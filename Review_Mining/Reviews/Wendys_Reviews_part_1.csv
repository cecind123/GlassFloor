rating,review
bad,Very unprofessional as a buisness and their condiments are outdated. I have witness a General mang. and crew member do disgusting things to ppl food that they dislike.
bad,"Not enjoyable, terrible team, wanted to quit the first day surprised I worked here this long. Made me hate people more than ever plus terrible service terrible terrible terrible"
bad,Don't pay much and there is no way to grow in this company and I think that they need to look at how they treat people and how only one person has to do everything in the store and I did like them to a point but now they suck
bad,Unsanitary and GM is a awful person makes people cry when they did nothing wrong all around most toxic work place I've ever worked would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"The job is stressful, as expected from a fast food place."
bad,"very bad management, I get 15-20 hours when they said they would give us at least 30. They don’t care about us employees, they use us for free labor sometimes. They take advantage of us."
bad,Never enough staff and always out of supplies. you either get no hours or you get worked to death. people are nice and fun to work with. management is not organized
bad,It was a very negative and hostile environment. I would not recommend this job to anyone who is trying to get into the workforce. It was very stressful and overwhelming each day.
bad,I worked with this company when my father was very sick and my managers knew this when my father passed away I was told I couldn't have the time off for his funeral needless to say that was end of my employment there
bad,"hated it. pay sucked, hours sucked, management sucked, employees sucked, training sucked, felt underappreciated, pushy, gave hours to friends, no training all done on computer"
bad,Management doesn't appreciate there employee's employee's do the managers job felt like the pay wasn't enough for my skills and work level all and all very poor establishment
bad,When I started here found out that your pay comes from anouther country and don't take taxes properly. The managers always treated me bad and gave me the worst jobs like cleaning a 6month old grease bucket. They claimed if you where to run into a bad situation at work you had to call a number that charged you $3 a min. Just to report things.
bad,They were never professional. Everyone was lazy and I had to do more than I was supposed to. I stayed later nights than I was supposed and the food wasn’t always fresh
bad,The manager wasn’t good at all the schedule was always getting changed the crew was bad my hours all ways got gut every week the store wasn’t clean like it should be
bad,Managers are horrible and don’t listen and don’t understand. One of my relatives had passed and the funeral was on a thursday in a completely different state and a 10 hour drive and said if your not back by friday (the day after) your fired. Also does not pay enough for the work you put in. Drive-thru is horrible the managers don’t schedule enough people at night so if your on drive thru you have to make your own food and drink and pay the customers out all within 3 minute so
bad,"clock in , find out your position , stay in that position all night , I learn a little. I at one time was a manager, so not much they can teach me , but if they do I listen. things are a little bit different from when I worked for wendys but the basic are still the same so its not hard to pick up the few differences they have now. I finish the day clean and restock my area , clock out and go home."
bad,They are horrible i have never worked so hard for a company and yet felt so unappreciated. Ive worked there almost a year and they dont give raises and treat the crew like total trash.
bad,Working here has had its ups and downs i don’t really want to say bad things about the company but as long as i can help it i would never go back they are not fair and do not want to pay employees or managers!
bad,The assistant manager tried to sell me drugs and I told the gm the district manager then the regional manager then HR and they did nothing so I quit and she's still employed.  It almost costed me my sobriety
bad,"no flexible hours, couldn’t even call in with a doctors note and doctors order not to work, would leave between 11 pm and midnight as a 17 year old in high school, none of the managers would actually work, they would just sit in the back office scrolling through facebook on their phones, managers always looked for something to complain about, absolutely not a good place to work"
bad,The gm has a attuide all the time towards the crew ast gm give out free food to his friends which is. Not right that store needs all knew staff the ast gm gets away free food to his friends which is not right whwn ebeeynody else has to pay for and nobody is doing anything aboit it
bad,"Working here would've been enjoyable if it wasn't for management absolutely treating you like a slave. If any minor mistake was made, general manager and district manager would be willing to yell at you (Loudly and in front of customers) to completely embarrass and humiliate you. Previous general manager had gotten pregnant from an employee, then was taking out all her rage on all the employees once the word was getting around. Meanwhile, the districts managers come in every so often and it was like walking on egg shells. Employees literally would all go outside during the night shift and smoke marijuana. It was crazy."
bad,"I hated working at Wendy's and now never want to eat there. Gross and dirty environment. Poor management. I cried myself to sleep every night while working at Wendy's. "
bad,Lack of proper management caused multiple issues within the workplace. I was forced to quit due to being constantly harassed and they did nothing about it
bad,"Wendy is a bad company, awful, the worst, the Gm are so rude and dis organized all they care bout is sales and not a thing about their workers at all."
bad,Wendys was horrible the never had the schedule right the mangers was disrespectful and never got enough hours they had to many workers at 1 time then they fired people for no reason
bad,"Good job for a teenager, but not for a grown adult with real bills. They didn't give me the flexibility in my schedule that they promised I would have."
bad,Doesn’t pay enough the hours are great but u can’t succeed at this job they keep you in one position and don’t want u to better yourself at all the management isn’t any better he wants you to always be stuck at that job with no raise or anything
bad,Seriously! Go anywhere else. Leadership consistently lies. There's no advancement and you have to fight for proper training. Healthcare plans are among the most expensive available. There is no flexibility in time. You are told this is your shift and they dont care about your needs. Pay is among the lowest in the industry. There are people that have been making $9/hr for over/ close to a decade that don't get raises because npc refuses to raise wages. Every store is critically staffed because of the tight restrictions that the company places on the workers. Its obvious that the company is not only pro-corporate but very anti-employee.
bad,"workers and customers were extremely rude, always late, gm never disciplined staff for poor attendance, causing employees to feel that they could come to work whenever they felt like it, making the good workers feel over worked and under appreciated."
bad,"I've been working for over a year and they sometimes just cut my shifts for no reason and as of writing this I haven't worked in over a month. The manager doesn't seem to understand the law and thinks she can just not give people hours and thinks she doesn't need to lay people off. "
bad,If i could say one thing I’d say: Management sucks. I’d say this has by far been one of the worst jobs I’ve ever worked at. I don’t think I have one positive thing to say.
bad,"Horrible company to work for "
bad,No longer able to keep up or handle stress load from franchise. I felt that wendy's cared more about not turning a profit rather that what we felt as employees.
bad,This was the absolute worst place I have ever worked in my entire life. I wish I had never gotten this job. The managers are horrible and don't care about their employees at all
bad,"Horrible place to work especially the 415 Goodman location. The manager is very rude and she does not like to help out the workers. I was promised a raise after completing an extensive learning program called wee learn and i never received the raise when I asked managers about it they would say they don't have time to sit down and check off my work or they would say I didn't get a raise so you wont be getting one. I was always told to work harder and i mainly had to take the orders, prepare the food, drop fries and nuggets, and bag the food all on my own. I could not speak with the district manager about my problems when I asked the general manager for her number I was told she doesn't want crew members calling her so I cant talk to her. I had zero idea which manager was actually in charge and the managers constantly fight with each other creating a horrible and stressful environment."
bad,"Managers don’t give a hootabout you they only care about money, whether you’re sick or not you have to go in, they only give you one half hour break for a 10 hour shift"
bad,Too much Drama not enough Teamwork The manager Curses almost every other word is in Gods name in vain I am a Christian Lady this just is no place of Atmosphere for a Christian to work and There is always a problem fussing Cussing Doesn't believe in giving Breaks to employees to eat or anything ! Im a Diabetic i need Food breaks plus way too much work for the small amount of pay ! Very disappointed in this job ! Overall
bad,The job was good but the corporate was not great support. When you ask for more knowledge on the position you hold they tell you to call another store to help you. The company does not treat the employees fairly
bad,I'm almost certain the manager changes my hours and rips my paycheck off. Managers make racist remarks. They disregard my availability and schedule me outside of my available days/hours.
bad,"No I did not have an interview with Wendy’s because they ask significant amounts of illegal questions. You may not ask the name of an employees High School, the city of the Highschool, their age, their College and location of (previous or current), and the list goes on. Management should consider consulting an HR representative to help them review their applications to ensure it is LEGAL. Also, that they are hiring with equal opportunity for everyone as per Wendy’s policy."
bad,"Managers are so rude,they will make you want to quit and find something better. The managers give people they know food that comes in the dinning area without paying for food. Night manager will leave out for hours smoking weed, while the drive thru is busy and have the time all messed up. The cooks eat food while making your food as well ."
bad,You will be overworked and taken adventage of by incompetent management. All of the restaurants that I have been to were filthy and should have been shut down due to unsafe food practices. They will pay you as little as possible and will never give you opportunities to get a raise unless its to further exploit you. Getting a job here is like selling your soul to the lowest buyer.
bad,"I hated working there. The smell annoyed me, the noise annoyed me, the heat annoyed me, etc. It was very hot in the kitchen and the fast pace was very difficult to keep up with due to the extreme heat."
bad,"Wendy’s was my first job, definitely do not recommend, managers are short tempered and very rude to new employees.. little to no training period and expect you to know what to do, talk about and make fun of people. Not my kinda job"
bad,At Wendy's when i worked there all they did was change hours without anyones knowing and they were not fair with their employees. I would never go back to that job
bad,Stay on top of your work and move at a fast pace stay with a smile on your face when greeting and taking customers orders make sure all food are fresh and hot
bad,Horrible place to work I will never in my life ever work at a fast food place ever again. Its an embarrassment to everyone and yourself . All these wendys places are just filled with disgusting nasty people and the managers are ruthless grimey mean ignorant people Im done with you people . Done .
bad,"if Your looking for an easy paycheck this job will do, other than that don’t make this job a career. The managers at the Wendy’s store I worked at didn’t respect any employees nor customers, foul language coming from both employees and managers, fights, arguments, employees disrespecting customers smfh. One of the managers acts her shoe size never her age she deserves to have her position REVOKED As I said don’t look forward to gaining a sense of belonging at this job bc you won’t get it. A waste of time and effort"
bad,"If I could give negative stars, I would. This job was beyond ridiculous. They would only hire teenagers, and yes the pay increased when Pilot took over, but the job within itself is still a joke. Me, along with 5 other employees were fired for ""stealing company time"" because they had us on camera, going to go use the bathroom. It's ridiculous and management is horrid."
bad,Plain and simple if there under the charltom restaurant group run there a joke. They do nothing to fix situation turn a blind man eye to any issues. If you complain they just cut your hours. Honestly worst job ever.
bad,"I have had experience working in fast food, but working at wendy's was the straw that broke the camels back. Lazy co workers, a gazillion health codes violated, not to mention an unsafe and misogynistic working environment. I never knew what I was going to get when I would clock in."
bad,"It was the worse job I ever had and I have been in fast food for 20+ yrs. Management was awful, very unclean, rude co workers, but when the upper management came management got up and worked"
bad,A new owner treats us like trash. The owner and his kid are terrible.  They dont care about anyone or anything other than working people into the ground. The kid running the place talks bad mouth filthy mouth. The district managers are extremely rude. None of them care about anything. Disgusting place to work. Used to be really good before new owner.
bad,"Management needs to work on scheduling, and hire actual trainers instead of having crew try to train newbies while also trying to get their own work done. Nothing is learned this way because crew doesn't have time to teach properly."
bad,This is the place to work if you wanna just hang out and smoke weed all day. People do whatever they wont barely show up to work and when they dp complain that they dont have enough hours then call off again the next day.
bad,"Boss was racist and very disrespectful on very many different levels, got ubset cause im color blind yet was put on the grill 24/7 and couldent see if meat was cooked, also worked without a food handlers card"
bad,This is the worst company I've worked with. The manager expects you to know what you are doing when you have not worked yh err y very long. When you ask a question you get a smart remark. Not helpful when they train. Only stuck in one position. Have no interest as you as a person worst company I have ever work for.
bad,Majority of managers are disrespectful. You won't get off when you're supposed to. Even if you're sick you're forced to come in. It's an incredibly negative and frustrating environment.
bad,Where should I start ? For starters the district manager or whomever in charge needs to get a hold of their store. You should not even be friends with your employers. There's a lot of work needed to be done at this location. My nerves are too bad for this place
bad,This is by far the worst job i ever had. EVER. The management gets high in the bathrooms. Allows employees to drink on the job. Its a popularity contest with rules and punishments/promotions. Only certain people are held to a standard while others do what they want.
bad,Good company but the people who run is who  is bad. In the 80 fast food was fast  inside service was under 60 sec drive Thursday was about 60 sec now it's 3-10 min inside and out. Wendys will be out off business in less than 5 years. If they don't fix service times. Add more labor people only have 30min for lunch 5min getting there 5 min in both line 10 minutes to eat 5 minutes to get to work
bad,never go back the management doesn’t care about employees the benefits aren’t any good they under pay claim they pay bonuses to other managers they do not
bad,They just used you the trash you out all the DM care about is money.they dont care about your feeling or what customer did i will never go work for them anymore
bad,Manager quit and the other manager was at work drunk. They never had anything available that they needed for store like toilet paper for customers. It took them a month to pay me for the month before and no kept track of my hours or put me in the system so I could get paid. Employees would argue in front of customers and it was very unprofessional there. I wouldn’t recommend no one to work there.
bad,Too many favorites not everyone is treated the same. Crew never get breaks unless ur 60 so not a place I recommend to work. They put to much on people and overwork them.
bad,Extremely poor store management and crew management!! Night shift is horrible. The store manager waters down cheeses and sauces and chili to save money which takes away the quality and taste that customers are PAYING a lot of money for.
bad,Poor revi Didn’t enjoy the job at all too many complaints the general manager did not do his job correctly it was just too much work you’re not having to give orders I rather have another job for fast food
bad,"The management for this company is family, The GM allows his daughters to treat their employees like dirt.  If you speak up for yourself, then your hours are cut until you apologize for defying them.  Truly hated coming to work here every day.  Truly a horrible experience."
bad,what to say about montrose wendys? do you like money and to be treated like you matter? do you enjoy feeling like you are an important part of a team and that you are valued? then Wendys in montrose is not the place for you!!  but it is in fact a great place to work if you feel like being treated like garbage by the management staff and any and all corporate people. its a great place if you want to feel like you are garbage and if you love to watch the manager close early and treat customers like trash.
bad,"The location I worked for was in chaos from day one. Unorganized staff and management, late pay checks, unhealthy work environment, and my least favorite part of it all was the verbally/physically abusive mangers."
bad,"Es un empleo en el cual podés adquirir mucha experiencia en atención al público. Te enseña sobre rapidez, precisión, responsabilidad, orden y trabajo en equipo. Es una empresa en la cual hacen muchísimo énfasis en la atención del cliente y su responsabilidad sobre ellos y su producto."
bad,I didn’t like working for this company but I made it Manage for a while. I don’t like that your not able to pick your own off days and I don’t like how you have to work so hard for little pay.
bad,"Have worked at many wendys for 10+ years as a crew and manager and it's all the same.  Work as hard as u can for as little pay as they are allowed to give u. salaries are not competitive. Management is chaotic and self serving. No teamwork nor respect for authority. if you are new to the work force, then that's fine, but having Wendy's and a lifelong career is a big mistake."
bad,"Like most places , they will promise you the world as long as they get what they want out of you. In return don't expect fare compensation, appreciation, or to be treated with common decency or respect."
bad,"All"
bad,The manager at that time always stayed on one knee looking at the computer he made the schedule and he would not lift one finger to help it was the worst place to work. and the front working space was Tiny.
bad,I highly suggest watching who you work with for they will falsely accuse you of stealing when you're doing something else. Always make sure that your drawer is good before you leave for home.
bad,"If you in school and you need extra cash that’s the only time I’d even think about working there. Unprofessional, rude not only to employees but to customers, and the pay is what does it for me."
bad,They need to learn how to train people better there employees and all so cross train so they can put them anywhere if someone calls off and up there pay
bad,They treat you unfairly unless you kiss kester every chance you get.... They paid you unfairly.... And such disrespect from the DMs and CEO of the company....
bad,They don’t allow promotions lots of stealing and management turnover. No good benefits and they are very rude. Takes a long time for a raise opportunity very unfair.
bad,"Worst employer, worst company. I couldn't believe how absolutely toxic this place was. I saw so many health code violations everyday on top of working with a volatile manager."
bad,Stole my hours and wages I was promised a starting wage of a set amount not only didnt get that but get cheated out of 22 hours of regular pay plus all my overtime I worked.
bad,"Horrible abusive management and everyone has an attitude constantly, if you can help it never work in fast food, customers are rude and so are coworkers"
bad,The pay was not good enough for da manager and the owners dont treat the mananger well enough they can treat us like trash. The owners only car bout them self
bad,the people at the job were great but just the job itself was very stressful. you have to basically learn how to do everything on your own there because no one really shows you what to do
bad,I was for the most part somewhat satisfied i was a decent place to work despite not really have a strong managing core. They were pretty lenient as far as scheduling
bad,Working for Wendys sucked. I went out for surgery so I quit thinking I had another job after recovery. Now mind you I quit on good terms. They won't rehire me.
bad,I have nothing to say about this job this was the worse  job that i ever worked at i will not recommend anyone to this job not at all this worse place to work at never again
bad,never work there they need better ppl working there they are races  not the best place to take kids the hole night team uses foul language the hole order was wrong and a mess the frosty was liquid
bad,Place is a joke. The Frankfort location literally has sewage coming up out of the drains in the floor when you drain a sink. Theres always like 4-5 people who are hella overworked doing everything while the rest of the staff doesn't even show up most of the time and keep their jobs. Managers don't get paid past 30 minutes after close even though it's almost physically impossible to get done in less than an hour past close. Don't work there.
bad,First off they dont know how to treat their employees or manager..they dont know how to hire people who want to work... I spent all of my shifts shorthanded..so if you are asking for opinions you wont get anything good from me
bad,"Just the lowest human being of a manager you can imagine never scheduled me on the right days even though I asked way before scheduling time says yes and never does it gives me opposite of what ask for, and the reason I got fired because I can’t show up on the days I ask her not to schedule me but still schedules me because I am unable to show up due to school or other uncontrollable factor. Just a low human being"
bad,Temporary $. Didn't like the way I was spoken to or trained. Only one break for 9 hr. shift. Only apply if you REALLY have to. Management talks down to employees.
bad,"There's no communication between crew members. People just stand there and argue with each other and don't work, which is why it takes so long for customers to be served."
bad,"The managers there are raciest the managers there treat people like they are nothing there "
bad,Not very pleased with working here. The management staff felt like they didn't care for there employer. the job itself isn't hard just felt like the management did not care at all.
bad,This is not good place to go for a job. Management isn’t stable. Work hours are not constant. Low staff. Also no training at all they throw you in with out any help.
bad,This job is for kids just starting their work experience . People who has children and a family to take care of can't live off of the salary. It's poor management and the company doesn't care about the employees.  However for teens and first timers it's great to get their feet wet
bad,Had a lot of bad mangers did what they wanted never did their jobs always went in early to help the managers out. I was not getting my overtime pay I was supposed to
bad,"Not worth it ,  "
bad,"They expect you to work overtime off the clock. If you go over 40 hours even short staffed you can receive a write up. If you're a manager expect to get pushed to every limit, with minimal raises, a pay barely above minimum wage, they'll also criticize every thing you do even if you do something useful. Upper management will curse at you and send emails degrading you if your store isn't up to theyre standards instead of helping you. Terrible place to work."
bad,"Don't Bother"
bad,"When I worked at Wendy's it was actually really stressful and i was working there for about 4 years, and what i learned was to make burgers, salads, fries, wraps, chilli, and also learned the cash. the management is not the greatest working at Wendy's because they would boss your around and I was a really good hard-worker and then he randomly took me off the schedule without giving me notice or giving me my last pay. the hardest part of the job was when it was dinner rush and everyone would come get food and it would be so busy and everyone would be getting frustrated. I Enjoyed being on driving threw taking customers orders."
bad,For this to be my first job I really didn’t like it . I had customers being rude to me for no reason at all . But the job was cool just that when you have a manager that shouldn’t be a manager that being loud that the customers can hear your whole conversation you don’t suppose to be having but other than that the job was pretty fast and cooperate all’s giving you a hard and will send you home for no reason . Cause they feel like it
bad,"Maybe not wendys as a whole, but Starboard was terrible.  Maximum pressure to attain results with no support, no coaching, and little care from upper management."
bad,This company breaks labor laws everyday and punishes whistle blowers. I would not recommend working for this company.  They play favoritism with their management.
bad,Ive worked at wendys for the past couple months now and I want no part in the company at all. I like the overall store and what it stands for but my store is bad.
bad,These managers and gm and others are slave masters . They work you and want $50.00 per hour worth of work for 8dollar an hour.  Very rude and disrespectful to all employees.  Wendys high turnover rate .  No one stays
bad,"stressfull work enviorment, understaffed over worked and under paid. will not work for this company again unless changes are made in pay and scheduling"
bad,I been with this job for almost 3 years dedicating working my off days I believe in my heart that they are racist on raccoon road I have experienced alot being there in that place I would not wish this on my worst enemies...
bad,"They suck and they should not have the manager that is working there, there. She is rude and goes against all Wendy's policies. Hiring people without papers and using hours against employees"
bad,"My experience at Wendy's was horrible. I would never get a new uniform when things ripped. There was always call offs and no consequences. The customers did not care about the way they talked to us. Also, the management made the crew do their own servery to hype up the store. I will never be working for Cotti Foods ever again."
bad,"I was an assistant manager at Wendys in New Holland , Pa. The hours are very flexible , but management is extremely unhelpful when explaining your expectations and daily job duties. Every manager tells you something different , so there is no consistency with job requirements. They say one thing but do another, its more of a do what i say not what i do type of situation. Otherwise the job is fairly easy."
bad,"They allow their Male managers harrasse the female employees,  then when the females try doing something about it they will fire you or make it to were it's the females fault I wouldnt recommend anyone to go to this company and try and work"
bad,I did not enjoy my time at this facility. I barely got hours and staff was not friendly. I enjoy the experience it gave me but I wouldn't recommend working here.
bad,"Horrible hours , horrible management , bad coworkers , the company was trash. Low pay for hard work , negative environment, poor team work. Wouldn’t recommend."
bad,"If you would like to work somewhere that completely ignores the whole purpose of the business, have no concern for their employees, no room for advancement, low pay for crew and management then Wendy’s is for you. But if you value yourself, your time & your money then please look elsewhere because Wendy’s is beyond sorry especially their AM,DM & GM’s. (Management is SORRY)"
bad,"Not a very good place to work they dont care about you or your family "
bad,"Wendy’s is always busy, it’s challenging to manage school and work but it does prepare you for what the real world is like. Wendy’s gives you hands on experience with customers to improve your customer service skills."
bad,If you wanna do more training go somewhere else i was poorly trained was stuck in drive thru everyday and washed dishes every day was not a good thing for me
bad,They use to be family oriented but now its numbers numbers numbers they dont care about there employees and in all reality they dont care about there guest either they just care about money
bad,"They judge you on the color of your skin and not your job performance."
bad,The managers were not very helpful not helpful just put us making sandwiches without proper training to many wokers trying to be bosses and go sick from the food
bad,It’s terrible I hated it and you will too it was astonishing how they didn’t take into consideration that you have a life and being in high school it didn’t make it any better. WORKERS BEWARE!
bad,"Worst management I’ve ever had the displeasure to work under. Constantly promised raises that are never given, general manager talks bad about every employee behind their back, always short staffed and expected to work 2-3 different positions at one time. I could go on and on."
bad,"Pésimo ambiente de trabajo, los 30 minutos de almuerzo se reducían a 15 y era el único tiempo que podías sentarte dentro de toda la jornada. Supervisores y encargados eran casi como dioses, mandando y presionando a destajo. Nunca cumplían con los supuestos beneficios."
bad,"Nothing good to say  about this company  wont ever work"
bad,I have been in fast food customer service since I turn 16 and could work in my 13 years I have never come to hate customers until working here the job itself sucks they expect so much work out of you but aren’t willing to pay you to do the work
bad,"Not sure if it was just my luck, but went through three store managers in the span of 3 months, and each one was more incompetent than the last. Daytime manager never had them clean the dishes, and the closing crew of two people had to do an entire days worth after close, keeping us an additional 2 hours. Management would turn a blind eye to problems in the kitchen or very obvious policy violations. Even had them not say a word when we were verbally harassed or had food thrown at us."
bad,"I work take customer orders. Prepare food , fry the food , make the sandwiches. Did cash and credit card transactions. Balanced till before and after my set time."
bad,Horrible at the location I had worked at but won't let that ruin my idea of teamwork and fast paced movement in the work area. Employees and other staff was ridiculously rude and just couldn't continue in this particular place.
bad,"Needs lots of improvements from owner, employee's offerd nothing except what GM do on their own and out if their own pockets. Uncaring if sick or hurt by the district manager, if unable to stay over it is frowned upon and your hours are cut."
bad,"Lets start with cleanliness  kitchen floors never proporly cleaned. Mold under the grill, oil iunder the fryers  food on the floor in the walk inn fridge, food prep workers dropping food on the floor and still serving it, crew members now washing their nads before returning to work after using the restroom or taking out trash."
bad,"Worst choice of bee this franchise make Wendys look horrible , I would not feed a dog out that store. give GM store with two day employees and store molded from top to bottom"
bad,Not enough worker we’re put on a Friday or Saturday to help customers. Closing with 3 other staff members was not enough. They also didn’t look to supply you with more workers for your shift.
bad,Poor managers. Too much stealing of food and money. Procedures wasn't been followed (mostly on night shift). When the GM or DM isn't there managers did whatever they wanted. Mangers and cashiers are rude to customers and slow on get product out or would be out of products.
bad,Bad managment bad people expect more from new employee with no training used dave thomas foundation for personal use long hrs no overtime over 40 hrs bad schedule
bad,Look around for better opportunities. This Wendy’s was recently sold and new owner and president are not a caring or compassionate - do not care about employees.
bad,This is the worse job i ever had. I was there for going on 9 years and all i was getting paid was $8.80 and their were new people that got hired and they were getting paid more than me
bad,"The job sucked. I worked there for 6 months and couldn't do it anymore. The employees are lazy and if you're willing to do your job they expect you to do their job to, without extra pay. I switched from day shift to closing shift with the understanding that my pay rate would increase, never happened.  Please don't work for this company."
bad,"They were confusing with the video training, causing me to go out of order and rewatching videos. Then when it was time for me to actually work, the dinner rush came through and our managers started gossiping while they started making orders I was already making, then making me feel stupid for just reading off the screen or asking if they had already made the orders. But here was the kicker. One manager said that she didn’t want to train me because she doesn’t like training people. Then they kept me 2 hours past my shift for every real shift I worked and I was a closer. For a shift that ended at 11 I worked until 1 in the morning.They were the worst people to work for especially as a college student with school in the morning . This job was a waste of time."
bad,I honestly didn't think that working here at this Wendys was going to be bad until I found out about the hourly pay and raises. Nothing but high school kids always on their phones giving out cold food. The job is easy itself but the management and everything that goes with it needs some serious help.
bad,Very stressful fast pace environment customers complain alot about their orders only one sandwich maker for drivethru and dine in it's a good temporary job no chance for moveing up
bad,Mangers sucked except for 2 of them but were hardly there so I had to deal with stupid people. Half the employees at night would go into the bathrooms and smoke their meth and nothing would be done about it.
bad,"Terrible, if they don't like how u manage, they accuse you of pushing someone (with no proof) so they are able to demote you. For what you have to deal with, they don't pay worth shiznit."
bad,"Maintained a fast speed of service, especially during rush times. Took orders from customers. Responded to guest questions, concerns and complaints and make sure they left satisfied. Cleaned thoroughly before, during and after each shift. Followed all restaurant safety and security procedures. Arrive on time for all shifts and stay until shift completion."
bad,I would not go back to work for them not enough money or hours and dont gove enough raises and no kid of health insurance it was not fun woking there i did not like the mangement team
bad,"poor management, understaffed, managers causing a lot of stress and drama. Managers sending people home early and going back in the system changing people's times."
bad,enjoyed my time working at Wendy’s. They change your schedule often ..not a good pay for what they expect you to do on a daily basis. It’s a good starting job but you can’t be there forever
bad,This company never respected my work hours or my health in general. No morals shared for their employees. Part time is non existent. Over time wasn't a choice.
bad,The whole place was a drag. Unless I can personally sit down and talk to any person or persons over Wendys headquarters there is no need to say anything because I will not get a resolution expressing my experience just for future employees to read.
bad,The managers sucks at Their job. Some of the employees are inconsistent with coworkers time. Managers and employees don’t show up for there shifts. So the ones that so show up have to stay late
bad,They don’t let you take breaks. I was a manager I was low staffed (me and one other person) and the district manager threatened to fire me because I asked for help.
bad,"Terrible place to work. Company doesn't take care about employees, advancement is rare or non existent. Be prepared to do the work of 3 people for the pay of one. Benefits are terrible you don’t get a break then your meal discount is 3 bucks talk about cheap from a company that probably makes millions and millions. Management will not work with your schedule even though the job lists flexible as a benefit to working here"
bad,It was very busy and didn’t like it cause u don’t get a break and they make u work to hard in there I think the workers should do a better job they are all over the place
bad,"Was excited to work there, but quickly realized how sucky it is. NPC doesn't care about its employees, and sucks the life out of all their employees. Not only that, but they base bonuses off of survey scores, which is completely dumb comsidering the only time people do a survey is when they are not happy"
bad,Did all the work the assistant manager did but paid the shift lead pay. Crew was very disrespectful and the district manager didn't. Are much. The assistant manager told lies and spread rumors about myself and the general manager
bad,"I’m honestly trying to find a new job mainly because the management there is so poor. If the managers were better at creating schedules or listening to their employees and being fair between all crew members, I wouldn’t have a problem working there. Because the management is so poor it forces me to want to leave but I can’t unless I have another job set up for me so I can pay bills."
bad,I worked for wendys off and on for three years the pay is horrifically horrible compared to the amount of work we do dont get paid well at all certain people should be able to retire after a certain age like the wendys on denny ave in goula needs to be shut down i know i can make that place a better environment
bad,Schedule wasn't made until Sunday of each week. Lying management. Goofy staff. Disrespectful to customers. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
bad,"The staff there are very slow and not so bright. the bosses are ignorant and have no consideration for anything, they will yell and embarrass you infront of everybody over something simple such as when starting new asking a question, they expect you to just know what to do... the gossip behind everybody’s back is also really immature coming from women at the age that should know better and act better then that"
bad,I hate that job. I don’t have time for my son until I’m off. They don’t know how to run a business. I would refer anyone to they. The people are disrespectful. No one wants to help. Everytime you go to work we’re always short and you’re busy nonstop. They don’t give breaks. It’s just not good in anyway.
bad,Wendy’s suck I wouldn’t work there at all good place to eat bad place to work  Poor management  upper management was racist they don’t believe in giving people Second chances
bad,They treat their employees and management like slaves. No direction from upper management.  Wasnt given yo many resources to correctly do the job. Just bad
bad,I did not start enjoying my job until it was close to my time at Wendy's to expire. Management was the utmost unprofessional I have ever witnessed.  Some manages talked to you as though they were above you and it was just a hot mess.
bad,"I do not see how upper management can get away with the things they do and no one will do anything about it.  I quote ""If you don't stop outting me you will end up brain dead"".  What kind of management allows managers to speak that way to staff? Another quote, ""I'll make sure you never work in Louisville again"".  Once again management's words of encouragement. Any children who work there I will keep you in my prayers because you're going to need it."
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work for this company. They are shady and they do not pay what shift supervisors deserve. They do more work then they get paid for.
bad,"Absolutely not worth the trouble, effort, and time. Management sucks and I don't mean that lightly. I worked there while pregnant, was forced to lift heavy things when I was directed by my doctor not to life more than 10lbs. Management caused me to have 3 threatened miscarriages due to that treatment."
bad,Place was run down building needed serious maintenance and management refused to pushed the issue. Water leaks molding rats etc. employees worked in harsh condition up to 98 degrees.
bad,i would not tell anyone to work there the gm dont do anything sit in the office alday she go to the bank but be gone for about a hour allher manager no so go home not to bank people ouit alot the gm dont know how to talk to people u get no advanment in company
bad,"Terrible place wish never walked in "
bad,"I hated my time working at Wendy's. The management was horrible, and the people that I worked with were not very helpful. I was not trained and had to learn most of the skills on my own. They also threw me into back-cash without even training me to begin with, and it was a very stressful situation. I have nothing but bad things to say about this company and working there."
bad,"Management don't care if you sick. There is no team effort. Management just sits in office while you bust your butt. Constantly threatening job even with doctors note, never give breaks, expects crew to do a job of 3 people and complains when times aren't within range, never released on time. Other employees can be late or never show up yet still have job."
bad,Entire company seems very confused. Incapable of maintaining consistency from one franchise to the next. Upper management is incredibly corrupt. Absolutely no regard for employees or quality of life. Dishonesty is practiced and little room for advancement without personal relations with owner/operator.
bad,They treat there employees like cramp they only care about making money never get ur breaks out on time sometimes u dont even get ur last 10 maria is a manager and she is very rude to the employees.
bad,As a manager there they work you between 45-60 hours a week and expect you to be able to work swing shifts which is really hard when you have a family. Also the other managers and staff are horrible
bad,"They skim money from your checks. The GM can't even spell, lies all the time, and they expect you to break your back for 8.50 an hour tops. Horrible place to work."
bad,"I was excited to work there because I never worked at a fast food place before . After working a couple days i started to not want to be there because the gm is bipolar and very disrespectful towards others and me , there are rare days when shes ok and mostly terrible , I still work there but I wish to quit so badly"
bad,They don't train very well and have a high turn over of employees and managers.i would not work here ever again. The other ma agers always steal and blame others.
bad,I worked  there for a while they never gave me any career advancement option. My bosses most of them not all were bullies...I never got to get breaks even when I asked. There is favoritism unless your kissing bootie even still they lie
bad,Management is terrible and It’s too stressful honestly and they don’t pay us enough for the situations that we the employees deal with. Wouldn’t work.
bad,Worked my a** off there for 3yrs Literally everybody I worked with said I should be a manager even one of the managers picked me as a manager! Then when old manager came back she pulled me out of the position simply because of jealousy not work performance not attitude. She seen me as a threat to possibly take her position!
bad,I don't reccommend noone work for Wendys. Wendy's is not a gud company to work for.... They do not have good benefits.... The Gm's dont care about noone but themselves.... Don't work for Wendys
bad,"Do yourself a favour, beg on the streets before you think of working for this place. There is regards to any hard work and the lazy gets rewarded. Sad."
bad,"No management control.  Each employee was treated differently.  There was no structure or control,over the employees.  Every employee was treated by the way the so called manager liked them."
bad,"It was honestly the worst job ever considering I had been one of the best employees. I always was responsible with my call off and would only call of if I had a doctor's note they always had issues with that . They were very dismissive towards the safety of their staff. They also were very selective of whoencouraged.  It they had a lady there for 30 years and she could count the ""thank yous"" she had received working there."
bad,"Horrible pay, no reviews or raises, hours are limited so they don't have to offer benefits. There are never enough employees working with you, so you work double stations for no extra benefits."
bad,"When I first started it was learning, but as time goes on and management change the place went down hill. The higher up management that does not include your general manager(your boss) are rude and disrespectful. They will come to the store and act like you don’t know anything. When you’ve been there long enough to know the rules. They treat you like you are stupid. When you Don’t have any sick hours cause for some weird reason they only give you 24 hrs, and you are sick and weak and can’t get up, you can’t call in cause you will get a write up unless you bring in a doctors note for that day.  And they expect you to be at work the next day feeling like the day before. When you also request days off, don’t expect you’ll get them even though you requested it months ahead. Only work here if you are building up customer skills, and while you are leaning also look for a new job."
bad,"Its a job no one needs because there rude disrespectful and nasty , they cheat people out of work hours and demands way to much work for what there are paying and also dont train the people at all they stick u on a spot and tell to learn it with no instructions to how to do the job"
bad,"It friendly to deaf ppl crew management are butch and ingore deaf and pity on deaf for fow "
bad,Wendys is a very bad place to work . they have u working these long hours . they barley pay good I would never work for a fast food company again in my life...
bad,"Everyday i went in to work there was drama this and drama that not a good place to work for. to much racism, hate, favoritism. never again working for there."
bad,The store manager treated us unfairly and felt the need to fire several without any given reason. Wouldn’t work there again to save my life. Horrible.
bad,Dont like working there due to lack of hours and poor management . Mangers are lazy and some co workers are lazy . Night time work consent of all young kids still in school. So they dont want to work but they want a paycheck
bad,"To Slow "
bad,It was ok manager need more trained and more crew members. They dont listening to the crew members. It was ok at first but now no. Hope they get it together Gm need to listen to the crew when they say someone wrong. But it was ok work they .i will go back but not to that one
bad,"Wendy's put more money on the job ad then paid me half in what they said I would make. The managers at Wendy's in Gainesvill, Florida show tremendous amounts of favoritism. It is a serious lack of professionalism."
bad,Was harassed and stocked by another employee management team and owners didnt care had to quit my job for safety reasons.had to call police to protect my children from this employee.
bad,"I worked at Wendy's about 5 years ago, so I cannot definitively tell you what the company is like today. When I worked there the management was horrible, and you had absolutely no benefits. You were made to deal with attitudes and over exerting yourself for $7.50-$8.00 an hour."
bad,This company sucks. Hard work goes unnoticed. They work you like slaves with no break. Mangers are very rude and lazy at times. The night crew never show on time.
bad,The management has changed since the last time I have been there however from what I hear the new management acts the same. People will sit in the back and do drugs and vape while one or two people run the store on their own. So good luck.
bad,Management was poor and lack of obsevation.  Went to work early and stood around most of the shift.  I was always on time and exceeded my work expectations.
bad,"Everyone at Wendy's did what they wanted, and no one cared about the customers, Wendy's was a very fast paced environment with slow workers that were lazy and didn't even wanna be there. The schedules were all messed up and even tho I was o my a part time worker I was basically working full time because no one knows how to show up for there shifts."
bad,mngrs do not follow policies meat left opened on counter emplyees eat from serving bins dip fries at hamburger station double dipping no training rude
bad,The restaurant I worked at didn't have vacation days for management or reasonable health care. They didn't pay their employees fair wages and it negatively effected the store. I'm sure other stores aren't run that way but in this case it was all around bad.
bad,"Terrible staff and terrible leaders. It's a company run by teenagers, and it shows with the lack of training. They tell and scream at the employees. Running behind on everything. Late night turns away customers by giving them rediculus waiting times."
bad,I was 18-19 at the time. Management had their favorites. It wasn't a healthy productive learning environment. I wouldn't work there again. It wasn't all bad. I just don't remember the good.
bad,From the day you work their I suggest you start looking for a different job this is just a temporary job they are always hiring . They willing have you in there about to fight x Crack heads and all soon as you are employed  boom your back in high schooL HAVE FUN
bad,The management in place is terrible. There's constant drama inside and outside of the work place. I had to speak to someone in corporate in order to get a raise or promotion. There is only CONSTANT NEGATIVITY and its a TERRIBLE work environment. There are NO benefits until you reach management and even then the benefits are very minimal. The only flexibility in work hours is forcing you to work overtime without added breaks or decent pay. Or messing up your schedule constantly even when you present specific hours you can and cannot work. There is no paid time off unless you've been there for years in management. Any other time off is unpaid and you are constantly felt like you are replaceable and like your job is on the line for the smallest hiccup. I HATED working there from day 1 but I got better money than other places offering so I stuck with it.
bad,All fast food is the same all the managers care for themselves. They only want their bonus they want you to work so hard for them. They say it helps the business but they mean themselves.
bad,"Management was terrible "
bad,The pay sucks horrible job to work for no good benefits nothing more to say can barely make a living workin here so its time to find a new job the jon overall sucks and its killin my health
bad,"high stress always under staff, management always put work load onto some else even if it was their job. fellow co workers very rude disrespectful. Most enjoyable part job was seeing smile on customer face and enjoying few mins of small talk."
bad,Worst job I’ve ever worked at in my life. Too much family working in one place and too much favoritism. I was so stressed out by the other employees I had to literally walk off the job before I had an anxiety attack. I was hit on by gross old truckers and reported it to management and they made me deal with the customer anyway.
bad,They suck can't even get a raise will not hand out promotion even if you earned it they show favorite towards workers and the managers sucks including the gm
bad,I liked Wendy’s but not the management it sticks they don’t appreciate the good work they have but other than that it’s a good place to work pay is good as well.
bad,"Working at Wendy’s as a cook provides a lot of time management fast paced and hard work . Fresh food to be dropped , good communication to co workers."
bad,I did not enjoy working here. The management team did not communicate any new ideas or new and upcoming menu items to new and current employees. I do no recommend this job to anyone.
bad,super busy always which is fine but there low salary and pay for how many hours i worked there was bad.i worked there for almost 7 months and still no raise when the minimum wadge went up i didn't even get paid it i was still getting paid under for a little while until i quit. would not recommend for anyone to work at the Wendy i worked out with the same manege.
bad,The GM at the store in Flagstaff on 89 doesn't provide proper training or care to. They continuously fail audits cause management is poor. I would not reccomend this store to anyone.
bad,"Unless they get rid of the manager currently at this restaurant, I wouldn’t suggest working here to my worst enemy! They kept screwing with my hours giving me a bunch one week and hardly none the following week. We were constantly losing people cause they couldn’t put up with manager and her tantrums."
bad,Just over all no team work. When you pulled it to the managers attention he didn’t care. Always drama ever a day of making customers happy someone always argued sometimes more then 2 people.
bad,"Wendy's was easily the worst experience of my career. Management gets too much slack, crew doesn't get enough. My store manager was often drunk, other shift leads were flaky, and on top of all that one of the managers was a pervert- I found out later that he had complaints made about him at another store and instead of firing him they just moved him to my store, and gave him the opportunity to harass more underage women!"
bad,Very bad and  unprofessional  no benefits for salary work like animal find other job but don't work with this company poor management long wait for customers lack of employees
bad,The Wendy's company is the worst I have ever worked for. They don't care how they mistreat their good employees. They management are very disrespectful to the employees and we were always shorthanded because people would rather quit tjan be disrespected
bad,Wendys on aberdeen rd in hampton va is the worst wendys u can possibly work the managers are unorganized and always changing the schedule inconveniently and also we would work 8 -10 hours on feet no breaks everyday they made it seem like getting a prevledge and not a right.I also didnt feel so good about the mangers and sum employees touching food without gloves and serve them like nothing happened it was just a disgusting experience
bad,They treat people like garbage. With no respect. They walk all over you & treat you like you worth less than a peace of garbage.  They have no respect for their employees.
bad,Working at Wendys was always busy only time it would be slow if we ran out of something which was hardly ever but that’s what I look for In A job something fast paced and stable
bad,"The work environment in this place was not very good, all the workers and customers are rude, even the managers. I could not stand to stay there any longer."
bad,"I worked here for 7 years with promise to get paid over minimum wage, with nothing. I stayed at minimum wage for the whole 7 years. When state each year would raise minimum wage the management would tell staff that was our raise! NO that’s the law , not Wendy’s management paying and appreciating a GOOD team player."
bad,When I was an employee at Wendy's the general manager was rude and and conceded of she had favorites I never really cared about her employees unless her boss was there. The store was never clean and we were sometimes asked or told to work off the clock.
bad,Working fast food sucks. Manager is a huge jerk. Assistant managers have power issues. Nobody is respected here. The customers are bad but the least concerning part honestly.
bad,They yelled at me all the time and one of the other crew members wanted to fight and if your over 6'3 don't work there I'm 6'8 and was almost able to touch the roof with my head and also kept hitting my head on all the overhangs it's made for short people
bad,Staff is unwelcomeing they don't pay you the right amount of  your paycheck they talk down to you They slave you and don't Care about there employees they don't do things by code
bad,I would only recommend this job for somebody's first job as in somebody in high school due to they have no benefits and as you get older you need thos
bad,would recommenced any one to work for this company. They paid less and they give you no hour the most you might have is like 16 hours a week . which is nothing to work with.
bad,I always thought that managers should work together to benefit a company. I was there for 7 months. The hole time the mangers butted heads and went against each other. It was just pathetic.
bad,The worse experience I ever had working with a company. The managers didn't do they jobs they let the crew members run the restaurant. If you talk to a manager about anything the whole store would know.
bad,Not much to really say about this job its a job that will help you get by if your a middle or high school student cash handing fast and friendly service
bad,This place was not friendly and was ride to customers and did not work together as a team and I worked at a few different Wendy's and they are so the same
bad,Very poor management!!! Fast paced environment and you were expected to learn everything after being told how to do it the first time. Management talked down to the staff on regular basis and was always rude.
bad,"Management was extremely rude and it made me hate working. I enjoyed the fast past that I worked. It was understaffed, I would not recommend this job because of the management. If you want to keep employees, don't let management treat them like they are nothing."
bad,The management was terrible. The people were terrible. It was a very stressful job and also a very boring one. All they had me do was the register the whole time.
bad,Getting off was the most enjoyable part of working there. They couldn’t find the management. So I could get any hours. Nothing was in order someone was stealing. Food cost was high.
bad,managers do not care. not enough pay. most of them do not listen to your concerns. hardest part was coming into a mess and the managers not caring. Most enjoyable was leaving.
bad,the managers never let people out on time and just hired anyone so they had people not show up for there shift low pay little to no breaks rude customers
bad,"Even though I had learned all the positions at my local Wendy's from opening maintenance to closing grill, from cashier to grill to fries to lobby, when I was working both as a crew member and as a shift manager, it sucked the life out of me. First of all, when I got promoted, I was working 60 hour weeks, coming in early, staying late, 14 hour shifts no break, kept on telling that to my fellow assistant managers and they just said that managers weren't supposed to have breaks. I'm sorry. I'm a little emotional about that."
bad,The environment is often toxic. There's a ton of fighting within and literal fist fights. Management never kept their word to give enough hours and the pay wasn't worth any of the hassle. It was a job to get through college and high school
bad,"wendy's was the worst company in the USA "
bad,"The management sucked. Store manager was a Bipolar Nightmare. She would be your best friend one day and then tell you everything wrong you’re doing the next. I quit because a) I was moving to college the next week anyway, and b) the store manager shoved me into the sand which station and called me illiterate. The employees are gossip oriented and rude. Also, I never ever got a single break, no matter how long I worked. The only way you get a break is if you are a smoker."
bad,"For the downriver area and now some northern area's, I would not want to eat or work at any Wendy's who are under Douglas corporation management.  He is an awful owner, who leaves his incompetent general manager's to run his store's and employees into the ground. He also pays only minimum wage, but expects you to work multiple positions. Minor's get paid less, but does just as much if not more then an adult. Employees and managers get mad and fed up with working environment, so they stop caring and customers get bad food and service!"
bad,too much work for too little pay they ask u to do too many things and you’ll find ur self overwhelmed considering this was my first official job it was a bad experience
bad,"If you want every customer to treat you like dirt, then you should work here. If you want to work in a building with no working AC then you should work here. If you want to have to stay an extra hour each night because the people who clean the dishes around noon thought that meant putting water on it and that makes it ""clean"" now, Then you should work here. If you want a new GM every 4 months so when you've worked there for 6 months and ask the new gm for a raise she'll say ""Um, I'm sorry but I haven't worked with you for over 6 months so I cant give you a raise :/ "" Rinse and repeat every 4 months. This isn't a good place to work. Work at McDonald's instead. They at least will give you a free meal every day vs wendys 50% off."
bad,Not worth it had to be paid more money to go threw what i went threw terrible management and employees the job is beyond demanding cant explain to you the level of stress working there iam scared for life. I had to quit.
bad,"The management at this particular establishment was rude, underhanded, and far from understanding.Not only were they drowning in what looked like health code violations, but they didn't even have a first aid kit in the restaurant. Fast food as a whole is stressful, but being surrounded by people who yell at anyone, including the customers is worse. If you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks, don't be afraid of the industry, be afraid of fast food."
bad,"If you are unable to move at a fast pace, working by yourself after 2 days of training, and have no problem with receiving no help from any of your fellow employees, then Wendy's is for you."
bad,People dont understand how much fast food workers have to do. They should be paid way more. I feel like they took advantage of me because i was young at the time.
bad,Tough environment... Lots of turnover... Not enough in labor budget to get the job done...tough hours for managers as shifts could change from late to early or mid... Training non existent in most stores... Store manager only salaried employee... Employees encouraged to manipulate service scores by doing surveys themselves...hard to give breaks to crew and managers are expected to work 10 hour shifts without a break.
bad,"Wendy's is actively one of the worst places in America to work for, right behind places like Mcdonalds and Walmart but not ahead of borderline indentured servitude like Amazon."
bad,This was one of the worst jobs I ever had. The general manager didn't know what she was doing. There was no communication between the managers and actually one of the managers attacked a employee while I was on shift
bad,"hey you take what you can get. fairly easy to learn the system, just takes practice. discount on food while on shift. rude customers of course always come in"
bad,cleaning tables sweeping swiiping windows doors changing garbges cleaning bathrooms stocking the comint stand wipping up messes mopping up and cleaning childs high chairs stock things
bad,I was paid incorrectly and the manager was inconsistent. Did not get a chance to stretch my abilities further. the pay is too low and its a bi-weekly pay.
bad,Lazy environment. Workers should not work harder than the manager. Staff is ok but don't take their jobs seriously. Hardworking people should avoid this place. You'll be pulling the weight while they sit on their behind.
bad,"At Wendy's it was very stressful.  I worked for 8.75/hr for 2 1/2 years strait.  There was a couple managers there that were not the very most friendliest, and I had to deal with a lot high school kids that didn't want to always show up for work a lot."
bad,"Poor Management and Employees, Unsanitary Environment , No course of Action Enforced by Management, OSHA should be called In to inspect , No Linches or Breaks are ever given to employees"
bad,Y’all pay worse then any job that I know of to your employees and treat them like rag dolls if y’all want more people to work there then pay them more and stop hiring managers who can’t manage and who can’t tell them apart from trump y’all also don’t give people benefits so when I fell and broke my arm because your floors are t cleaned properly and I got no coverage for the hospital bill and I had to pay $2000 out of pocket all because y’all didnt give better benefits and then only reason I didn’t sue y’all was because I hate the cops and if I had the choice to pay half off for diabetes and cancer or work for Hitler I’d take my chances with Hitler
bad,"Very fast paced, not good management, expected to do the job of several people yourself. learned customer service, friendly workplace with the exception of the managers, hardest part of the job doing everything yourself."
bad,"Often times there were only about three workers there, so everyone had to work hard. Management would not fire those that never showed up, and rarely gave people days off when asked for. I worked over 40 hours a week while in high school, while others got less than 10 hours because they refused to show up and I had to take their shift."
bad,"I have worked here for more than a year and still make minimum wage. The establishment I work at is poorly managed and the managers are lazy. The general manager only enforces rules during an inspection. After that, you can go back to the normal trash hole it usually is. Since I've worked there, an entirely new crew team has been established because the old employees left because of poor management and they hated their jobs. I would not recommend working at a Wendy's unless you hate your life."
bad,The company only cares about making its money it does not matter what is going on in your life they under pay people especially for the work that is asked to do they can’t keep employees so we always working short staff the company sucks
bad,Some of tge managers are great and the rest are horrible. Bad place to work as an adukt trying to make a living. This is a placr to work if You're a teenager or you just want a second job that rams you in the keister you and doesn't pay well.
bad,Management is all out of order here. From leaning on employees to complete management tasks to being left in charge to run a shift yourself if a manager is outside on the phone or in the office sitting down.
bad,"I can only speak for one location, in Smith's Grove. General and District Manager along with the owner's son are beyond rude and have no sympathy or compassion for their employees at all. It's all about the money here, they do not value employee effort or loyalty. They will replace you in an instant and ban you from the property, while treating you like you don't exist."
bad,I had so much bad management when I worked at Wendy’s I was working shifts over 12 hours and all were scheduled evening to close. I was hired for day shifts. They never gave me breaks unless I begged for them. So understaffed that work was too much.
bad,This company care nothing about their employees. The pay is not great. Long hours with less pay will try to work you off the clock. No leadership they dont come aroind unless its a problem.
bad,"It was not what I expected it to be, they work you like your in a sweat shop and you just have to keep pushing forward weather you want or not. They don't care about you or yojr family."
bad,"Management sucks, when I was hired on they said they would work with my school schedule and they wouldn't. They would schedule me days to work Monday thru Friday that I had to work but i had to be in school at the same time. I had asked management to change my hours and then my mother got involved because i was a minor at the time calling me because i was late to work because I was still in school. Poor company to work for. Never have i ever went back to a Wendy's again."
bad,This wendys was the worst place to work! I needed a job ASAP and took what first came to me. Boy do I regret working for this company. Management is terrible! They start you your first day as if you've been there for months. This is a place I wouldn't recommend for anyone. But if you really need a job go for it!
bad,The worst job i ever had hardly any breaks. And the manerment stinks. they cutting my hrs of about 50% just because i took three days off. ..............
bad,"I will this chance of opportunity of what they did to me, As a change my job and went at the other place here in New Brunswick what they did to me is giving me a negative feedback at the boarder of St. Stephen due to not giving me a Work permit that time that's why I don't have a job for almost a year. Canada is a free country and we pay for what we are now. I prefer to not tell this kind of treatment because I was scared that time."
bad,One if the worst companies to work for !!  Very poor management.Never enough employees to run efficiently. Diirty restaurants in almost every location.
bad,Very rude & the food is nasty manger very rude & ghetto so is the team it’s no real team effort the employees stank they never wash up all Wendy’s want you to do is wash dishes constantly all day from the start of your shift to the end smh
bad,I work ridiculous long hours and do not get paid enough. Working paycheck to paycheck is just not worth it. There are so many other bad things!!!!!!!!
bad,"Lazy General Manager that complained and talked about employer and employees behind their back and then smiles in their face when they are present. I had to constantly drive to different locations to pick up food items that ran low, which was practically everyday and that interfered with getting my work done properly."
bad,"This place has ZERO management skills. they're rude to employees and none of the managers in the store communicate with the others or the employees.they basically expect you to ""read their mind"". It was a very horrible, hostile, work environment. Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy!!!"
bad,"Management as a whole was unwilling to accommodate and not very organised. Co-workers often refused to cooperate, and breaks were rarely given, and always unpaid. Only benefit received is 50% meals, with manager permission required."
bad,The DM likes to keep friends and not enough proper employees when called out on bad things he gets rid of the people that will call him out on it and not try to correct all the bad in his stores. So much inside theft of food smoking in the stores so much disrespect from upper mangers to employees and nothing done about it. False advertisement on pay to get you inside then work you like a slave for little pay then be little you on things.
bad,"When they say u have give up your lite to work here, it true ! I can’t call in you can’t take a break you can’t even use the bathroom from 1-4 - 5-8 it unreal how they treat the employees and I feel worst for the management! The DM is a horrible person and so disrespectful... don’t even waste your time apply"
bad,I did not enjoy my experience at Wendy's as my manager was rude and would refuse to provide me with help when I first started working there. The job was understaffed and required a heavy workload.
bad,Come in and stock the work area and start making sandwiches and what whatever needs to be done I would do it.  I learned how to do my job at a fast pace and I handle some rude customers and appropriate manner so I can finish my shift with complaints and mad customer's. Management wasn't the best management team! The big exciting Rush that happens every few hours. The employee's and some of  the customer made my shift when I worked.
bad,"The management at Wendy’s tend to be immature, bitter and very controlling and in my opinion is not a place to work unless a person have intense patience."
bad,Find a job were management can separate they home life from there job life. I did not enjoy working there was too much unnecessary drama.you have to do too much for lil pay. You put up with a lot of mess from management.
bad,I absolutely hated Wendy’s. Managers were so unprofessional. Felt over worked and unappreciated. Employees other then myself also hated working in such an unprofessional environment. Overall 1 star
bad,Terrible place to work. Poorly managed. Managers never were very sexist and discriminatory I absolutely hated working there and would never recommend anyone employment there
bad,Too many kids hired wanting a paycheck but not do work. you are expected to do your job and anything else the kids don't or won't do. Very lazy manager.
bad,"When i was employed there it started out ok. It was fun even, Managers were all laid back but very professional when need be. However, it slowly went in the opposite direction. Managers were dreading work. employees were dreading work...Maybe its changed, I know they got a new rgm."
bad,I worked here when I was in high school. I moved up relatively fast but I never really enjoyed it. I made a lot of friends who then all left for better jobs and they found places where they could be happy.
bad,They treat there workers poorly and you don't get a great pay and they want you to work until you brake your back while other workers sit and do nothing
bad,Maybe if I worked at a different Wendy's I would feel different. But they train backwards and the managers at the time did have favorites and let it show.
bad,poor management and to much drama and the boss was not very nice he gets mad to easy and take it out on his employees and I just didn't feel like comforble there anymore
bad,"learned food safety"
bad,It was pretty easy going not enough hours though didnt really see eye to eye with the manager cause where I wasn't getting enough hours bur other then that I got along with all the employees and did my job
bad,"Poor management. The training just watch the video."
bad,Management was rude and unprofessional. Always screaming at employees with a lobby full of customers. You are never acknowledged for your hard work. Covering shifts when asked.
bad,Really bad. No one gets disciplined for anything they do. Always short staffed. Everyone calls off and comes in late. The pay is AWFUL. Nothing good about it
bad,This was the first place that i have experienced some discrimination in the work space. I felt very uncomfortable by the shift manager and there behind the light movements. Not doing any work unless theres someone is watching.
bad,"I applied to Wendy's as a part time employee cause I am still a high school student. They have me working full time and I don't have time for family or friends anymore. In the short time I was there, at least four people had quit due to poor management. I do the work of three people on a normal day. Wendy's employees don't get paid enough for the things they do, and it is very frustrating. When I first started I was trained by people who were also new and still didn't know what to do in certain situations. "
bad,I hated this place.  Management sucks. Most of the workers were lazy or unorganized. Everyone always had an attitude. I love fast food and this would be the last place I work ever again.
bad,"Manger is never helping out when u need it "
bad,Absolutely terrible place of employment never work here unless you like management playing favorites unfair hour overly stressful due to understaffing because the management is so terrible people quit constantly
bad,i opened the store and made sure everything was ready to go to open on time. preped all the salads made the chilli and made sure the dinning room was stocked
bad,"the management was terrible , a lot of favoritism, drug use on company property. The store was really dirty, rude to customers, mis treated food, theft was a big issue."
bad,"The typical day at Wendy's was okay, there was a lot of work thrown at me everyday and very little help was offered to finish it all. There wasn't an enjoyable part"
bad,I hated working for them and would never do it again it has been so long that i caso please stinnot remember much about the whole expierence    just stop asking
bad,They are very rude and disrespectful they keep up drama and make you do loads of work and don’t get paid enough the managers date everybody and show favoritism I hate this job and would never recommend to anyone TRUST ME !!!!
bad,"my experience working for this place was not a very good one. i dont recommend working here unless this would be a first time job. Pay was bad, managment could be better."
bad,"Very messy management. Inconsistent hours, jumped form 4 hours a day to 10 straight ,Sometimes would not get a break. Very stressful. Could be fun at times but the amount of work and fast paced environment doesn’t make up for it."
bad,unprofessional horribly  kept kitchen rude disrespectful over worked their workers while in school made me close the store with only one manager on almost every occaison
bad,Wendys is a great environment for teens seeking their first job. It is not the ideal place of employment for anyone over the age of 20. Wendys does over advancement opportunities.
bad,"Just an overall bad place to work at. The store I worked at had very biased and bad management, to the point where some crew quit due to it. The management at that store is extremely biased and do not treat there workers individually. On top of this, the store breaks MANY laws, including laws about working minors, and violates many OSHA standards."
bad,A typical day at work was me cleaning up at the store. I learned how to work hard. Management treated me poorly. The hardest part of the job was working while being mistreated. The most enjoyable part of the job was doing my actual job.
bad,"I hated working there, because of poor management, bad boss and it so darn stressful and I could not keep up with the customers' food orders. The place is no longer there in Kingsport Pavilion shopping center."
bad,"They train you in 1 job and expect you to work until you die. There is maybe like 5 employees on a Saturday, on lunch hour if you are lucky. If you work at the speed of sound they will still somehow find a way to yell at you for not being fast enough. They will probably never give you more than 20 hours per week."
bad,The management team didn’t care about anything but themselves. I had to put in my two weeks because i was recovering from a csection and they wanted me to lift boxes over 50lbs as well as mop while i still had stitches in my stomach
bad,Busy and what i learned nothing honestly and managment was not great they didnt do anything and had issues there. Was trying to be happy and trying to work on things
bad,I couldn’t acquire or improve my skills cause they didn’t give me the chance to do it. I liked working there but they didn’t have patience with me and were always talking about me behind my back
bad,It v a very corrupt place to work. Very very poor management and a lack of work committment. I would honestly not recommend it to anyone wanting or needing a job.
bad,"Poor management. That's all I can really say. The managers would do a poor job, and then when the bigger bosses would come in, they would blame it on the employees. Even though, majority of the time the managers would train the new employees completely wrong."
bad,Mangers needed managers but refused to promote of fear of them being fired. Nasty managers in charge who talked down to the staff and overwork us and under pay everyone. Horrible company where I was treated like dirt even though i was excellent on the line and i was the fastest sandwich maker in my whole district.
bad,The managers taught everyone quick ways to do things an alot of it were health hazards they were disrespectful to the employees they were rude to customers
bad,While working at wendys i didnt like it because there was drama everywhere. Customers always complaining about workers. Managers talking loud and being disrespectful
bad,"Wendy's, unfortunately, follows the practice of labor percentage which means whoever is getting paid the highest hourly wage on shift gets sent home before they are schedule to which is a violation of the law."
bad,I worked as a cashier and cook and I did not like my job they always messed up my check and I bearly got any hours and it was nothing but drama with other employees
bad,I would have to be their as soon as the place opens just to prepare the food make sure everything is okay for customers greet them and help them when they need assistance
bad,I worked here for 4 years. And barely got any hours. Even after graduating I was only getting roughly 20 hours a week. The management was horrible. They always had and attitude when you ask for a day off. And they show a lot of favoritism. Also I was expected to work 8 days straight with one day off. Barely get any breaks. I do not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,It's a good first job. once you start getting more bills expenses it is not a job to live on. it's also a good job if you been convicted of any type of felony.
bad,The managers are okay but not the greatest. It's all drama. Pay is minimum wage. Dont get raises. It's a stressful environment when everything is so negative.
bad,They wasn’t treating me right so I had to leave  they was doing wrong stuff they shouldn’t do teaches everybody wrong and never teaches them right from worng
bad,"management is terrible, the demand too much and are unreasonable. I would never want anyone to have to work for such a terrible company. the manager is not reasonable and makes the schedule at the very last minute at midnight the day its due."
bad,You are not as llowed to di your job. If you get on to someone all they have to do is cry to the gm and they are off the hook and you are in trouble. If your a male you are definitely screwed by the management. Also you will not be allowed to take your vacation time.
bad,"it was cool, just not something I would do after high school. not enough pay for the labor they expect you to put in. and you'll sweat a lot more than you think"
bad,It was very stressed and I enjoyed my time dealing with the customers and we making each other laugh. I cant really say too much about the good times working beside the customers. The managers was very lazy didn't care none of the customers food or the time to get the food out. team work is always key for me getting along with your peers is a wonderful feeling. don't nobody want to be stressed at work
bad,i have nothing to say about this job ..it was a job that i am glad to say that i no longer have to work for . NO job benefits ... no kind of paid days off . nothing .
bad,"This store is ran on drama, nobody gets along and nobody ever looks or even is happy. things are ran very oddly in this store and the managers don't care."
bad,Very fast paced job that gives you little time to rest and little to no rewards for your hard work. If you are a crack head. alcoholic. cant smoke enough. This is the job for you.
bad,"Typical day at work involves prepping, cleaning, preparing food, etc. I learned how to make food fast pace and learn the idea of working at a fast food place. Management was extremely rude and not understanding. "
bad,The managers are jerks! They don’t know how to keep their mouths shut or provide privacy when it comes to confidentiality!!!! They can shove it where the sun doesn’t shine!
bad,Management when i worked at Wendys was very poor. Staff was treated with little to no respect and employees were yelled and cussed at for misunderstandings. They have since gotten new management which i believe has helped a lot with business and employee commitment
bad,I would never work for this company again. I have not been treated well by my previous DM and RM. You are micro managed and belittled by the DM. DM needs to learn how to be a leader not a boss
bad,Only work at Icomm Drive if you absolutely need the cash and can't find anywhere else to work. This is most toxic work environment I have ever worked at. GM acts like a highschool student from gossiping to general passive aggressiveness when you don't worship them.
bad,they ask the world out of you and still don't want to give you the days you ask off off and if you ask a day off they give you even less hours so you can't make any money thank you
bad,"My excitement to start this job was beyond imaginable it was a chance to step my foot in the right path I needed. However the start was too harsh for anyone with a gentle heart could handle.The aggression to new employees is awful, they will bully and harass you for not knowing jobs that they even havn't had taught you as of yet. Constantly being forced to do multiple tasks with no reward but telling you that you never did a good enough job. If one task you were told to focus on they will instantly jump down your throat for not doing this other task they said just now in seconds without warning. There will be co workers who will constantly talked down to you and after doing their bidding you can hear them saying how stupid you are out loud around managers that will turn the other cheek for this special treated person. Speaking up to the harasser will lead to being called defensive and a person who thinks their better. Making any complaint will lead to you potentially getting fire purely on bias for the harasser since they are all buddies after all. I have been told by many customers complaining to me that their food shouldn't take over 10 minutes and hearing them laugh out loud gossip with each other made them tell me that ""after this wait I think I will never come here again."" I sincerely pray for those who are new potential victims to this company because it's a completely bias industry that not being their best friends and doing your job will just cause you to never have any respect as a individual. Thinking back on it still gives me PTSD of the events there that will probably"
bad,i hated this work place they all are ghetto they never get your order an the manager is so rude and they dont look clean at all so unprofessional i will never recommand anyone there
bad,"show up at 7 am wait on manager to open the doors"
bad,Coworkers help eachother. The management isnt very good they have no protocols. They do stuff against the law and try to mask everything they do wrong
bad,A typical day at work was very rushed and quick paced. Most of the employees and manager at the time were very snippy and didn't tend to their employees as needed. It was a very stressful work environment.
bad,"This was my first job when I was 16. The management was trash. I worked here for about 5 months and the raise I was given was less than the raise I was promised and more hours was out of the question - but when my friend came to work here 2 months after me he got a raise and ended up making more and working more, just because he was the stereotypical Asian boy that my manager liked so much."
bad,"I really didn’t like working here , they had us do a lot of work for very little pay . Managers had no respect for employees or customers. Had you jumping from task to task even if you didn’t finish the first one."
bad,"I did not  enjoy rolling for Wendy's because I feel the management was poor, hours were scarce as well as any kind of proper training. Hours were not given unless begged for."
bad,"I had a really bad experience with one of the most toxic and manipulative people I ever met. the manager.  I get along with everyone and don't have any problems with anyone ever but that lady has driven so many people away because of how terrible she is. its ridiculous she still works there. I didn't leave on bad terms, but she takes everyone so personally"
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's was very rough, unorganized, and unsanitary. I learned how Managements hold the key to a successful store they also control how gross the store is. Hardest part about the job was communicating with management on poor crew work."
bad,"the environment wasn't fun at all. the new management were overly strict, they weren't organized, We had employees that had been working in that specific  establishment for over 5 years and they haven't gotten a raise yet, wasn't a fun or a learning experience."
bad,"This company literally is horrible.  Higher Management does not protect employees from discrimination, nor care about employee concerns. They will use you,  and spit you out."
bad,it did the purpose it was intended which was to help make extra money during high school. The environment depends at the location you work at I worked at a total of 3 different stores and they all had different people
bad,this job is nasty they drop food prepreparing and still serve it they are not caught they are not only rude to customers and make you be polite but they are rude to employees too this is definitely not a place to work
bad,The hardest part of the job was that the leaders took advantage of the crew members. There was a lot of bullying going around and the leads liked picking on the younger team members.
bad,"I wasn't getting paid enough.The managment didn't care about my health at all. They would not let me do what I was suppose to do, for example: I was Cashier but they had me cooking"
bad,The management was awful. There were very few managers who actually did their jobs. I wouldnt ever recommend this job to anyone ever. Please dont do it!!!
bad,Wendy's wasn't for me I didn't like working here I was doing everything and my pay was nothing I was in school at the time and I was working till midnight that's against the law
bad,The wendys i worked at was poor at everything. (Poor managment. poor wages .poor workplace eithics. Poor cleanliness. ) i do not recommend working here to anyone.
bad,the general manager was not seaming to care about the store and had issues with me when i had to work open to close and had my son at was at home and worked open to close. t was not able to leave when i was schooled off
bad,Managers were terrible and this place was not fun to work at. Constant stress as manager sits in the back of the store on their phones. Not  good place to work.
bad,The management was very poor and I struggled to make money there. They cut hours just so others can meet their fair amount. Wendy's is not a great recommended job.
bad,Por trabajar de lunes a sábado todo un mes sueldos de 140000 aprox
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this company because I had no training, no benefits, the staff was extremely rude, the managers took  too many smoke breaks and left the crew to take care of the store, overworked for less pay."
bad,"Expect you to know everything, they barely train you and they treat you like a dog. Worst job ever! I DON'T recommend working there if you are looking for a good job with great pay."
bad,"At Wendy's, they have poor management and treat their employees like dirt. Every day they speak in Spanish, in front of customers and use poor language. In all, the company is not good."
bad,i worked there and the store owner made me feel unwanted and worthless he was mean to all the employees and customers. he yelled at us in front  of everyone in the store
bad,"Everything about working there sucks. It’s dirty, the people suck, and the pay is way to low to deal with some of the stuff that goes on in there so overall don’t work there"
bad,"My whole experience at a place where you can typically expect the mosh pit of hangry consumers and horrible bosses, this was the living experience for a person who was just starting off her first job, and they also say the first job is the quickest you want out. Not only the fact that I had no growth, capitally, but the co-workers was the next to working in a living nightmare right next to managers who felt the need to turn the environment into high school all over again. I wouldn't even want my worst enemy at this Wendy's."
bad,Sucks don’t work there . The person who hire managers traded a good manager who been there for someone who is very rude and sneaky.woud never work there again
bad,"The job was terrible. The staff would always call off, leaving the rest of the crew short handed some days. There would be fights very often and it was just not a good place to work."
bad,"Very hostile working environment, managers would change your hours without knowledge, and there were no cameras in building, very dirty place, and very careless staff."
bad,Now they say hard work pays off not at wendys . felt like i worked for nothing but a penny . but i made the best out of my work place and learn that i could multi task at a speed of no other .
bad,the job was really easy i didnt mind working for them until it was basically brought to my attention that the labor i was doing and the wage i was making was completely a rip off.
bad,"Worked here for a year and it was nothing but he'll. The employees were rude, customers were rude, store got gross quickly bad area to work in just overall terrible."
bad,"I used to love working for Wendy's. the management now days is letting the company go down hill really fast and I hate to see that! Wendy's was always a nice place, love the food. :)"
bad,They are very Bad people they always stating something with there  employees. You can’t say non with out the jumping right in to your conversation. I wish you guys luck if u work there.
bad,I watched people actually get fired and days cut if they called out for being in the hospital. when the company got switched to franchise elmpoyes was
bad,They don’t care about employees. They are lots of drama not worth the time at all. Made me miserable at the end so had to quit. Job is complete bs. Do not recommend.
bad,Come in clock in didn't matter if it wasn't time if you were there you needed to clock in. My managers always yelled at me all the time and created stress that I felt was unnecessary. The turnover rate was outrageous. They say competitive I said cut-throat and cruel. They put me on dishes 9 months pregnant knowing I couldn't reach over the sink with my belly but I did anyways. I worked my butt off harder at this job than any other job I have had and I have been a manager and I have worked pregnant before.
bad,Always wear non slip resistent shoes when working in a fast food restaurant...i liked my job it was east and time went very fast it was relaxing and organizational akills is very important when working administration and human resources
bad,The most hardest/easiest job I have but I get paid so little for so much work. loved my co workers. Training one on one is bad so youll have to watch n learn.
bad,The managers there are ridiculous when it comes to talk to employees nice and caring for them they cuss at them and yell at them also they don't get u off when you need to.
bad,You could be sooo nice to a customers and still get in trouble and yelled at telling the “manager” what happened. Food cost always being complained about but they are always giving away free food.
bad,"it was ok working here at first i enjoyed my job , but i didn't appreciate the other employees how they had constant negative attitude and how i felt like i was treated differently"
bad,"The management at this job was poor and still continues to be lacking. People were fired and then rehired months later and no one focuses on the job or being the best. The service is slow, nothing is done to company standards, people treat the customers like trash. I learned how to run a store with one other person while everyone else stands around and does nothing to help."
bad,the managers were all uptight they yelled at the employees like they were nothing the hours were stressful the were understaffed because so many people walked out
bad,"You were assigned to one task.  No cross training or cross working."
bad,"Everyone knows fast food jobs suck but they can be made fun with the people you work with. That is soo not the case with Wendy's. Management doesn't know what they're doing, never orders enough, and blames you when the customers complain when you're out of stuff."
bad,It is a terrible place to work and they make sure that the people they like the most its obvious and if they don't like you they treat you differently.
bad,It was very stressful and I rarely got a break. It wasn't a good job to have while being in school full time. I worked way too late and never got help.
bad,Wendy’s did not pay enough and barely gives raises. They only give 30 minute lunches regardless if you worked a 10 hour shift. No breaks in between. Short staffed.
bad,The work I did was good. I didn't like how many hours I was getting and they didn't let me have a day off when I requested it. The company I felt was racist
bad,"Lazy and people don’t want to work , being rude to customers .  Don’t show up , dirty place to work at , slow pace , employees don’t clean or do they job , people walk out"
bad,"general manager never helped out no matter how busy, just sat in office"
bad,They never allowed you to be able to work on the days needed. I was pregnant and sick in the hospital. I came back with a note to keep my hours of 40 the manager cut my hours to make me leave. She had been trying since I came into her store. She was racist.
bad,"Honestly I know fast food isn’t the best job. But what makes it the worst is the healthcodes and labor law broken daily."
bad,"My experience there was horrible. The managers did not get anything done. All they did was walk around bossing everyone around and they would make fun of a fellow coworker because she did not wear deodorant and called her “Stinkbug”. Overall , I woke up around 4 AM to get to work by 5AM and clock out at 11-12 and sometimes had to stay until 1 or 2 and still got paid 8... was not worth it."
bad,I hate Wendys as an employee but love Wendys as a customer. They pay sucks and the work environment is highly stressful I believe due to the pay . If workers were getting paid more I believe it would make the work environment less stressful.  Point blank this is slave work !!!!!!!!!
bad,I would never go back there you had 25 year old getting a 17 yeard old pregnant they steal money and try to  be slick with it the even played favortism
bad,I enjoyed working for the company to assist with my income for my goals while I was in school. The management team worked with me and my school schedule and
bad,I was ridiculed and belittled by management for worrying while on leave (FMLA). I didn't feel comfortable or respected. I was consistently short staffed despite repeated attempts to ask for help.
bad,I honestly disliked my job. they were extremely  understaffed so several employees and I never received breaks and we were doing so much extra work and the pay was $7.00 it was definitely not worth it in my opinion.
bad,"When I worked here at Wendy's the management was poor, the crew was always smoking whenever they felt like it and no matter what they always put themselves before the customer. Me and my cousin worked there and I felt like we were the hardest workers but the ones that always went outside to smoke whenever they felt like got paid more money and was always in the right to the manager."
bad,Never ever will I work for this company ever worse fast food experience I have ever had!!!! Was fired for saying something to a shift manager about causing conflict between two employees allowing the employees to argue in front of customers! So unprofessional.
bad,I wouldn't recommend no one to work here because of lack of hours. You can't make it home until the next person comes in and they might not come in on time so that prolongs you time working.
bad,wouldn't even try to work here again it was a okay job when i was in high school but it isn't something people should have to deal with the manager was horrible and didn't care about anything as long as you were at work. had a family emergency and the manger told me that work was more important than family and they if i didn't show up i would be fired
bad,i didnt like working there but i cant speak for others it was understaff nasty and the work hours where horrible. they didnt have enough people on a shift for what we was doing.
bad,"The job sucks, I would never wish my worst enemy to work here. The managers suck and the food is terrible after you find out how they fix it, I only got one uniform and hardly ever had off work."
bad,I have been working there for two weeks and both weeks I was given days I could not work. There is also a lot of yelling and vulgar language among other employees.
bad,I didn’t like working at Wendy’s because they were not helping me I use to go to work on time everyday and I was a a cashier the only one pushing orders
bad,"I don’t make enough money to support myself im 16 and have to do everything on my own and they only schedule me 1 day a week and some managers have the audacity to send me home early and let other employees who weren’t supposed to be there stay , I call that favoritism"
bad,I experience at Wendy’s was horrible and unorganized        They had no one training me and the days I did work I taught my self to do everything I needed to know and with doing all of that I wasn’t getting any hours I kept calling but it got me no where.
bad,Just horrible never will work here again it is not worth it you will be mad don't ever work here bad policy alot of people in lobby  that don't even bee eating
bad,After working for Wendys since the age of 15 it started out not so bad then it became one of the worst jobs I worked for the managers was horrible you could never leave on time and they don’t have any respect for people with children
bad,"Awful place to work. Manager treats workers poorly , doesn't care about their staff. Called me a liar when I called into work because of a snow storm, also called me lazy and said I didn't want to work but in reality I literally could not get to work because of a snow storm."
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with but the management was poor and not organized at all. I believe there was favoritism in the workplace, which is not very appropriate for work."
bad,Wendy's by far had the most disrespectful crew I've ever worked with. I would highly recommend my friends not work there because of bad experiences that I had.
bad,It's FAST food so it's gonna be super stressful and your gonna get dirty. The mangers where I worked we're horrible. I was in high school and they would keep me until almost 12:30 at night when I started at 4 and  wouldn't get out of school until 3. The drive through gave me horrible anxiety and the lunch rushes were way too much. Friendly staff though.
bad,"very judgemental"
bad,"The typical work day lasted longer than your scheduled hours. I learned that it is not a good first job for anyone because they do not train you and expect you to know what you are doing right away. The management was unprofessional to say the least, cussing at their workers infront of a bunch of customers. The workplace environment was okay I guess. The hardest part of my job was having to do everything at once, from taking orders to making the orders to cleaning and everything, although, I did not complain and did my job as needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was break honestly, that was when or if I got a break that day."
bad,"The job is a starter job yes , but it is just ridiculous what they expect of you . They played me. And wanted me to work off the clock because I was getting to much over time ."
bad,Have never seen such lack of responsible individuals at a work place and I would not recommend this wendys to anyone. I would not want to work for another wendys because of this experienced I had to go through
bad,"The work environment is beyond atrocious. Nearly any and all stress inducers (aside from rude customers) are caused because of poor management and lack of entailed professional behavior inside the work area. Furthermore, in order to add on to such a complaint with unprofessional manager behaviors, the overall unprofessionalism from said anonymous managers is utterly unethical."
bad,I enjoy working there but don’t feel comfortable .i barely get a break when I work long shifts I don’t get a break and the man manger is very patient but other mangers can be rude
bad,"terrible management, rude customers , disgusting place to work, not Wirth the pay, hardest part was closing theres always a rush u should work at mcdonalds"
bad,The heat was unbearable while I worked there at the fryers all the time. Hours were terrible. I was not intending to stay long so I was not trained on much.
bad,"The management was almost always hired outside of the company and had no idea what they were doing. They were almost never around when needed and would harp on the employees for not being capable of dealing with things without them. The salary was terrible for anyone who wasn't in high school and the GM's would usually find terrible excuses not to give out well deserved raises. Some of the employees would take the managers example and not do any work making it difficult on the closers. It was always a stressful working environment, which led to a high turnover rate, which was blamed on the employees that didn't quit."
bad,"At the start of you're job here everything seems all dandy and such, but after while and you analyze everything, it is not a healthy environment at all"
bad,I would not recamend that you work at wendys because the managers are rude and the pay is poor and the hours are not enough and they atmosphere is not friendly at all.
bad,I honestly hated working at wendys no respect at all from co-workers the work ethics of some people was horrible. Nobody did their jobs the right way and it could of gotten us all in trouble I would say I never really enjoyed working at wendys they never really appreciated their employees
bad,Don’t ever work there...it was a dangerous unsafe environment... it was very gross and nasty terrible managers and employees... sometimes breaks weren’t even giving to minors
bad,I enjoyed working here for a few years until I was fired for having my menstrual cycle and needing to go home. The hours were normal 8 hours but if you didn't smoke then you didn't get a break. I worked a lot of 9 and 10 hour shifts with no breaks. If you ate any food you had to pay for it yourself even tho I didn't get a break to eat. Extremely hot in the summer. Rude customers wanting free things all the time. Having intelligence insulted by customers. A job for a teen just starting out. Definitely not a career.
bad,I did not like how there was clear favoritism in the work place while most employees where related to the managers until the district manager started to relocate people. If you were not liked by the managers then you had to work a lot harder then everyone else so you could keep your job and that put a lot on my shoulders especially because i grew up working so i worked extra hard and my head was always spinning making me literally hate my life because of where i worked.
bad,When I was working there it was a collaboration of poor management that had little to no grasp on the English language combined with busy and stressful employees.
bad,Working there was terrible but it was a Job the company was terrible I didn’t care about us as people they work you have to do was terrible I got robbed up  there before
bad,I was taken off the schedule for 1 month and I could be off the schedule for that long because I have a car and insurance to pay. So if I want working I couldn't pay for maintenance on my car and my insurance
bad,"The management is terrible, they expect you to do much more than what you are required to do, and make you clock out early even if you are still working and continue to work off the clock so that they don't have to pay for overtime. Constantly running out of products like napkins, spoons, sauces, and even fries just so that they spend less on food orders and get the extra money saved as a bonus. Absolutely horrendous place to work."
bad,"It started by preparing food and waiting for customers. During the waiting period, when we weren't preparing food, we would clean the store. Management was hardly seen and customers would often be left unattended while the employees and such were busy with other things."
bad,Wendy's on first Ave in Evansville is a terrible place of employment store was dirty poorly staffed and ran by incompetent mangers poorly trained highly unprofessional crew members who basically did whatever they wanted...
bad,the managers did not take into regard that people have lives other jobs and children and would get upset when i was not able to work insane hours like 5pm until 2am monday thru saturday when i had two other jobs
bad,I didn't like it and worked there twice they don't really wanna compensate with other life activity.. I've been put down for no reason and at the time there was no structure
bad,There is nothing nice to say about Wendy's they don't know how to work as a team there they think no one need's help at all they think that the works can do everything by their self.
bad,Unfair management. Doesn’t follow up on tasks given. Majority of the higher management worked us like dogs. I closed 5-4am to open 6-2pm. Didn’t pay me overtime aswell. Worked 12 hours free.
bad,Horrible management tried to accuse me of stealing from the drawer. They messed up because they couldn't count. I enjoyed working for the company. But would not work here again.
bad,In the time I worked at wendys I worked from 10am to 2am 7 days of the week for weeks straight. They denied me breaks and when I was given breaks they would come and tell me they need me back inside to help before my break was over. Promised me promotions repeatedly to keep me working 15+ hour shifts 7 days of the week but never followed through was hurt on the job repeatedly. I told managment that i cant get overly hot several times or I will faint and they wouldnt listen when i would tell them im beginning to get lightheaded and woozy until I fainted twice in the same shift. Any other time I would get hurt on the clock they wouldn't allow me to go the the hospital because they were scared of being sued. All in all it was a terrible start up company with very terrible management.
bad,"Horrible management, very difficult to learn efficiently in the environment, and the atmosphere was completely hostile. A regular day consisted of an employee working two or more stations during the shift because most days we were shortly staffed. Breaks came few and in between while most cashiers worked unexpected doubles."
bad,"This is by far the worst place I have ever worked. Dave would be ashamed to know that his dream has turned into a cooperate nightmare! There are no values, they don't care about their employees, and will literally give anyone a position here. They sell you great in training and bust you when you get to the store. Forget this place!"
bad,This place is awful. The management doesn't care about the employees let alone the customers. They don't care about if your child is sick or if you are they only want to work people like dogs and they allow women to be sexually harassed awful place horrible
bad,"The pay is too low, the hours are ridiculous. The managers are unfair. The workers are treated with no respect. The hours are ridiculous as well. Would not recommend."
bad,The staff was very uneducated & very unprofessional! They were rude and rarely cared about their work. there was always drama with some of the employees . The General Manager was very rude and unprofessional along with 2  managers
bad,"I relocated to Ohio to care for my mother in law during her illness , I would not recommend this place of employment due to the high turnover rate and lack of respect for the employees displayed by the management, Sylva North Carolina is a bigoted small minded town that relies on college students"
bad,Dysfunctional All the way around. Same problems all different crew.  I have done at one time or another here most all positions with the exception of management duties.  Management continues to encounter inconsistent approaches to management practices... to then when at their desired convenience bend rules and practices... only later to turn around and try to micromanage.  I have voiced my opinions and always get viewed as incompetent as far as opportunity offered. The place has a bad reputation.  As well as it has additional structure/ function ability issues. You cannot even use the mop sink properly!  What I learned..... people are complacent!
bad,"worked here for a couple of months and it sucked! Horrible place to work, def over work you and very little pay. I guess it was ookay for a high school job tho."
bad,Horrible place to work. Work environment is bad and the coworkers have bad attitudes nobody really cares about the job and won’t ever really care about it
bad,"Always short with staff and employees. Very poor management! No one cared about the companies rules or regulations. Working here was just bad from the beginning, due to disrespectful managers & very racist."
bad,A typical day at wendys was stressful. I learned the difference between a boss and a leader . The management was poor. I did not like the workplace culture.
bad,From the time I started to the time I resigned we've gone through TDM's the  managers we're never organized and always giving hours to people who call in but people who are dedicated and come in when they're not assigned to come in would wind up with 15 to 17 hours a week even when they're promised a set schedule
bad,"slow management, rude coworkers, no stability, no raises, rude management, non stable work hours, favoritism, no benefits, uneasy to deal with, stressful work environment."
bad,Working at Wendy's sucked and  was the worst job I ever worked and the management was poor and I learned nothing for the most part but this not for me
bad,Typical fast food job with typical fast paced food service responsibilities. Not much to say about this role besides the fact that it is exactly what you would expect form this kind of job.
bad,Upper management not easily accessible. Employees able to treat assistant managers and shift managers like dirt and nothing was done. I left do to being afraid to work til 2 am.
bad,the restaurant is understaffed and upper management only cares about themselves and numbers. very stressful place to work. Employees always leave and quit there.
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone the management and fellow employees we're all drug addicts and people were stealing money out of the cash registers and I was told I wouldn't have to work on some days and would get others off and never worked out and was asked multiple times to work off the clock because of this.and there was a lot of nepotism and favoritism going on
bad,I worked there a long time ago and by now all the managers are gone and the place has been remodeled. You want more characters though. How about noww.
bad,This is not a good place to work it is going down hill. I used to love it before it came under new managers and has been for past 3 years...every 3 - 6 months they're getting of one replacing it with a new one. Should have never transferred the original manager of this store.
bad,I got paid 7.95 not even 8.00. It was the worst and we could never get paid for overtime. Did a lot for the very little i got paid. I was literally the only cashier.
bad,Working conditions were not good.  Management gave little consideration for the worker's personal schedule when the work schedule was developed.  The manager was difficult to work with.
bad,Wendy's is a bad place to work I dont like the people or the company I don't like the work either although it got me by it's not enough pay for the work you do there
bad,It may have changed by now but it was never a happy place to work. Employees weren't reliable and I was over worked and underpaid. I do not recommend managing in fast food.
bad,This job is for a high schooler or someone with no responsibilities. In order to make ends meet you would need a second job working for Wendy’s.  I recommend this job to teenagers
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone else ever again. After working there for some time you will start to see all of the unprofessional-ism and the way management is sought up.
bad,Hours for crew members were inconsistent. I was constantly being called and in becuase my manager was sending everyone home all the time. Many times I worked thirteen hour shifts and only got a fifteen minute break. They are not sensitive to the needs of human beings
bad,I've done this type of work for to long now. So It was time to advance. Love helping people but I turely feel like there's more for me to do in the world.
bad,"Wendy's is an extremely busy business. Always shortstaffed and everyone has to bust their as* for minimum wage.. customers are rude no matter how nice you are to them."
bad,Working there was the most  unorganized mess ever. People quitting left and right... 2 or 3 people doing all the work while some employees get to slack around and do the bare minimum. I was hardly ever off of work on time and everyday I worked there I felt like quitting.
bad,The DM are unreliable and do not help at all.. no rules or labor laws are followed. They are a very shady company to work for that do not appreciate their employees that have been there for years
bad,Pretty much have to work hard to get paid barely anything. No good benefits. Health care sucks. Barely pay people enough to live. Definitely need to pay more. Management at the store I worked for was the worst. The new Gm we got had no clue what she was doing. I always got blamed for a lot of things even though I was the only manger to run night shift 5 nights a week. Just a terrible place to work you could make more money at Mc Donald’s.
bad,the only thing good about Wendy is the discounts on food other then that its drama you got to stay to yourself no team work half of the time working at this will have you drained you wouldn't want to work here at all
bad,"Employees call off everyday, managers have no experience in what they are doing. They have no patience or people skills. Employees get yelled at constantly not a fun place to work"
bad,Star board is the worse management I've worked for... they dont understand there stores enough and how they work. They make it worse by suspending the only person who had any idea on what was going on around the 2 stores crumbling to the ground due to thinking they know what's best....
bad,"There is too much Drama at this store, making it miserable to work there daily, there is no point in showing up if they are going to treat you like a slave if you aren’t kissing the right butt everyday."
bad,"Wendy’s in my personal opinion is one of the worse jobs I’ve ever had, the management is bad and if the staff has something to talk about it gets spread around. Over all working at Wendy’s is horrible."
bad,"Awful workplace to work in, no managment, not enough labor, horrible. Co workers go unappreciated, never noticed. Always picking up the slack. Not enough pay. Dirty enviroment."
bad,"Managers fought constantly, was left alone to run the restaurant on the first day, was 16 at the time. Was not given a day off when sick, was treated terribly by staff, was expected to clean everything, alone."
bad,They we're reAlly not acceptable they don't wanna promote u and u work for pennies its sad I tried to reapply its under new management and they r worse!!!
bad,They we're reAlly not acceptable they don't wanna promote u and u work for pennies its sad I tried to reapply its under new management and they r worse!!!
bad,"Managers don't know how to work, no one takes the job seriously, everyday working there there was always an issue with the people i worked with. it was a place i hated to go too. so i left."
bad,I was lied to about how much I was getting paid. I was not trained at all and i was thrown into a job that i had no idea what i was doing. The people were rude.
bad,"Very poor management, long hours, stressful, rude customers, no recognition, short staffed, very fast paced, unfair break times if you even got one. Do not reccomend"
bad,"Wendys was stressful ! Constantly getting yelled at by management, and staff was always blamed for managements mistakes . While working at Wendy’s it was sued twice for lack of breaks giving to staff."
bad,I had the worst experience at Wendy's. there was poor management skills . Was hired full time was scheduled less than 20 hours . Always expected to come in to cover other people shifts . Managers there didn't even seem to care about the company or the customers
bad,"If you don't have a good manager, everything goes down the drain.  The only plus is that you are allowed one meal for free.  Problem is, you never get an actual break to eat said free meal."
bad,this place was not worth it yea it was good for a starting job but the crew were all stuck up snobs the managers stole from the store it was always a mess and gross
bad,The management was terrible already unorganized etc then the management shifted and got even worst the store manager had the worst personality and some of the ppl (person) for a time he had in charge was impossible what made my time there horrible
bad,No one really cared about there job. Management mostly messed around with the crew members and were not focused on there job. The store I worked at was dirty and no one cared.
bad,I really didn't like  working here because they had a lot  of favorites. The management team was very rude and disrespectful. They didn't show no respect to the regular employees.
bad,"A typical day at work at Wendy’s as the cook you’re gonna be standing at your station for a hour or more cooking burgers and chicken and fries and nuggets "
bad,i was always nigh shift working with the laziest managers at the time. I worked over a year but got a 10 cent raise. Was completely overlooked by the management on how i went out of my way to come in and help whenever we were short.
bad,"Isn’t a great place to work due to management & conworkers , HIGHLY stressful , unprofessional , rude & disrespectful, wouldn’t recommend working here"
bad,"The general manager is dating her boss, she’s disrespectful to everyone including customers. Two of the other managers, are beyond disrespectful to the staff. Most of them bully the staff, tell them how worthless they are. Really pathetic place to work."
bad,it was a stressful job and hard people to work with i did not enjoy it and wish i never worked there for almost a year but i did meet some nice people who i still talk tpo
bad,"I work for Wendys international for 8 years"
bad,"The general manager kept up too much and often told her business which was never work related. They didn’t have any benefits and the fact that this wasn’t my first job , the hourly pay was horrible. They was no proper training and “favoritism” was often shown a lot."
bad,"Lack of Communication between managers and crew members. Managers cutting hours down just for the tell of it. Morning crew takes responsibility over every shift. Wendy's is not a place o start off with. Crew members was never heard about , about any problems going on."
bad,This is a very competitive place to work but the team work is poor. Also the management is bad. They really should be more professional in the work environment.
bad,"the customers made this job pleasant and the most enjoyable part"
bad,A typical day for me started at 7am when the manager showed up on time if not u get to sit in parking lot till they show up I made salads did all the daily prep and made sandwiches through lunch I was the only sanwitch maker they had breaks was a joke
bad,"This work place is not the best to work for a new associate, as they have no decorum, nor do they have their employees' health and safety in their best interests."
bad,"Working here was not the best experience. No teamwork, chaotic environment every time I would go in. Luckily it was a temporary option because it was a draining environment."
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here at all, the management at my location was horrible & followed no rules/ unfair. The managers force people to work hard and show favoritism. The pay was nowhere near the work done."
bad,"You will be treated poorly by both management and customers.  Work up to two persons worth of job requirements on your shift, for half the pay of one.  "
bad,"Not work all the blood, burns and sweat you have to endure. People were quitting all the time. During their breaks they wouldn't show up so a lot of us were doing 2 or 3 jobs. The assistant manager is rude and yells at you. Everything is oily and you will go home smelling like French fries. "
bad,"Do not work at the northshore slidell location or haza foods period. No benifits ,Managment sucks,they have a history of not paying wages owed,overworked ,underpaid,staffing is always an issue due to turnovers because unhappy employees.this was the worst work experience ever over 10 years of management as a general Managment"
bad,"The management and employees was not professional . The opportunity is good for the moment , but if you are trying to get somewhere in life, this is not the job for you."
bad,"I started here at 16 and loved it until everyone was rude and disrespectful  to the customers "
bad,They show alot of favoritism toward alot of family members that work there the managers show npw responsible for there actions bur blame you for whats going on
bad,Management and customer service is awful they are very rude and orders are always getting handed out to the wrong people the management doesn't communicate with employees professionally.
bad,"worked me all day with no breaks and wouldn't let me leave despite me disagreeing to stay over on certain days. once worked 12 hours with no break just to go back to school the next day feeling sick and awful. definitely would not recommend. Also I got sick on the job one day and they refused to give me a break even then, making me work the rest of the day with vomit on my clothing."
bad,"the most unorganized place i have ever worked.....people got away with murder there and had no consequence for their actions.they never wanted to fix any of the equipment that was broke, just VERY bad upper management......dont care about their employees or mamangers"
bad,"wendys was a horrible place to work. the work space was beyond limited, the co-workers were not enjoyable, the management was poor, and customers were always rude."
bad,"I would go in, clean up behind other employees, get fussed out because my job wasnt spotless, Even though i would end up staying over to make sure it was. Did not help out when I was pregnant."
bad,The store that I work for has issues with engagement and communication. They do not know how to manage and they do not communicate with people. They have no cameras at the location I work at and I am almost positive that the managers are stealing.They cut all teenagers hours to 8 hours when we where promised full time.
bad,you work like a slave. they promate you then they try everything in the power if the gm dont like you to fire you! they saw you get a flex work week but u dont ! they make you work whatever they want. and if u need a day off they dont care !
bad,Nothing to look forward to.. They took away paid vacation time for employees who have worked so hard for them.. They are not well organized .they make you work hard for little money even if your a manager you dont make money at all
bad,I was over worked. There was no communication where I worked at.  They kept taking money out of my paycheck. Lack of people there also. No one would do their job right.
bad,"Umm, let's see low pay, noone can live on minimum wage, Horrible management noone seems to know how to properly train people, had touble with management illegally altering my times by putting in breaks that I've never took."
bad,Just wasnt a good job. They wouldnt let me do work and school at the same time. Worked over time to much with no ways home after a night shift. Couldnt take it anymore.
bad,I asked for help the mangers told me no I cashier all the time when I wanted to do something else no discounts I asked for a raise they told me no the manger were mean
bad,"back biting, nepotism, and managers that play favorites.  I was hired as a red shirt-step up for crew since i have experiences with food prep.  nepotism is rampant in this place because of the very low pay."
bad,Management engages in discrimination and racism. Favors applicants from their own country over Caucasian workers. No opportunity for advancement for white workers.
bad,"Needed a job, Wendy's was hiring.  Poor management, nothing is fresh, everything is a lie.  Scheduling is very inconsistent and very unsustainable and definitely not enough to pay bills."
bad,"It might've been my location, but working there literally made me want to die. Like, the managers were sketchy and rage schedule for the next week was never posted with enough notice. I couldn't have a life cause I didn't know when I'd work. And even then it wasn't consistent. They'd change it, not tell you, and then get mad when you didn't show up to when they changed it to."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that doesn't have patience, you deal with a lot of different types of people. Sometimes nice people, sometimes not so nice. If you can't handle a rude person almost every day, I wouldn't do it."
bad,I had a really great boss for my first 3 years then she left. After that I hated going to work and hated the entire atmosphere. After my favorite boss Left I should have quit too.
bad,"Managers are not all there, employees slack and constantly playing around. And the schedule  bounces around from getting hours to next week having no hours"
bad,This company is by far one the worst companies! They are very stingy and show absolutely no recognition for their employees. I have been there for four years and cannot wait to leave!
bad,"my personal experience was horrible, the managers picked favorites and if you were not one of them your hours would be cut drastically, there is no free food. it is a nasty place"
bad,I did not enjoy my time here at all and kept the job simply because i needed the money. I enjoyed the night crew and my night manager because they always made the work environment fun.
bad,"I just worked here to earn fast cash for a short period of time"
bad,"The management that Wendy's was very discriminatory. The general manager hired mainly family members, and had no issues talking about all the employees in front of guests and other employees. The standards at that place or very low they had never passed a safety or cleanliness inspection."
bad,was fired because i answered a customers question honestly. there food is out of date and they go in the general manager and changes them thats how her in house cost are so low.
bad,Wendy's is a job that only desires to break a great a manager down into a paper bag opener. I've worked a 10 hour shift consistently with no break and hardly any crew members. The store i worked at had no working equipment including the cooling equipment and grills. It was riddled with bugs and pests and nobody seemed to want to fix it. Terrible workload but decent pay if you are into that.
bad,good for teens and old people mini wage no benefits time off and no real way up the latter and they just want to make them self feel big by telling you they are your boss and better
bad,Managers are very rude. They talk about employees and always cause drama. Half the workers dont do all thier work but that's ok cause they are favored and  you have to do it.
bad,"At Wendy's I felt very overwhelmed, not because it was always busy but because I felt as though it was not worth it and putting up with the disrespect with both the customers and your co workers and managers was not wort it."
bad,I worked for this establishment for a few years. The one located next to UNCG. The management is rude and nasty and treat employees like animals. The attitude of the managers is atrocious and there seems to be no checks and balances in place. They do not offer more than 10 hours a week if you do not have kids. Those who have children get sonority and scheduling preference. A lot of workplace drama as they have dealings with one another outside of work that is carried into the workplace.
bad,"Terrible place to work. Not as bad as the army. But close. The manager is anti military. Disrespects them. Was always accused of taking money, even though they never were able to prove it and I was able to prove I didn't. You"
bad,i hated it at wendys it was the worst job i had and i had a good few jobs so far. working at wendys made me appreciate my previous job at dig inn and the staff
bad,"Management was very poor, ran by mostly teenagers. Very dis organized and disgusting facility. Non- sanitary and none caring. Every one on staff has an horrible attitude and lacks costumer service."
bad,"Managers was very disrespectful. Coming into work would be very stressful. There was mangers calling employees out there name, smoking in the work place, illegal things going on and more"
bad,"Not an enjoyable workplace, people get very frustrated with customizers and some co-workers cannot handle the fast food and fast pace environment and many end up quitting"
bad,"When Wendy's came to my town in 2003 give or take a year, they didn't last very long at all as with most businesses before and after that had tried to prevail in the same building and location. i believe it lasted less then a full year. My hours were from whenever till whenever on a daily base and management seemed to like to schedule everyone on a constant changing routine. I found myself 98% of the time not getting out of work until 1,2,3 in the morning after having already started work anywhere from open to whenever i was schedule, 5-7 days per week."
bad,Everyday there would be lack of management sometimes i would have to act like the manager and do manager things like solve customer problems because  the manager wouldn't want to resolve the problem with the customer.
bad,"I liked working at wendys but when a manager put her hands on me literally grabbed me and pushed me into the register , i was upset because i was embaressed because customers saw plus nobody does that and i knew i had to quit and i liked working there , and i was trying my best"
bad,It's over all trash dirty environment poor management over all disrespectful to not only customers and crew the food was poor because no one cares about the product being served properly
bad,this had a good people to work with but  certain managers sucked they really didn't work they had employee doing all the work while they sat in office all day
bad,"Wendy's gave me the opportunity to cook on the grill, make sundaes, use the cash register, meet new customers, learn the close out operation, what need to be done before closing."
bad,A typical date work is me being on the drive thru window and multitasking the drinks and the food ordering and sometimes even bagging food. Then when I am not busy I go do dishes or I stock my drive thru station.
bad,"Disrespectful staffing + management, horrible pay & nasty conditions as a restaurant health wise. Customers always come drunk & have thrown food at me & other employees. Nasty atmosphere, no clean nor sanitized. Horrible work place all around."
bad,I found working at Wendy's to be very stressful unfair and bias and racist the environment was hostile and managers tended to yell at the employees if we weren't working hard enough the lazy workers got more benefits then the hard working workers I would NOT recommend anyone to work there if you prefer racist environments and unfair pay Wendy's is the job for you
bad,lack of management and the team members were not friendly and not a good inviorment  and the hours were short they were sending people home because it was slow
bad,The Pay was horrible. At $8 an hour (and that was with manager expierence) one could not take care of their children. Schedule wasn't flexible at all.
bad,"The bosses are not as honest as they should be, they tell you one thing and then and go do another. The person who does the schedule ignores what you tell them when you say you can't work a certain shift. They schedule you for that shift anyways. The co workers are rude and slacking on their jobs. They would rather joke around talk about people behind their backs and just stand around."
bad,I took orders for front end Drive took the money for front and drive welcome to guests make sure that the lobby was clean and stocked with condiments including the drink machine which is one of those flavor Choice machines or freestyle machines make sure the bathrooms were clean and I made sure that all the customers had plenty to drink the orders were correct the tables were clean and they didn't need to get up for anything if they got up for something being wrong I had to correct it before they got to the counter
bad,"first off the pat is horrible and far below the cost of living , second the rate of speed at which you are forced to work is irate not to mention the heat in the workplace and lack of breaks"
bad,This is a decent place to work however there is not enough hours for the salary getting paid. Management was excellent if I needed something or something was wrong they fixed it almost immediately which is a huge thing for me.
bad,"I hope they have improved their business model for management since I worked there last, no flexible scheduling, low wages and no opportunities for advancement and no support from the company"
bad,"They could have better managment, and employees"
bad,Very low pay for what you have to do there. Not enough training to understand what is going on. Not enough employees on some shifts. The whole place needs to be updated.
bad,Wendy's is the worst job I ever had in my life the people I worked with was rude and full of drama they made working at wendy's nasty and uncomfortable.
bad,Managers there showed favoritism and let others do things that was not allowed by the average person they let staff also customers get any with everything
bad,They never had enough workers in there no one new ever was trained on there stations they were working on and the mangers were all mean and nasty real bossy and disrespectful
bad,Thier is no room for advancement..u don't. Get raises only food discount ..and the cashier's are always getting it from the customers cuz of companies rules and policies they need find better ways to protect the cashier from the complained by simply sending signs for customers can read and know thier has been changed made to the way they charge..example crackers .25 customers have a fit cuz it dosent say on the menu and who's fault is it the cashiers..
bad,Everybody in Wendys play to much the order get missed up the management is poor they always have attitude they just don’t care at that work place I will never work there again
bad,"I would not tell anyone to work for wendy'. the worst job you could ever get, and the mangers are just as bad as the job. If i knew what i know now..."
bad,Poor management and no communication people that call off get more hours then the ones that dont. The store is constinatly dirty homeless everywhere and no leadership whats so ever
bad,"the managers are always rude. they will get mad when you're new and they put you on something by yourself during the rushes and still go slow, but don't give any help."
bad,"Not the best work place, rude managers, and crew members, just overall a terrible place to work. If you like high school, you'll love this place, all the drama is the same. It's not a work place, its a baby sitting center."
bad,"It is a good job for students who are just beginning to work (High school and college students), It is also a good job for someone who might be between job but not necessarily a career."
bad,They are not kind. They do not care about their workers. this includes the workers who show up every day and work their butts off. The employees care about the customers.
bad,"This was basically my first job, and at first i loved it. Until management started going from bad to worse. The manager did not care about his employees, he had favorites and would never buy anything for the store because the less he spends the more bonuses he gets. I worked there for a year and 5 months and got a raise once. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE."
bad,"Very stressful. In order to make it through the day you have to have lots of patience, you have to be a people's person and you can not have a voice. This would be good for a teenage in high school trying to do all the high school activities."
bad,I learned nothing. I was paid minimum wage to be yelled at all day not only by the customers but by other crew members. Never got any of the days i requested off and was kept there sometimes two hours after my shift ended.
bad,working at wendys in kitty hawk isnt a good place to work they hiring tons of illegals who dont pay taxes and make more then the rest of us who do pay taxes .They brag that they dont have a social and make more then rest of us. management is poor also treat you horrible and claim to be illegal also i dont understand how they can do this.
bad,As any resturant job unless you really enjoy working it then fine but as far as moving up in the company good luck with that.so this job is fun and good for a while and while your in school but that's just it.
bad,No words can begin to express how degraded I had felt working close to slave hours and getting poor treatment from management on top of that just sad.
bad,"no one at this job would talk to me, or speak in english at all. there were signs posted from management asking employees to speak in english but no one followed this, not even the manger himself. I felt bullied constantly & never made friends here. I got in trouble for things that others never got in trouble for. bad management and no enforcement unless they don’t like you."
bad,"A typical day at wendys can be very stressful because of poor management and poor customer service skills within other employee. "
bad,"I worked at Wendy's for almost 2 years. I became an assistant manager in less than half of that time, however, the advancement stopped there. I only got paid 9.50 per hour. Hated that job"
bad,great place to work. certain giudlines are unfair to employees that the employees have no control over. very fast paced and compassionate employees ..
bad,"Poor management, just a bad work environment in general. It is a job though, so for first jobs go, it is what it is. You get to wear jeans and get 50% your entire meal though now. So cool if that is your thing"
bad,I had a falling out with a few managers who were mean to me and mean to other workers. The pay was very poor there. I would definitly not work there again.
bad,The area leaders are very disrespectful and its acceptable with HR and corporate leaders. The discipline is based on if your one of their groupies. This is in the Jacksonville Fl district!
bad,i worked night shifts and it had to be the worst experience.. one of my male coworkers physically abused me and all my direct manager did was transfer the man to another store.
bad,"All I can say is,if your looking for good quick money work here. Just don’t get involved in the drama stay to yourself and make your paper sis. Be kind to all the customers. They were my highlight. Individuality and love is what they excerpt when you give them kindness."
bad,This work enviorment is very stressful specially for someones first job. Very unorganized and filthy!!  I could never got back to this place regardless
bad,Management wasn't productive they had attitudes all the time for no reason completely distespectful they couldn't understand if u was I hired in car accident regardless I still had to work the staff was friendly and helpful but district mana get wasnt
bad,If you want the finer things in life and to feel appreciated then this is not the place for you. I was overworked and underpaid. I had to work holidays and missed out on a lot of family memories.
bad,I worked here for almost two months and Everytime I had to call out I made the minimum requirements. I called at least 2-3 hours ahead to let them kno. I had work excuses for everyday I had to miss out on work.
bad,Management wasn't to nice everything was not together as it should I would only work back there to help out as management not as a crew member I feel it really would be a great addition to the location.
bad,One of the worst jobs I've ever had. I feel under paid and over worked. There is no respect by other employees or managers. Hours are unfairly distributed. Stock is always low. Customers are unhappy. And the place is filthy.
bad,"I’ve worked for Wendy’s since I was 16, this being my first job is also my worst job. The management team is very unorganized, the crew member are extremely lazy and the work to pay ratio is insane. I do not reccomend"
bad,Unfair job including not enough hours. Unfair employees not improving qualifications for work. No benefits included or overtime. Having to work over the extented period of time and bo help
bad,i was young. first job. it was no fun at all. the managers were not nice to me. i felt like i was being picked on. i would not recommend any one to work there especially someone who is GROWN
bad,"i would work three different positions in one shift , it was very tiring. i also would close the store , and then be scheduled to work early the next morning during a rush . also i was always picking up other people's shifts . i didn't feel appreciated ."
bad,Stressful place to with bills to pay...the people are cool but not always...management has select favorites and with that being said there's no way to advance...every year they will find new ways to take back money and time you have earned and that's not fair.
bad,i hated working here. the management sucked. the food sucked. they all smoked weed. just a bad place to work. customers were rude. staff are all young idiot that dont know how to work.
bad,its was a good work place to start out after school and help but more in the store you see much more then what you really needed to see and after a long time the manager would not take the time to really show the new people how to be training  for a world wild company!
bad,"The first job I was able to get after being a stay at home mom for 8 yrs. Terrible management, pay is nothing, and customers treat you like dirt. Worst job I've ever had by far."
bad,"They don't care about employees, your disposable to them. My manager didn't care about me at all and gave everyone there volatile hours, everybody just felt like a number."
bad,"At the interview, the manager seemed very understanding and willing to work with anyone on anything. When I started working she quickly turned me away on training and having me learn other tasks besides basic cleaning and doing the dishes."
bad,Everyday  we were busy and i run a crew of 8 i made sure we gave  good quality service  and fresh food to our customers i learned how to run a shift while being busy taking care of  breaks  and taking care of post rushes i opened and closed shifts
bad,"Lack of management skills, no training, no raises, the managers were all mean, rude, snobby, unpleasant, disrespectful, lazy, did not want to help anyone or answer any questions."
bad,This review stuff is annoying. I dont like reviewing jobs because I have nothing nice to say about this company they dont pay their emplyees enough to even survive
bad,"•	Sandwich, Salad, and Drink Preparer"
bad,My advice dont work for them they are an awful company and treat they employees like garbage. You are part time  ut you work full time hours. No pto no 401k no benefits nothing.
bad,"Worked for Wendy’s in NY for almost three years.. got me through college, as the hours as really flexible. Here in NY, fast food workers get paid $1.35 more than minimum wage, so pay was OK.. I got as many or as little hours I as I wanted. Management was horrible, but what do you really expect from a fast food facility. A good first job or temporary job, wouldn’t recommend staying long. Most of my coworkers didn’t even have their highschool diploma, so customers automatically viewed me as scum, which is a horrible feeling."
bad,"I go to work, work and go home and then i would have to do the same dag on thing every single day that i would have to go into work and now honestly. I'm done"
bad,Management has taken a terrible turn. Management has a consistent attitude with employees. Constantly break rules but enforce them on others. Upper levels have not taken action to fix this issue.
bad,"I had to leave.  The manager was really awful. Ms.Kim. she talked to everybody in a disrespectful way even in front of customers , but tried to put on a front. I worked almost every single day because they were short of staff. It was stressful . I never received help while management yells at you to hurry up and cuss you out. Id never ever work again there."
bad,"The only way that you will make it in that company is if you sleep with Management and if you escalated anything against anyone with a management role, you were retaliated against and upper management would know about that sweep it under the rug."
bad,"The job was very fast paced and unprofessional. I would go in and have to jump on duty, because the managers were slacking. Sometimes, I would forget to clock in because they are so behind as I start my shift."
bad,The job lack job advancement the shifts are usually 8 hrs or more bit the pay is minium wage and u barley know when your going to get a raise. The variety pf people is very nice.
bad,Wendy's was an unprofessional job. The customers were rude. It's not worth the stress considering how much you're getting paid. you have to move at a fast pace.
bad,"When I worked there, there was one, maybe two, good managers on a team of 5. I hardly ever worked with them. Everyone hated being there, and was clearly doing it for the money. It stunk, grease burns hurt, and standing in front of a grill gets boring after the first 15 minutes. But, money is a necessary evil. Or so I hear."
bad,"A day at wendys is about how to deal with the worst possible siution you have ever been in and then multiply by cancer."
bad,"I would never would want to work for wendy's ever again.  No one there is experienced, all they hired was highschool kids that dont do there job for what they were hired for and I just got sick and tired of the drama and the rediculous lack of workers that doesn't want to do there job and expect me to do everything and I was like I don't think so Im not doing everyones job and I said to the manager on shift that I quit and I cant deal with all this and they expect me to do everything like honestly so I would never go back to work for wendy's"
bad,i would never work here again management isnt good at all and i wouldnt tell anyone to work here becuase they dont know what they want with people or what they want people to do
bad,I was an opener come in at eight prep put the sandwich station together made sure all the cookies and the fried food down and I also did the grill as far as the manager was concerned he did his job in the office really didn't come out untol5the store was about to open up. We had days were people was on the schedule and did not come on or if they did it was on there time
bad,"It was alright to start off, then the shift supervisors tried to take authority to a new level. They would be outside on the phone way over there break times causing us to run two positions at once!"
bad,"Management was a joke when I worked here. It was fast paced and often lost track of what I was doing because there's so many things going on at once. Some people are good at it but I wasn't, so it's not their fault."
bad,They have favorites and everyone knows they treat them better than all other employees. It also doesn't matter what hours you said you couldn't  work because they will still schedule you and expect you to come in . I had no reliable ride to work after 11am and past 10 which was told to them during my interview and they still scheduled me 5-10 and would get mad when I had no transportation there. They also threaten to fire me in front of other employees which isn't professional at all then still expected me to come in the next day and act like nothing was being said . In other words management is horrible and could use some help
bad,"Management there was poor and not worth my time. My general manager at the time accused me of doing drugs while she was high on the job or about to get high. The food there was not up to company standards, and because of this we had corporate in there every week. Now of course this is one Wendy's out of thousands so take this a just a warning that some are not in best of shapes"
bad,Working in fast food is fast paced and stressful. And you're only making minimum wage. Save wendys for high school and college students or those who need mother's hours.
bad,"Poorly ran company. HR department is a joke and only utilizes powers if they want to get rid of you or have to get rid of you. Poor management, no care given for the employees and the timer rules all. Anything else is second."
bad,"The job paid ok money and the work sucked. It was a fine job for the time being but pretty much all fast food jobs are not an ideal choice, I would not recommend working here. As the saying goes, Overworked and Underpaid."
bad,Working at wendys didnt fit for me too much standing around and stying in one location was just not for me. The wendys culture was great they really stand by great customer service and abide by that. Also great quality food products. Hardest part of the job was the customers and just the grace periods
bad,It was great to work but the way they treat you is horrible. When I first started out I was looked down upon because I didn't catch on to certain things as fast as they wanted me to.
bad,I did not enjoy working here. Almost all the mangers were ignorant. And as soon as you start with no experience they make you run back and forth to every location. Then give you trouble when your not filling the ice cause they told you to clean the dinning room. This was my experience but I'm sure some are fine
bad,Poor management. NO regards to availability. If you want a mature work place this is not the place.  A lot of employees treat it like a high school cafeteria. Worst experience of my life. Broke my toe and they would not allow me to work with crutches so I had to put pressure for 8 plus hours on a freshly broken toe.
bad,"i will absolutely never work here again"
bad,as i was working there no one liked me because they didn't want to teach any one what to do. they didn't care about costumer satisfaction they just wanted to go home.
bad,Wendys was nice if you like meeting interesting nice people. but when things get to hectic  it totally changes and everything goes bad. the work itself is easy.
bad,"great job for young kids just starting, it fast pace, slow hours. They'll learn how to work with customers from good to bad. Work with a lot of associates learn how to  communicate"
bad,The management team does not get paid well at all. You do not get paid vacation or sick time. Do not get sick or have an emergency nothing is more important than WORK. Even when your child is in the hospital for a month fighting for her life they will try to guilt you into coming into work.
bad,"Not all Wendy's are bad to work at... It was just at the location I worked at were I had a bad experience. This was back in 2015 and they  recently changed management in the location I worked at so it seems better, but I still wouldn't work there."
bad,I learned to be fast on my hands and also feet. The hardest part of the job was having to wake up at 6am to make it there at 7am and be ready to work.
bad,Working for this company as a hard workers you quickly see that you are just that! They tend to cater to mgrs that do not perform well but they chose to overlook the ones that go hard for the company. Short staffed always.
bad,They were unorganized and the manager was constantly being rude to the employees but some how we managed to deal with it.. My manager would tell me to take a break if I wasn't doing something right
bad,"Poor management, hazardous environment, filthy areas. The management is very verbally abusive, everyone is always on their phone, including management."
bad,The manager is very dull & very rude & disrespectful. Everything about this work experience was the worst experience ever. I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,Wendy’s is a horrible place to work at because the pay is low they make you work harder then most jobs  The management is horrible especially the district managers there are always eating food and being fat as well as being nasty to there  employee
bad,this job was my first job and my worst job not only was it fast paced and crowded all the time but the management was terrible and the hours were too much because it was always under staffed.
bad,this store was the most unclean place i have ever work for i was afraid to put my hands any where and i saw that when a inspection was coming around they knew before they came through the other store having to go through so they had time to fix and clean .but the most biggest problem was the electrical shortages
bad,"They had a terrible management and treated other employees better than others. They name called there employees as well and didn't provide a raise when they said they would. Couldn't manage a staff, nor a schedule. No benefits as well."
bad,"I wouldn’t advise anyone to work for Wendy’s,it’s the worst place I ever worked at in my life.you do so much and get paid so little th place is disguising the managers are rude"
bad,Management yelled at employees and didn't know how to handle People who were learning. This job Required a lot of energy and time without giving much back.
bad,"This has too be the absolute worst job I have ever had, nothing good came from and I went in debt because of it. Couldn’t pay bills or nothing. I do not recommend this job too anyone trying to pay bills."
bad,a typical work day at wendys was alway fast paced you don't ever really have time to relax your touching food all day and dealing with rude customers.
bad,really bad work environment bad at explaining my positions and what I should do I had to learn by watching my surrounding plus less attention for hard workers
bad,"Poor management ,lack of help expectation high for you not to know certain things give  little but oh hours . Not flexible with your schedule . Very inconvenient when it comes to others ."
bad,"in my experience at working with Wendy's, I noticed favoritism among the managers and crew members. They scheduled people to work by their relationship with them and not by how hard they worked."
bad,A day at work was nothing but a struggle. People didn't come to work. I go to school at night & I always late to my classes because i had to stay. The management could be much better.
bad,You are expected to perform jobs that you weren't trained for. You are never given pay raises. Shift managers get paid $1/hr than regular team members. You are expected to do hard physical labor inside and outside. You get half off of one meal during each shift. The opportunities to advance are minimal at best. Your shifts are not consistent and they don't care about your personal life or if you're able to work assigned shifts. Don't work for Wendys unless it is your LAST option.
bad,i did not enjoy working here. the management was was very poor ans there was a lack of leadership.i left the job because i was moving but i probably would have quit anyway.
bad,"Management was not up to par, it wasn't sanitary, and also wasn't not a good working environment because it was very unprofessional , I honestly wouldn't recommend"
bad,Working for Wendy's as a whole from my experience has a highly dramatic work life with employees having disagreements and liking towards one another. During my time of employment there I felt I was back in a high school to middle school social setting
bad,"Never work here. I would never suggest anyone to work here. I was singled out for pointing out problems my manager ignored and lost more hours every week. This place does not care about their employees. I attempted to go over my general manager's head like many other employees had as well, but was completely ignored."
bad,Horrible management even when offered a management spot managers did there best to make sure training never happened so it secured their position in management.
bad,work there could be good if the management was so favortism about some employees and mean to others  thae hardest thing about working there is dealing with lazy manament
bad,"It was an okay working environment, it was good for beginners.The work place culture was fun and upbeat, I enjoyed the fast pace of the job. Good for beginners looking to get their foot in the door"
bad,management is terrible. they will get on you for everything. get out of everyone’s way cause there’s favoritism. do what you are “supposed” to do. and never say what you think.
bad,Wendys Is An Ok Company To Work For You Just Have To How To Deal With Disrespect Customers And Co-Workers The Managers Care Some Times abut Most Of The Time You’re Pretty Much On Your Own
bad,teribe place to work for extriemly teribel when it come to the sanitary part lazy emploiees always waiting to see if some body elese is going to do it ordeal it got to where I was afraid to touch anything with out using gloves all around the store  I was even more concern for the customer .and the maintenance was ajoke the whole time I was there the electrical wire's where exposed to the point of kicking the breaker but nobody cared .
bad,I had a terrible experience working here.  The management was rude and did not care about their employees.  I would not recommend this place to job seekers.
bad,there was no self discipline in the work area even though it was fun to work there there wasn't no control in the schedules crew members was coming in and doing whab they wanted to do
bad,The managers didn't act like managers. The crew never listened. And everybody brought there personal life to the work place. Nobody was ever on time. Everybody called in alot. Everybody was late on there break. We didn't even get paid breaks
bad,"This job was terrible. Management was horrible, work was strenuous and fast paced, NO BREAKS, and half the time when you are scheduled to work you are called by the manager on duty and told not to come in because of being overstaffed. Yet they continue to hire more employees and have each employee running 2-3 positions at once."
bad,They had very terrible customer service and management they managers used to cuss out the staff and correct them infront of customers when they should be doing it in private !
bad,"Its slow, you learn more about the company as the day goes on. The management isn't that good, its poor. I would say its a good culture to work in.I wouldn't say there is a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part is making the customers happy."
bad,the staff there were unfriendly and unprofessional and the place was not as clean as it should have been and the general manager had a lack of interest in the company
bad,Was very slow-paced even though there was alot of customers. The management was terrible and the crew members stole constantly from the store by taking breaks and stealing food without permission. Overall just a terrible place to work.
bad,I had terrible times at wendys through being there for almost 3 years. The management made fun of me and my disability. I was poorly treated until my last month at wendy's. I learned alot about fast food and how to count drawers and properly train new employees
bad,once the company was bought out the management didn't care about the staff the subordinate managers they only cared about GM and DM they didn't care if we work short handed or even if we where sick all they want was us to make money for them never did they say thank you
bad,This is not a great place to work. If you need a part time job for 10 dollars an hour and don't like set schedule this is the place for you. Management needs to be better
bad,"Not the worst place for a first job"
bad,There was no room to move up in the company. Management is horrible because they are so stressed out due to upper management. When raises came in it was only like ten cents. Too much work for too little pay.
bad,"This was one of the worst work experiences of my life. While the crew was great to be around, the management was rude and disrespectful. I would never wish this job on my worst enemy."
bad,"The workers would be friendly, but i had an issue with employers stealing money from me.  Management did not seem to care. If you work here, make sure your manager actually cares about their employers."
bad,"It was very stressful, company had little concern with school schedule, horrible culture, irresponsible and lazy management, improper customer service,and lack of motivation"
bad,"It was okay. It was a good experience and my first job. I do not like fast food as a job personally. Fast paste, lack of good management, and rude people."
bad,It started off pretty well at the beginning of the job but there wasn't much teamwork. Everyone wasn't moving at the same pace. There was too much dependability on one person and it wasn't a very good place to work. The working conditions were horrible. Not enough ventilation from the vents.
bad,Lack of work ethic. Was a bad time and had crummy management. I wouldn't recommend it at all. It was a wasted time on my part. I tried hard and worked hard to grow there but wasn't advanced
bad,Poor management hard work is never rewarded only mangers favorites are people get paid that you never see working hours are cut to nothing you end up doing a multi task of different positions because some workers like the drive to do their jobs mangement preference is towards having minors in Work place even with hours they are not allowed to work
bad,They will say what you want to hear to get you to work for them. They told me if i went out of my way to travel all the way from Ogden to kaysville i would get to move to store of my choice which never happened.
bad,Not a good place to work. horrible management skills. If you are looking for a first job I would not recommend this to you. do not have any type of compassion for their employees.
bad,It was a a horrible Job in my opinion. It was a everyday job. It was not a hard job at all. The job requires a lot of paying attention too and physical work.  .
bad,"Difficult work environment. Lack of management support. Horrible training. When I first started working there, they didn't even train me to do anything and it was my first job, I had no idea what I was doing. A lot of gossiping and drama, everyone was negative all the time and always rude to the customers. Managers wouldn't even put on gloves to make the food. I worked at the one on 70 and I would NEVER, EVER recommend this place to work at to ANYONE. It was a nightmare."
bad,"when I started working here they had me in the back room watching videos of how to work the dishwasher etc. That took about almost two weeks then I moved on to working the fryer, frying the fries and chicken nuggets handing them to the people who worked the drive thru. then right before I left they started me on the cash register which was very confusing. If you are looking for a much that doesn't may much but requires a lot of work then this is the job for you"
bad,Eveyone one was doing there own thing but me I was forced to do everything with my shoulder out of socket and felling like I was bout to go into a seizure. Wendys DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THERE EMPLOYEES AND I NEVER HAD ANY TYPE OF BREAKS AND I DONE OPEN TO CLOSE EVERYNIGHT DO TO LACK OD EMPLOYEES. The store I worked at had messed up plumbing grease caked up everywhere the frier basket was caked up its nasty.
bad,"Need better management, manager steal out of draws and expect the employee to pay it back..."
bad,managers were very impulsive. they never let me work in the kitchen properly and they always made me do floors and washroom for them. they were so rude and are not even understanding.
bad,Great place to work overall. The customers are super friendly and your coworkers are amazing. Management are very flexible with hours and are great. Great place to work!
bad,I learned nothing there the management was not very good and neither was their employes it was not a safe environment to be in. it was fast pace and competitive
bad,"Mangement: force male employees to fetch items, open jars, lift objects for MGRs and female employees. (Discriminatory Practices)! Hiring female employees for just register and sandwiches. Male employees must run grill or fries unless there is not a female to run register. "
bad,Manager couldn't train me well.  I was so unprepared for the work day.  Only worked like two days a week and couldn't keep up with how busy it got.  it was bad
bad,"At the specific location I worked at, the management was awful. They took me off of the schedule due to a rumor that was not true that I was looking for a new job. When they confronted me, they were very rude and disrespectful."
bad,"Worst place to ever work, but it is a great place to start your first job. Very nasty and employees are very rude to both eah other and customers as well"
bad,"The upper management was nearly nonexistent at Wendy's. The training system took exceptionally long to complete and was barely applicable in many cases when actually on the job. Weekly schedules were cryptic and were more often than not late, leaving it up to the on duty shift managers to call in employees for Sunday and Monday. Aside from the highschool students passing through, there is a group of long time employees that make the workplace somewhat hostile to anyone that does not immediately take to a new task. The only reasonably good thing about working here is the shift managers, which do their job rather well and are all great to work with."
bad,This place doesn't pay well. For the work they expect from you.  You could be there day and night and still would make a good check.  First and for most even if they paid you right away it took me a month to get my first check
bad,"Made sandwich "
bad,"Effectively communicated with kitchen staff regarding customer allergies, dietary needs and other special requests."
bad,"Working for this company could been very few hours, or several hours without break-time. Customers can often be hostile. Managers are often under tons of stress, and they often pass that dress downward."
bad,DO NOT WORK THERE the manager treats the crew like dirt on the ground and favors some over others          he is mean they don't appreciate anyone or anything that's done for them
bad,I would not reccomend. Always overstaffed so you do not get to work the hours your job said you would be working. Not a very good environment. Would only consider good if it were used as a 2nd or 3rd job along side a real job.
bad,"great job for teenagers. fresh beef never frozen, too much salt on fries.  need to train the managers better,inexperienced kids trying to run a restaurant . thanks"
bad,Poor people skills not very clean horrible managment poor hours poor staffing not the right amount of people at once to much on one persons work shift
bad,The way the managers cared for their employees or lack thereof was unacceptable. It's honestly not worth your time unless you are still in highschool but even then I highly recommend a retail position retail anywhere else. I should probably add no one ever wore gloves or washed their hands.
bad,"hours are very long usually 65 hours per week. staffing is always in issue as their is never enough crew members to actually run the store properly. "
bad,working at Wendy's was not fun for me at all. The manager had a hard time understanding I was still in high school and couldn't work late night shifts. They don't help you improve and you will forever stay in the same position. The only people that get promotions and raises are managers.
bad,I didnt get enough hours and lack of mangement and poor santiry.i dont know what eles to say aboit this job.really didnt like it much. Mangement was not there most of the time.
bad,i worked there for two months and hated every moment of it. worse thing i had to do was lay on the floor and clean places that had not been cleaned in months.
bad,"It is fast paced environment, it's hot, the customers are terrible, and management is a joke. I was a night worker and we never got any breaks. If it was a slow night, it was laid back. But if it was a busy night you could be working a full 11 to 12 hour shift, NO BREAK. My GM ignored the terrible conduct of one of the shift managers, that manager basically just yelled at everyone. Everybody was complaining about that manager. The GM did nothing. Before I left I was in training to be a manager. The GM did nothing. I taught myself and was basically working as a manager but without the pay raise. They really can drag their feet on that."
bad,My experience there was okay. There is a couple of things the company needs to improve. The management was fair. My work schedule was perfect. My manager made sure my schedule was perfect for me.
bad,"It is not the ideal environment to work in. They make you do shifts which you are not rostered for. After telling them specific shifts i can and can not do, they still gave me those shifts after agreeing to my conditions."
bad,"nobody in wendys was really prepared they didint properly train the employees., they didnt properly clean up like they were told and the managers are very disrespectful"
bad,The management towards employees were unacceptable. Managers used their title for power. The managers treated each employee differently. They had their picks of who they liked and dislike.
bad,"it opened my eyes to just how bad a company could be.  I worked for a franchise based out of South Carolina ans most of their locations were in Georgia, that should say it all"
bad,disagreement with ex co worker and the manager I don't like how they try to be so over controlling so unprofessional I was a sandwich maker and the sandwich trainer she fuss me about something so pity.
bad,management was not good. the store doesn't help with scheduling. they make u work some of the worst hours. management helps themselves to hours without anyone else thoughts.
bad,"The management is horrible.  None the less, word got out that 3 of the 4 managers decided to screw in the walk-in. I was disgusted by this place.  The hours are horrible, yes they are flexible but only to the point of where if they need you you HAVE too come in or you HAVE to stay longer when you were supposed to get off 2 hours ago."
bad,"The crew and managers were ok, pay sucked and got paid every 2 weeks which is insane. Great 1st job for a teen, but as an adult it does not pay the bills. Almost impossible to get 40 hours a week because they got way too many people."
bad,They're very rude and they don't know how to speak to their employees. I've worked for better companies. Feel like half the people working there didn't really want to be there.
bad,"Nothing to say, the job was a complete bust - I am half deaf and I was placed on window with no window training and was expected to know it all and keep the pace, I was also only trained for 15 minutes and the mangement sat in office all day"
bad,shift managers are cruel and rude you have to beg for hours if your absent and even come back with a doctors excuse they cut your hours location is route 60 huntington wv
bad,Started off as a fun/ good job at first but drastically went downhill. Management hasn’t been so great since our last but hopefully the newer one brings things back to life.
bad,"Well a typical day at work would be the managers making sure that everybody is not just standing around doing nothing and to be cleaning making sure the place looks nice. What I have learned about the company is that I'm a people person never that I was until I came across a fast food restaurant. So management; well they are not nice if that's what your asking and they do not really care about emploeyes feelings at all, and really just don't want to here things about harassment in there building so they don't want to hear it so they don't need to do anything about it."
bad,workers are lazy managers dont know how to treat customers pay sucks the environment is so distasteful everybody is always mad drunk or high management lacks responsibility.
bad,Serve old food & managers won't help you with anything close to late low pay hardest part is the cleaning the day people doesn't clean after themselves so night people have extra cleaning
bad,The Wendys I worked at did not have very good management. Certain employees were treated less than ideal. The managers did not know how to communicate with each other and they did not know what they were doing.
bad,"Working here was the worst job I've ever had. Not only was management never reliable, they never took the time to train me. "
bad,i worked at wendys for a short time the people there didn't make me feel welcomed there so I found me another job where I felt welcomed. I really didn't enjoy my time working here.
bad,The management wasn’t so good and my schedule was all over the place it was horrible. I wouldn’t want to work at any other Wendy’s again just from my experience.
bad,"first time employment, if necessary.  Last ditch effort for employment..............................................................................................................Not a good job for someone with any work experience, just for kids, and whoever can put up with the manager."
bad,It was in amazing experience and I'm happy that I got to experience working there it's amazing people that work there in the managers that helped out.
bad,My managers didn't manage. they were on vacation every other week and didn't want to train anyone for anything other than what the thought they were best at
bad,High stress cut throat work environment for managers and they are short handed and expect you to work 80 hours or more .  They do not do raises on a consistant basis.
bad,management is awful if they werent yelling at you they were bullshitting around. the pay sucks. and everyone is always causing drama. id rather work anywhere than there
bad,A typical day at work included dealing with rude managers that would scream at the employees. I wasn't trained for any position and I had to teach myself all of the positions
bad,Poor management made me leave. They were TOO rude and ugly. People were never on time or ready. It was horrible and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone ever.
bad,"Poor place to work, too much drama, low pay, the work you do there isn't appreciated, not much teamwork, everyone gets too butt hurt about the littlest things,"
bad,No help. Very poor customer service and employees. Bad supervisor as well. Team sucked. Poor hourly rate no overtime and no raises with no benefits or paid time off.
bad,Since Starboard took over the franchise everything went to heck. A lot of staff quit due to Starboard being cheap and limiting scheduled hours to avoid having to offer health insurance. Labor and food cost percentage goals were unrealistic. The company also refused to fix broken equipment on a timely manner and they have a bad reputation for not paying their bills.
bad,everyone doesn't work well together the second one thing goes wrong they all point there fingers at someone else unprofessional work environment poor management
bad,"Wendy's is a great place to work for high school kids and college kids. Its not a place you want to work as a career, being that it can be very stressful at times and most cases they only care about the customer and have no problem letting you go over a customer complaint, which is unfair."
bad,"Great first time job, but not for someone looking for a career. Customer service skills gained and time management needed to be sucessful in this job field."
bad,a typical day work is very stressful.I feel as though i did learn a lot about customer service.the management can be rude to sometimes and don't care about you.The hardest part of the job is working with difficult customers.the most enjoyable is seeing your coworkers.
bad,People were to harsh and the manager was not at all helpful in a nice way. Wasn't balanced or even conducted right. Drive through was always slow and breaks real short.
bad,That's all I can say about working there. The hours were horrible. The pay was even worse. Working 50+ hours a week for 9.10 an hr on a manager salary is not worth it at all!
bad,Too much work for too little pay. I have worked for wendy's for over 2 and a half years and have only received a five cent raise once. I was never looked at for promotion even though I am one of the star employees. The managers played favorites and would go back on their word.
bad,"managers yelled to employees infront of customers, the whole staff is rude to employees and customers, will never work here again. had to many problems"
bad,Wendy's is a fast food resturant and i dont encourage people to work here. You bust your butt off just to get paid $7.25. It is a lot of work to do just as a cashier. Management is all over the place. Only enjoyable thing about this job is the food.
bad,Absolutely no team work or proper management poor enviroment rude lazy coworkers and unfit managers Cordova TN location to be exact everything was thrown together and customers werent valued very unprofessional environment.
bad,Wasn't the fast food type it was too fast paced poor management lack of employees loud environment constant yelling free drinks though good high school job but not to pay rent
bad,"Unprofessional, not one single thing positive I can say about working there. Poor management & unsafe work environment with no benefits at all. Construction work is more tolerable."
bad,"Worst place ever to work. Bad hours, management refuses to take into account of family life. Low pay, no raises, lucky to get 10 hours a week.  Management doesn't know what they are doing."
bad,"Management is beyond careless. They shorted my hours multiple times, changed my shifts without telling me, they put their place of work above anything and anyone who works for them, and they are a completely selfish company who does not care about their employees."
bad,"typical day was so stressful until I had to smoke to take a break."
bad,"Very unorganized, not enough employees, Pay is too low for expectations"
bad,i worked alot of hours and i was told i would be manager and i never got my chance . i felt they took advantage of me . wendys only wanted you to do what they wanted but when it came down to it no one would be considtere of what you needed as a staff member
bad,the whole job was a joke the manager was younger than me i knew how to do everything in the store that the manager didnt it was just a lot of young kids in there working
bad,"Working at Wendy's was not a good experience. They didn't pay good.The work was very irritating. The managers wasn't very nice to me.     "
bad,HORRIBLE place to work for. Upper management extremely rude and very demeaning towards employees. Lack of job security and also job training. Treated you like dirt if you didn’t do what they wanted.
bad,"I've worked at Wendy's for about a year now and it wasn't fun or easy. We were constantly short people, we never had enough people working,  they never respect how we feel and the management literally only cares about making money and nothing else."
bad,"worst place to work for, no advancements, you always promised to move up, but nothing happened. the general manager has her favorites, to get a raise. even if u do give 110% no chance"
bad,The management never got along and it caused problems for crew members. The GM overrode all of the supervisor's directions and it made the day horrible. Try not to work there.
bad,This place is not the best place to work because the food was and is bad the people that work their all they do is fight at each other not a place I would let my kids work at.
bad,"I would never reccomend Wendys to anyone to work for, they are horrible with giving out hours, the management team there is a joke, no one gets along... everyone is stuck up their own butt and think they can do no wrong. Overall I wish I never worked there."
bad,"This type of job is one of a teenager. The work pace is really fast and it is not worth it in the end. Fast food jobs are very much underestimated. The pay is not good at all, which is to be expected."
bad,"I worked here only for the need for money at the time to pay for groceries and my car insurance, though it rarely covered that. Work days were extremely stressful, and no one ever received a break. Work days were always much longer than scheduled. A very tiring, underpaid job."
bad,"The management and partners that own the store I work at could care less whether you live or die. It's all about the bottom line, they have forgotten who works their butts off so they can get that bottom line. I would seriously not recommend anyone to work for this company."
bad,The company is poorly run understaffed they do not care about there employees and there employees are not recognized for the work they do. Management does not care
bad,long hours and unappreciation. training suxs and attitude from upper management is awful. This is the worst place to work for and will never return. Nothing enjoyable at all.
bad,"its a good place to work temporarily very clean worked there for a year still was ""in training"" good management organized lots of hours to offer liked working the night shifts"
bad,"Fast food can be bad, but Wendy's will use you until your sick, treat you terribly and pay you like trash. I couldn't recommend working at this establishment for anyone, they turn over like 3 employees a week for a reason."
bad,"I have been working here for nearly 6 months now and have been met with non stop drama, inconsistent hours. Plus the lack of managers or management change has been brutal for us, the amount of minors that work at the Wendy’s is brutal at the most."
bad,The management is not the best and they take advantage of employees. The customers are wonderful. The manager does not give enough hours to the employees that want the extra hours.
bad,Very bad place to work especially if it is your first job. They expect you to do everything and know everything about a fast food restaurant. Some of the managers just don't care about their employees and their health and safety.
bad,This place was the worst job I've ever had. They do not care about you going to school in fact they completely discouraged it. I gave them my hours of availability and they ignored it.
bad,"I was verbally abused my entire time by all the upper management."
bad,"stressful work environment ,lack of communication,i feel like its not enough hours,and I'm looking for something better with fast growing company in which i will obtain a career."
bad,"This job was boring after a month and you had to put up with others that were lazy at work, and the other workers where not willing to work hard all the time."
bad,"This place is poorly managed and needs some big improvements. "
bad,It started out okay but then my manager started giving me less and less hours. She was extremely unorganized and rude. I had to work with racist people. It truly sucked but I'm pretty sure the b*tch retired so maybe working there now wouldn't be so bad.
bad,They were not friendly. Horrible customer service. Managers were not doing their jobs. Customers were not satisfied. I would not recommend Wendy's on  freedom to be a good job
bad,i did jobs i wasn't suppose to when i worked there. the management was horrible and they expected too much out of the workers. too stressful. i wont work there agian
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's was setting up the store for business, running the daily operations, then closing the store. I was in charge of cash deposits, inventory, food prep, and employee management."
bad,The manager and owner are both rude and are not considerate at all. They do not care about schedules and are not helpful with personal issues. The coworkers are all rude.
bad,Wendy's was fair at first til I work six months it became a problem cause the members would disrespect me and disrespect others including managers the couldn't keep in place and made managers quit.
bad,they are willing to work around your school schedule or any circumstances that may arise       but it has too much favoritism going on in that place    its not structured      too many that do not have to pull their weight while the others have to do more than their share    they don't want to give raises   its like pulling teeth to get one  no matter how long you have worked there     its good to work for a short term job to just get extra money   but no advancement or payraise if youre looking for that
bad,Mucha hostilidad de parte de los jefes a cargo y trabajadores.
bad,i get things set up and ready for lunch.i learned alot like how stuff works what to do and what not to do some of the managers was ok i guess the hardest part of my job is the customers the most enjoyable was my off days..
bad,"The only thing I can say about that place is that I gained cashier experience. I honestly wouldn't go back to Wendy's. My first day, they put me on the register like I was suppose to know exactly what to do. The managers would get angry if I asked too many questions."
bad,I wouldn't recommend someone to Wendy's if they don't like being yelled at and called names. Some of the managers are horrible and they give no respect at all.
bad,The absolute worst company I ever worked for the first time. I assumed it was just the manager I had and worked at a different location a few years later and it was the same way. Very poorly ran in the southwest Missouri area.
bad,This company is a mess. The equipment is poor and constantly malfunctioning. The management team is poorly trained and very inadequate. Its like a giant highschool.
bad,I will never work at Wendy's in Marion va. I'm a single mom trying to make it and at Wendy's I feel I was treated poorly. to many chefs not enough Indians
bad,"Working at Wendy's was a horrible experience for me. The owner was rude, her managers were rude they weren't professional in there at all. I am truly glad that I no longer work for that company"
bad,I would never work there again. The job isn't worth it because you make terrible money and deal with rude people all day and the management and staff were terrible!
bad,Management is horrible people keep leaving. Get no breaks. Short staffed due to management. Several complaints daily in attitudes from.employees and management.
bad,"Not productive,and the crew and management is very unprofessional. OK I earned a $200 bonus my first 3 month the 2nd bonus was taken from me because it was issued late. The GM claimed I was rude to a customer but if the bonus had been issued on time I would've already had it and they couldn't have taken it therefore I feel I was entitled to it. But their so unprofessional nothing is ever done right."
bad,Poor training horrible place to work.  People constantly calling into work.  Was just in a bad location over all.  Upper management did not come in to help if you were short handed
bad,"The managers here at my location do know how to manage labor, their employees, cash registers, nor their customers. One of the managers (new) decides that in the middle of a huge rush when his crew and fellow managers need him to go and eat a frosty in the break room. They do not treat fellow employees with respect, everybody has an attitude towards their customers and fellow co-workers. The list can go on."
bad,general manager was on a dating website with hiring manager while on the clock and cooked her own lasagna with wendys hamburger meat. Never helped out her crew when we needed help
bad,from management down to the employee's the culture there is no loyalty or team work at all. the GM's do next to nothing about the store other than work on drive time for bonus. good first job for learning how one does not want to b treated.
bad,Not a good place to work. Can't wait to leave. Maybe another location would be better but not the one I was at.  The management only promotes and hires friends and relatives that don't work well and then blame everybody else for things not done.
bad,Was sexually harassed the whole time I was there by a employee who still works there. I will never work at another Wendy's as long as I live. And I'll never recommend any friends to work there either.
bad,"Very unorganized. Rude employees. Don't get paid enough for full time $8 an hour. Needs to be cleaned. They have to many kids that don't do anything, but they don't do good training with the workers either, more figure it out yourself or leave. No team work."
bad,All Management is a disgrace. Awful and unrealistic goals and expectations for employees. Management treat employees unfairly and in a disrespectful manner.
bad,"manager played favorites, inconsistent hours, stressful work situation, manager will be bias with you if you decided to be more focused on school, unhealthy work environment"
bad,Average fast food joint has no concern for employees wellbeing or needs. Only thing that matters is sales. No benefits minimum wage job. Not worth wasting time on.
bad,"I was terminated do to false claims; meanwhile the manager that fired me sexually harasses underage employees, threatens employees, instigates problems with the employees, locks employees out then clocks them out... all the managers know of everything that this one manager has done but neglect to do anything about it, it's just a bad work environment for not anough pay."
bad,I never like working at wendy's due of nasty working place. Crowded place and dirty floor. Associates never clean their hands. Manager are too rude. Its not good to work there.
bad,Nobody ever trained me but had me training other people I would come in early and leave late and not get counted for the extra hours I worked only would give me 1 15 minute break for a 8 hour shift sometimes I wouldn't even get that.
bad,"poor management, dirty restaurant, bad service, this was by far one of the worst places I ever worked. if I had any other option at the time I wouldn't have even chosen to work there"
bad,"Very poor management. They don't work with your college schedule. They want you to focus on only wenyd's instead of being proud and happy that you are going to college to help better yourself. The managers only care about ""numbers and sales"" instead of the hard working employees who make it happen."
bad,Managers were never nice you can tell they came to work for drama no one was willing to here there employees out and Wendy's was very nasty in the inside I've seen some things thereb
bad,I did not like working for Wendy's . I never got a raise like I was suppose to. We weren't trained properly . When we asked for help the managers would act as if they couldn't hear us .
bad,My coworkers were extremely disrespectful. The managers were so rude to me and treated me indifferently. I don't recommend working there. I feel discriminated.
bad,The staff is very disrespectful to the customers as far as conversation between each other and screaming curse words so loud that customers can hear them. The managers are extremely rude to new employees. And they do not do proper training.
bad,This job is very stressful management doesn't want to help the crew and expects the crew to do so much for such little pay . They would rather over work you than give you a pay raise for the hard work
bad,"The job was very stressful, with low pay. Sometimes we did not have enough employee for the shift. As well we did not get raises, or offered any health care coverage."
bad,Working at Wendys is very tough. There's to much work for little pay. As a manager there's to much regular employee work you have to do. Your work hours are all over the place. Overall it can be a nice environment to work but in a quick second work will get very hectic and stressful.
bad,"Poor management, horrible enviornment. Really bad. Not fair. Good people but they run the business really poorly. Good food as well. Real beef and chicken."
bad,Worked here for several years. No appreciation towards their employees. Very rude!! And cruel!! Poor and very dirty environment. Roaches everywhere poor cleaning
bad,"It sucked, most of the managers there are very fun to work with. The general manager is a terrible person, she acts as if she cant compromise on anybody's schedule except for her stepdaughter. Which is so unfair to everyone who works there, there is so much favoritism its not even funny."
bad,"A typical day at wendy's was going to work at 6 a.m., Cleaning, Opening, Getting yelled at for things you had no control over, Cleaning some more, Arguing over who went on break first, Being treated like a lower life form by customers, co-workers, and supervisors. Management always had some crisis happening that was for some reason everyone else's fault. The hardest parts of the job were taking mental abuse from my manager and customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was cleaning the freezer door because I could channel all of my irritations and OCD into getting that door sparkling clean."
bad,"I was honestly just looking for a skip button because I really don't remember what it was like working here.."
bad,I left this company because i was undergoing harassment. When i brought it to the attention of a corporate manager i was ignored so i left this company and i insist i will never go back.
bad,"*Lacks training to new employees"
bad,If you're looking for a first job this is it but it's gunna be terrible. Managers are terrible and expect you to do everything at once and know what to do without training you.
bad,It was like I was in my worst nightmare. It was a lot of drama there. The managers was selfish and ignorant. They didn't care about No one but theirselves.
bad,I worked here only to have the management completely disrespect me and coworkers by calling them profanity and yelling asking if individuals was stupid
bad,"Go in to night shift around 6 cook all the food clean the storage area and kitchen, after the store closes make sure all the food was properly put away then I would clean the lobby and bathrooms."
bad,This job would be very stressful at times. The employees was fun to work with but the job itself was just because I needed something to help support myself.
bad,I would never recommend Wendy's to anyone. The people I worked with were horrible. The management was horrible. The food is horrible. I did not like working there.
bad,This company is just not for me. They don't appreciate you at all or acknowledge all the hard work and dedication you've done gave them. They don't won't to give you a raise and if they do it don't be nothing.
bad,do not apply here. you deal with idiots and you get paid minimum wage. its really dumb and they make everything hard for no reason at alllll. its not worth the time or money.
bad,It's okay it's as about okay as fast food can get but yet still fast food and that sucks but I mean for a teen it's great but all that's there is teenagers really
bad,horrible . the employees and managers were very rude to employees and customers. was created unfairly and very poorly. I would not recommend for anyone.
bad,The managers are horrible and the building was disgusting. Roaches and bugs were constantly present. I would not recommend this job at this specific location.
bad,The hardest part of the job was dealing with the people and management. after working here i never would like to work in a fast food place again. I think the CEO of Wendys should really look into that one.
bad,"Managers are rude,very unhelpful, not nice. Its very challenging no one wants to teach you properly so you find out for yourself. There's no order.  You might be accused of stealing. Get yelled at for not doing certain things right and then no one telling you how to do it correctly."
bad,"The mangers are the very rude to you if you do one thing wrong. They don't give you any raises when it's legally due. If you work there be prepared to work the whole restaurant all by yourself while everyone goes on break at the same time. If you are working 8 hour shifts, they do not let you have a break. They will refuse it"
bad,"Just trust me you dont want to work here, dont have your child work here either, they truly will not care about you. if you need a job go somewhere that will truly care!"
bad,"Wendy's was a good place to work at, and to get hands on to thing's. The easy part about this job was being able to do the work. The hardest part is how to deal with complaints."
bad,Wendy's was just like every other minimum wage paying job. The environment wasn't happy based on the feeling that no one wanted to be there. The worst part about the job is when we would get into a rush of customers people would give up on trying to complete orders
bad,"A typical day at work for me was getting yelled at by certain managers, and being pulled away from taking care of a customer to do whatever they want me to do. They expect you to know how to do everything within 3 days of working there. Some managers did not care about their employees or how they treated them."
bad,"I get little to no hours, the management favorites other people. It was a fun job when I started, but they haven't lived up to what they said they would do for me."
bad,"A typical day at wendys was stress filled and annoying especially if you work in a busy area. everything s rushed, some managers try to play with your hours, and feelings."
bad,If you are a great worked they take advantage of what you have to offer. no balance. Tough to request days off. learned a lot about customer service and the ins and outs of fast food.
bad,"Fast food business is a hard business, its very tiring for little pay. Management is poor and stressful while moral is always down and training is not well done."
bad,the district managers are totally retarded they promote stupid people to managers that treat like shit the crew
bad,It was too crazy for my likings it always had Changing schedules and it wasn't the best with management I don't understand why they can't do things that are asked of them
bad,"Not a place work anymore"
bad,"When I was in employee the management was reckless, carefree and could not get their stuff together. They hardly cared about their workers and they just rush to get things done. I do not really eat there often but when I do  I always double check to make sure things are right because some of the employees/new employees do not care"
bad,"Managers would treat me like actual dirt, managers and supervisors would curse at me and make me feel like an outcast because of my skin tone. The job was easy and could be done by anyone but the management is so awful I would be perfectly fine never being a customer or ever seeing a wendys again. Never worried about what the customers requests were. When I brought up the situation to the store manager she blew it off and never did anything about it."
bad,It was faced paced and we were always short handed.  The owners wanted the cash but did not help out when more was needed from them.  There was a lack of top down communication.
bad,It was a okay place to work the head boss was very rude disrespectful would yell at you in front of customers will get mad if you request certain days off they would drop old fries nuggets back in the oil again and would service it to customers...
bad,Overall a decent place to work. It is what you should expect when working at a fast food restaurant. It is not the worst job ever but its not one you would want to have long term.
bad,I really don't like it here the manger it's alright but the crew members are rude and the owner wouldn't like if we had over time would try to take it away from people
bad,They make you learn every station and then over work you and then out of no where you get all new managers and then after the new managers come they change everything and make everyone miserable worst job of my life
bad,"I will not recommend this job to anybody. Too much heat, unprofessional management, disgusting complain about the food quality. I were just the dead ghost working there."
bad,"Terrible management, terrible pay, terrible advancement, terrible hours, terrible conditions, terrible everything. I would not recommend this place to anyone regardless of work experience or age."
bad,"I always did my job plus more , a typical day at work was horrible but I dealt with it because I needed the money . some days were good but most weren't management should show more respect towards crew members."
bad,The workplace is full of gossip.  I would never recommend anyone here.  They teased me everyday about my clothes and hair. This is not a great place they are mean and rude.
bad,"My working experience at Wendy's is a great learning experience, all of the do's and don't's of how to run a restaurant. I enjoy working there because of the customers, they are the reason why I go in with a smile."
bad,Horrible worker and customer service I feel they could do a lot better with what they are doing but other than that the food is ok and they keep the store clean
bad,They keep you from getting hours enough to get benefits and when they need people they just hire more instead of giving livable hours to their current employees. if you cant work the hours they want you to they make you feel like you dont belong there. They dont believe in family and if you say you cant work they will cut your hours.
bad,Too much drama the employees and employer were rude they wasn't organized rude to customers their score was never good its wasn't clean. I just didn't like it i wouldn't recommend it to nobody.
bad,"This was my first job opportunity in life.  It was exciting the forest 2 years,  but after that. . . It wasn't a career opportunity I had kept interest in.  Management  here kept you underpaid and under-scheduled. Priority became favoritism."
bad,"This was a very horrible location to work at, they treated me lesser for my race, and were really homophobic, they made really bad remarks when they found out my sexuality."
bad,They do not treat you well and when i went in to quit they said they were going to fire me the reason being i was not living up to their expectations when in fact the reason being why i was not was i did not get trained properly and was just thrown on the drive through window with no experience and when ever i would ask a question they would get huffy and annoyed
bad,Bad place to work managment was very bad so workers not not nice or have customer service skills. Load very fast paced I'm in Illinois so pay was very bad and a lot to do for very little pay.
bad,"Fired me for no reason. When asked for my last check, denied it. Had to go to HR (which was all the way on the other side of town). General manager has no idea how to be an adult and talk to the employees when there is a real problem."
bad,"Lots of hours to be worked in fast food. Always had overtime, in any shift really. Its hot back there with all the grills and fryers. Very fast paced at times"
bad,Didn't not enjoy my time there. Unsanitary conditions at every location except the remodeled location on college in Fort Collins Colorado. Pay was not good either.
bad,This should be a job for teenagers but there are more older people working than youngsters. Make it very uneasy to advance because the older people are there to stay
bad,"Cooking food and cashier"
bad,Job is horrible management is worse. They will make you stay overtime and edit your time card to say that you didn't stay. If you work for them then you are gonna get scammed and abused.
bad,"Typical run of the mill fast food place of employment. Usual days consisted of preparing food, running cash registers, cleaning, and stocking. Very over worked and under pain environment."
bad,"Working at Wendy's is not at all as easy breezy as you'd think. The Wendy's branch I worked for in Norcross, GA only cared about making money, and nothing else. They never cared about their employees. They'd ask you to work more hours than you are scheduled for and end up with overtime, but never got paid for overtime. They'd only pay you up to 40 hours. You rarely get a lunch break. Management is so unorganized, and will fire you for anything but say that you opted to quit. They don't clean properly. You'd work and serve customers in areas that were infested with roaches. Drink machines were moldy. Working at Wendy's is more stress than what they pay you for. I would never work at another Wendy's again, and I'd definitely never recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"The GM makes the work hard for the managers in which the managers make the day so much harder for the crew members. There is never enough people scheduled for the typical work day which makes the customer service so much slower and a lot of unhappy customers. The soda machine always goes out which makes it more for the crew member on the front line cause they have to actually get ice and drinks from the drive thru side for customers. The bathrooms are always messy and smelly, the condiment stand is never filled and the ketchup pump never works. The dining area seems to only get cleaning once maybe twice a day. I've came in the store several times first thing in the morning when the store just opens and smell marijuana in the dining and bathroom area which is very disturbing to me. Wendy's located at 7700 City Ave is the worst fast food place I've ever been to."
bad,"Have been with this Employer for years. When I first started they gave 40 Hours a week. Only 28 or less now. And management is Horrible. Messy employee's, A lot of work for not a lot of pay. They also expect you to stay and slave for them. This is a Job for a Teen or someone who's never had a Job before. This was also my first Job. Regret it. Don't work for them you will regret it."
bad,"i have been working here for a while now and i honestly think it is not a good place to work. the management it terrible,she is rude and is mean to everyone and not enough hours."
bad,Management sucks - take workers for granted. All they do is boss you around while they sit around and do nothing. Never want to give raise. Customers are so rude and management doesn't help.
bad,"Wendy's is a fast food restaurant so it is very fast paced and stressful. I Usually worked as the drive- through cashier. But I also learned how to food prep, make sandwiches,  use the fryer, and cleaned the dinning room. I was promised 30 + hours and was not given them. And I needed these hours to provide for my family. The manager and the employees  were not very friendly."
bad,"I learned a lot from how too treat people with more kindness then normal . how to operate a henny penny fryer , how too properly work a cash drawer and  multi task"
bad,A typical day at work is normally always busy and fast paced. But overall the place was very clean and up to standard in terms of a food place. It was a good place to work at.
bad,"There were times were there a was only 3-4 people working during a shift, and when things got busy it was a complete disaster. Management here is horrible, don't hire enough people that actually want to work and have good work ethic. Its hard to get any time off. If you are a good work you, they will over work you"
bad,"over work for all the stuff you have to do, instead of hiring more people to do a specific position, you are all over the place all day and constantly changing with stress. no thx."
bad,"This was literally just a first job. I got paid around $7.50 which was definitely not worth what I did, but it was better than asking my mother for money 24/7 you know? I had a hand in cleaning EVEVERYTHING. No need for listing, literally everything. The area I worked was so hot because I was surrounded by fryers and grills. I cant lie though, I have to thank for giving me plenty angry customers to handle. I think thats what makes me such a good speaker today. All I know is once I seen a girl faint in the back of the kitchen for working $7.25/hr job, I had to get out of there."
bad,This Wendy's is horrible. I do not feel welcomed and got my hour cut extremely when the new managers started. I am not satisfied with this fast food restaurant and would not recommend it to any friends or any one for that matter.
bad,I worked here when I got out of high school until something better came along. This is an employer I would recommend to someone who is retired looking for extra work or someone who is in school.
bad,worst job ive ever had. Gross and the Gm and all other managers were awful. Other employees always did drugs during work in bathroom and everyone was always messing around.
bad,"Never work for wendys, its a horrible job and the management is bad.... rude customers and a manager that treated me like i was a slave and hit me if i didnt do what he said... i told the general manager and she did nothing they dont care about the people that work there"
bad,did not like was very cut throat seemed like it was evry man for themselves there was no team work. if something was not done when they wanted favortism was shown a
bad,"Personas más eficientes ,más comunicación avía el empleado"
bad,"I was a great first job , I love making the customers satisfied with their order, our times were decent. We were very busy during the afternoon , rush was a very chaotic stressful time but I got through it. The management wasn't good, they were slacking on the job and showed a lot of favoritism."
bad,Take orders from front end and drive thru. Keep clean works space. Ensure customer satisfaction. Help cooks prepare orders for the customers. Aid any co worker if needed in their responsibilities.
bad,"100% unsatisfying. the pay is horrible for what we have employee's have too and we receive discipline for any small detail. I do not enjoy this job, its only to break food on the table."
bad,Management was very inconsiderate of my school schedule. They would schedule me from 2 pm to close which was 12 pm. with knowledge that I was still attending high school and had to ride the bus to and from school.
bad,"Well what can I say this job was not for me as it require long intensive days behind a grill for low pay and no benefits.  I spent most of my days behind the grill burner or fryer cooking up a storm. While by the end of the day every one of those devices where then cleaned and polished. I all can say it was awful dirty, greasy mess. Though the people there were fun to be around with and made the job just a little bit easier."
bad,the immature workers there was ridiculous all they did was try to get people fired. manager was nice if you were on his good side. other than that i do not want to go back ever.
bad,"great work it was very nice, i enjoyed my self working here with nice people ‘ they was very flexible ‘ hours was very nice checks was very lovely and was able to pay bills"
bad,I was trained for a specific area but i wasn't actually working in this area. I was told to go to a different area and i wasn't properly trained. it wasn't organized.
bad,A typical day at work would be stressful. I never really got trained so I had to basically learn everything on my own. I didn't really have a relationship with the manger because she was rude. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the customers.
bad,they give rasies every 6 months managers eat for free also team members get a discount on there food while at work and off the clock there move people up within the company
bad,i have only work at wendys for a short few months an i quit because of lack of respect for others and their careers. working with this company i had barley no hours. i couldn't do my work as needed because i was always stopped and threatened. my checks was always messed up....
bad,"Stores are understaffed. High paced, little rewards. Just like pretty much any other fast food job. Don't expect much. Good for a parttime, bad for long term."
bad,"A typical day consist of running the register, refilling up the condiment station/sauces, making deserts cleaning the dinning area and working with drive thru. I learned to not make friends and work as a team only. The culture was diverse. Rush hour was the hardest part of the job. It was not enjoyable!"
bad,when working there they treated everyone else with more respect. they looked at me like i didnt mean anything to them just because i worked the backroom
bad,The management made people work overtime without paying the overtime wages and changed our hours a lot. Horrible place to work and i suggest nobody to work here.
bad,Wendy's was my first job in high school . I only worked there for 5 months before moving onto McDonald's where I have been for 3 years now . Wendy's only allows you to get 30 hours a week at the most and pays minimum wage . Never overtime and getting days off was difficult .
bad,"The Wendy's was by far the worst place I have ever worked. Management does nothing to stop shift leaders from harassing other crew members, you will be overworked and stressed everyday. Management will withhold your paychecks and not tell you why. I do not recommend working here."
bad,I worked here for over a year and the management wasnt good and the staff didn't care about the customers. There was always rumors spreading and not a lot of the crew got along with each other.
bad,Very slow but the crew members are good workersand deserve to be paid better and get more money that's just my opinion I don't know what else to say it was fun while it lasted
bad,"not a good job had it during my high school years low pay no benefits. Not a good job for an older adult with responsibilities, not even good for a high school student very long or short hours depending on what you want, not allowed to do overtime or over 40 hours."
bad,Far too stressful. Rude customers every day. Incompetent employees. Rotating management. People quit all of the time. Far too much work for the pay. Greedy ownership.
bad,"They don't care about their employers, they suck at giving raises even if you work harder than everyone else there. This is an awful company to work for."
bad,"A typical day (from my job) was I'd come in at 7 PM and do the inside closing procedures (taking out the trash, cleaning floors).  The manager would send me home even if I had an hour left because I finished quickly.  He even told me that corporate preferred me to work quick so that they ""didn't have to pay me more"".  I don't know who has a business model like this, but I couldn't get out of there fast enough!"
bad,"As a cashier it was my job to satisfy a customer quickly and accurately when taking their order as well as handing them their order. Also as a cashier it was my job to clean all of the tables and chairs, every stock all the silverware and condiments, take out all the trash, and clean the bathrooms. When I work as a pickup window operators it was my duties to take their order as well as collect the money and give them their order with a smile."
bad,my first day at wendys they made me work by myself I didn't know what I was doing or anything the manager was rude to me because I didn't know what to do
bad,Working at Wendy's was very stressful and very busy. The workers didn't really train me well. They threw me on the burger station on my first day. And the managers were barely there.
bad,"I worked under a franchise owner who was very poor at managing staff. Always understaffed and when there was an employee there, they would be too miserable to do anything"
bad,"Bad company, managers, employees. Wendys do not pay well awful environments no good benefits. No security they don't care about your safety or family. Very unprofessional just not a good work place."
bad,"I made a few friends working here, but the management was awful. I was 16 at the time I was hired and I was never given any breaks. I would work from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. get ready to leave, then get yelled at for trying to go home and would have to stay a few more hours until the next person came in at 6 to cover the shift."
bad,"Daily work was  ok ,   key responsibility  including greetings customers, making sandwiches, prep, opening and closing store, submitting orders, operations on cash register"
bad,Some challenges of Managing in fast food involve Steady to busy constantly. Fast paced environment. And you don't always receive proper feedback to know where you stand in your position
bad,"I would never go back to this place for work. The management is not good, at all. The staff is lazy and doesn't do anything. When I worked there I was one of the only ones that was a good worker and ended up getting treated like I wasn't appreciated."
bad,"No one to show you your job or what to do, you learn on your own and yelled at all the time to hurry,do more than 1 job including non qualified jobs ."
bad,The Wendys crew would always be a drag to others and the customers. The management was very poor and hypocritical. The only part I enjoyed was the wonderful customers that came back to see me
bad,Not exactly an ideal company for job growth. The rush times were the busiest. Good atmosphere but really didn't care about the turnover rate. A little more appreciation would have been nice.
bad,"busy"
bad,I appreciate the opportunity to work here but the environment is very chaotic. I wish that there was a more supportive management staff as well as reliable team members.
bad,The work was too much for what an employee was getting paid. Management was unorganized an made it a very stressful work environment. Most employees were in their young teens an were immature
bad,"Treat you wrong, not very organised and the pay  isn't enough. Not very well kept company this company sucks. Over work and doesn't give credit where credit is due"
bad,Management completely disrespectful. Curses at you call you names and when you let the other managers know they completely disregard the situation. I would not refer anyone to this job.
bad,"Anytime I would ask for a day off specifically for an appointment, or a meeting, or to see my parents, they would call me in or they would already have me on the schedule and tell me that I couldn't get the day off, they had plenty of people working there, the customers are never nice to you at this location, and the coworkers that I worked with were not passionate about anything."
bad,It was OK but wouldn't go back . It was not a good work environment no communication between mangers and crew members always some type of problems .I just felt like I was going no where with the company
bad,It was horrible working here. The only place worse is the dollar tree. I hate this place and discourage anyone else from applying here unless you have to.
bad,"I do not recommend this job to no one who does not enjoy working around job the job is ok when you have the help that's needed and everyone on the same page, but you will not make a living working places like this."
bad,"Terrible, they try to overwork you for little pay"
bad,"take orders, greet customers, prepare bacon, potatoes, teas, beverages, coordinate orders, clean, wash dishes, provide customer service, solve problems, restock my station, fill appliances."
bad,Over worked under payed. Very overestimate worked and under payed and expeded to be thei in snow that is 23 inches and they don't care if you die getting their and they want you their even when you are sick as well.
bad,una empresa de clase mundial con poco crecimiento a nivel general
bad,"never gave me hours but constantly hiring new people. Management was not strong or responsible at all. They never paid me my full check on time, it was always an issue."
bad,"boring days at work"
bad,no pay what so ever. poor benefits. people are extremely rude. you will get stuck working every weekend. they do not work with you about your personal life
bad,"A typical day at work included making food, serving customers, getting yelled at, cleaning the washrooms and floors, as well as keeping the dining room clean. New employees are not trained properly which made the job stressful. Managers always give you attitude and intentionally schedule you on days you are not available to work."
bad,"I will never work for fast food again because of this place. The food is never fresh like they say, the people you work with are so backwards its not funny."
bad,Whatever you do don't work at Wendy's. More of a work environment for kids rather than adults. Lack in teamwork cleanliness etc. Pay is very lousy for the work you do.
bad,"working here was awful, the managers were always late, everyone was in a bad mood and i was forced to work several stations with no help. Really not a place i would recommend working at."
bad,i did not like working there do to people not doing there job people standing around no one trained me on anything and i was but in one job that i was not hired for
bad,"This job might have been a little too fun. We would lose track of time sometimes and be there longer than we should have. As a first job its a good one, but rude customers are not fun."
bad,This job gave me the opportunity to learn what it takes to be a cashier and working with the public. I learned how to be a team player and provided the best customer service while learning new skills as a cashier
bad,I cant say anything good about them. they work you like crazy and don't pay you that good. if your in high school its a prefect job for you. you can know everything in that store and you going to be over looked.
bad,The management really sucks they need to get there stuff together no one ever stays there very long. I was there a long time and they didn't do me very good. I was one of the longest crew members there and couldn't ever move forward and I want to move forward at a job not stay at the same place for two years
bad,"After working there for 7 months i can happily say that was most likely the worst job I have ever had. a typical day consisted of me showing up at the crack of dawn for work, and immediately sent scrubbing the drive-thru. After that would be cleaning the grills, and stoves, pre-cooking bacon, prepping meat, veggies, and beginning to serve customers for a majority of the day with one 30 minute break in between. That aside, it was a valuable learning experience for someone fresh in the working world."
bad,"Management is horrible. They have no respect for there employees. I worked there for over a year. I worked 12 hour days and more than most, I would never receive a break. Employees are expected to do way to much at a time for the customers which would lead to a bad experience for them. "
bad,"This is more of a beginner's job. For someone with experience and a desire to secure a great position, obviously I wouldn't recommend the food service industry."
bad,It doesn't pay much. The management is horrible. The company makes tons of money but wont set their pay rate to be at least $9-$10 an hour. I would not recommend anyone to work for the company
bad,the job was nasty the people their were rude i disliked the majority of the people that i worked with and i usually get along with everone for the most part
bad,"Workplace was dirty. Pay was really low. Employees were very rude. I worked hard, and was disrespected extremely. I would not recommend working in this work environment ever again."
bad,"Fast food restaurants are fast food restaurants. You shouldn't expect anything good. Management sucks, and the only thing i enjoyed were the other employees who actually cared."
bad,"Unprofessional, violates employee rights, unappreciative/rude management, overall horrible place to work. Would not there again, even on my most desperate day."
bad,Not the fast food type of guy to many rules on shaving an tattoos low pay no overtime an people would smoke in the bathroom during closing time so not the best place
bad,"Bullying was permited by management. Poor communication and co-workers jealousy. No bonus.No over time, but pressure to do the monthly closing on time."
bad,"This job was horrible with bad customer service, orders always wrong , employees with bad attitudes , environment was dirty ,  half cooked food , and bad management."
bad,The management is horrible and isn't run right and honestly it's a horrible place to work at. The mangers think that they are better then every one else when they aren't.
bad,"did not like management, did not like the hours, did not like my co workers. I tried working with them but they all continually went either on a ""break"" after they just had like an hour and a half worth of a break or even just left the back and left me and the manager up front making the food. I gave my two weeks after working there for two weeks."
bad,"Definitely not a great company to work for. Under-paid and overworked. Don't care about the employees, and work conditions and not the best. Lack of communication with the employees."
bad,"I will never work at a fast food restaurant again. Fast food isn't a job for me, it is a job for someone who has no prior experience or education or a student."
bad,"The manager threatened to ""take me out back"". They teased me and said it was fine. I believe a manager should not say things like that but i still tryed to stick it out till that same manger layed her hands on me."
bad,"I was very much over worked here. I learned how to become a shift supervisor and less than a year. Management was very unprofessional. The workplace culture is very messy. Not very welcoming at all. The hardest part was coming to work, that was the hardest part because work was that dreadful. I liked getting off  tha was the best part of working at wendys, & this was at the location I was at which was Downtown state street wendys"
bad,"The job was very stressful,and there is a huge lack of teamwork and professionalism. I really loved getting to interact with customers. I learned how to do salad/food prep and really enjoyed doing that and learning new things."
bad,"terrible place to work, terrible ownership, took employees for granted."
bad,"This company is one of the worst I had ever worked for. They're very unfair when it comes to hours, as well if you have an emergency. Terrible pay terrible environment to work for."
bad,There are not words to describe how awful it is to work at this job. There is not a single manager there who can handle their job. The employees are unfriendly and incapable of completing simple tasks. This job is ridiculous. Any where would be better than here.
bad,It was like being an a high school. They were unprofessional and always gossiping. The only kind people there was the customers. The training is not great.
bad,"I was constantly sent home because of other employees complaining and I was only agreeing with them. But for that reason all of the employees, including myself, should of been sent home but I was the only one sent home"
bad,This Was my very first job ever i was 16 years old and i couldn't wait to get out of there. The Nasty things i say employees do to not only the products but to each other was sickening.
bad,If you're in the Salina area this job is only suitable for maybe a highschooler. The managers are not worth a penny. You don't get raises as often as you should and when you do it takes forever in a day to send an email! Very poor staff and they honestly seemed like they only hire addicts or people off the street. Parents DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS WORK IN THE SALINA LOCATIONS
bad,"I worked at 3 different restaurants & from what I've seen it's horrible. No one did they're job right, management didn't know how to run a restaurant & THE FOOD IS NEVER FRESH"
bad,Worked to the bone for over 5 years as a shift manager and transferred stores even in order to advance and get promoted. Never happened so I left the company.
bad,i loved the customers that came in all the time they told me i keep the place cleaned and it smelled really good. the managers did not do their jobs at all they are always on there phones etc plus they are to chicken to confront the customers if they have an issue with there food its not a good place to work for at all.
bad,Working here was an experience I was able to meet new people who I'm glad too the time to train me correctly although others would try to over power me. Favoritism was obvious thats why I left this job. Aside from being so far from home it wasn't worth it.
bad,When I began to work here I thought I would like my job. I took customers orders. I made there drinks also while receiving the money. I like getting to know the different type of people. But I highly dislike this store. The mangers are very rude. The gm tiffany..she dont deserve the title. The store was ran poorly. The ice cream machine was flithy. Most crew members wouldn't do the jobs they was asked to do. I will never work for Wendy's again..
bad,"Don't do it. No team workers, everyone plays the blame game, no paid time off. They work you like crazy for the little time you are there putting you in all the positions. People often walk out and you have to fill that position for your shift and it's stressful."
bad,A typical workday as a cashier at Wendy's was stressful due to unreliable employees and management that wouldn't be as assertive as needed with employees whom were slacking.
bad,"The workers don't get treated well, managers are always eating and in a bad mood. General manager is on her phone the whole day and just sits in the office and just keeps complaining and rushing the workers through the headset."
bad,I didn't like working for Wendy's  this was my first job and my worst job. the management wasn't good at all  all they did was yell and scream and they never solved any problems.
bad,"Worked as a grill closer, poor co workers people often lazy never helps. Managers will barley help with jobs. Often not ran in order just people everywhere helping."
bad,"at first it was really fun to work there,everything was smooth going and just really cool. after a few months in the managers became very rude, very disgusting, and didnt know how to treat an employee,and my coworkers were like a bunch of highschoolers complained and gossiped like 3 year olds."
bad,ive never worked in such a horrible place in my life. they treat there employees horribly. there management is unorganized and they have to care for the wellbeing of their employees i would never advise anyone to work here ever!
bad,there isn't enough words to describe how I felt about working here. long hour days for little pay. rude employees and management.
bad,Management is awful! Very rude and unprofessional. As a minor they paid under minimum wage and had me doing more work than I was suppose to!
bad,"I was working really hard there. Management sucked. They were not good at all. Prolly shouldn't have worked there at all. I made good, got drinks, cleaned, ran the cash registers, customer service, and ran drive thru."
bad,Not easy to advance and the pay is horrible. Your constantly short staffed. I was a manager and always stressed out. My boss was a fool and left me to do his job which he took all the credit for.
bad,"I focused on sharpening my skills"
bad,"Poor management , in interview, manager went over rules and guide lines and after a week working there at least half were broken by current employers. Had to start paying  full price for food, our breaks were cut along with our smoke breaks,  no drug testing."
bad,"Good management. Pay is so low that they can not keep any good employees, This leads to covering call ins all the time, or running the store short staffed."
bad,I hated it there if you like be put down and constant nagging this is the job for you. Customers barely even know what they themselves ordered. Very lousy work environment.
bad,There really isn't much to say about working at wendy's. Nobody cares about the job until the owners are in the building. The owner's expect the children working there to work as hard as possible with the only reward being not getting yelled at in the drive through for being slow. Overall garbage.
bad,"I would work the closing shift that started at 4pm and almost always ended at 2 or 3 in the morning. If i wasn't done closing up by the time the schedule said i was off (mostly 11pm) i would have to clock out for the rest of the time. The management is horrible, they aren't flexible with school or with their employees needs. Out of the time i spent working there, very few people who were hired would stay longer than their first day because of how careless and rude everyone is."
bad,"A typical day at work was hectic, of course. Always on your feet, and don't forget getting screamed at! I had no formal training whatsoever. My first day I was left alone at the sandwich station during lunch rush. We had nine managers and none of them had their stuff together. I only ever saw three of them. At Wendy's, nobody was your friend. You did not advance. You did not get raises. The hardest part of the job was the complete disregard the managers had for their employees, I was even slapped with a hot spatula once and still have the burn scars all over my right arm. I went home that night and my skin was covered in clear bubbles from the grease on the spatula. The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting. I'm not over-exaggerating, I worked for a construction company for three years and NEVER went through what I did in  my month at Wendy's."
bad,The work place was completely dirty and the managers didn't treat the employees with respect. I left Wendy's after one week because the pay was bad and I was leaving for college.
bad,Bonus structure and the way they portray the company in the interview process are very different than in reality. The hours are very long and there is no respect of time when you are off.
bad,You come home smelly and stressed out because the management team is very unprofessional a lot of Call ins and disrespect from other employees and never a resolution because the management didn't care
bad,"I learned so much about giving great Customer Service while working with the fast food. Being able to Multi Task and being able to get the job done in a certain amount of time and still keeping my sanity was the goal and I accomplished that on top of working under pressure. I started off on just fries and nuggets to Cashier in a very busy drive thru plus doing dishes, Food prep, sometimes having to make my own sandwiches while ringing up orders, receiving money and giving exact change. it was all a challenge until you get used to the rush and you look down at your paycheck."
bad,"The management was really bad and they never cared about the employees. The crew was rude to customers and they never cared about their job, and the managment didn't try hard enough to get good employees or to train them right in the first place."
bad,"The job was just messy....crew members, management & corporate workers. They weren't about doing what was right...all they were concerned about was making the next dollar"
bad,Was the most miserable 4 months of my life. The managers act like children instead of managers. They run you out of there and wonder why they can't keep anybody.
bad,Was not all that good of a job...a manager ended up getting involved with my child's mother and then started causing issues so I left..
bad,i starve while working while dealing with the hot harsh conditions in the kitchen. it was very hard to breath and to even work with the other members there as a team.
bad,"If you enjoy working at an insanely rapid pace while still getting constantly talked down to and yelled at for being slow, and also getting minimal breaks (if any) while getting paid an absolute minimum wage than Wendy's is the place for you."
bad,"It was a terrible work experience"
bad,"Always  stay busy do your job and be the best at it .always try to move up the opportunity  is always there ,they're always  hiring and welcome  anyone with experience  or not ."
bad,"its an ok place to work , it pays the bills, I never got a raise in over a year working there. Management was ok.i have nothing to say about wendys"
bad,I got hired here and they didnt show me where anything was. They got a guy to train me and he was only there for 3 weeks. I later had to train someone and i was only there for a week. You get 50% off meals only when youre working. You only get 1 half hr break thats unpaid and You dont get two 15 min breaks if you work 8 hrs. I asked for full time work and i get less then 40 hrs a week and i make min wage. All the managers are philipino except the owners son.
bad,This is a job that is for people that are in school or anyone that is living with someone. The pay is not that good and there are a lot of long hours that come with the job.
bad,really had a good time some nights working. Was very stressful because the turnover rate was so high and it was hard to keep people. Also learned how to work hard.
bad,"the work was good i learn most of my job from a co worker not a manager. i worked a lot, i did get enough hours. the only bad thing was that they acted like children talking behind each others back. manager against manager, a manger was fired for stealing is was reckless."
bad,"Low pay and too much work. I was a cashier but I'd food prep, clean dining room ,bathrooms, etc. But the company is a well established one. My wendy's was just low staffed."
bad,"I began a part time job at Wendy's as an adult seeking something flexible and fun. I never had a bad experience at any Wendy's prior however working at this store left a very bad taste. I was sexually harassed and when I went to the Store Manager, she referred me to speak to any of the hourly managers. She was the only woman, of course I wanted to speak to a female about this, but that was ignored. Instead, I was asked if I wanted to become a shift supervisor. I attended meetings at other stores, did the WeLearns and the ServSafe test and was never compensated as promised. I was told I would receive a sign on bonus of $50 instead. The ""sign on"" never happened since my official meeting with regional manager was pushed back month after month after month. Additionally, I never had been given proper breaks. In our state, and I explained this to the store manager, we get breaks at 4 and 6 hours. She ignored what I said and I heard they prepared for auditing shortly after to avoid fines. After all that happened there, it was her comment about a chocolate frosty that made me simply quit. That job was a nightmare."
bad,poor servies sloppy bad hours  I really don't know what  to say I did not like the job  the hours were good at first then they cut them down to 2 days aweek
bad,This place was my first job and I disliked it due to the unprofessional staff and management. As my first job ever I didn't like going to work after school everyday nor did I like the communication skills shown there.
bad,They pull you in with the promise of money and great training and give you neither.   You are on call all the time and managers care very little for their employees.
bad,"Didn't like to much ,enjoy food,but I do like working with my Co workers.I  learned to keep my good job and to use my skills to be more productive."
bad,Working at Wendy's started out enjoyable but near the end of my time there it was terrible. it was very strict and you are being watched 24/7 on the cameras which makes you feel not trusted.
bad,No teamwork on day shift. Night shift was better but no supervision from management. Too much complaining from the staff about doing their job. Most staff didn't seem like they took pride in their job.
bad,The managers don't speak English very well and the hours suck I would average 10-15 hours a week at minimum wage it is a very slow boring job and you don't do much there
bad,"Greet every customer with a smile, be courteous. Great work enviroment, nice co-workers. Sometime's very rude customer's.  Some customer's would come in, and ask for me by name. That was the most enjoyable part of work at Wendy's."
bad,There is no back bone to this company. They have expectations that cannot be met and no money to meet them apparently. They lie and do not take any responsibility for their actions.
bad,This is a terrible place to work. Please do not work here. I beg of you. I absolutely despised this job. Everyone there was terrible
bad,"The managers were not very proffesional, shared too much of their personal life with staff, poor team skills. The hours were terrible, manager had favourites"
bad,Work you super hard. Barely want to give you a raise been there for three years and was treated very poorly... would not recomand no one to work there
bad,i worked at Wendy's since i was 16 year old the place has horrible management and the place is a joke. i do not see how the place passes when the health department comes in.
bad,"don't follow their own  procedures"
bad,"filthy kitchen and dinning room. cockroaches in the kitchen utilities, very rude employees. managers are very rude and unkind. a very unhealthy work environment. employees are very rude to customers."
bad,"I seldom bother reviewing companies but in this case I have to speak up because I was outright abused when I went into Wendy's management training program. This was like 20 years ago but still it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in my whole career. I had high hopes when I applied. I'd always liked Wendy's."
bad,maintain a good fast pace. i learned how to sterilize dishes and use a technology to ring up food. i also dealtwith money and restocking items that needed to be restocked.
bad,managers there are the most rude people i have ever met. I used to work there and my girlfriend walked me into work one day and they told her to get out. even though she had money and wanted to buy something.
bad,This job helped me learn people skills. It is easy and self explainable but I cannot live on the pay. My managers were great my co-workers got the job done and it flowed very well for the most part. the hardest part of the job was trying to help customers and keep the dining area clean. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers happy with the service I provided to them.
bad,Managers don't appreciate you. They're always rude to employees If youre sick and call out and bring in a doctors note your hours will be cut. The coworkers will always talk about you behind your back.
bad,I have been with this company almost 3 years no raises for employees wjo have been with the company long higher pay for new crew members management staff poor starting from stor manager dm manager assistant manager the store i am presently working at has mold in the ceiling mold in the lemonade dispenser mold in the outer walls in the lobby atore 13693 Murphy road stafford texas 77477
bad,They didnt want work with me i needed to work days but kept me a nights and said they will put me on days but never didnt then i ended up moving out of town
bad,"Wendy's is a fairly decent company to work for.  I learned that I have to get my education in  order to better myself.  Management was fairly good, I loved my co-workers, we were all a big family.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers & the most enjoyable part of the job is getting off."
bad,the dm is a racist an the gm is a lazy mf the other managers try an treat u like your a child an they want you to do work that they not paying you for the just are not rite for any thing this company sucks they all ways out of product
bad,i really wasnt there long enough to say much. but it was a horrible experience for fast food. managers were all over the place and not very coordinated. too much going on
bad,"i didnt like working here at all, employees were nice and helped when i needed it but other than that it is a very unsanitary place, floors werent clean, i almost slipped and fell a few times, and there was a centipede crawling out of the cooler where all the food is kept"
bad,Not a place to work in management if you have kids job is stressful but you will  get thru it if you have patiences most employees nice the bosses always make threats when things not right was a delight to deal with the customers some made your day was nice to get to know customer's name and their order
bad,this place is the worst. the pay is horrible for how you are treated. they do not follow the under18 guidelines and will make you work during school hours.
bad,"when I worked for the company I wasn't able to make many hours, but flexbile for full time students. The company may be good for someone that is working for their first time"
bad,"Working at Wendy's was without a doubt the nastiest place i have ever worked, The Management was also awful and they were extremely ruse to their workers and put on a ""fake"" face to the customers then proceed to talk behind the customers back."
bad,It's okay place to work but will be better if we had better manager and mature employees. Some of the people make it hard to work there especially the one I work with and how hard we work we deserve free food
bad,The managers are a joke. I did everything there and never got creditfor what i did. Every manager there talks about everyone. Its not a good place to work
bad,"the company is a very bad company id rather work some place better. dm's and gm's are unprofessional, managers are never on the same page and crew does what they wanna do"
bad,"Terrible management, no advancement, horrible hours, and on top of all of that you only get half off of one meal. Also the management shows favoritism."
bad,Very fast paced enviroment i will probably work for this company again just needs better scheduling skills instead of last minute hours
bad,A typical work day was non stop movement and the managers were not very pleasant. The co workers I've worked with was friendly and good to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the managers tried to make me move faster than how fast I was moving already. The enjoyable part was the break time.
bad,i woud come to work faithfully everyday and would get picked on my the general manager for no reason at all. but beside that it was a job and i thank one of the managers for giving it to me.
bad,My typical day at work is working with drive thru taking costumers money and giving them their food. the hardest part of that job is washing the dishes. the management is terrible and they suck at that all they do is yell and they are very RUDE.
bad,"Wendys is a horrible restaurant to work for. They flip and flop your hours. They will give your hours to someone else without telling you. And when you get a day off approved they will call you the day before and tell you that you have to come into work. That they person that THEY found to cover your spot isn't ""qualified""."
bad,Not only was i not trained at all and thrown on register by myself during a push of 20+ people. The workers domt use gloves and touch raw product and cooked with the same unwashed hands. If a fry or nugget falls on the tray or the bagging station it's picked up with dirty hands and put in the customers food pouch. Workers were stealing money from the company. Management was a joke. Worked one day and will NEVER work there again.
bad,Had little to no respect to workers. Hours and pay where terrible. Many of the workers did not get along and often had verbal arguments.
bad,the Place was very upkeep Except for the bathrooms they smelt like they Had mold in there I told the assistant manager to have it looked at but it sucked at with there employee training
bad,"The workers here talk bad about each other and the management turns a blind eye or is involved. The store is unclean and doesn't follow protocol, and a lot of the equipment is broken."
bad,A typical day at work is always very busy and fast phase job. I've learn to manage my time wisely and work for a long period of time. I manage to work in a fast phase and consistently working good. The hardest part of the job is satisfying the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer happy and satisfied.
bad,"greet customers, take orders, make orders,handle cash, stock what was needed. i enjoyed working with the crew we got the job done"
bad,"People didn't do there jobs."
bad,"As a crew member, I was treated incorrectly. The managers were unprofessional, and rude. There was a lot of favoritism going around, along with lies. The first GM that I worked with never ordered things correctly, or on time. When the next GM came in, she was rude and said very unprofessional things to me. The way they treated another manager there was wrong. They forced employees to work even when they were sick and had doctors notes."
bad,"Managers, often yell at you and talk down to you."
bad,"I would NEVER in my life recommend this location. "
bad,"I worked at Wedys for 6 months and hardly got any hours. the management was horrible. always got yelled at for small things and they gave me 7 hours a week but, when new people started they gave them 30 hours a week."
bad,My opinion about Wendy's that typical day at work was relaxing. I learned a lot of hands on and computer training to become a manager. The management was amazing. My co workers were one of the best reasons why management would be a future for me one day. The hardest part of the job was making sure being able to handle taking orders and listening to someone over talk them while listening. The most enjoyable part was the experience.
bad,"Everyone here is very fun and respectful, the managers are serious when they need to be, but treat their employees like actual people. The only problem I have with this job is that it is hard to advance."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help the customers when they came in to eat because the food was good and they were hungry. The hardest part of my job was having to take the negative comments about something I hadn't done. There was also the blame game the Management would play.  I called in more than I should due to it being my first job and not knowing how to handle getting my feelings out in a professional manner. Management wasn't very empathetic about things either. I was at an interview with Job Corps and they said that it wasn't a reason not to come in. Management also screws up. I had been getting 21+ hours a week, and than I told management that I was pregnant and it was very shortly after that, that my hours were cut. I don't know if it was due to me being pregnant or me calling in to tell them I had a doctor appointment that had just been scheduled, but my hours were cut form 21+ to not even 5, a week."
bad,"As a shift manager who worked my way up through the chain of command rather quickly (I was being trained within about four months of being hired) I not only faced a lot of problems from the other managers as a a crew but also as a fellow manager. I worked night shifts and it was well known that while we would be left with excess of day shifts work, causing us to leave at 2 or 3 in the morning after closing at 1 and scheduled to be out by 1:30, if the slightest mess was left, we were written up."
bad,I served as a cashier and sandwich topper for a couple of months. Working at Wendy's was a fun experience while on summer break.
bad,"what you don't already know"
bad,Wendy's had absolutely not fun. They were ALWAYS busy and the one manager and he was not nice to anyone. The fact that the specific store i worked for is now closed.
bad,"Daily inventory, lots of late night closes. If your in the mood for fast food Wendy's is as fresh as it gets. Salads made fresh daily plus no meat is ever frozen."
bad,"its just a seasonal job. cut and mow customers lawns,  mulch if customer needed it.. its not bad to have in the summer.. just cant have it as a job to make a living"
bad,"Wendy's was my first job. We all had good and bad days- it was hard to work there and be a junior in high school at the same time though. They did not really accept/understand the ""curfew"" corporate enforced upon high school students either."
bad,The environment was not something I enjoyed when working here. The management team were unfriendly and stressful to be around. The job itself was not hard but the people were just terrible. I did not enjoy my time here.
bad,"Cashier, responsible for tending money, helping customers, and helping to maintain the store and keeping it clean.  THere was really no perks to the job as most of my co-workers were illegal workers who did not understand English on an incredibly basic level."
bad,This was my first job and I always came in with a smile on face and ready to do pretty much whatever they threw at me. I have been working for a month now and I hate my job!  I was untrained I was thrown on grill the first day  and this  was my  training   These little burgers take 3 1/2 minutes to cook and these one takes 8 1/2 minutes to cook.  Since I was new I got behind because I was still trying to learn well  the other crew member did not care and they were rude  and they would grab the meat and go lay it on the grill where the girll chicken was cooked and start pressing it to cook faster then said we are not suppose to do this but. We need this meat so we do it anyways.30 days later here I am still  untrained  and everyday I go to work. All they do is yell at me for not knowing how to do stuff.  The only reason I  am able to do the grill and do the  fries is because I used my own time outside of work at home on my own laptop to watch the videos. So I'm doing it how the video showed well at this Wendy's they don't do anything like the videos so. The videos were not much help and they don't care to train you so working at Wendy's does suck.  Yesterday my manger pulled me aside and said is everything okay when you first started here you were so outgoing and you were always talking and smile now I don't even hear you talk or smile  anymore and I looked at him and said because I hate being here. All I do is. Get yelled at. For doing the best I can I only know so much due to the lack of I had no training  and. No person should ever be treated like I do all you guys do is yell
bad,the management is very bad. the store has many mechanical problems that have yet to be fixed. the mount of work that you do for the small amount of pay you receive is not even worth the job most of the time.
bad,"While I really enjoyed the people I worked with on my team, the store owner and general manager really didn't care about their employees, the pay because it is fast food is minimum wage which isn't enough to make a living on and you never get very many hours unless you work overnight."
bad,"Wendy's is a good job for mostly high school students that need little bit cash each week, but other then that Wendy's isn't a good job that needs to support their family because they don't provide you enough hours or any benefits and they keep you at minimum wage."
bad,"Worst Place Ever! Managers are childish, smoke every 2 seconds, not the best restaurant and the meat is rare! but they still serve it."
bad,was an okay place to work the managers were never to nice but I got a discount on my lunch. it was my first job so I learned a lot here. but would not recommend this place of employment to a friend.
bad,I hate working for this company. If I did not have bills I would quit as soon as possible. Management is terrible and you will probably never be promoted.
bad,i didn't really cared about working here because it was to faced paced for my liking. the management sucked didn't have any benefits or medical insurance
bad,"Really did not like working here, the managers were very manipulative, rude , and nasty. They were sabotaging the drawers of employees they did not like. It was a horrible place to work."
bad,"Co workers have low character and bad tempers. The managers tend to get out of character and doesn't treat people with equal respect. It is a very unorganized workplace. They have very unorganized product flow. There are few good working co workers that actually do there job how they are suppose to do. When Wendy's have busy business and long orders I do my part as a team member and help out. One day I did that and my manager walked on me at a bad time when I was done helping my team members and was waiting to receive the burger from her so, he assumed i wasn't doing anything. I tried to tell him I was helping but he only talked over me so I ignored him and he got mad and pushed me two feet and so I defended myself by telling him not to touch me and he sent me home."
bad,I started working Wendy's when I was only sixteen years old. They treated me horribly and stole my money from jacket. Management would always let the older co-workers pick on me. If you are sixteen or seventeen years and looking at Wendy's for a first time job. I would at different company.
bad,i will never again work or tell any i know to work for this company because they do not treat any one with respect or give a dame about your health or if a family problems come up.the don't really care about any thing but them selfs.
bad,A typical day at work is very slow unti close to bar time. Your co workers are okay as long as you know them before you start work. The manager that hires you on was like hardly there to talk to. The most enjoying part was really nothing.
bad,"I thought I was going to like Wendy's at first, but I was wrong. The customer service wasn't all that good. The workers were cussing in front of the customers. They were also very slow with negative attitudes."
bad,"They fired me so pretty upset about that"
bad,I hate working for Wendy's in Muscle Shoals Al the pay is minimum wage but you will work all day and not get breaks like suppose to. The Managers are the rudest and will yell at you in front of customers. Don't work here WARNING********
bad,Working here taught me how to improve my people skills and to pick and choose my battles. The customers weren't always the easiest to deal with but I grew and learned how to let things go in one ear and out the other.
bad,"Employees come to work high and many of them have criminals sheets a mile long, the managers will hire anyone even when they do not do the task needed, leaving it on the other people to complete them. Many of the managers are bullies making fun of peoples weight and other medical disorders."
bad,I worked for this company for many years and i enjoyed it. I dedicated myself to my job while raising my children and never left them short handed and would come in and cover if and when needed. I also traveled 60 miles to other counties to cover at all times of the day and night. I was put in three different stores my last year working for the company two of which were in different counties from which i lived.
bad,"Full of drama, maybe it was just my location. A lot of times I would find the manager gossiping about other employees with other employees. there was a lot of favoritism."
bad,running a register cleaning the entire dininng facility policing the area that i am required to look after assembling for and preping food opening and closing the store
bad,"rude employees, place isn't clean at times. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone especially at the location I was located at."
bad,"I made decent money - it is what you put into it."
bad,It was a great first job but not something that I want to go back to. I learned a lot of valuable skills working there. I'm looking for more now that I am older
bad,"not worth the time or effort, managers were ok, breaks were amazing :] , lunches were ok (1/2 price) they used to have me working Drive Thru Window in the middle of a snow storm, and washing dishes at the same time, makes no sense."
bad,The job was not that hard of a job and my life completly revolved around wendys but the hire ups had no respect for u or will get rid of you for no real reason at all and instead of taking responsibilty for their own actions the play the blame game instead of trying to find a way to fix any problem they have they terminate their good employees and hire worse if u get close to 10 yrs they can u so they dont have to pay u more money.
bad,"There are a number of areas that are begging for improvement in both the management as well as the crew level."
bad,The work and hours that I had to put in did not reflect on my pay check.  You can work 20 years for this company and you will not walk away with any benefits.  Job advancement only depended on who you know and who you are friends with.  I have never felt so under appreciated in a workplace!  I take pride in my work and have always been complemented on my job but this job was a waste of my time.  It barely paid the bills and didn't give me any time with my family.
bad,the problem with Wendy's is they cut your hrs back when they hire new people the work place is good 4 exp. new things. When they go to work its great till they hire new people.
bad,"The Wedny's I worked for was owned and operated by Carolina Restaurant Group in Charlotte, NC. These people were some of the worse people I have ever worked for. I am so glad this was a starter job for me while in high school. The managers had very nasty attitudes and had there favorites as to what they allowed people to get away with. The district manager always talked down to you as if you were a piece of trash. Also the hourly pay is terrible and you never get a raise."
bad,explain to many women working together there tudes were all messed up. An pay was ok it was a job for the time being. management is poor.
bad,This was an ok job but your chances for further growth with the company is very slim. You have to always constantly go out and beyond for those who don't appreciate you
bad,family was allowed to stoop and visted with there friends and family. if you where not family you got in trouble for visteding with others. mangement would yell cut down employs in front of customers and other workers
bad,"The management was very poor, anything goes at Wendy's on western blvd. Crew members would often argue and fight and shift managers didn't bother to control the shift. The employees hired were not trained and were just put into position because we were so short on staff making it a very frustrating and unproductive work environment."
bad,"They expect a lot from their employees with minimal pay. The raises are only 10-20 cents every 6 month, the management treats you poorly, the corporate people are rude, and the job requires a lot more physical labor than expected. For the amount of work done, there is not enough compensation."
bad,it was ok the staff was very rude and digusting but I was comfortable at the end. I use to love being to come to work and make my own schedule
bad,"I didnt like this job only because they did not treat their employees right at all, they didnt feed you or let you have at least one free meal."
bad,"Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.Managers do not invest in the workers to make sure that they succeed."
bad,it is a good starting place for people looking to advance their career futher.  I recommend it for new adults who are looking to build their experience.
bad,Its a lot that happens at Wendy's that I don't approve of like how they have favoritism in there and treat they employees bad
bad,a typical day at work was always a learning experience so happy to of worked here with everyone try it out sometime. Learned how to deal with customers and be a team player. management sucks. co workers suck. cleaning was the hardest. cooking was the most enjoyable
bad,"working in the front and making sure I smile and take customer order "
bad,"Best part of the job: co workers and management. Hardest part of the job: store maintenance. Good position for first job. Typical day just consisted on going in, taking and fulfilling orders, cleaning up and going home."
bad,"this job is intended for high schooled not meant to be a career. It is a good starter and gives you something to put on a resume, but that's about it. It takes a special person to really enjoy this job"
bad,"Not really somewhere you want to go unless you're in school and dont plan on making a living wage. The hardest part of the job is just remembering orders and to which customers they go. Very fast paced environment. Co-workers are usually quick to help in any situation. You get a certain discount on your food, but personally as hard as you work and as little hours you get it should be free as the corporation piles in the money anyways. The most enjoyable part is just knowing you helped a customer in a cerain selection and made their day better."
bad,worst place ive ever worked. the women there are horrible. all they do is gossip and talk about people. they are very clean
bad,Terrible management! Terrible attitudes of both co-workers and management. Disgusting place overall. It was a struggle dealing with truck drivers who were rude and smelt awful.
bad,Wendy's was my first job. I really didn't enjoy being here. Everyone would run over me and try to make me go in for them when they wanted.
bad,"it was a great opportunity to learn more but working for that particular store, management was very rude and unprofessional."
bad,"During my time working for this company it was horrible, all the managers have nasty attitudes and even though everyone suppose to be adults it was too many people acting like children, I would never work here again or referee anyone to this company."
bad,"disgusting......... didn't realize people really do spit in your food at these places! Rude management as well. No raises, no room for growth, only good for a ""first job"" just for a little money while you find a good job."
bad,The company does not allow for you to have any family time.  Managers have had to cancel their vacation plans at the last minute because they lost employees or because the area could not keep managers.  The new upper management regime believes that a GM should be in their store 24/7.
bad,"The manager played favorites often, called me in sick and threated to fire me if I went to the hospital. a typical work day was stressful and disorganized. most coworkers did work, but some; the favorites often got more hours and spent most if not all of the shift in the back or in the office."
bad,"In my days here it was very unorganized, falling apart at the seams nightly. It was stressful and hard to keep up once it started. My coworkers would loss their temper, I would have to take on roles which were not my title and I did well with it."
bad,"The managers are lazy, rude, pick favorites, and are completely obnoxious. Also, the employees are a bunch of high-schoolers and there is a ton of DRAMA!"
bad,did not like working there would walk 4 miles to wendys would close open or anything they needed but they asked me to leave and I felt that they where in the wrong
bad,"Maintained sanitation, health, and safety standards in work areas. "
bad,"this felt like a dead end job, this was. not the best idea I had. I was happy to move to something better better better better."
bad,"Work was cool But the Manager Was Childish "
bad,the management at wendys was very unproductive. my co-workers had attitudes and lack work ethic. a typical day went well for myself but frustrating at the same time.
bad,"I was the morning breakfast opener. I would come in and set up daily to do's for all employees, who was doing food prep, chili prep etc. I would check all food dates in the walk-in's. Check in all inventory control, quality control and assurance. Entering all sales, balance safe, deposits, register count downs and till preps. Thru out through out the day, we would have surprise visits from either; Health Department, OSHA visits, District Manager's and Corporate personnel. Salad and stock preps through timely frame units, shift differences and ran my shift of 15-16 employees at a time. Daily sales counts and reports."
bad,Rushed non stop. I learned to be patient with the public and helpful. Management and co-workers were good.The hardest part of my job was being patient with the public.
bad,"good place, learnt a lot about people's taste and likings. didnt like the way some employees were treated by higher employees."
bad,I wouldn't work here ever again. The store of which I worked was a terrible place. They couldn't even manage to keep a manager for more than a month.
bad,"I did a lot working for this company, and they help me along the way, and if i go back to my hometown i know i will always have a job because i was a good worker."
bad,they arent a good company they will cut your hours for no reason unless they like you then you will get all the hours you get hurt and they can careless and make you feel bad
bad,very very very horrible worst place to work in all over Chicago downtown is the worst the management was the worst and you would not want to work there
bad,"Working at wendy's help me learn about keeping up fast pace and leadership. Everyday at wendy's was jiust a typical day , You willget in the work place do whats needed to be done and go home. Management was okay some days . My co- workers were great for the most part. The hardest part of the job was learning to make sandwhiches but I think thats anybody weakness.The most enjoyable part was getting support ."
bad,"the co-workers were great and the job wasn't hard. the management (store manager and above) made working there a horrible experience."
bad,It was nice and the customers were very polite. The workers wasn't up to par they wasn't as professional as they should be
bad,Being a night line manager gave me good experience but over time I realized that the rest of management were falsifying the books and trying to pin the loss on lower employees.
bad,Cheap owners who don't care for customer or staff satisfaction with extreme managerial discord. I would never advise anyone to work here.
bad,no hours. low pay. Lots of drama. Nasty coworkers. the highest amount of hours a worker can receive was only 28 hours a week
bad,"I have noticed that the managers in these fast food shops often ask you to do things for them that are unneccessary,because thats what they think being a manager is. It was very under developed."
bad,It's fast food. Fast paced. Just like every other fast food place you work way too hard for the money you get paid. Everyone who has worked in one knows this. Everyone who hasn't doesn't care.
bad,preepping food was always fun and making sure people had great meals was a plus i like the group i work with i never got a bad feeling about working there
bad,"First impression at interview was not pleasant.Assistant manager,Christina has a very bad attitude. But I accepted the job because I was desperate. I worked for almost 3 weeks less than 10 hrs.a week. It was more than enough for me. The attitudes of both management and co-workers were miserable. It was a very unprofessional environment. Texting during slow periods,cursing,eating and drinking at workstations and overall poor customer service. I was very uncomfortable and the oldest employee there. Thankfully,my small online business is booming and I don't need that job. Worst job ever and it's not for someone who needs to support them self or family. It's for high school kids,college students,homemakers and people with no personality. Not friendly at all and no customer service skills. DO NOT work there!!"
bad,Ive learned how to react with people and how customer service should be. The hardest part of the job was working a lot but not enough pay
bad,Knowledge of governmental health regulations and food safety is required. Food handling and sanitation knowledge is also vital.
bad,"Everyday I would prepare foods needed for the first shift of the day. I prepared foods such as cheese, buns, condiments, bacon, chicken, salads, and drinks. I put up shipment of products twice a week. I cleaned store, store facilities, and store equipment. I also prepared customer orders."
bad,I Truthfully Have Nothing To Say Because They Never Had You In A Settled Location To Work I Mean They Would Print Out A Piece Of Paper And Say Show Up At This Time And When You Arrive There You Might Get Turned Around
bad,"I liked working  at wendys but the  management was kind of poor,but I enjoyed my coworkers and most of ther customers. I loved my schedule"
bad,"Fast and quick food services. Duties including making sure all food was available at serving time, restocking inventory every night, breaking down the stations and cleaning and wiping down everything I worked on that day"
bad,Too much to type. well it was a job that was seemly easy and the children wasn't that tedious. had fun helping them with homework and such.
bad,very stressful environment. the employees were very friendly and team players. management were very unprofessional and unorganized.
bad,"The Management for the district I worked in was very disorganized and had blatenly showed favortism. The pay sucked and the place had absolutely no air conditioning for the kitchen employees. My last day there which is the reason why I quit; the fire cheif actuall deemed it an unsafe work environment and other fast food places shut sown for the day in the area but no not wendy's, they made us work in 130 degree kitchen. So I quit."
bad,"a typical day at work would be chaotic, I learned to be patient with customers. Management at this location was   not properly trained leaving room for error in the work place. the hardest part of my job would be knowing I could do a better job than most employees. the most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with different people threw out the shift."
bad,"A work shift is always busy. There is always something to be done and we are generally busy helping customers, as well as doing our other responsibilities. Management tends to yell at their employees, they do not have very good communication skills. I really like who I work with in terms of employees and shift supervisors. One thing I have really learned how to do better is to manage my time better so I can get everything done that I need to in the time allotted."
bad,I was Wendy's before the Pilot took over. They came and bumped up all the prices. The company Pilot fired all of the original management to bring in Pilot workers who didn't know anything about the fast food industry. Management is horrible and a company i would never work for Pilot again.
bad,"Horrible place to work, very rude people and superiors. nasty work enviroment"
bad,"very busy on proceed nights, expected to do 50 things when you can only do one. some management mistreats the employees or yells at them to intimidate them. customers are very nasty. co workers make  your day go a whole lot better"
bad,"This was the worst place ive worked so far. Ive never worked around a more immature and greedy group of people who didnt care about anyone. People doing drugs on the job, spitting in the food, touching it with their bare hands. Management at the time was a group of immature dicks. And one mannager thought it was funny to put some one one week into the job, by himself during a rush period."
bad,"Racist management. (they don't hire black people)"
bad,Rude management to customers and co workers . A lot Of Inappropriate Harassment  with the Managers teaching the Co Workers and not getting Paid for the Full hours and Overtime Worked .
bad,This was the last food job i had and it was very unprofessional. i will not put them down. I just wasnt satisfied how the company was being run at the time. it was very unprofessional and there is no other way to explain that. But i did learn how to keep my areas clean and how to always keep the front of my store clean. i also learned about the different types of people that were out there. it was a good experience cause i learned there what type of job i was out there looking for
bad,"The Wendy's I worked at repeatedly broke the rules we were taught not to break, as well as had no room to move up into management and had no hours to give anyone but the people locked into there position."
bad,I had to apply taxes for all sales. I took care of making all flyers and such for all sales.
bad,its a job no room for growth. pay suck and no communication in this company they don't value employees nor management at all
bad,"I gained experience in cash handling, and they worked around my schedule. Sometimes they did get mad that I had to call off for school. You can only move up to shift manager and can only get up to a .50cent raise which is not even worth is because as a regular employee you have the same responsibilities and the only different is that you are basically babysitting and closing the shift. As a regular employee you can earn the same amount of money."
bad,"it was a job. learn to work with cash and obtain customer service skills with customers. learning to work at a fast rate was crucial there. managers were ok, but communication skills were bad, favortisim was bad as well. over all experience there could off been better."
bad,I really don't like working in fast food I needed a job so I  took this one and I don't get very many hours I would like a job that works at least 40 hours a week the mangerment has its picks like any other place some of my co workers  are awesome others not so /the hardest part of my job is getting up at three thirty in the morning.
bad,"flip burgers"
bad,"Well, it's a fast food restaurant. Everyone has to startsomewhere. I'm not ashamed at all, in fact I excelled and prided myself on the fact that I could always provideenoughfood for the lunch and dinner rushes! A great way to learn how to be sanitary, safe, and how to work as a team!"
bad,The management was a mess and the complete year of working there was a waste of time. The benefits I had gotten out of this was that it was my first job and it opened me up to a new world and opportunities.
bad,I was cashier and cook love what i was doing till didnt have a baby sitter had to quit.
bad,typical day you go in keep quiet and get to work you dont have time to talk or youll get yelled at. enjoyable thing is when your off. The hardest day is trying to play nice with everyone.I learned nothing beacuse i knew everything. Management is poor
bad,An environment for people to learn how to work in a face paced environment and they learn how to handle cash.
bad,"The best part of the job is to leave a customer satisfied, but the worst part is running into the rude customers."
bad,"I did not like working there, the managers smoked cigarettes in the office, and did not include you if you did not get involved in drama between other co-workers, you could not just come to work to do your job, i did not feel like that was fair."
bad,Not challenging. The day was slow an manager's Would send us home no bennifits. An no fulltime position's only for management.
bad,"I was young, this was my first job and just wasn't a good experience. and the customers were sometimes rude."
bad,Management is not organized. Lack of workers or too many. Not helpful in getting a new person started. Lack of hours.
bad,They do not take care of their employees especially if they are good workers. They over work you and do not appreciate you. Never hire no workers and depend on people who are not good workers.
bad,No team work what so ever. Bad management no raises or benefits
bad,customer service is my area of expertise. i enjoy helping customers whether it is helping with technical difficulties or even just simply making their food the way they like it.  As a cashier you deal with all kinds of people but my job is to make them smile and for them to return again the next day. I'm proud to speak fluently through the headset and have such a friendly tone of voice i can turn a customer's bad day into good.I've been offered manager positions alot but i am a morning person. Mornings is the time of day that i am mostly energized my co- workers love working with me. I believe the hardest part of my job is having to deal with angry customers. But there is nothing i can't handle. The most enjoyable part of my job is making customers smile and return again.
bad,do yourself a favor and avoid working at any burger joints. you work 10 hours a day with hormonal teenagers who don't work and you never get a raise for working hard(despite the fact that you know how to do everything in the store).
bad,Everything about working here was bad. 100% bad. Management was bad.
bad,Working at wendys was more like working by yourself. No one worked as a team.
bad,It was not a very good place to work. I liked working with people though. I didn't like the fact the management team was so corrupted.
bad,nothing good or bad to say about this job but it was a job and it paid the bills
bad,cook food. learned how to cook food. Management was professional. Hardest part was bus load orders. I enjoyed cooking
bad,"It is dirty and gross, Closing is the worst because you are there until 3am (earliest). There is so much grease and mold in the restaurant, the managers and very unkind, and the employees aren't concerned about customer service at all."
bad,"Unless you're looking for a management job or your first job, I wouldn't suggest it."
bad,I hated this place because the food was never up to par and they had bad roaches which  made it kind of hard to take care of customer because the customer sees the roaches and I cant explain
bad,a typical day was going in to work. setup your employer where you where putting people. then check the store to make sure it was clean.check to see how busy it may get.  buy checking sales from the year before. they helping employes. to make the food. and doing what needs to be done for everything to go right. people you work with sometimes gave you  a hard time. if they did what to do something. the hardest part as fast food manager is work 50 to 60 hours a week on salary. and work crazy times. one day you may work from 4:45 am to 6pm. they the next day 3pm to 3am the next day 11am to 10pm that the shifts you may get you did know what crazy stuff you would get. you could work 3pm to 4am have off then have to work the next day at 4:45am to 5pm  that not a day off. sometimes not getting on more then 4 0r 5 hours of sleep in between shifts. and getting pay next to noting for all time you put in. i could not there was noithing enjoyable about that job.
bad,"Wendys is a cool job for young teenage kids, but for someone with children of their own trying to support a family is too much for Wendys. I liked working there but there are lot of things I also did not like at the job."
bad,"Hours were bad, management was awful, and the benefits were awful"
bad,depends on the day if busy day or a slow one. discounts on food. cool management staff
bad,Supervisors had a lot of favoritism among employees creating a low quality work environment.
bad,"My day would start by having to cook the food, as well as maintain all of the trash, and do any of the pohysical lifting tasks becuase there was never another male scheduled to work at the same times. Management lacked the leadership needed to establish a smooth working environment. Hardest part of the job was that I was expected to cloe and not leave until 330 am then be back to open at 630 am. The best part of the jobe was when I turned in my notice."
bad,"Management didnt follow guidelines, really mean about breaks and hard to work with. Maybe different with everyone???"
bad,"hard staying energized in a hot environment, i learned how to runthe whole store, management had favorites who they give hours too, co-workers was rude and disrespectful, hardest was everything, nothing was enjoyable working for wendys"
bad,had good people working here but upper management was horrinle very little room to advance
bad,"open and closed store"
bad,Racist manager who still works there and no trainin. Schedule you to work four hours a week but will tell you to clock out when your shift isn't even over.
bad,I really like workn at wendys  it kool to go into work in work with different people everyday and to see who u can make smile in make there day better by sayn something nice to them in have a conversation with them . in askn them how there day was .I learned that everyone is different from each other In there on way .everyone learn different things in different ways .management can be fun some times but not all the time it can be stressful most of the time but you just have to make the best of it .and just do what you got to do to hang in the .co workers they can be a mess when they wont to you have to guide them in the right derection  in help them understand things in how they go.i got to say the hardest part of the day is dealing with crazy people that come in there messed up in talkn crazy to everyone other than that its just a nother day at work.i think just being there to help each other out in learning new things in meeting new people .in showing them that you care I apreate them in what they do .
bad,I absolutely did not enjoy working for Wendy's. At the time I worked here the managers were very rude as well as the employees. I felt discriminated against at Wendy's when I was employed here.
bad,Worst job I ever had because of the people and environment i will nevr work at other fast food place again
bad,restaurant is now closed it was a fast food job.. busy and hot
bad,"Childish managers. 20 managers..store, general, night, day, fry, salad, front, back, etc. They do not mentor or teach. Only criticize and make fun of you. Ruined my zest for work."
bad,"do not work for them they are not ethicly appropriate. uiyiughjgjhg"
bad,"A day working for a fast food company was awful, but doing it for six months I acquired knowledge and increased in my skills. I learned I was a bit over qualified for this position and found myself unhappy in the position I was hired for. I was to be moved to management within the company but I chose not to stay for lack of benefits and high expectations for low wages. The management team had strong but more weak points. Scheduling was always put up the day before the new week was to start, new hires were incompetent teenagers. They could be fun to work with for laughs and a good time, but that is not what I was there for.  The hardest part of the job was the constant rush that was placed on everything. The procedures they expected in the manner of time they expected placed my level of stress to it's max for low pay and nothing else.  I have asked myself many times what did I enjoy about the position and I have always come to the same answer of nothing. I did not enjoy anything to do with the job, managers, or requirements they demanded. I felt treated as a child when I am a hard working adult with much to offer to any deserving company."
bad,"As Wendys Crew Chief  I was trained in all positions from: grill, fry station, sandwich station, front counter and the drive through. In addition to the station i would be working at that day it was my job to keep my team on task and motivated, as well as assigning a different cleaning task for that day."
bad,Rude employees starting confusion in the workplace with other employees.
bad,"a very harassing place to work, managers are snooty for the most part, you need to have depression pills to even bear working there, you will be cut hours if they don't like you. "
bad,"the woman who was owner operator stole from counselors, lied and stolle from clients. horrible place to work"
bad,The business is slow. People always pick McDonald's over it!
bad,I was ok working for this company at the beginning but then you find out that the management at the time was crooked and it was not an ending that was wanted. Not bad on my part but for there sake
bad,Working as a manager for this company requires you to have no life outside of work. You will be required to work 10 hour days with no breaks. There will be many times when you get home at two in the morning after closing and need to be back in at nine that very same morning. Raises are only 1% every year regardless of how well or poorly you do on your performance evaluation.
bad,It was fast paced and hard to keep up. It was a good job to have to learn new ropes.
bad,"making sandwiches, cooking the fries and chicken nuggets and fingers,"
bad,"Being a manager for Wendy's is an easy and on the go job. The job has its ups and downs but, what job doesn't?"
bad,I did not like anything or anyone at this particular job. Everyone was rude the employees and customers.
bad,i was made to clean the fool with chilly pots and the thereten to fire me if i did not the meat is not cool the manager was racist
bad,"This job was very unpleasant because almost every single person didn't want to be there.  These people were there because they were high school students and didn't have many options, or just because they were uneducated and couldn't find another place of employment.  I learned that I definitely wanted to get an education so that I could better myself and not end up working in a dead end job where no education was required. Also, you only are paid minimum wage so it is very difficult to make a living on such a small amount of money, even if you work the maximum 40 hours a week."
bad,"I worked at the Wendy's in Haverford, Pa in April of 2013- August of the same year. It was my first job and the experience there was horrible. The managers does not know how to treat the employees at all and are sometimes just absolutely ""nasty"" (disrespectful) to the customers, especially the ones who aren't regulars."
bad,Wendys Food service is a work place that has a lot of problems between having reliable people working there to having there management slack at their jobs on respect for their crew members and making the work place easy to work in. Would not recommend to anyone to work for wendys.
bad,Was lied to when initially hired about schedule. was hired told I would work days. They had posted hiring for all positions and hours. As a single mother of three I cried to my manager stating I couldn't Managers take many breaks while skip or rush crew breaks.
bad,"When the day starts its 7 am and many people aren't awake. It wasn't a promblem for me. I would get coffee and a snack for my co workers. Then the crew is alive. We would challege each other in sandwitch making and it had to be neat and wrapped correctly. Also it was fun getting a great speed of service. That was important because most people had 30 minutes breaks. Customers would come to Wendys because they wouldn't have to wait long for lunch and can get back to work on time. So it would work out for everyone, customers and crew members. Now if the crew didn't meet our goal for the day and if we had 1 unhappy customer, we would find the problem, see what can be done differently or what wasn't done correctly. After that ,the following day we correct the issue. So this is the life of an crewleader at Wendys!"
bad,"N/a"
bad,Working at wendy's at first was okay; my main manager was a really good guy but the environment the shift managers and other employees made was horrible. It was constant yelling at someone and it was just stressful all around.
bad,Wendy's on main street in Richmond Indiana wasn't my best experience. they only worked me three days in one month. Everyday that i did work they only worked me for two hours and plus sent me home early. I did manage to learn how to work the registers. the hardest part about working at wendy's was being the new girl that didn't know much about work. Wendy's was my first job and i was nervous as can be but i got used to it and got the hang of the job.their was really nothing to enjoy about Wendy's due to cocky managers and co-workers with really bad attitudes.
bad,"Make food take orders"
bad,"the managers just stood and watched me work in a slammed drive thru, we were short handed to being with, they didnt call anybodys else in. i got stung by a bee while i was taking orders at 930 at night. my drive thru was so backed up that i was starting to get complaints that i was taking to long, i had to take orders, make drinks, bag my orders, take money and stock my area. I would never work for them again in this lifetime. My whole store was spanish and most of them refused to speak english me a white woman. my store manager was also spanish and she would come up to me speaking spankish telling me to do stuff, i could not understand, and when i was hired it was not a requirement to speak more then english."
bad,"First of all when i first was hired i did the manager a solid and came in on the spot then never saw the man for the first week. then when i tried to get my paycheck he didn't file the paperwork so i had to track him down for my measly min wage part time paycheck, then when i got another job i was given and ultimatum between jobs. bad place to work"
bad,"hectic, no team players,very unprofessional manager as well as dishonest. only one dependable co-worker,hardest part of the job was having to do everything alone.the most enjoyable part of the job was leaving to go home."
bad,"The location on Cherry Rd is not a good store to work for. The GM  is vindictive, unprofessional and lacks the proper support for his crew. He works strictly by favoritism and 7 out of 10 new hires he personally knows. Hard work and perfect attendance are not valued at this location."
bad,i like working for Wendy but it is not the bomb becuase I am not proerly trained to do certain
bad,Management treated me very poorly and did not properly distribute their employees to where they were needed.
bad,"Was hired as cashier/cook, then got placed as a lot attendant as a temporary replacement for someone who was suspended for a month due to a drug test failure. I was asked to leave the day that that employee came back, because there would be too many people there. This happened to several temporary (in which we didn't know) employees."
bad,"Could not stand the management there, it did not matter what you did you always were at fault for something, it was not worth the money for the agrevation"
bad,our resturant was always clean but we always had ppl complainng for free food. the manager was rude she didnt evn know how to do anything how she got the position as manager idk.
bad,"Personal no idóneo para las tareas. Empleadores irrespetuosos, engreídos y explotadores"
bad,"Do not care to ever work in a fast food environment again."
bad,worked there for year and half with no raises. got yelled at for asking for one.
bad,"Not too bad, reallt depends on the manager. I was unlucky my manager was not so nice so I had to leave."
bad,My first job and not the best! I loved helping people get the food they wanted at top quality but team work wasn't there.
bad,I hate this job. They work you very hard with very little pay. It is gross and extremely unclean and the managers like to act like little children.
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's is horrible, what I've learned is people get in your business. The management is horrible, co-workers are rude and the job is difficult cause nobody does there job. There is no enjoyable day at Wendy's."
bad,Poor Manangement. Some of the co workers were the best part of the job.
bad,"i will never go back to working a fast food job. the air is terribly ridden with oils and grease and will make you break out and crave fattening food. You will barely ever get raise and when you do, it is mere pennies."
bad,"A typical day at work was standing for hours in the front while getting yelled at by the manger. "
bad,ring up customers orders and then make change and hand it out to them
bad,like any typical fast food restaurant. slow customers even slower workers
bad,very caotic  mangagement is poor learned what not to do. most favorite part of job was the customers
bad,"fast paced 8 hr job with fun crew. hardest part schedule,best part hours. flexible management."
bad,I regularly ran the grill but I also ran the cash register. The majority of the managers are very difficult to work with.
bad,"I love wendys and the establishment itself, working there though wasnt the best experience. But every experience is different. my co workers made the days a little easier because we had a really good group of individuals."
bad,Did not like the atmosphere. Did not feel like it was a healthy environment.
bad,the management isn't good at all no one communicated with me i was fired for a false no call no show and i would go in on the days i was scheduled then be told i am not needed for the day and be sent home by the manager that was running the store this has happened more than 2 times after driving 8 miles from home
bad,There was always negativity and they didnt care about their employees.
bad,take the customers order and make sure that they have everything that they need before leaving the restaurant
bad,Was well respected by co-workers and enjoyed being able to manage this group of employees.
bad,I didn't care to work at Wendy's. I stopped woking there after a manager tried to make me pick up a used feminine product.
bad,"it is fairly busy"
bad,Management was very harsh and rude to all workers in front of customers. A typical day at work involved trying to keep my composure and felt like I was walking on eggshells everyday.
bad,"nothing special, my first job and first learning experience"
bad,I'm not fit for working in fast food restaurants its not my cup of tea.  The things I've seen and heard were ridiculous and I'd never work there again
bad,"I have nothing nice to say, so I prefer to remain silent. Tough job with no room for error. I got called in several times at 7 AM after getting off at 2 AM for silly things. Ultimately, I got let go for filling out the temperature log book on the wrong day. (I was off the day I filled in, meaning that another manager did not fill it out as well)."
bad,"very good for experience, really enjoyed the environment. its a wonderful place to learn customer service skills"
bad,"Everytime you get to work, sometimes the manager hasn't made the schedule up yet and you never knew when yu were going to work that week or not! And when other workers would come in, and it wasn't just me, but when the manger or assistant manager would come in, the co-workers would seem to be in a funk. You couldn't move because during rush hours of food serivce they would be in the way, and we couldn't do our job fast like normal. They come come, it would slow our service down probably by 10-12%."
bad,Telemarketing is not my dream.. no close out deals not enough hours and poor business matter but I made it thru the years to get by...
bad,I enjoyed talking to my coustomers every day. I worked a 50 to 70 hour.  I conducted training every day with the crew and managers.
bad,Unprofessional best way to describe. horrible management hard to get ahead. Was like high school.
bad,the store I was at. managers were not very nice. they made up an excuse just to fire you instead of letting you know the store was going down
bad,"They do not follow policy, but instead use intimidation to carry out the necessary functions that are involved in a fast food industry. I find this appalling due to the fact that the majority of the crew that are hired are teenagers who also have the stress of their own school and family life. If I could give no star-I would, unfortunately I had to lie and put one star next to the company."
bad,"its was okay, needed better pay, needed more hours, employers need to be more motivated."
bad,"its not a growing environment and no benefits, the customers are rude and sometimes wrong but management has a hard time understanding that and one can easily get revoked because your"
bad,"exciting job , customers were wonderful. manager was not professionl"
bad,Wendy's was a fast paced environment with little chanceds of advancement.
bad,was fun working with variety of people and meeting wide variety of people daily
bad,The store manager is terrible and you would not like working there. You beliefs and values are put to side for others
bad,I hated this job the staff were soo rude. it was a messy job. I don't want anybody to work for this job.
bad,A typical day at work for me basically allowed me to progress in my customer service skills. I learned how to work at a very fast pace and my co-workers were very friendly we work as a team if we saw another team member struggling we would help out. I really didn't have a hard time at work other than when I got a difficult customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others and giving fast friendly service.
bad,"I felt disappointed at each turn with this company. They don't appreciate any employee and I was told time and time again that it didn't matter if someone quit because there would always be someone out there willing to get the job done for the lowest amount of pay. Any crew that had been there a long time were harassed until they quit simply because they were paid to much. Also, when the Obama care requirements came out instead of reporting honest needs of the company they insisted that we cut all employees to below 28 hrs and simply find more to fill in the blanks. If the blanks weren't filled or someone went over on hours, the owner was very fond of making a single person stand up and be ridiculed because they had taken away the resources needed to run a good shift. "
bad,move around too much in different positions that you aren't or haven't received training for!
bad,Way too many late nights. There was no team work involved meaning that my co-workers were no help. Management was horrible because they show no authority and they have their favorites. Learned that customer service can be enjoyable. The most enjoyable part was eating free food
bad,"I performed all the basic duties from taking orders, running the register, cleaning. learned how to do the register. I was not there for that every long I didn't know that every many people. there was no hard part about this job."
bad,"A typical day at the job would consist of changing job stations multiple times (from cashier to fry station etc.), working with customers, fixing and serving food, coordinating, running the cash register, taking drive thru orders, maintaining a clean store etc. i worked wherever i was needed. I learned how to work at the fry station, the grill, I learned how to show my great customer service skills daily, I learned how to tolerate things i felt were wrong. Management at my job was horrible, It made it a very uncomfortable work environment, my GM disrespected us and belittled us as employees which led up to me resigning. My co-workers were great, we worked together and made a great team and despite management we found ways to get through the day together and still leave our place of work smiling. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management and favoritism in the work place. the most enjoyable part of the job was having conversations with the customers, they were awesome."
bad,"Worked short staffed most of the time.  Management was childish, they played around too much.  Employees were not dependable, high turnover rate.  The hardest part of the job was to run shifts short-handed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was punching out at the end of my shift."
bad,"They do not abide by the Employment Standards Act."
bad,"store opened late at times. greeted customers and took orders, got trained on new station. People there were very racist and not cooperative with one another. I was in line for shift manager. Hardest part was to listen to the cruel remarks. The customers."
bad,This job wasn't for me to much for to little not enough hours poor communication and management didnt help.
bad,"cook, clean, manage money, sandwich maker. made salads. helped management balance registers."
bad,"A typical day working in the fast food business is very hectic you are literally overly busy from the time you walk in until the time you leave. Even though Wendy's isn't my ideal job it has taught me many things. I have many food certifications and also because of working in such crazy situations I also learned how to handle people/customers in general, I would consider myself very people oriented and I make every visit very personable to all the customers. I loved and helped every single on of my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my day at Wendy's would probably have to be my break"
bad,"Unload and stock shipment, count inventory, costumer service, prep and rotation"
bad,"buisness wasnt ran correctly. bad manegment,lach of hours and communication with maneger"
bad,"Terrible work expeirence, managers suck, wages suck. Dont get paid enough for the work."
bad,"It's a good job for students, work was hard and always busy & rude and nasty management even the district manager , but I met some great co workers."
bad,"- if you're a ""colored"" person you get mistreated there. the manager is mainly the one who's against ""colored"" people. it was hard for me being there and dealing with the bullying the manager did to me."
bad,The only I found positive was interacting with the customers. At that particular store they needed a lot of help.
bad,"overall restaurant operations"
bad,"Fast Food was not a good field of work for me with no benefits."
bad,"my typical day at work, always working over or working my off days because they have no one to work hardly. i learned managers will say they are going to do something just to get you to work over and then when it comes down to it, it dont happen. co-workers- some are really hard working, others are as lazy as can be and dont even need to be on the schedule period. the hardest part of my job was washing all the dishs in the hole store, but it kept me busy. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers smile because of their service they recieved. The main manager of the store messes up checks every payday. my last check had 13 hours missing from it because of her mess up. not only mine does she mess up, but others also. not just once in a blue moon either. she doesnt have enough people staffed therefore, she expects every one to stay over or come in every day they are supppose to be off to cover shifts, she should hire better people then she would not have that problem."
bad,Its Not Organized Went There And On My First Day She Lost All My Documents Had To Wait Two Days To Start. On Second Week I Found Out They Had Rodents. We Found A Rat Eating They Bread And They Refused To Throw Away The Bread. They Commanded Us To Continue Serving The Bread.. After That I Quit.
bad,"Handled customers"
bad,job that i got after moving to everett hated every minit i worked there. I walked out. and i need to type more stuped computer im not even going to spell chekc this so ha
bad,this was my first job back 2002. I was in high school and I needed money in my pocket.
bad,Wendy's has quality food but the prices are ridiculous. Minimum wage for the attitudes/ drama from workers and customers you have to endure is NOT worth it.
bad,"*was very hard to get along with the workers not very good training."
bad,"Typical day consisted of manual labor with inventory, and good customer service. I learned how to be accurate and punctual with your work. Management team was good to help the flow of operation. Co-workers made work worth coming to. The hardest part of the job was maintaining service drive-thru time. The most enjoyable moment was the rush hours."
bad,"I would take peoples orders, perform bathroom and dining room cleaning. I learned alot about the Wendy's franchise. The management was very poor, and the co workers would always get in to altercations with each other. The hardest part of working there is learning how to deal with different peoples attitudes. The most enjoyable was getting a thank you and a smile "
bad,At Wendy's the fast pace was a constant factor. I loved to greet people and take there orders. there was never room for a dull moment. The list of responsibilities was never ending and there was always something to do right up until it was time to go home.
bad,clean tables chairs bathrooms floors windows and counters
bad,needs improvement in all areas. Dont work here unless you have to.
bad,This job wasnt very good. They paid in cash. and took out my taxes but most of it didnt make since to me. I enjoyed my client but not the management.
bad,"wendys fue mi primer trabajo como tal aprendi a sacar ordenes a los clientes, saber la temperatura de cada producto la calidad... el trato era muy agradable la parte mas difícil era cuando me abollaba en cuanto a los pedidos me gustaba mucho ya que siempre trabajábamos en equipo nos ayudábamos en conjunto"
bad,"Starting your shift is most times also finishing the last crew members shift. "
bad,I am 24 and have had three fast food jobs. This was the worst job I have had in my life. Often at work til 2am+ and doing back breaking work. This was in 2007 though so I hope some of the problems have been fixed.
bad,Super bad!!! the whole place was just out of order. You never get overtime and if your getting close to 35 hours they start sending you home even if they schedule for 35 hours. Poor!!!
bad,"full or part time"
bad,bad workplace an so are the supervisors.. I hated it an the people I worked with alot of discrimation an everything else the district manager made a pregnant lady go into labor after breatheing nasty fumes 
bad,don't like working fast food but I worked there as I was going to truck driving school
bad,Constant call outs poor management pay is not competitive for the amount of work required
bad,"A typical day at work for me is clocking into work at 7:00 am preparing salads assisting customers at 10:00 am introducing new products ,customer service,taking orders and what I learned would being communicative and eye to eye contact. The managers are very in order, I enjoy new co-workers we get and current workers we work as one big group when getting the work done but , there isn't really no hard part about the job and being to enjoy the customer visit    achieving the duties that's required are most enjoyable about the job."
bad,"I excelled in my duties at this job, however, the staff nor the management was very friendly nor organized."
bad,"When i first started there the managers and other employees were nice fun teaching what to do stuff like that. But it was very much if you didn't get in with the ""cool kids"" they were nice in front of you and bad talking you to management for no reason. To me it felt very much like I was surrounded by a bunch of high school kids. But i enjoy working for Wendy's because i feel they do have some of the best food."
bad,"The company is great, the establishment i was at was a complete waste of anyones time."
bad,Wendys was a great learning experience. I learned how to prepare different kinds if food. I also had fun working work the manament and staff. Wendys gave people a chanc to work in a good place.
bad,The management was lazy and they blamed it all on there employees.
bad,the job was easy but the management sucked. felt unneeded and like i was never doing a good job but i was. i did what i was told and i got put on dishes a lot for no reason
bad,i did not like this place i was very uncomfortable and i was treated very poorly by the employees and customers
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked! The managers are lazy and inapporpriate with their staff. They never ordered enough stock and honestly I don't think they even cared when we ran out of stock. They were terrible at dealing with customer complaints and especially worse at dealing with concerns from staff members. There was a lot of fooling around going on constantly and long waiting times for customers to receive their food. The staff doesn't work well together and are very disorganized. As for rewards for being a good worker, it doesn't exist. They randomly choose their employee of the month. The supervisors are the WORSE. Too many personal relationships between staff members, especially the supervisors with crew members. A lot of bullying (name calling, teasing, swearing, sexual comments and unwanted advances) in which none of the supervisors or managers did anything about. Staff members rarely follow proper proceedures unless head office is there. Very unsafe and unclean! I wouldn't eat the food served at this restaurant. "
bad,not enough hours during the week. Give hours to the wrong people. rude employees 
bad,"I did not enjoy myself there, for some reason The crew and management did not like me. Even the customers noticed it and gave me the advice to quite. One customer gave me a pray card. My sister who does not look anything like me came in as a customer and witness their abuse towards me, she told me later it made her cry. I believed her because when she retold the story to here friend she started to cry then."
bad,I worked very hard and it was very repetitious. They depended on me to cut lettuce every single day and it was wear and tear on my hand and wrist. I disliked that about the job the most. People constantly called out of work and we were constantly low staffed on most days of business.
bad,I would come in and there would be not enough people working so I would have to do 2 or 3 people's job at once. The co-workers were rude and they tried to get you in trouble. The management was inexperienced and they really didn't do anything except for yell. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the negativity coming from co-workers and guests.
bad,A typical day at work is prepping all the food for the day.
bad,Typical day at work would be opening the store at 4:45am. Making sure everything is ready by 6am. Making sandwiches and prepping food.
bad,"trained the new crew that came in,mostly closed the store,very late shifts,allot of cleaning"
bad,it was ok place to work. nothing relly differnt then other fast food joints
bad,"Quite possibly the worst job in existance, I am glad to have had this experience as my first ""paid"" job - because it showed me where I DON'T want to be in life."
bad,i loved working there. the bosses were nice and the crew was exceptional.
bad,at wendys i was always on a till. i learned more about till work. management lacked in skills. my coworkers were nice. the hardest part was teaching myself everything. the most enjoyable part was interactiong with new people
bad,"Very unprofessional and rude, workers did no work at all, and management treated employees wrong"
bad,a typical day at working is dealing with the customers and taking their orders.
bad,"Wendy's was ok for my first job as a teenager. But, I would not go work there again."
bad,i made alot food for people and done trucks too. I put it away too.
bad,"I def did not enjoy this job, the company values and morals are no where close to what they should be."
bad,At Wendy's it seemed to be more about speed and not providing good customer service.
bad,it a very fast job and your have to it be quick in everything you do. this job also help u bulid great customer service.
bad,"bad customer service, employees treated poorly"
bad,fast paced lunch hour
bad,No work hours. Lazy employees. I was forced to work a station I was not trained on and was constantly hassled if I messed up. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Management was not very good at all.
bad,for having 5 managers they cant keep a good schedule. they called me in for an 11:30. sent me on lunch a half hr later and then sent me home a half hr after lunch. i called to get schedule and one manager said i wasnt working that day. called in the next day and a different manager said i was supposed to be at work the previous day and it was marked as a no call/no show. its also very dirty. dont throw out food when supposed to. its been 3 weeks since i quit and im still waiting for my last check in the mail...
bad,I worked the midnight shift. I learned how to keep myself busy with little customer flow. I would do projects around the store so that the store would be maintained on a regular basis when the store was busy during regular hours. I worked with different people that often came from colorful backgrounds and we all got along very well.
bad,The mgr on night shift was awful plus had to drive thirty miles one way to work.
bad,very bad hours low pay. bad management. typical fast food place.
bad,"the managers there are bad morally and other ways i have seen non- washing of hands, poor hygienic people handle peoples food with no care"
bad,responsible for 25 crew members and 4 managers accountability forecasting scheduling budget
bad,"I would come in for the lunch rush. I started on fries and nuggets and moved to bagging the to the back window/dishwasher. I didn't really learn anything at this job. The management was really bad. They were forgetful, gossipy, unprofessional people. My co-workers weren't that bad. We worked well as a team. The hardest part of the job was being short staffed and having confusion or a backup in the drive-thru. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we got orders out on time."
bad,"i was in training at the time learning for a new store that was going to open. Learning the cash register was the hardest, everyone gave me a hard time, did not like this job at all."
bad,"Typical day is 14-16 hours with maybe two employees, five employees during lunch if you can hire them."
bad,Although I was consistently in the top 5 stores according to P&L goals and the top 10 according to the QSC inspection ranking I was constantly made to feel that it was never good enough and eventually became disillusioned with the company (Meritage Hospitality Group) and its outlook.
bad,"Honestly, if I could find a better job around here I would, and I plan on leaving there as soon as I find a better one."
bad,Worst Work environment ever
bad,Very fast paced with a lot of angry customers at times. I learned how to handle rude customers also how to multitask at work. My co-workers and manager were easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was the long hours I worked. For example I used to work like 15hour shifts. The most enjoyable part of my job was that is was my first job and it was fun to me at that time.
bad,The job was a place where I worked with friendly people but the company itself is not one that I like.
bad,Wasn't flexible with work and school for me.
bad,management sucks they have no idea what they are doing. they dont pay well and do not follow state and government guidelines on breaks
bad,A typical day at work we were always understaffed and we suffered heavily from this. I could run every position and was sometimes forced to run them all at the same time because there were never enough employees on the clock.
bad,"I had a great crew!! I learned how to prepare a schedule differently, there wasnt a gm there at all times so I basically ran the restaurant when I was there."
bad,i WAS QUITE STAYED TO MYSELF DID WHAT I WAS TOLD ANS BUSTED MY BUT FOR THEM WHILE I WAS STILL IN SCHOOL PREGNENT NO CAR WALKING TO WORK AND GOT THERE ON TIME.WHEN I HAD A PROBLEM AND TOOK IT TO MANAGEMENT THEY DID NOT HANDLE IT HOW I THOUGHT THEY TOOK ME FOR A JOKE AND TOLD THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED WITH ME WHAT I TOLD THEM FIGURING EVERY BODY WAS REALLY CLOSE AND SOME FAMILLY I THOUGHT THEY WHERE GANGING UP ON ME THEY DID NOT GIVE ME A plesent work exp. plus that was my first job ever and they didnt even go through the whole proceedure to hire some one the right way it made me never wanting to work for any fast food ever again i mean im unemployed now and i know with out a dought i can get hired quick doing fast food but thanks to my first job wendys i say No no im a single mother who stay to herself most of the time but do what im told in my work place and i feel shouldent go through anything like that again
bad,they dont care about anybody but there self and there are time that we would not get paid
bad,"work together and getting things done, work schedules to fit with life style."
bad,Took care of customers needs
bad,They were a good company to work with at first but once new manegment takes over they get rid of all employees with tenure.
bad,"A typical day at wendy's is like a typical day in high school. drama, gossips, vulgar language, and near phyical fights at work. Ghetto, yuck!"
bad,"Wendy's is seriously the worst job I have had in my life. Every single day you would go in and they would over work you and under pay you. Most of the people there don't speak english which makes it even more difficult to work. Management was terrible, but can't blame them - its a terrible company. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the management. Nothing was enjoyable. What I learned after working there is to appreciate every job you have."
bad,I love working with people but the management team there is terrible. So therefore the store is very unstable with workers so they cant produce great results.
bad,The crew members ran this store. Many of them did not have a diploma and never had a fear of losing their jobs. The managers had very little control over the employees.
bad,i couldn't stand working there the pay was low the people sucked.the days were long..
bad,The harder i worked the more i was told to stop and i wasnt doing my duties corect if i was working.
bad,i didn't enjoy working there. the hours were bad and the managment was not very nice.
bad,"taking orders, making sandwich, etc..... how to work fast everyone worked good together had to ask to go to the bathroom, talking to customers"
bad,It is a good job good pay long hours it get hot in their sometime and cool somrtime to
bad,"a typical day at work starts with me clocking in, then i make sure my station is clean fully stocked and ready to rock in roll. I learned how to work in a fast pace environment, how to handle any situations calmly dealing with customer making sure at the end they leave with a smile on thier faces. the management is just fine i like the management because they make sure all of their employees are okay,happy and and ready to work. I have fun working with my co-workers interacting with them working together so that the customers get good and fast service. the hardest part of the job was actually nothing everything that i was taught i was able to pick it up and apply as i worked day to day. The most enjoyable part of the job is basically having it and getting payed so that i can take care of home."
bad,"No break room, short breaks, lazy management and lazy co-workers. Hardest part of the job was cleaning for everyone because no one else wanted to."
bad,No matter how well you worked or how respectful you were to the managers you still were treated badly.
bad,"The best part about this job is the costumers. The employee's are very silly and imature, the management team are VERY rude and inconsiderate of it's employees and there personal feelings or well being. The pay for such emotionally heavy work is embarrassingly low."
bad,to get you started in a great customer services management is okay not that great to work with
bad,"A typical day at work: I would clock in at 5 then I would go back and get my register and sign it in. I then would make sure that my side would be stocked, which it should be if the other person is leaving. I then , would ask for the next customer. After getting all the customer attened. I then would get my rag and walk out to the dining room and take all the trays that the customers used. I would take them to the back and clean them off and replace the paper. I would also try to help out with other positions if all my work was done. While I was working , I learned that you will always come across rude people, and you just have to know to keep a smile on your face. I believed that the management group could have done a better job. My co-workers were the best. They made me want to go to work. That was the most enjoyable part of the job, and the other part is being able to chat with our senior customers."
bad,"The stores are so Filthy,they serve out of date food, the management sucks, the pay like everywhere else sucks and the stores are way to out of date. I was a manager there for 8months. I worked in three different locations during that time. I would know."
bad,"Drama, immaturity, false promises, incompetant employees on all levels. If you need a job for the sake of having a job, work here. If you need a fulfilling career or even a fulfilling temporary position, look elsewhere."
bad,"Wendy's itself seems to be a great company but the one I personally worked for in Slidell, LA was horrible. They don't care about their employees or management, they have no morals and very low pay."
bad,i was wrongly let go when i came off medical leave. i wopuld not go back
bad,"Working at Wendy's was not fun. Sure you learn about the history of the company, which had a good idea at first when the food was still made with quality. But at the Wendys I worked at, I was the only one going to college yet they called me stupid. I am a vegetarian so they purposely made me pour the blood out of the trash cans and wash them. When you work the money window, nothing is sanitary. You are cutting raw meat and sure you're suppose to wash your hands but if you are in charge of the window, you have to be there when the customer is there or else. So you can be dealing money with salminila on your hands. It's really something, from the side of the counter where the customer stands, there is an illusion of a reasturant, but behind the counter it is just a factory. You have to wash the dishes as fast as possible. Most of the time, the dishes still had raw meat attatched to them after they were washed and then reused. They didn't care, they didn't want me to make sure the dishes were really clean, they just wanted me to make sure the sink was clear. The floors made me want to vomit because they looked like they were covered in it. Everyone was very negative. They made specific hours for me to work and I came in when I was suppose to. When I told them that my shift was ending soon, they told me no, I had to work until 10 without me having a say in it. Which would be making me work more than 20 hours which is considered full time and when you work full time you get more money per the hour than part time which they would not be giving me so I walked out. I just want you to"
bad,my six years their i was offred a shift mangement position.as a cashier i would also order taker greet guest stock position
bad,They have no care or concern for the employees they over work you they hire people that don’t work they are messy and drama in the work place and they don’t knowledge your achievement
bad,"The management team showed favoritism and a lack of authority."
bad,"Will make you choose between your family (child) and them. I work my 50 hrs and often found my child at work with me because of their high demands. More like 75-90hrs a week. Was often stuck running my store and other locations on top of my own.. If I ever had to do it again, I would never work for Wendy’s. They could not keep managers or employees. Massive turn over and they do nothing to improve."
bad,"I worked here as a summer college job to get some money for my textbooks and other necessities for class. The GM was never there, and when he was there he would sit in the office from open to 12 when lunch rush was happening and just leave. I was mainly a cashier but due to management either sitting in the back room or deciding to only do sandwiches, I also had to drop fries, coordinate drive thru and front register AND take orders at the same time. I was even yelled at if I wasnt fast enough to help drive thru while taking orders for the front counter! I was scheduled to work 8 hour shifts as a part time employee and would be kept for roughly 12 to 13 hours on the weekends because there weren't enough employees scheduled and half of the time no one even showed up. At least I got paid overtime, I guess."
bad,"Working at Wendy's for a complete year was a okay experience. It gotten worse when they gave me hours that disrupted my school and sleep schedule. From 8pm-4am one day to the next 3pm when o get out of school til 2am. It got really hard.  Honestly picking up everyone's slack operating multiple stations at once (drive thru,  fry station,  the. Doing i"
bad,Job is good for kids starting to work and learning about saving money. its a very learning experience wendys is a good place to work if you love to talk to people and are a people person
bad,"Wouldn’t suggest this place for anyone to work at. They have way to high expectations that can’t be met, there higher ups don’t care about you, just money for the company"
bad,"Mucho egoísmo, poco trabajo en equipo ,mala administración y cero beneficios."
bad,Some of the managers are helpful but others not so much. I am not happy as an employee there no more. I dread going to work everyday. It stinks there.
bad,"They only care about themselves and getting money. If you’re sick they don’t care they make you work, if you need time to yourself they don’t care. They change your schedule behind your back, they make you stay late when you have plans and threaten to fire you, they mess up so many payments. They ripped me off for 20.5 hours and still haven’t fixed my check. I wouldn’t work here most horrible experience ever. Only thing good is the free drinks."
bad,"Good way to learn to get out of your comfort zone with people and get used to talking to people. Not good pay for the amount of work put in, and if you’re a teenager working here prepare to no be respected."
bad,"Ugh, it’s sucks, just plain sucks everything is a one star!! Management horrible, GM has horrible memory pay is the worst for the amount of work needed to be done, literally we have to clean air vents and spray the walls, while operating with 5 or less workers with crowds of 30 or more excluding drive through!"
bad,"no employee recognition awards. no yearly review or raises. very stressful. management is rude and unprofessional. would not get full time hours even if you were hired for full time, which left a lot of people to find second jobs. when you changed availability to make a living and juggle both jobs, they would not adjust your hours accordingly and would schedule you beyond your availability. and if they should ever call you at home to pick up a shift, heaven forbid you are unable to answer their call, now you just lost more hours on your next schedule"
bad,"It was the worst job i have had, the crew was very hostile with eachother, i was poorly managed, the hardest part of the job was working until 3 am, with school the next morning."
bad,There's no growth for advancement anymore And there's no overtime so I wanna leave. And find a better opportunity somewhere else And more money & days.
bad,"I had been a crew member at Wendy’s for about a year and a half to two years.  I had worked up to being a manager in training prior to my former General Manager being terminated. My District Manager has entered me into the serve safe class for that following December.  We finally received a new General Manager about a month without one, with the other mangers including me and the District Manager, when she came in she told me that I was not in training to be a manger that she had all of her managers and that the only reason I was put in was because my former General Manager had put me in.   But that was failed and she didn’t want to listen to anything that I had to say and I was not going to put up with being talked to that was and told that I wasn’t old enough for the position when I fact I am, I am 19 years old"
bad,"The crew and their managers were disrespectful, thought they were better than everyone else. Physically put their hands on you. Take sides. It's all just a bunch of games up there, if you ask me."
bad,Managers sat in the office playing games texting. Most workers like myself had to do multiple jobs within one shift. Terrible place to work. Would not recommend at all.
bad,"Working here was good to stay busy and earn some money, but it was not a good environment. A lot of the employees there were related and/or dating or married. So they got a lot of the hours and got away with breaking a lot ethics of the job."
bad,"Poor manager . Discrimination. "
bad,When I first worked there I never thought I'd work there as long as I did. When I moved down south the entire Starboard Wendy's franchise took advantage of me and I didn't find it right.
bad,You work with a bunch of dysfunctional people including management! The pay sucks and barely any benefits ! They work you to the core and don’t want to give any raises
bad,"The Supervisors lie on their employees."
bad,"People as in fellow crew members are amazing. Management has no clue about how to manage people effectively. Punish people for being late, or calling in sick. Could be working 40 hours per week but if you call in sick go down to 20. Be careful if you get pregnant. My gf was called useless because she refused to bend as per doctors orders. Also if you stick up for yourself ei. Your rights theyll cut your hours. Or if you follow proper procedure. If you dont follow the managers way. Even if it goes against company policies youll get less hours and written up. Lets not forget if youre working full time 40 plus hours for over 2 years. Expect them to hire a new part time employee wholl get more hours than you. The company is toxic; help yourself and apply somewhere else."
bad,The franchise owner doesn't want to buy anything new. It's piecemeal on everything and don't want to pay more than nine dollars an hour. Even assistant manager only make between 9 and 11.50 per hour. Every day something goes wrong and makes the job harder than it should be. Always shorthanded.
bad,"Crew members are great, for the most part, but the management sucks! There was no consistency in rules, each manager ran things their own way, and people get written up for doing what one manager says but another manager doesn't agree with! Not to mention the favoritism that is blatant. As for progression in the company, at this specific store, there is none, they string you along and make sure to keep a majority of their employees well under 40 hours to keep from giving benefits. They only give breaks if you work OVER 6 hours and 15 minutes, which is illegal."
bad,Honestly it was the worst place to ever work. There was managers who would clip their fingernails by the food stations and etc. I was a minor working over the legal limit and that company made me hate my life.
bad,"While working there I learned a lot, but the management was the worst I have ever seen. The lack of commitment to the job and disregard for the employees was unbelievable."
bad,A typical day at work can sometimes be fast or slow. What I learned was how to deal with customers and how to work very quickly.About management some managers was okay some were very excellent with their skills and work ethic. The workplace culture could be very frustrating especially with employees not showing up and it's short handed. The hardest part about the job was working short handed and having to do too much at one time on top of having to have the cars out the line at a certain time.Now the most enjoyable was I had experience working with some wonderful employees and managers.
bad,I hated the pay but the people is nice if it payed more it be worth it and if they give you more hours it would be more worth it to work at Wendy's and working grill at closing is lots of work
bad,The management not well they just sit in the office on there phone while the crew do everything even wen its just 3 crew member they try to give us free food but its still negative
bad,The management is unfair and the hours are too long for someone underage. I was 16 and they made me work long past my curfew and ignored my complaints about pain or illness regarding the work space.
bad,"Trust is a huge issue when it comes to fast food businesses."
bad,"Working as a shift supervisor, you will be told to cut hours if the GM doesn’t know how scheduling works. Not fair to crew members, felt terrible every time I had to send someone home who needed the hours."
bad,"This was the most difficult job I've had. The job itself isn't difficult, but the store I worked at was one of the busiest in the country and the managers worked the college students who worked there like dogs to try and compensate for the amount of business they received. They kept pushing hours on first-year college students during one of the most important years of their college experience."
bad,I often saw fellow employees standing around on their phones while the managers basically ignored it all while pressuring me to do what was some else’s responsibility
bad,"I was always trying to do my best and I would watch others stand around on their phones and steal fries and chicken nuggets, also saw discrimination and sagregation some managers had their favorites and also the General manager had family in there working and the Corp or Company allowed a person back knowing they hurt a customer!"
bad,Managers wouldn’t help with anything when busy and went on smoke breaks instead of helping learned how to do cashier and work with others very dirty work place.
bad,"I learned how to multitask in fast pace situations and always keep busy on my feet. Working in these kind of job industries you have to be a patient person who can get problems fixed, while pleasing the costumer to your full ability."
bad,I highly disliked working at Wendy's. Management treated me unfairly and unkindly. I was not offered the proper training. They also did not pay me enough for everything I was demanded to do. I would never recommend anybody to work there.
bad,"The worst company to work for. "
bad,dont like it would never go back living heck managers are bad & no benefits & underpaid as heck please stop making me write about them i dont like them
bad,There’s only one good manager there and she works nights I believe. Hours are inconsistent and they don’t care about your availability and they change the schedule in the middle of the week and blame you for being late or not showing up
bad,"Management sucked"
bad,"Management was not protected and over worked for the amount of pay they was offering. Lakenof communication, respect, and customer service towards employees."
bad,Its fast food. Stressful. If your in managment its worse. The stress level is intense. Very low pay for the amount of work and stress u undergow. No crew incentives. No awards. No acknowledgements. This is perspective from higher managment down
bad,"Customers change orders SO quick and when you're making their sandwich in less than 15 seconds, you have to trash it if they change it. It's frustrating, hard work and horrible environment. Coworkers spread rumors and at the time, I was threatened by one of them."
bad,mostly waiting to be told what to do to avoid getting yelled at. one manager tells u one thing and another says completely different. it would be bad some days.
bad,"my time at this wendys has been nothing but bad, would never ever recommend working here nor would i ever come back.a typical day for me at work would come in do someones work that should of been done before they left, finish that work and do my work, finish my work early because i know how to time manage just to finish and have to help someone else. most days were missing inventory so someone has to go get it, meanwhile customers are getting mad at us for it not the generale manager whos actually in charge of all that stuff. some days i would come in and someone has called off and they dont find someone else to cover so im stuck doing 2 jobs instead of just my job. the only thing thats enjoyable about this job is coming in to some of the people i actually like there."
bad,"I got hired two hours after my interview. Naturally I was happy right? Well, it's because everyone is ALWAYS quitting. Management was unreliable. Once I came in for a 4 hour shift and ended up working a 12 hour shift. It was good money, but when they don't give you breaks to sit down or eat it's miserable. I got home and nearly passed out. They did things like this multiple times. It was overwhelming and I would sit in my car after work and cry. I got yelled at multiple times for restocking the front when we were out of things like sauce or napkins, etc. because I was supposed to interrupt someone else doing a job to go get it for me. The communication was also terrible. I told my manager multiple times to not schedule me during the day anyone because I was starting classes and she gave me a forty hour week. Well, I walked in and quit when I saw that schedule. They also started cutting more hours. My coworker was a mother who needed a full time job to raise her kids and they reduced her hours to 10 hours a week, while I, someone who just needed some spending money, was working forty hours a week. It wasn't fair to my coworker."
bad,It was hard there I’m just glad I got out. I worked my bit off and wasn’t appreciated enough it was really stressful and I needed money so the fact that I quit just shows how bad they are.
bad,My coworkers at Wendy's were mostly kids in school who still lived at home with their parents.  They didn't care about the job or did they fulfill their duties while there.
bad,"I worked there for 2 months"
bad,I hate it the pay & work load is ridiculous. You work long hours not only do the customers disrespect you but the managers talk to you like your beneath them too
bad,"Not enough pay, very funny coworkers, unprofessional environment and management. Managers steal money and blame it on your drawer being short. Nice hours."
bad,A very unprofessional work environment. Managment is unfair and disrespectful than thinking about leaving just looking for a new job as soon as I do I am leaving
bad,"ive had days where i would go to work and hate the way i got treated by staying later than usual. They would tell me to do everything, but they would sit there on there phone and not do anything."
bad,"Poor management made it a hard job to keep. Pay is reasonable for what you have to deal with every day, but you have to be able to tolerate terrible leaders on a daily basis."
bad,It is not my type of environment they value working more than school and the managers are not understanding. Also i am not using my abilities to succeed
bad,This job is extremely stressful and quick paced and for someone who often has leg pain is a nightmare due to the fact that you're never able to take a break.
bad,I worked before I was given an employee clock in number. They never paid me for the hours I worked. I was only paid for a part of my hours there. I was supposed to be trained and didn't receive the proper training to perform the job correctly.
bad,"The best part about this job is that I don't do it anymore. at the store i worked at there was a GM who everyday when a Manager and a Team Lead came in for their shift to start would pull them into the office and have an hour long lecture about something they ""did"". This Manager and Team Lead were the only authority figures that did anything right. The other two Managers would leave for half hour to an hour and go do drugs or drink. one of them was even stealing products and money from drawers when counting them. The two Managers would let anything slide as long as a customer couldn't see you."
bad,"Management could be better. Staff don't care for the store. Lack of leadership, lack of compensation. Most of the time it's more work less pay. The only benefits there was discounted food. Other than that it's simple all work no fun."
bad,Very rude employees and cleanliness is not important to most of the staff. Training was was not good. Very disrespectful workers and managers don’t care
bad,"in the year ive been working there ive met a lot of great people but of course people come and go that's apart of life but there is so much craziness that comes along with this job and I deal with disrespectful managers, employees, a manager threatened to punch me in the face and they let her go just to rehire her, the manager was emotionally abusive, I should have left along time ago but I do have a family I have to support and needed the money."
bad,IT was a ok job for what it was worth i couldn't imagine myself staying their all my life it paid the bills i did like my hours i worked and the people i worked with
bad,"Started as crew, was promoted to manager. Made very little money, still had to act in crew position as well as managerial duties. Was transferred a lot and management was poor."
bad,Needs to improve management skills and need to work on customer satisfaction needs improvement on speed and getting customers food ready on time make eye contact
bad,always short handed. the pay is horrible for the amount of work you do. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. terrible turn around rate all due to the pay and the amount of work put in.
bad,"I had been with Wendy’s for five years, I was a shift manager and had worked at many different stores in different cities. The worst location was in Lexington, if you work here make sure you check your pay stubs, many employees have been having their hours adjusted by management, I would help my crew members by correcting their hours worked. I informed the REGIONAL MANAGER of This and nothing was done, I filled a complaint with the labor board and left the company because of the stress it was putting on me, they even tried adjusting MY hours also."
bad,"The workplace is negative and toxic. Employees are condescending and rude to other employees, especially new ones.The general manager and the other managers at the Crowfoot branch reprimand newer employees for the same mistake that another employee is making. Why the discrimination? They are also never satisfied with your work and very picky/faulty. If I could give this place 0 stars I would."
bad,The company doesn't care about how you work only that you have to kiss the HR Directors butt so you don't get fired.  She doesn't talk to you about issues that someone else brings to the table.  The management is also the same.
bad,The management and fellow crew members were very unprofessional and hard to work with. They were short on headsets so it made working at the windows while completing other jobs and tasks more difficult. The hardest part of the job was cleaning out the heavy equipment. This job however advanced my customer service experience and got my foot in the door.
bad,This is a good first job teaches you how to start the work force.Many of the workers are older due to it being the middle of nowhere.I like it though until I found a job closer to home that paid more and wanted to pay me 40 hours plus
bad,Did some customer service at the front counter. Very little drive thru. Layed hamburger patties on a flat grill. And let them cook. Had to fry foods in a fryer.
bad,I have a wife with stage 4 breast cancer and I always get attitude if I can not come in to take care of her. I work the grill and never stop working while people friends with the managers get smoke breaks as often as they need them
bad,We were short staffed at lunch and at dinner every day.Which was really stressful.The customers outnumbered the employees at lunch time and dinner time.We could not keep up with the orders.The front ordertaker would way too many orders and not get the food out to the customers in time.The customers would complain that there order was taking to long and the food was getting cold.What I learned was how to work the various machines and that the customers can be very condensing and rude to you.The hardest  part about working there was when the customers would be condensing when they talked to you.That was the annoying part of the job.Laughing with your co workers was fun when we had funny things to say.
bad,"I've worked at this job my 10th grade year, and once I graduated as well. This job checks were good,  but this job was awful! This was the most childish unprofessional job. My boss was always trying to sabotage the workers, and gossip. I hated it. I love the friends I made but too unprofessional."
bad,"I would get to work,get prepared to do my job sometimes when one manager worked,things will run the way they suppose to but other times the store would be in a mess!You literally had to stock your station up before starting because the last person did not try to do anything.I learned that in my 10 yrs+ in fast-food things sometime get outta hand because you have some employees just there.The hardest thing about the job was not having a good team work effort the thing i love most is getting the customers orders to them in a timely manner an seeing them smile"
bad,"I work 5-11 most the time which really means I work 5-1 or 2 some nights. When I come in the daytime staff are just standing around all while the dining room is trashed and not stocked. Don't get me wrong I absolutely love the general manager, but I never work with her. The managers will not give you breaks even when there is well enough people too. I get paid too little to deal with everything I deal with."
bad,"The store I was placed in was literally falling apart. There were holes in the floor in the walk in cooler, the entire wall by drive thru was dry rotted behind the plaster. we were infested with fruit flies because of a design flaw with one of our floor drains we could not reach to clean, and management and crew were blamed and punished for all of this. On top of all the health concerns, food concerns from within the restaurant the way the company was run made no sense whatsoever and failed to provide both crew and management with proper training of any kind that aided in the way there jobs were performed, therefore hindering the advancement or even proper job performances that were expected of there employees."
bad,This was my first job ever and it was the worst. Everyone was just rude and disrespectful towards customers and the management was horrible. There was no organization with how everything should be handled. From the manager i was working under i was the only one that got compliments.
bad,At Wendy's the managers have favorites and people who they don't care about. The pay is terrible for the stuff that goes on there. Its not hard work but they never have people to work when we're short on people. I would not recommend Wendy's to anyone.
bad,"Hours always get cut, managers suck and too much favoritism. Managers dont want to help out and always cuss out/start drama with employees. Really bad work environment."
bad,"Wendy's is a place for someone's first job and it isn't a very good place for that. During the time I worked there we went through several managers who were fired due to stealing from the company, violating company policy, or just quitting to find better jobs. The general manager was never at the store and was only there to discipline the lower level workers. When it got really busy, the entire crew was under a lot of stress and difficult customers didn't help that at all."
bad,"Managers expect to much out of employees for how little they are paid, managers will go out of their way to punish employees for slight mistakes. Overall a terrible place to work if you have any other option."
bad,The managers were not professional at all . They tried to have me on call .  They tried to have me on call.When I couldn't come in they would make me take the week off .
bad,Never fully trained bad mangers and one good one and and bad workers confusing schedules there are good customers but some works horse play and throw stuff
bad,I did not enjoy my work experience at Wendy's because my boss was incompetent with any of the hours I requested and he lacked professional conduct. I would not recommend working for this company.
bad,I went into work everyday knowing I would get upset. They barely trained me on my position and would get mad at me when I would do something wrong. They would then put me on another position and would expect me to just know how to do it. The hardest part of the job was doing it and not knowing what I was doing. I didn't enjoy working there at all.
bad,"Working fast food is horrible, customers are rude continuously, other workers are as well. Management sits in the office doing nothing while all workers are running around doing everything."
bad,"It is a good job to start your work experience. It teaches you basic work ethic. Managers here try their best to retain employees but based on demands compared to the pay, it is hard to keep a consistent team"
bad,We had a new genereal manager and our teamwork also our communication went downhill. I feel if there is not a good leader then how are the managers supposed to follow that person.
bad,The manager was always mean screaming at everybody wanted me to stay more then my hours nd i could she said she would fire me if i didnt but i needed the job so i would always stay
bad,"Schedule is never made on time. Very short staffed, mangers are rude GM doesn’t know how to run the store we always run out of product. It’s not a place you’d want t work for a long time maybe a month but then it’ll be super stressful"
bad,a typical day consisted of running drive thru and making sandwiches. the management were okay. the hardest part of the job was dealing with all of the childish drama that goes on there.
bad,"Wendys needs a complete overhaul when it comes to managers and employees. The managers talk to you any type of way, you may never receive a raise based on your hard work. Raises are given based on who the manager wants to have them, the store is dirty and is not properly cleaned. New employees are not properly trained."
bad,The work place was ok some where rude and some was ok the job was ok  but some of the job description was very hard and hard to keep up with I just wish they would of help little more
bad,Worked very hard for a minimum wage.  Managers did not understand how to treat people. Very difficult to move up spent most of my time watching videos that did not help me to improve my ability to do my job..
bad,The Wendy's that I worked at had horrible management and bad pay. People keep on trying to leave or flat out quit. I worked days that I did not want to work and was also targeted by management for harassment.
bad,Very mistreated and uncomfortable environment. Threatened by managers about hours and switching shifts over availability. Not allowed to have other things in life with out being ridiculed. No time to study. Worked past allowed hours of the night.
bad,"I need a job where I can work over 30hrs a week without having to begg..I like to be independent and not ask anyone for anything,even though often someone does need help I like to pay bills and etc I like to work when I get to work,not sit around and be lazy. I like to be respected as long as others want respect..I don’t lie,steal cheat . I’m good with working with people, and,accept criticism from others as long as it’s not being meaningfull ,harming people is nothing I would do"
bad,its not a bad job at fist bur the will randomly cut your hours if you change your availability slightly its just not a good pace to work when you need the money to pay bills. my last check was 48 dollars and so imma be short on rent
bad,Not a good place to work. They are not understanding at all or flexible with hours. My experience here was awful and probably the worst place i have ever worked.
bad,I learned that a job is what you make of it. I began to dislike my work therefore slacking. The management sucked at the time but no one is perfect. It was definitely a lesson learned for me though.
bad,Worst job ive ever had. Management was terrible. I felt as if i wasnt a hard worker when i knew i was since i had prior experience with culinary. Also too many hours during school. I usually did at least 30 hours a week while in school.
bad,"You aren't trained properly, no handbook or no explaning of the rules and regulations, they expect alot for little pay, management some of them come to work with a nasty attitude."
bad,"just do good in school. it will be worth it just poor management, poor working conditions, poor ventilation and theft by other coworkers is a common issue"
bad,"Besides the GM that I worked for that's no longer there, I would never recommend anyone to apply.  They work managers 10hrs+ a day 5-6 sometimes 7 days a week paying minimum wage.  If you're an hourly employee, you won't get over 30hrs due to them having to offer you benefits.  The health and dental plans are not great, they don't offer 401k and you only get about a week or two of vacation, depending on how long you've been there."
bad,"A stranded day in the life of a Wendys employee has you start by coming to see scummiest people I have ever interacted with, then proceeding to work upwards of 10 hours without so much as a 15 minute brake."
bad,"I hated every moment of employment with this Wendy's. I don't honestly know if all Wendy's are this bad, but this location was under terrible management for the entire year that I was there."
bad,"bad place for work doesn't try the poor manager every one lie gm manager she a terrible boss.Most employees are very nice .manager is driving everyone crazy.she  just doesn't communicate! Once in a while, she can seem friendly but not."
bad,"My first week at Wendy's I was making 36 hours and after that it just kept going down to the point I was only working 10 hours a week only working 2 days, very stressful place to work at and the managers play favoritism."
bad,"Worst place I've ever worked. Management hires friends and let's fired employee return. Managers protect each other when they are at fault for something and put the blame on less liked employees. Mission street, mount pleasant Michigan."
bad,"it's by far the worst place I've ever worked in, but at least if you manage to endure the incredibly incompetent co-workers and management you wont be completely broke in the week. It has increased my tolerance of others significantly and it's taught me to be a lot more fast paced, but that's about it."
bad,"As a manager at Wendy's i saw a lot of this that where done unfairly and  race played a major part of it .management treated the employees with very little respect , worked them like slaves and didnt offer breaks .they over work everyone and no one is appreciated.I have had crew come in and do a great job and yet it was never good enough for the GM I have also encountered on several occasions higher mangers clocking out crew for breaks when no breaks where even giving ,"
bad,First job after high school. They start you off at 7.25 and its hard to move up in management. Its all who you know in the company. Family members work together and its favoritism.
bad,"poor management, people in positions they cannot handle which ends up reflecting in the stores productivity as well as morale. Also doesn't give you legal breaks."
bad,Wendy’s is stressful and isn’t well organized well on a typical day. The worst thing about Wendy’s is doing your job and someone else’s job. The best part is my happy customers!
bad,"Would not want to make a career out of working for wendy's. The coworkers and management, especially the regional manager, made every day in and day out miserable. Had several issues with paychecks not being for the correct amount. Low pay, hard work, short breaks, and being constantly blamed for other people's mistakes is enough to turn anyone away from food service, especially away from wendy's."
bad,Working for wendys was very stressful. They required long hours with a very small staff and high volume of business. The management is required to juggle several different tasks at once which made it difficult to complete tasks effectively and provide excellent customer service.
bad,You get paid salary so you work a lot more hours than you're paid for. The benefits are terrible. You work random shifts so its hard to have a social life or plan ahead. Some days you have to work until 2 or 3am and then you have to be back at work at 7 or 9am the next day. You don't have consistent days off. Upper management lets certain crew members/store managers get away with a lot if they have family in upper management. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"While learning a lot about customer service, the management was terribly poor, often speaking about personal things that the employees shouldn't have to hear about. The management very commonly was on their phones and showed severe favoritism. The general manager gave raises and higher pay to the more attractive blonde ladies that worked their while the guys all received minimum wage and were never given the raise ""every 6 months"" like promised in orientation. Would not recommend."
bad,I worked at Wendy's for 4 years. It took over my life. I spent so much time there that I was hardly home for my kids. Before the management changed it was decent enough. But afterwards it was just terrible.
bad,The job would not be that bad if they would pay more than minimum wadge. They over work you and have favoritism between the employees. I was always scheduled over 40 hours a week and only 1 day off a week even after talking with the management that I needed more than 1 day off a week.
bad,Workers were not kind to each other. Competed with each other rather than worked together. Customers were talked about. Slippery floor. Only 8 hours a week spending a lot of that time standing in one place. Cramped work space
bad,This company there is no advancement. They are only worried about covering shifts to make them  money even being short staffed. I worked 60 plus hours and when the company was bought by a new owner they promoted me only to cut my pay.
bad,The managers there are constantly nagging to do something when it's already done and they take their anger out in the employees. I would not recommend working here AT ALL
bad,Wendys was ok to work for at first but went down. The managers are immature and unfair.i would not recommend Wendys for a job. I had to leave the job. Because it was getting stressful and had too much drama with a couple of the managers.
bad,"Poor management, conflict between work team, and every one not treated the same, dont get a lunch break unless you r under the age of 18. I've had one 25 cent raise in the year and 8 months I've been there, expected to do more than just your job without being compensated for it."
bad,"the wendy's i worked for was not the best. it was slow getting orders out, managers acting like they weren't at work, no structure. I learned that wherever you work people are not you're friends and managers can be just as bad as employees."
bad,When i first started it was good but when i became a manager things got bad employees makin their own schedule and doin what they wanted they hired a bunch of kids that didnt want to work it was just hecked
bad,I loved coming to work everyday ppl where so happy there the food freash shifts ran well schedule always on time customers love coming an having a good time with the team I loved it
bad,"I hated working here. The people that I worked with, the employees and daily workers were great...mostly but the upper management was terrible. More often than not I had to close the entire store with only one other person and more times than I can count did I get a ""Well that's just how the cookie crumbles"" from my general manager."
bad,"I've been working at Wendy's for a year and some months. I work very hard! I've never missed a day or called out. Still haven't gotten a raise. ($7.25). The management sucks, the owner doesn't care about his employees at all. We hardly ever get breaks.I hate working there!!! I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone at all."
bad,I met some great people a few employees stayed and helped once in a while. But management wasn't great they sent the wrong people home and employees that didnt feel like working or that were slacking it stayed working their full 8 hours management had favoritism.
bad,"Coworkers made this job a better place to work at. The manager was very mean, rude, and disrespectful. Whenever the General Manager was coming to visit, our store manager would feel it was okay to holler and curse to get everything and everyone in place. She often found it common to embarrass the employees in front of each other. Upon ending my shift, she would say ""if she quits it'll be okay, we ain't lost nothing."" How was I suppose to be perfect in my 1st week of work???"
bad,"The management is horrible, if you aren't one of there favorites then you get treated horribly and you won't get the days you ask for off. It have descent work experience like it teaches you how to work with people you don't like."
bad,"Could be very unsanitary. As a employee, free meals should be given. As an minor I worked 7 hours in a row with no break multiple times and so management would not get in trouble, they went in and fixed my time so I was not getting paid for what I worked."
bad,"Depending on your location it might be better then my experience. However, my managers were absolutely horrible. I've never been yelled at like that or even treated that way in my life."
bad,"A day at work you would most likely be short staffed due to employee call outs. This would continue happening daily because the management does not know how to show the staff their appreciation of their presence nor do they know how to give proper repercussions for recurrent absences. Cr*ppy upper management combined with a skewed workload among the lower management (asking too much for a pay that doesn't reflect the amount of work to do) creates a toxic cycle of failure. The bonus systems are hardly attainable due to all of the credentials needing to be met to get any form of payout from it. I learned that even if you are with a company for 4 years they still are only out for themselves and will squeeze, use, and abuse you are sour. The incompetency of management I witnesses while working for this company was an ever-flowing fountain of stupidity."
bad,"I've learned a few things from Wendy's. But they do NOT know how to train new employees. This was my first job at the age of 16. I went in with all smiles. It was very nice for the first day or so, until the people ""Training"" me refused to teach me, Told me to do something I had NO clue how to do, and then got angry when I didn't know how to do it."
bad,My hours were flexible and I learned new things about the fast food environment. I enjoyed my customers and the people I worked with. Management was just terrible and we as employees had no voice within the company.
bad,"The manager has favorites, sometimes i just worked 2 days, alot of days just three hours, and they no help, you basically got to figure out everything yourself."
bad,Worked from June 16th 2016 to September 2016. I worked 20-30 hours a week. Managers were kind of rude same with team. The team wouldn't do a good job and if they did it was sloppy.
bad,The Wendy's I currently work at has several OSHA violations. Some of those have caused severe damage to employees. They lack the required rubber mats that are supposed to be stationed at all positions. There is also a lack of cleaning supplies. They have also set off Pest bombs and not cleaned the store afterwords. There is an electrical socket that smokes if it is used. The managers and GM have made many insulting comments to disabled employees. Over all it has been a very stressful situation and one that I wish to leave as soon as I possibly can.
bad,"A typical day starts out with going into work and going to your station then getting yelled at for the mess the last person left.Then as the day goes on you get yelled at by, customers, co-workers and managers. Mainly for things that are not your fault and probably theirs. Some of m co-workers are fun to work with but for the most part you just want to get away from them.The hardest part of the job is when the rush starts and everyone decides to come in at the same time and you're anxious and about to have an anxiety attack because all these people are coming in and your manager is yelling at you for every little mistake you do in front of everyone. The most enjoyable part of job was clocking out each day."
bad,"Wendy's doesn't give you enough hours, i was sick for 4 days and they fired me for the sick days due to my doctor being away. manager isn't understanding, the management isn't good  and the pay isn't much and there's no benefits either. I wasn't satisfied with working here."
bad,"I do not recommend applying at Wendys on Cleveland Street. They hire to many people, if it is to crowded in the kitchen (which is their fault they hired people they did not even need) they would send the new people recently hired home, the employees there are rude to custumers, and at times they are really slow on making food. I was hired, boss gave me 2 days out of the whole week only working 3 hours a day but sent me home early due to too many people in the kitchen and ""nothing fro me to do""."
bad,Management would always suspend people for the littlest things that happened. Everyone that they hire is on drugs. We have found previous syringe packages out back of the store.
bad,"not a great work environment, mean people, management lacking, did not seem to know what they were doing"
bad,I had requested the day for my own wedding off from the day they hired me. The day before my wedding I was told I wasn't going to be able to have the day off and I needed to move my wedding. I told them I was unable to do that and wouldn't be able to make it to work due to my wedding. They then told me not to bother coming back to work.
bad,The management was always different with every shift making the everyday work difficult. Sometimes the management would not care about co-workers or customers and sometimes management would not care about co-workers and only care about customers. My co-workers were mainly other teenagers who didn't really put a lot of effort into their job. The hardest part about the job was being able to practically work by yourself or with a management who would not treat you with respect or make your night easy to close. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and being able to bring a service to customers.
bad,I loved my team members here but the management overall was not very good. There wasn't a lot of organization which is a big thing for me. I learned that dependability plays a huge factor when running a business. The hardest part of this job was keeping my team members motivated to work. The most enjoyable was the family feel I got from most of the crew.
bad,Some good people to work with but overall a horrible place to try to advance. They demand a lot from you but are not willing to give anything in return.
bad,"learned that people can be so rude when their in a higher position then you. My 1st job after my son was born, I was 16. Management need to learn respect for their workers. My night Manger spit in the floor and told me to mop it up. My GM was very rude, I was there bout a week and a costumer ask what was on a sandwich and i was looking seeing what was all on it and she said ""whats all of the F****** sandwich"" ""Do your job"". I found nothing enjoyable working for Wendy's."
bad,"The job was very helpful in the sense that it was my first job ever, but I also learned from my mistakes of trusting corrupt managers. I was working a lot during the summer, but when football season started I got less than 5 hours a week. They also taxed the heck out of my paycheck to the point to where they owed me over $550 dollars in money I was never payed back still to this day. It was a terrible environment to work in, especially due to the fact that I was told to ""slow down"" at my position because everyone else was underperforming. I was eventually terminated from the job because I ""worked too fast and was snippy with the scheduling manager"", when the first one was true, but the latter was EXTREMELY false. My advice, get a real job and don't work fast food, especially at this Wendy's back in my home town."
bad,"Typical Day Monotonous"
bad,You will not like it there. You're basically a piece of meat that works for them. I have worked for the for years because of financial struggles. They do not have any good management and makes poor working decisions. They will show you they only care about the money they can make off of you then get rid of you once there family member needs a job. I have seen a lot of people come and go from this company. It's only for high school kids. If you are an adult please and i mean please don't work for this company.
bad,I worked 25-30 hours a week and I was suppose to be full-time. Pay was horrible. Only closed 2 days out the year.  Co-workers are teenagers because the pay is so poor. I learned nothing. I enjoyed the repeat guest. They made bad days good.
bad,"Management is poorly ran"
bad,Fast food environment where your constantly on the move. Believes that the customer is always right. Typical day consist of taking orders and tending to customers needs. Management could have been more involved with production seeing that there were few co-workers that always did their jobs.
bad,"This is the type of job for high school students and first time job seekers. The employees as well as the management team are not clean at all when it comes to preparing people's food. When a person works with food, one have to treat people's food like it is their own. Workers including the management to do not properly handle the customers food with care. For example, a manager in training dropped a cooked chicken patty on the floor and before I could pick it up and dispose of it, she picked it up off the floor and put it back into the grease to serve to a customer So gross!"
bad,There was plenty of busy work but never was fun. Environment was greasy and hot. Co workers were great to be around just not in that environment.
bad,this company is a bad company. I worked here for a year and they treat there workers really poorly. I worked only 3 hours a day
bad,"A typical day really depends on the day. Beginning of the week is usually slow as to when the end of the week comes it gets more busier which is nice because then time flies by. I've learned to be better at counting money out and be faster at multi-tasking. Also to have better costumer service skills. I got along well, for the most part, with management, though there was some favoritism. I got along and had made some friends with most of my co-workers. Honestly there wasn't anything really hard about the job. The part of the job I enjoyed most was being the ""bagger"" for the drive-thru. I became fast and accurate with the orders, making sure every order was handed out complete."
bad,"I would come in, clock in on the dot then I would get straight to work on whatever position they had me covering that day. I'd either be handing out drinks and food, taking orders, handing out orders, or handling fries. After I cleaned up whatever station it was, I'd clock out and go home."
bad,"Typical day working for Wendys consisted of operating the front cashier as well as the drive thru, and being very multi-taskful. It was a very fast paced environment, which at times was very stressful. Interacting with customers was a daily routine as well, greeting them as they come in, leave, and as you take down their orders. Also, it was a requirement to clean the lobbies and restrooms on down time. From my experience, I Iearned how to multi-task better, and also how to adapt to working in a fast paced environment. Management wasn't the best at Wendys, my manager was a slacker....Co-workers were great to work with, everyone worked as a team. Hardest part of the job I would say is dealing with rude customers. Enjoyable part was being able to put put smiles on customers faces."
bad,"I learned very little working at wendys, the management was not reliable. the schedule was never posted on time. i was barely scheduled for work. the hardest part of the job was communicating with management."
bad,"I did this Take and fill orders, handle customer complaints, assist co-workers to help customers, help keep the restaurant clean."
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's is dull. The managers are not very professional and seem not to care about work at all. My co-workers are disengaged and uninterested. Again, i attribute this problem to the lack of efficient management."
bad,a typical day at work would be serving customers orders and completing task that needed to be done.
bad,"Its Fast food, the pay is bad, management sucks, no care for employees."
bad,"enjoy in the first time but the to long time. "
bad,"customers are nice, some times customers complain its fun helping customers with their orders"
bad,The management was uncoordinated. they wasn't really focused on what they needed to be doing
bad,A food service job teaches a lot of things about yourself and about the people around every day.
bad,"Most days are busy, weekends are extremely busy. I've learned  how important it is to have multi-tasking skills. Management in my opinion could show more professionalism. Co-workers vary in age groups, some good some bad attitudes."
bad,"i have a lot new things while working, i like to have new experiences!"
bad,"The people you work with are what makes you want to come to work and be there, other than that it's just a job. It's not someplace that makes you wanna work any harder or excel in anything that you are doing in your job."
bad,"A typical work day would be to work the cash register and try to up-sale combos or new products."
bad,"Working at fast food restaurant is really difficult ."
bad,"It wasn't my choice of work because I have experience in a different field, but it is ok for a first job or teenager."
bad,my hours had gotten cut  a lot when i worked their. it was bad until i started to only get 6hrs/week.
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's is steady and fast paced. I learned Good costumer Service ""the costumers are always right"". I also learned how to multitask "
bad,Working at this particular company I learned how to deal with all sorts of customers and employees. Its not a place where I would make a career but it gets you by.The management part was sort of out of order because everyone seemed to wanted to be for them selves and not work as a team player. As far as my co workers I had a share of good and bad. The most part I enjoyed about the job was the different people I would come by. They taught me how to deal with problems no matter how frustrating they can seem.
bad,"There were a number of issues I've had with this job, when I did something wrong when I just started out, instead of letting me know what I did wrong all they did was push me out of the way and did it themselves.  Not only that they stacked too much on an opener's plate (Having only three people opening; one for salads, the other for sitting in the office as the manager, and the other doing all outside stuff) and you were expected to do it in an hours time thanks to the new ""famous"" GM our store got.  I often got into arguments with the very same GM who claimed I have absolutely no rights as a worker, and that only minors are entitled to a break at all, when the law clearly states if you work over six hours you MUST have a break (I was working eight hours on average per day) and many other workers got upset because I knew that loophole and they wouldn't ask for a break because it made everyone a liability.  The new GM yelled at me for something I didn't even do wrong.  She said, and I quote ""I asked three people to get chilies on the stove and two people to get the chili meat"" I thought that it doesn't pertain to me since I literally just got on the clock two minutes ago, then she added ""You know I'm talking to you (my name here)"" "
bad,This district really needs a remodeled management team completely.
bad,Will never work for wendys again nor will i ever recommend a job here.
bad,a typical day there is fun depending on where u are if u where in the grill food prep area you enjoyed your self but if you where in the back window you hated it and had to do everything in the back of the building with out assistance.
bad,There its not what you know its who you know. They are greedy and money hungry there and dont want you to work to push their company forward.
bad,"A typical day is preparing food on the menu, conducting sales transactions,and stocking supplies."
bad,"My typical day was to help open the resturant, get the grills turn-on, check the parking lot for trash, assist with prep. I like the people I worked with until the new manager came on and didn't understand individuals with a disability"
bad,"very hard work,long hours,no breaks, days off are not consistant"
bad,"A typical day for me at work is dealing with customers with bad attitude but knowing how to deal with it. I learned how to be more patient and and focus alot more on what im doing i enjoyed my time working there. the Management is horrible some of them barely know how to work the cash register. My co-workers were fun to work with if they needed help i helped them if i needed help they helped me overall we always worked together as a team. The hardest part of the job wasnt anything , im a great worker i listen you only have the tell me once and i get it first try. The part i really enjoyed would be meeting new people and being able to laugh and be myself."
bad,"A day at wendys would be very fun depends on which manager's shift it is, the people are very fun to be around and very easy to get along with if you are outgoing, gets along with others very easily. my personal opinion of the management would be that they should be more organized when it comes to ordering things for the store, making sure that everything they need is present. the hardest part of the job would be responding to the customers complaints about food not being served hot and telling the regular customers we do not have what they came to wendys for when they visit on a regular basis. as far as co workers some come to work and some come to socialize, not getting their job done which leaves you stuck to do your work and their work also. the most enjoyable part of the day would be bringing home your check that you worked so hard for at the end of the day."
bad,"the job was very easy. the managers was so fake. the managers favor other workers. sometimes the managers will give out free meals to their favorites. the store was always dirty, food was always spoiled. the managers was very lazy. to be honest that was the worst job i ever worked in. they had bed bugs in the crew room. people was stealing from your purse or lockers. the food is burned and old. they should really shut that store down. the cashiers was slow, rude."
bad,"I dislike it all together the work is very easy and can be abussed by manager. I've learned a lot cashier,stocking,spanish,and outstanding customer service. I dislike management because the crew works harder and yet get paid less. The crew/coworkers are awsome and fun to be around besides the ones who have been working there for years trying to be the boss. The hardest part about the job is dealing with management whom have no idea what they are doing yet put all the work on the crew and gets to sit around,be lazy,and tell everyone else how to do there job. Only the crew and customers you grow to like plus the pay because we all have bills and now for me at least is the inspection because I get to see the shoe on the other foot as the management goes into a panic when it comes time for them to be told what to do."
bad,I wasnt there long. I did not have many hours prior to having surgery after surgery I was not placed back on schedule
bad,"was a bad overall store, bad customers, worse management and employees"
bad,Didn't care for the General Manager. She hired people who could not communicate which made it difficult to train and work with. No advancement or advancement opportunities.
bad,It was fun but didn't make enough money and it was just a starter job to get the bills payed and take care of my family plus I really like working with people
bad,"You are required to know/learn many positions; yet, once you get remotely good at one small thing, you will be stuck doing the same task without any benefits for your 'accomplishment and 'worth' to the company."
bad,"The Wendy's I had worked at, the one on North Topeka Boulevard, has so much toxicity when it comes to the co-workers and few of the managers there as well, except a couple. I have been working there for at least a year now, I've stayed with them through all the hard times, I always show up to work on time, and it's just a bunch of unnecessary drama that is not only needed in my mental life, but not needed at the work place as well. I've learned how to do most the stuff there by myself since the managers at the time wouldn't teach me anything else. So it really hurts when I didn't mind working so much but just due to the drama, along with the fact it was starting to drain my energy from school, the hardest part of the job is just managing to stay sane there when you're the social punching bag. All in all, I enjoyed my first job better."
bad,"I have worked for this company for a year and a half, never called off always on time, Learned proper procedures and executed them on a daily and still got a hard time getting a raise, and it was small"
bad,I loved that the store I started in felt like a family. I was trained properly at this store so well that the next store I was hired at literally begged me to worked for them
bad,"I worked at Wendy's in New Albany, IN. I can't speak for every Wendy's, but my time there gave me a bad impression about working there. My schedule was always changing (and while I know some jobs are like that, I would think you would agree to a changing schedule in an application or an interview, which did not happen). Despite learning more and more, I got fewer and fewer hours over the course of a month and one day just stopped getting hours despite the fact that my performance was improving. When I asked for more hours or why I was losing hours I was always brushed off. I was also yelled at if I was working too slow (though I was going as fast as I could), I was fussed at if I put things in the wrong place and people would get annoyed if I asked questions. If you don''t already KNOW how to work there, don't work there. It's not a place to learn."
bad,"When you would go in a few minutes early, they would ask you where you've been, acting as if you were late and complaining that the drive through is packed. Then, you would be told by the manager playing on their phone to hurry up and get the orders out. When the manager goes out for a smoke break, many other employees do as well. There were many times that I was left alone to do drive thru, front, and sandwich making, while one other person is doing meats and fries. would not reccomend this job."
bad,"Only good thing about working here is flexible hours and some of the people are fun to be around. Bad thing is they try to overwork you. You do the work of several people but get paid for one, which they pay jack. They expect you to work around food but not eat anything unless you pay for it. Once you become manager, they harass you all day and night trying to get you to cover stupid people."
bad,i would never work there again unless they had better management.it was an okay place at first but not later when you get told you have no choice but to work 2 closes and 1 open no if's and's or buts about  it this from one of the owners
bad,"It is very disorganized, the crew is unhappy and won't work.  The.GM is a mess and let's the crew walk all over her.     She lies to the District Manager."
bad,"Upper management does not really help. Instead, they push people out they don’t like. Hiring managers off street and passing up current qualified employees. Very biased upper management. Impossible to retain employees when the District Manager is so insufferable towards the crew they quit."
bad,Work over 24 years didnt pay enough for the stress u deal with on every day basic manager turn over was high because there was no respect crew turn over over was high because was to low
bad,"Manager was disappointing as new manager when I worked there basically made all the best employees leave and she wanted to be in control and tell everyone what to do, even though we were a well trained machine."
bad,"Very time consuming job, people there do not care about the job besides like 1 manager that I promoted. Everyone there is lazy and no one cares about the job."
bad,Same as any other job  could be very stressful  short staff n very busy  could have some real bad days  managers can be very childish  and rude  as well as unprofessional
bad,I worked for Wendy's for quite a while and was never offered a pay raise or different position. They shuffled my schedule all over the place and I could not work the entire 40 hours I needed to.
bad,"working here was okay depending on the manager that was running the shift, a lot of drama between coworkers, customers and weekends sucked, a good job if you are desperate"
bad,Lord a lot of mad people the boss would try to fight the workers people was taking food home right out the freezer there was never a good day never clean dishes nothing never was pep. and ready for the day.
bad,I just want to say how horrible this place was to me!! I would work 12 or more hour shifts!!! I would be short staffed on all my shifts and was expected to find people to work!!! I wasn’t appreciated there!!! My gm would yell at me when i got out at 4 am or when i wouldn’t pick up a shift when i would work like 50-60 hours in one week!!! The pay was worth it but not when i loose sleep!! just to come back there the next day!!!
bad,"Upper management, district manager in my case was a nightmare. Rude. Unbearable to work with. All around jerk. He is the reason I am not there anymore. Loved my crew."
bad,"Was told not to care for my employees,we had young workers there who needed to learn how to be in the work place was our job I thought to teach them how.they don't care about family or you as a person it's the numbers is all ..."
bad,I don’t recommend working here at all. It’s full of drama and poor management. I can’t even explain to you how bad it is the GM looked me straight in the eye and said I don’t need a raise or promotion even though everyone else knows I work harder then anyone else. If you see a now hiring sign and it lists all the benefits that is for assistant managers only.
bad,"I got a lot of hours, but the employees are very rude and unwilling to help you. That is why I quit. I was the only one who wanted to work. Pay is unfair for the amount of physical labor that has to be done."
bad,Don’t bother working at this franchise.. really bad management they don’t care about they’re employees at all.The pay isn’t worth it they always made me do the dirty work while everyone else did all the easy stuff while the manager wouldn’t ever help us they would just sit in the office. Never got to work drive thru or assembly station and I worked there for over a month..
bad,"They are rude and spiteful poor moral,lack of compassion for hard workers,you are replaceable, it's a good first job for kids, or a nice place for people in the halfway house to get back to work,The same thing every day, but it's a job also new management fires anyone they didnt hire and they dont keep the same managers long so happy couple slave months if your lucky."
bad,"I worked for Wendy""s for over a year they have no benefits what so ever. You have to accumulate sick pay hours but you only can if you work more than 32 hours a week if not you never get any"
bad,"I liked my job I just can't work under being harassed or taunted, and definitely could of used a break, very unfair how Sue allows Rainy to harrass and taunt employee's"
bad,This job was a waste of my time. The people was nasty. They didnt wash there hands. They were very messy for no reason. So many people has quit there cause the play with people hours.
bad,The one I worked wasn’t the best place to work in town. The GM and AM was rude disrespectful and just care about the company. Maybe if they’d get rid of them they’d be able to keep people
bad,"Very unorganized. They don’t realize when you work hard. No credit given. Management is very horrible. Very stressful. Easy job just horrible management, very rude. So many things wrong."
bad,"Wendy’s Manager and franchise owner does not care about the workers. If a"
bad,"I like working with some of the people at Wendy's, but sometimes it can be complex if it is not running smooth if we don't have the right people there or if someone messes up our routine then everything be comes a mess."
bad,"Worked there for three years as manager, put in two weeks. After my two weeks never received my last check and when I asked why they said I didn't finish my notice"
bad,"I didn't enjoy working for the company. It didn't have good work life balance,  compensation or culture. It was good for s first job but I got stuck there for a long time."
bad,"I transferred to the South Logan store after doing a bid at the store in Tremonton. Management is AWFUL. They yelled at me, belittled me, and made me feel like an idiot. I lasted a week at that store before deciding my mental health was a priority over being ridiculed every day. Hopefully they have new and better management at this point."
bad,"Wendy’s was my very first job experience i was a cashier, front counter cash handler "
bad,Staff leaders was very rude with new staff.... nobody listen the problem of employees and nobody take actions regarding problems. Really very bad experience at Wendy’s.
bad,Very poorly managed. They don't pay their bills. Always waiting on parts. They want you to travel between Amarillo and Hutchinson Kansas covering four separate markets. They offered no per diem foretravel and it is not a option. Very stressful work environment. Most of their restaurants are very old bug infested mouse infested and the equipment is very wore out.they continued to tell the management at each location they are going to get a remodel. Which never happens. Therefore causing you more issues with management because they expect you to be a miracle worker. And in any way they can they will have you go around any safety devices or any other safe practices to get the job done. Like my summary said run run fast
bad,"Management is poor, drama all around, higher ups belittle employees, crew take fault from managers, rude environment. Only positive it has is it’s like a disfuctional family atmosphere"
bad,"They never trained me on how to work the fryers, just had me start using them one day. No discussion of general food safety either. "
bad,Overall the company is not a great one the management is awful and you’re left to do a lot of things on your own with little to no help. I didn’t enjoy the environment at all and it’s takes a toll on your mind.
bad,"Worked for a GM that was more concerned about maintaining friendships with peers rather than hold them accountable for doing their jobs"
bad,"It’s was nice working there for awhile. Things have changed. It’d be nice if they knew how to talk to their managers and employees. Tell them what to do and what they are doing wrong, don’t yell at them and tell them if they don’t do it right they are fired."
bad,Did not enjoy my short time with Wendy's work was too hard for little pay. The employees did as they wish and management did not enforce the rules.  It was not considered a clean and safe environment from my point of view.
bad,Lack of pay I started out at 7.50 I also only recieved 5 to 8 hours a week for months but who can live off of that when I was finally given hours it wasnt enough
bad,I don't really have a review for this job it may be a good place for someone
bad,"Worked here for several years. Management are immature bullies. People who do heroin get promoted but not the people who work hard and are reliable. Staff is lazy and night workers get stuck doing everyone else's job. Yearly raises are a joke. Felt more depressed working here than ever in my life. When the air breaks in the summer and the kitchen is near 100 degrees your boss will tell you to ""just drink some water"" while they sit comfortably in the office."
bad,"Management needs a lot of help training and diversity. The bully culture is stressful, I learned the system well enough to help increase sales with the help of my team."
bad,Working for wendys was good for awhile until my dad past away after his death iv had to step up and take care of my mother and my boss didn’t accept that and iv mossed a few days she wanted a doctors note but i was out of town for his funeral and after she didn’t get a note she cut my hours to one day a week for two hours so i quit so if you can work everyday then id recommend it but if you have health issues or have to take care of family or children I wouldnt apply
bad,Ive work there almost 5 months and the managment has gotten worse its very catty and personal relationships affect alot of whats going on ive tried to voice my concern and wont be heard. I contiune to work there because I tune all this out and have bills to pay I love my job duties and I'm very good at them so until I can either be heard anf advance or find another job this is where I will work
bad,"The only good thing about this job is that they are flexible with scheduling. You receive no discounts outside of when you're working, which is still miniscule, the staff are all very rude, safety practices in handling food is not truly managed, small pay, incompetent managers."
bad,"In Wendy's, I was expected to know every station and do every station. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasnt a minimum wage job. However, the management wrote me up because I had to leave work due to a sudden death in the family. This is completely despicable and I do not recommend!"
bad,"Do not work here. Do not eat here. Do not and would not recommend. Terrible management bad work eithic and environment. Bad hours, many staff physical fights."
bad,I have worked for this company for a long time and had many problem the hole time. I have worked very hard to push thought the hard times for a bigger picture but know I that i want and need a better srounding.
bad,i worked in the parth of food handler i gave the order of food to the customers in the car and everyything they asked also come to attention in the principal part
bad,The managers are rude and uncaring and lazy. Hardly any career advancement (raises or promotions). Hostile and stressful environment. Old products are served because management doesn't pay attention and too lazy. Managers play favorites.
bad,"The management didn't do their job, didn't properly schedule, order stock, do inventory, set up cleaning schedules, the whole nine yards. All attempts to talk to them about this were met by either insults or derogatory remarks towards my person. I would not ever recommend anyone work at a Wendy's unless you truly have no other opportunities for employment."
bad,"Not the best place to work. All the management is family. So unless you are part of that family, all you do is get yelled at or criticized. It got to the point people would just quit just a few days later."
bad,"The job is horrible, you will me miserable, the manager are all annoying except for one who she’s sweet but she’s lazy. The other three managers are all annoying and will always be on your back about things you can’t control only 2/4 actually work."
bad,Help your people skills and to learn to be a team player. Get to meet new people and new ideas if going into management. It good for a second job or something to do
bad,"Making sandwiches, stocking food stations, prep making salads,"
bad,Worst job I’ve ever had.                  Turnover rate is awful for this employer.               No chance to move up unless you wait a year. No flexibility
bad,I worked this job as a seasonal  position. It was fast-pace with no time for breaks. The manager at the time had me working after a major surgery and I could no longer perform the duties required.
bad,"A typical work day consists of headaches, anger and depression. they do nothing but use their employees and something as simple as booking off a day is impossible to do without increased stress. they will lie to you just to get you to work more days and if you ask for anything, they will screw you over out of spite. This place is a cancer to work in and should not be pursued unless you have literally no other options."
bad,"They only care about you making them money, anything else is irrelevant..they don't want to raise the pay but expect you to work like a slave for 7.25!! Raises?? forget about it!!!"
bad,Management sucks. Everybody wasn’t together when it came to be lunch time or dinner. I didn’t have enough hours and I asked them to give me more hours and they said they would but it never happened.
bad,no one can live off of 7.25 an hour even if they spent more than 60 hours at work with no benefits at all and mostly selfish ignorant people..........
bad,Miserable and horrible managers who bully and gossip. Fast paced with commonplace sexual harrassment where victims lose their jobs instead of perpetrator and perpetrator gets to take your hours when you are fired after your hours go down to minimum and you (the victim) are fired in retaliation.
bad,At Wendy’s you get pay little and have to work hard and it’s like that job you have to have no life to work. But don’t get pay enough to get be life. You have to be fast on your feet and it’s  stressful  To work at Wendy’s.
bad,"After working here at Wendy's this place is really not a good work environment. most of the time cuts hours if you call off from work because of school or other events, place always has flies and the store is dirty."
bad,I worked 5 hours a day 3 days a week. I was hired on as full time. I asked for more hours and never got them because we we overstaffed. The food is fresh and I loved seeing my regulars.
bad,"When i was hired they knew i wanted to work my way up. DM has hire new ppl and they have been ServSafe Cert. before me and i've been there 7 months. Ive had to cover shifts for managers that leave the store during their shift, and not come back for hours on end. I've had to cover the same managers shift when she was arrested (19 hour shift)!!! This company preaches how family friendly they are, but they keep drug addicts employed as managers and crew. I've had to break up fights between employees, and terminate them. I've been told to call other stores in our chain before i call the DM to ask for help to run our store. "
bad,"i have worked for oyher Wendy's resturants before, this one was one of the worst i have worked at. they use/work their employees like dogs, ESPECIALLY if you are a good worker."
bad,"Wendy honestly isn't all that great, the management where i work sucks nobody ever listens. and the managers think its okay to get snappy with the crew members.  getting some type of me but i think. if you guys have really good employees then you need to give them raises. because i do the most for the store and i dont see any recognition but broken promises."
bad,Starts off nice an slow lunch come rush everybody moving accordingly an get it done slows up till dinner an a rush so I'll help out to the rush is done an i clock out after
bad,"This is only for the High schoolers, this it not made to live off of  The work is high maintenance constantly on the go you must have slip resistant shoes you’re wearing a uniform"
bad,"horrible workplace, the management  is rude and tells people your personal business, it was always busy which was nice because it kept you busy. getting in and out of the location was not fun"
bad,work was fun sometimes but then other times it seemed like none of the managers cared about how well you were doing your job. while i was there i tried to do my best and most of the time i gave it all i had and it seemed like nothing pleased any of them and that's one of the main reasons why i left.
bad,Managers are idiots nd inconsiderate. They use people for their own benefit nd dont value the workers they have. Wouldnt reccomend this job to my worst enemy
bad,The job was alright but the manger would hit on his male employees and would favor some employees.  But I was a crew member/cook.  When I was a crew member I would have to unload our shipment and put them in their spot. And stock the shelf’s.
bad,"They really rude, it’s hard working, the manager rude, the most enjoyable part is sitting down on break, the hardest part is having a rush without enough people working"
bad,There is no room for a advancement with this company I worked here over one year and I didn’t even see one pay raise but that’s usually how it goes in fast food
bad,Would not move me up only gave me 3 hours a day always hiring new people but would not move me up had to buy own non slip shoes was lowest person there so got all the work the others people did not want to do
bad,Horrible Job. No balance between life and work. Two paid sick days a year. Customers are not friendly. Most employees are not reliable. The hardest part of the job was scheduling people that don't want to be there.
bad,"staff allowed others to get harassed. all staff treated everyone like garbage and put others down. when brought to the manager, it was told to me to get over it. does not recommend going there."
bad,I am thankful for my employment with this company because they helped me better myself and help me recognize some of my potential for management. I also had the opportunity of working and training with some awesome people.
bad,It was a decent job for my first job but honestly it was pretty horrible to. if you are a certain age u don’t get paid as much and if your of higher age u get paid more. I didn’t agree with that
bad,"A typical day at work would be stressful. I learned basically nothing. The management was horrible , lazy and incompetent. This place is all about preserving the food so the frys sit there and sit there. The crew members are just as bad as the managers lazy incompetent ect. The only crew members that were acceptable quit like i did. this place is in desperate need for a food and health inspection. 0/10"
bad,"Wendy's in west Monroe,la off Wells rd. is the worst place ive ever work. bad management. Not to many benefits. im good at multi-tasking but my boss had me going in circles. she whould tell me to stay in one place then forget that she told me to do other duties."
bad,"I liked the company at first. People were pleasant and the job atmosphere was fine until my hours just dropped. I needed the money and hours. As many as possible. Yet, after they renovated the restaurant, they said they could not give me hours until the summer which was months away. I had been going though a lot and I was practically homeless and making no income because my the managers ""had to many people"" and I couldn't be scheduled. So overall, the people were great, job was fairly easy, the managers who hire to many people sucks."
bad,"poor management and poor work ethics.They make you work hard for little money no appreciation. The wendy's I worked for had little, to no structure. I often found that a lots of employees called in often,which meant more work on top of my work."
bad,stressful place long hours. they lost 44 managers in 4 months. Not a place you want to work. No home life for a manger. You must be on call 24/7. Even on your days off. DM's are no supportive.
bad,"come into work always short staff"
bad,"This was the worst job I had! The workers were so rude to the customers at night. They would get smart with the customers if they were tired or annoyed about something else. A lot of people there would gossip about each other, even the managers."
bad,wendys was just a complete mess. lack of help and managers would sit in the office sometimes but complain when a crew member would sit for 5 minutes they would complain even just to get a drink with nothing to do
bad,Most of the time the job was okay and fun and then others was stressful and hard to deal with how was being treated by higher ups. But my customers got help and never once turned them down....I enjoyed my customers and the hardest part was dealing with how i was treated...But no matter i cooked food and made sure my customers was happy
bad,"Boss was very rude, unprofessional, cut my hours so i only worked 4 days out of the week, this didnt make it easy to live with a check which was $200.00. Bi-weekly. So i have been and are actively looking for another job where i can actually work and get paid more."
bad,This jobs fine if you're just entering the work force but it's not a place to be if you're looking to live off of it. The pay is very low ( minimum wage) and the management is extremely poor and impressionable.
bad,I would not recommend being in management for this company. The pay is not worth the stress and the hours are terrible. Two days a week I would have to close the night before and be there until 4am and open the next day at 6am.
bad,They never listen to employees or customers. They are rude to employees in front of customers. They don't care if you have kids and there sick or anything.
bad,There was planning for scheduled shifts and worker normally gets ad hoc calls as to start time for their shift as well as end time.  Competition was present for shifts and management lack proper training making the environment very toxic resulting in high staff turnover.
bad,"I like I'm a good worker. I'm always on time. It's a good job and u meet new people. There are some cool people. It's a easy job.i was a grill,fryer. It's a clean aplace and it's get so busy.we help each other."
bad,At Wendys I always had something to do. If it was either running the fry station and the grill at the same time. I was kept relatively busy. I loved the advancement opportunities.
bad,Working conditions are horrible. The staff works their butt off everyday because we are always short handed. Management sucks and so do the workers. That’s about it.
bad,"A typical day at work wouldn't be a good day. The people you work with weren't good people and they only cared about themselves and the hours they worked. You start off by cleaning up and taking peoples orders. Then you go and mop/sweep the floor. You clean the serving trays and then right before closing time, you mop and clean everything in the bathroom. I learned to communicate with people a lot better and I learned how to handle and deal with money a lot better. The workplace culture isn't very good and the people are selfish. The hardest part of the job was having to do other peoples jobs when you weren't assigned to that  because of too many people coming into the restaurant at once. It was tricky but it got better the longer you worked there. The most enjoyable part of the job would most definitely be the discount on food you get. You get a really good discount on all the food and you get as many free drinks as you please as well. All in all I didn't like working at wendys and my review would be to not choose that place as a place to work and a place to start your career."
bad,"You are just a number. If you're a robot, you'll love it. Your days off belong to them, too. Surprise shift changes and running very, very short handed all the time is normal. Management won't see their own faults to correct issues. Lots of slander is tolerated."
bad,This job is terrible when it comes to getting raises and promotions. I have worked here for a little over 2 years and only got a 5 cent raise. Barely any workers to keep the restaurant open and it’s so busy that you’re just overworked and underpaid.
bad,"unstable environment no one is following one set of rules "
bad,The managers was terrible. Didnt have inventory to sell to customers which created bad reviews each week as customers thought works was lying about what we had
bad,"Very unprofessional"
bad,It wasnt bad at first but over two years it became a sweat shop. After taking payed time off id earned i came back to a crew with a grudge because i wasnt there to take care of everything.
bad,This place Sucks to work for because the higher management who runs the whole operation in Quebec don’t know there bum from there elbow! It sucks bad!
bad,Wendys was not the best place to be at the moment it was a new site new building new people. management  was poor very low pay lots of complaints twards  management
bad,"was nice place sometimes but underpaid and underappreciated."
bad,My experience with Wend’s was terrible. Management was completely unwilling to work with high school students schedules. Workers could not work efficiently and calmly together. Zero benefits and you can work there for over a year with no raise.
bad,"It was cool at first but then it wasn’t because customers was rude , I would’ve stayed longer but I couldn’t tolerate the disrespect but the pay was pretty good every two weeks"
bad,"Wendys is a good starter job for teens But For teens who are ready to work. its a very fast paced job that is not a joke! Sometimes people are work more than suppose too and don't get paid for it which is not fair,"
bad,"Working here was very stressful. The managers didn’t care, the general manager just wanted money. It was practically kids working straight out of high school so it wasn’t very productive."
bad,"it was probably one of the worst jobs out there, this was because the managers were not very productive or approving, they also were extremely rude..."
bad,This was a terrible place with terrible people and a terrible atmosphere filled with terrible management. A place I wouldn't even recommend to someone as a  job even if they needed money.
bad,I did not like working there the pay sucked and manager sucked and I didn't want to work there anymore and me and my manager didn't get along and I quite.
bad,"The job is not bad if the crew you are working with is trained, the worst part is the management. If your looking for a job that values you going to school this is not it!!!!"
bad,I would not recommend working for the Wendy's company. The reason i quit is because while i was being rushed to an ER for a illness I was being told my medical excuse was not going to be accepted unless i had coverage. I called seven hours ahead of my shift and was lying in the ICU trying to find coverage so I did not lose my job.
bad,"Working there was very stressful and not very understandable when it came to appointments and meetings with my case worker due to fostercare until im 21. They had poor management when it came to working and asking questions. They were a fun place to be around at first, then as time went on it got worse espesually when i needed the days off they never gave me them so i had more sick days due to needing to meet with my workers and my appointmentd"
bad,"The pay was well below competative and the hours were too much fo a single parent like me, The upper management was unapproachable.  There was no praise for a good job only harsh words for not doing it even better."
bad,I would never work for wendys again. They lost my checks several times and i was late on some bills. I hated this job and feel bad for anyone who works there.
bad,"Management was terrible, very unorganized and attempted to overwork me legally as a minor. Awful scheduling, managers are rude and yell at employees as well as giving attitude to customers."
bad,"This job is very unorganized. The store managers are full of drama. Never worked at a job that has a whole house working at same store. The store manager, managers, and crew members are related whether they are mother, daughter, son, nephew, niece, cousins..."
bad,"As most fast food franchises, it has it's up as well as downs, the restaurant I had the pleasure of working with lacked team work as well as  communication & the staff were treated horribly & inhuman."
bad,"This job was one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had, the management was horrible, and they hire people who stand around all day and fire the people who do a good job"
bad,the older workers shoulder all the work load not a good place to work unless your a manager & even they have to work like the average worker they have to fill in when people don't show for work
bad,"No organization, no benefits, no flexibility. It was a good learning experience on how to interact with customers and work in a fast pace environment."
bad,"Most of the employees there are druggies and management is mostly older people who dont know what a shower is. Everyone is all around rude, mostly because most of them are teenagers."
bad,i work here before but it was not a good first job for me it made me relize i dont wanted be in that company ever again they was very rude and did not care if you was in school or not i think they should hired a new manger and they was very slow
bad,working here was the biggest mistake of my life they did not give man hours pay was terrible and management did not know they're jobs nor how to fix any situation
bad,I didn't like working for this company I worked there seven yrs and only got two raises in the time I worked there and that is because I moved up in position they don't respect and apriciate there employees you do more work than what you get paid for
bad,"Wasn't something I will ever do again , I was harassed at 17 by an older man there. An he still continued to work there . The manager was very rude to all employees an was very demanding."
bad,"I have never worked at a place this bad, there is poor job security, the wage is below the minimum wage and frankly it was the worst experience of my life. Not only have i been bullied by my manager, working here has heightened my depression to suicidal extremes."
bad,There has been lots of lack of communication. Lack of communication with team. A lot of negativities within the workjob. Could do better if communicate more often.
bad,"The management is not the best there what so ever. I had had problems clocking in for work, but the machine was broken. They did nothing about it....."
bad,The managers are hypocritical and provide minimal help during busy hours. General manager is unprofessional and cant control his temper. Obtaining the hours on the days you want is next to impossible.
bad,The average day at Wendy's consists of getting assigned to what you are going to do the second you walk in and having no clue what it was you were going to be doing beforehand (The managers always seem to put you in your least favourite position) and then it's off to the hustle and bustle of the work day. The drive thru times that the company expects you to get are ludicrously low and basically impossible to reach especially with customers taking as long as they want to order. This creates a problem because then the drive through starts backing up and no one is getting through and your drive thru times are screwed up for the rest of your shift. Overall the environment is much too stressful for the average person and I do not recommend working here.
bad,Work for this company for twelve years and upper management have no idea what they are doing.  The employees that I worked with were all great people and I only wish the best for them all though.
bad,I love the work i did i just didnt get treated with respect at all thats why i had to leave if i could change anything there it would be for managers to treat there employees right
bad,"Will only hire you until they find the next person to take your spot! Co-workers get away with being on cell phones, being disrespectful, and goofing off and not working all together! They also take advantage of teenagers and work them like dogs! More than 40 hours a week!"
bad,We were to work as a team and I understand the meaning of self teach but the managers grew lazy within a week or two of me being there. Didn't show team members appreciation just kind of throws you wherever for shifts. Very unbalanced aura at Homewood location.
bad,"i could do better managing there then the actual manager, food was disgusting to serve to people because they'd leave it cold no manager acted mature for their age"
bad,Fun work place. But a lot of double standards. Day managers seem to have everything scattered. Night managers seem to have it together. I'd work here again just not during the day
bad,"cons: "
bad,"Not a place for students, fast-food may be a great and easy first job for students but Brockville Wendy's is not youth friendly. Staff is known to be loud."
bad,"i work 8am-5pm, six or seven times a week. i learned good customer service because i was always in the window taking peoples orders. The manger was mean and just would like to explain more in interview."
bad,"I would just do yourself a favor and keep looking, if the managers arent yelling at people to work its because they are busy talking with each other about which employees they dont like, as well as im pretty sure they are sexist, there is no males on the management team and the only people that moved up in the year i worked there were woman."
bad,Terrible place to work. The management doesn't care about their employees at all. The pay is absolutely terrible and they don't respect their bonds.
bad,this is a horrable company  to work for. they will lie to you every chance they get. crappiest place i have ever worked. don't work for these people. horrable
bad,"Possibly the worst job you can ever have only because of the mangers. They are down your back watching your every move, judgmental, and beyond disrespectful to the point That I wanted to fight and I don't even fight alot."
bad,Working at wendy's is good job for teenagers while their in highschool but they do not pay enough for the amount of work that is being done for them at all.
bad,"Best thing about Wendys is the customers they have , the employees are under paid minimum wage is ridiculous Wendys only offer 26 hours a week, rarely using gloves that are there more for a show.. And having all the raw meat around the food is not sanitary"
bad,"Management is horrible , unorganized , and not professional at all. I was never trained on anything im scheduled to work everyday minus 2 .. work 5 hours a day with the pay being $8.75 and the schedule never finished on time! And lastly everyone comes here to horse around not work. i quit after a few days !"
bad,The GM will make your work experience not so great she doesn't appreciates her employee's she lost so many great workers due to her ways and she also has alot of compliments to HR but for whatever reason they don't fire her ..
bad,"management isn't great"
bad,"My scheduling is so inconsistent that I am unable to rely on my job to pay my bills. One week I will have three (yes, three) hours and I will have 30+ the next. I get sent home early (due to it not being bisy) at least once a week. Most workers aren't allowed to wear gloves, only the sandwich guy is. The grillmaster who is touching raw meat? Nope. The fry man who is putting your fries in the container? Nope. It is utterly disgusting."
bad,"Wendys started out as a great company. Things were fun and I enjoyed my job. Then routines and procedures started changing everday that resulted in customer losses, employee losses, and unhappiness. We got a new district manager that favored certain managers."
bad,A typical day at work would consists of relieving the prior crew member of their duties. It changed from day to day as I did everything. I learned how to work in a high stress environment. A lot of the management ignored the crew members flaws. A lot of my co-workers just called out everyday. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the orders you get during lunch time. The most enjoyable part is that it's a great tool to help you with multitasking.
bad,"Wendy's use to be a pretty good place to work for when I previously worked for them in the '80's & '90's. I went back in 2015, just to work about 12 to 15 hrs. a week, just to pay on my car. Started out okay. But the store is need of some major renovation & new equipment. Most everyone that works at this particular store is pretty good, however, you have a few that are complete jerks!!!!! The "" kids "" want to mainly goof off & half  do their jobs. And you have a few,including management,that are complete jerks & take out a lot of bitterness, anger, rudeness, & non professionalism on the ones that are hard workers. And supervisors do not see that the stores are taken care of or fixed up at all. This is nothing like the Wendy's that I first worked at in the Nashville, Tn. region. If the managers, supervisors, & crew members were back when I was working, they all would've been fired on the spot. No Wendy's is definitely not like it was in my day. As soon as I find another part time job.......I'm out of that nasty, stinking, smelly place."
bad,Waking up to a phone call because somebody else can't do their job isn't exactly the way I like to start my day. They overworked me till my breaking point. The only things I really learned was how terrible the staff was and how to fix most of the equipment that the payed technicians couldn't even fix. The management was a joke. they were uneducated for the most part. My co-workers even more so. The pay wasn't even worth the effort to get up in the morning and deal with the stuff. I was promised a raise at 6 months and never received one the whole year and a few months I was there. They eventually fired me for not being able to show up for one day due to brake failure that I told the manager the day before that I needed to fix. The district manager practically told me risk my life or get fired. $1500 worth of brake systems isn't worth my life. I will never work for Wendy's again and I strongly urge anyone else not to work here.
bad,"Difficult team  members to work with or be around,no team work."
bad,A typical day at work would be not having a stable schedule. Sometimes they would randomly change the schedule without letting you know. I learned how to have a great communication with customers. Management was very bad. Some coworkers were really hard to work while others where very caring and respectful. The hardest part of my job was probably dealing with angry/rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with customers.
bad,A typical day at work was fun.learn how to prep food and deal with costumers. Management was very good with me and costumer. Fun to work with.There was no hard part at job.Dealing with the costumers
bad,This place is the worst place to work....First off the managers are unprofessional and on drugs and alcoholics and hella ghetto !! Truth
bad,"I have worked with different Wendy's Franchises over the years and this was one of the worst. As a General manager I would tell my management team to do certain things the right way and they would run to their old GM whom was then the DM. Anything I asked them to do she would under write me. The owners son said that salary managers were not allowed to ""take breaks' but forced minimum wage employees only working five or less hours to take a break. This whole company is corrupt on so many levels they only cared about making money and didn't care about their employees."
bad,"Typical day consisted of setting up everything before we opened, and running around like a crazy person all day long serving orders to both the drive-thru and front-end, the restaurant area had to be clean along with the bathrooms and back offices. the hardest part of the job was the environment, and I personally didn't enjoy working with food."
bad,The only thing I learn how to work every station ....the co-workers there some of them are lazy don't like to work at some do there always that one that like to start stuff .the hardest part there is the cashier
bad,Over worked & under paid. No raises allowed even with exceptional service and no marks. No overtime allowed at all. Managers weren't qualified at the time.
bad,It sounds as horrendous as you'd think it would. terrible pay and co-workers were as intelligent as the meat i grilled. the epitome of a dead end job. I would only suggest this type of demeaning employment to high school students to learn what the value of studying in school and staying away from drugs.
bad,"Unorganized and unprofessional. The best moments of Wendy's were, meeting new people while gaining valuable customer service skills."
bad,work starts and it is high pressure. managers yelling. drugs sold and consumed. absolutely horrible. food tastes goood but is of low quality
bad,Don't want to waste my time writing a review for a job I only stayed at because I needed to for the moment. Wouldn't do it again if I was offered.
bad,"A typical day for me working at Wendy's is the fry station.  I wear a Wendy's uniform; which consist of career pants, slip-proof sneakers,  Wendy's shirt, apron, hair net, hat and company headset (to listen to orders from drive-thru window)."
bad,"This company is all about the numbers at least in my district. Cant take vacations when you want too, cant use personal days, and they have no sympathy for you when you are sick or  have a death in your family, they still want you to come to work. I have lost vacations, personal, and sick time for this company in the years I have been here and I don't think its fair to give us the days if we cant use them and when you are off they expect you to come in on your off day for an inspection something needs to be done about this enough is enough and they still are unappreciative. Also we are working over 50 hours a week at my location no other store is totally unfair and its hot and smoky as well no other store is. I just don't understand what is goin on. And they wonder why we are losing managers in the district no respect for the individual. But we give it our all and all everyday. I wouldn't recommend working here to anyone if they have to go through what we are going through."
bad,"the work was fine but the management skills were lacking they never knew what they were doing and they sometimes did not know time management skills. We ended up wasting a lot of food. Managers are not so nice. "
bad,I didn't really like working at Wendy's.  I did learn how to work in a very fast paced environment. The management was very mean. I liked the coworkers they were very helping. The hardest part of the job was getting 0 voids everyday.
bad,"I did not like working at wendys , the work place was not clean the employees  where all rude . it was supposed to be fast paste but was always slow"
bad,"Take orders, learned how to take orders, managers were nice, coworkers were nice, hardest part was closing, enjoyable was opening."
bad,It was very hard work and a place that was very stressfull and people made it more diffcult because they always wanted your job was not the best place to work. I was there 25 years because i had a family to take care of.
bad,Wendy's is a very frustrating place to work at. They are very strict and treat their workers like nothing. The manager are very rude and they talk to you whatever type of way they feel like.
bad,"My typical day consisted of taking orders inside the restaurant or at the drive-thru. I would make drinks, bag meals, and take payments. I would also be in charge of keeping the dining room clean. I learned the basic skills of having a job since this was my first. The management was the worst part of this job. There was no professionalism and many of the managers were stealing money from the registers. My co-workers weren't too great either, despite a few friends that worked their with me my other co-workers were not good workers at all and the men were constantly harassing me. The hardest part of the job was the lack of management being hit on and sexually harassed by 30 yr old men while I was 16. The most enjoyable part was working with my friends."
bad,"Fast Food is ever challenging and changing."
bad,A typical day there was really chaotic. A lot of the time we where understaffed or out of product. Also it was like they were not willing to advance their crew members. Management was great to the crew and was willing to do all they could to try and advance their crew members but they were stopped by the higher ups in the company.
bad,"Management picks favorites and hates the rest."
bad,"Store maintenance, money management and delegating employees. Store is usually busy and management isn't always the best."
bad,My manager was happy with the way that I made the customers come back and see us to get morefood service
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is serving the customers.
bad,"Bad management, Non reliable work schedules, unwilling to work around school activities, lazy coworkers, unprofessional mood"
bad,"Fast paced environment, always work to be done, however the company does not care about their employees."
bad,this job sucked  co workers were  rude to others and even managers . showed no respect
bad,Typical day was grilling and cleaning. I learned fast food is hard work! The manager was young as well we worked together as a team to accomplish everyday tasks. Mostly young people working so there was a lot of no shows or call offs.
bad,horriabe managment no one spoke english they don't properly train you an there's no respect
bad,"On a normal day I would be on cash. Usually in the drive-through window order-taking / collecting money. However, I am trained on all positions so there are days I am doing other things. I prep for the day all the things we will need in the sandwitch stations and drink stations. "
bad,"My experience working at Wendy's roebuck location has been the worst ever!!! Management sucks, they don't care at all about their employees, they don't do their jobs and they throw u under the bus to save their butts, My GM is by far the most unpleasant,unprofessional, ill mannered, person I have ever met. for what ever reason she clocks me out during work days and doesn't fix my hours, she doesn't give breaks and i explained to her that i could not do night shifts before and after i got hired and still my I work nights shifts My manager is very rude and confrontational which makes a days work unbearable.......I would never recommend anyone eating let along working there terrible!!!"
bad,is not a great job i washed dishes for 6 month not a living job or pay
bad,I would only work there for the money. Its a very stessful job depending on your co-workers
bad,"At the time of working there one manager made work life horrible, and there was inadaquite training as well."
bad,"Managment is very childish"
bad,i have never heard of or seen a place whos employees cared less about their responsibilities. SEVERE micromanagement issues as well as poor morals
bad,I work here currently as a high school student and the managment is horrible its unorganized their is no appreciation during the holidays when we works new years eve and day and Christmas eve we didnt eveven get a thank you or good job when we get a compliment we didnt even get a christmas party or any type of gift card or anything I just find that the management dosent appreciate the works and that the managers or shift supervisers alot of them dont deserve to be that and people who do d3serve to be are not and the managers just sit in the office like head office should do something about this
bad,A typical day at work consists of rude managers.
bad,I was a cashier and also prepared food. This was my first job.
bad,"I go into work every day that I am scheduled. I have only called out once for a real emergency and yet I cannot seem to get any cooperation from my managers. It has been made know that I am replaceable as a worker. I am trapped in a shift I don't want, closing shift. I have asked many times to move to day shift but it was said that would ""disrupt"" things. I can't get the hours I need, also, if you go into over-time you are written up. This makes no sense as it is not usually the worker's fault, it is the person who makes the schedule that should be written up. ALSO, at least in my store, nothing is really done the way it should be. The day crew does close to nothing and then night crew has to pick up the slack. This is the worst job I have ever had."
bad,Never had full training available. Couldn’t get upper management to understand that I never had training and basically had to teach myself everything to know about being the store manager.
bad,Your have to pretty much live there to be a manger! Unreasonable we hours. If you have kids or a family not the place to work. They just leave you stuck doing multi jobs alone.
bad,"The Store was not following labour laws and would cut your hours if you worked past overtime. You will never get the overtime payments that your have worked for. I have several times worked 50+ hours a week due to everyone quitting. The store manager would take my extra hours and give them to her Daughter."
bad,"Working for wendy's  was like working  my life away  I barely had time to spend with my family all they care about is making sure someone is at work to run their store they have no sympathy for no one family I was out sick not one person even called to check on me just wanted to know when was I coming  back to work I have witnessed two Managers die while working for this company  kno one showed up wheater was bad they stayed open putting  workers life in danger even showed  up  another  Manager "
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked, the management is absolutely terrible. And there's definitely a ""special treatment""/""favorites"" situation being played at all times. the manager does not know how to make a proper schedule so on a general day-to-day basis people don't show up people don't come in there's not enough people or maybe in some cases too many people. and since Wendy's change corporate companies the new company that owns the place has very ""UNREALISTIC"" expectations. I'm not stupid I know you have to adapt to changes and learn to deal with it but in certain situations there really isn't anything you can do. a lot of the crew is just really young and it seems like they're more there to play than anything else. it's a very bad catty high School like environment."
bad,"I have worked at two different Wendy's within the past year. The first one I worked at was in Norfolk Va this one was okay until mangers started stealing. They had mangers who was only 19 years old running the store. The second one is located in Philadelphia Pa this one is under bad management. They have very lazy mangers,all the employees do what they want. They are very dirty in that store."
bad,Work for this company for 3 years hears a lot of promoting promising just to be pushed aside by family members of other management. This is a tell them what they wanna hear company.
bad,I was hired as a manager but instead of training me properly I was never trained as a manager but was given jobs that crew do. Just before my three months ran out I was demoted and my pay was cut.
bad,"Non flexible schedule, would get mad when I needed days off but would let other workers get long periods of time off and the headsets are trash no one will really help except a few workers only like 2 good managers the rest are lazy and/or would expect you to do more then you should and I would get threatened about getting fired if I don’t come in on the days I requested off"
bad,Its nice but if you want a good job that supports you and doesnt just throw you out like the trash don't work here. Someone claimed I offended them when all I had said was I will be right with you because I had to go and help drive thru. My management didnt even try to help they just said I was suspended and didnt even bother to call me to tell me they are letting me go. They are worthless when it comes to upper management and they expect everything to be done in less that 85 seconds when orders take longer than that to take
bad,I don't recommend anyone else working there it's bad they don't train people right and there management is terrible bc they talk to people like they own them an expect people to know what there dOing an the messed up on my money an didn't pay me right
bad,The managers always felt that they were better than everyone expect for about 2. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. They are very inconsiderate and unfair to the teenagers that are employed there. Although it had it's fun times. The general manager is very rude.
bad,The place was full of drama  it’s like everyone was in everyone’s business  a lot of people let personal situations get in the way of what they had going on
bad,The wendy's i worked at was terrible. I should never have become a manager. They treat you badly and expect you to work yourself to death for nothing.
bad,"They were not flexible, tried over working me. And always for me to stay later, worst job possible in Parker. Co workers and managers were mean, job wws very busy"
bad,"Rude staff and managment  everyone who works there in unmotivated and uncaring,the sanitary rules they make you follow are horied like dumping used greese on the paties"
bad,"The current regional management at Wendy's in the Okanagan to put it simply is abusive and no one does anything about it. Watch out for the regional manager, she is a monster in a tiny Asian women's body."
bad,Except you to do the job of 4 people when they are short handed or while other people are standing around and playing on their phone's. And want you to work while you are sick.
bad,One manager is always yelling and has family who works in the same place and never get complained at and always watch over anyones shoulders and laugh at other workers and talk about you in other languages. On my first day of training I was left alone at the register and had to constantly go back and get another crew member or the manager. I was not ready to be alone at the register and needed more assistance.
bad,"It was like being in the middle of ""All My children"" what a soap opera. Just games and drama.Aint no money worth the headaches! Bunch of kids playing games and adults who have zero desire to get their act together."
bad,"Bad management and they payed me like a minor when I working fulltime , and horrible customers. Very perverted Male coworkers and disrespectful. Manager had anger problems and lashed out all the time and would leave for several breaks."
bad,the best part of the job was how well communication was with most of the other employees. most of management were understanding and responsible. if there wasn't any drama being brought into the workplace.
bad,At first I thought it was great till I got to see how there is no respect period between mangers & employees . Mangers lie constantly leave all the employees to do everything even knowing they short handed. Mangers call you stupid talk to you how you want. Do not handle any situation properly. Constantly talking behind each other back. Constant drama and disrespect. Broken promises to movement in advance. I . maybe new management could straighten it out but if not. I do not recommend to work at.
bad,"Most Wendys are disgusting in the inside they usually like to make it appear as if the job is clean but it’s never really clean only for the moment , I’ve had a lot of family members that work for the company and all left because they are working harder then they get paid."
bad,"trabajar en wendys es un lugar donde puedes sentirte confiado a que su seguridad con la comida es muy importante para ellos, al igual que el trato a los clientes es su mayor prioridad"
bad,"nothing good to say about wendys except the co workers were good to work with. id never work here. alot of sanitation isnt followed, people eating food on the job."
bad,I didnt like the pay they only paid 7.25 and it was real far from where i stay at so i needed something closer anyway so i been applying for jobs hopeful i get the job .
bad,"Loved the people that I worked with but management was not good. Was promised for a month to go on day shift but nothing came of it. Requested days off for baby doctor appointments, I was scheduled to work over the appointments."
bad,Didn’t get a long with the managers. Wasn’t able to receive a raise. It was also hard to request days off. It was so much stress and I am glad I quit. Never had an opportunity to grow.
bad,"They had me throw 60+ pound bags of grease into the trash bin with normal trash, which Im pretty sure grease needs to go in a grease trap and be disposed of by a company to prevent a fire. They also treated me like i was 5 when I clearly was more knowledgeable about fast food operation from my previous job at DQ."
bad,"The managers didn't communicate with the other employees. I wasn't told that there was a crew app until after 3 days, and it wasn't by a manager. I tried calling in to tell them I had to have an emergency surgery and couldn't come in due to complications and the phones didn't connect, nor did they try to call me."
bad,There is always something to do. When you first come in you have to clean up and stock up by a certain time. Management is always checking up on their employees. Th hardest part is trying to make drive-thru time.
bad,"I started off with 13-20 hours a week during my training. My training was lack luster and once they decided that I wasn't doing a good enough job, they cut my hours to 5 hours a week."
bad,The workers spare a couple are lazy and the management spare a single one are all terrible at there jobs. I could not have had a worse experience with all the stress they put me through.
bad,"The managers at least are decent at helping others, but the atmosphere of the store is purely toxic. Nobody cares about each other and they said they were like a family. There is so much to do in slower times, but they just sit or stand there and talk loudly or play on their phones. Also, everybody swears there and that adds to the terrible environment. I would rather be working in Peru than work here again! I have already wanted to quit severall times. Some of the employees are very immature. I am still waiting to learn other skills. Two people have quit in my time there, and i would quit too if i had a better job!"
bad,"The One Thing Is......  You get Paid every other Friday, as opposed to twice a month, like the 5th and the 20th or the 1st and 15th.  You absolutely lose money that way (Unless you chose salary instead of hourly.), whether it's the extra hours you have to work [88] on the twice a month or the fact that twice a month is a Total of 24 paychecks a year and Every Other Friday is a total of 26 paychecks a year.  Either way, you are out some money and the Employer knows this and is greedy, which is just sad and pathetic on their part!!"
bad,Most of upper management and most crew never followed the rules or cared about other employees. After an employee left they alls reaped rumors and tried to interfere with the former employees life.
bad,"1) A typical day at work would consist of working very hard so your manager can sit in the office the whole time and then blame you for doing a bad job. Very rude customers, and the demand is very high and can be overwhelming at times."
bad,Nothing to imply about this company at the moment. My experience does not reflect the company as a whole just those I worked with during my employment there.
bad,This was my first job. Good for a first job but that's about it. Lots of work with little to show for it. Lots of rude customers. Little room for advancement.
bad,"Deal with persistently impatient and inconsiderate customers. Dealing with egotistical management. Dirty working conditions. Hard to get enough hours, not enough pay per hour."
bad,It was a living nightmare. The management (except for one manger) were extremely rude and didn't care about you well being. The place was constantly unsanitary. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Wendys was a start to my mangment millstone I just wish they had better benefits an more workers they only worry about Wendys not your health I worked 5-6 night folding on the weekends with not enough crew members to run the store properly but I held down the store for 1 year as a manager until I couldn’t do it anymore
bad,Work 6 to 7 days a week without compensation  no matter how well you do for them they are always trying to replace you for someone who will take less money
bad,Worse two years of my life. Upper management was terrible. Never got a vacation in two years because they could never keep the stores staffed with management. District manager's never worked only company I've seen where district manager's never worked weekends. Claimed to be a Christian bases company but with no christian values. My advice stay away
bad,"Management is clueless and demanding, with little to no respect for their crew's availability and written work hours. The crew I worked with was the only redeemable quality about the job, and the only reason I stayed."
bad,My experience was not the best. It was my first real job. I had to take time off because of my surgery and to talk to the manager before I started the job and weeks before and the week before the actual date. after I was approved by the doctor to go back to work the manager never scheduled me again.
bad,I would not work for Wendys again. There was poor management in which I was harassed. They were very unprofessional. The pay was minimal. There were major hour cuts also.
bad,"The pay was terrible, management was more concerned with trying to socialize and be liked by the crew than keeping up with the store. No benifets what so ever. There was alot of drama with crew members back and forth which i find personally distracting im a fast paced environment like fast food."
bad,"I was working anywhere from 60 to 95+ hours in a week, sometimes I worked open to close then open due to lack of managers. The hardest part of my job was keeping the employees due to low pay and harder work than you think, management didn’t care as long as they got their pay and bonuses."
bad,"Awful managers that want to screwover your hours. Crooks that steal from the store, old grouchy customers that are rude for no reason. Dont work here."
bad,"Min. wage pay, horrible managers, higher ups expected more work, less pay. 1 week vacation for shift supervisors, no breaks even if you worked 10+ hours a day."
bad,The work place there was very stressful and cut throat. I felt like I was out of place working there. And everyone looked very depressed while working.
bad,"I was promoted to be store manager. I was doing all the hiring, scheduling, and interviewing. I never got my management pay and was still be paid as a crew member."
bad,"It’s okay, not too bad not too good. You’re way overworked for 7.25. I think that they should give more hours, Like if people made 7.25 then i think they should atleast get 12 hours or more."
bad,"The work was fairly easy and it went at a decent pace. Although the crew was friendly, i believe they didn't have a good enough work ethic to sustain their jobs."
bad,I don't think I was treated fairly the supervisors had preferences. The work was really harsh not to mention the long standing which caused my feet to be swollen and aches and pains. It just wasn't my field of work and to top it off the work was too much for the salary being paid.
bad,"Depending upon management, this would be a horrible place for anyone to work. I was a high school senior when I worked here. They did not have enough employees to fulfill the job."
bad,"This is a very fast paced and stressful job. You have to manage several people at one time, handle any and all customer service situations, handle call outs and get shifts covered, plus any other operational defect that may come along. Sometimes there are issues you take to hire up managers to let them know what kind of environment employees are working in and nothing gets done about it. There are jobs with less stress, better hours and are easier to do that pay more than the GM's are making. Many other restaurant jobs pay more to their crew members than what a shift manager is making. The demand of things to get done in a day is unreasonable."
bad,It was the most annoying job I've ever had staff was terrible the management and the owner even worse. Im so glad I quit I would never go back there !
bad,"great for a first time job or second job, i wouldnt make it a career the manger at the time had favorites that didnt do any work so the work was all on you"
bad,"This is a good place to get a first job. It was my first job and I learned how to work in a team, and how to be in customer service. It can be hectic at times and other times very boring."
bad,"The employees including management were very unprofessional. They may have been going for the family vibe, but for me it felt negative and isolating at times. Otherwise it was ok for a fast food place."
bad,This job is surrounded by a very stressful environment. The managers are poor schedulers and only did the schedule that fit their life and not the style of the business.
bad,great company in Columbia Missouri. great people fun and efficient. nice and clean environment. poor management but other employees are great to work with
bad,"lot to say about this people but i honestly dont want to remember about such a nightmare but was ok a some point but then was just bad in all aspect, bad placed to work at."
bad,"The manager was rude "
bad,"i hate wendys, they are so rude and out of placed and mess people schedules up it has been a whole mess and i just want to leave that place and never come back."
bad,NPC  took over Davco.  They did not have me at the system. I could not get paid when the other employees got paid.  They move me from store to store  Due to me being put in a store that was not a training store. New company very unorganize
bad,"Like any other fast-food franchise, it was a fast-paced, stressful, and low-paying job that kept you on your feet the entire time you are at work.  The pay is terrible, especially for the responsibilities that come with being a manager, and the benefits are non-existent."
bad,It is a challenge working for a company that projects themselves as a professional and caring place to work but is not. The bottom line is the profit margin and the treatment of the front line workers is insulting and demeaning.
bad,"Although Management did do their absolute best with what they had to work with, it was not a healthy place to work at and for. Highly stressful. I wouldn't recommend working here."
bad,"Working at Wendy's was by far my worst experience in terms of working. Everybody who worked with me was disrespectful and were very unwilling to train new employees. The management was terrible, as they hired a lot of new employees but were not willing to train them. Not to mention the terrible pay. This is not a reflection of the entire Wendy's as a business, but for the particular one that I worked for."
bad,"Lots of inaccurate order taking. Not a clean work environment. Employees are lazy and nobody wants to do there job. On the plus side, they do make good food."
bad,Night management is terrible though day shift is great. Not understanding with taking days off and an extremely fast paced environment. Management plays favorites with employees and watch out if youre not a favorite.
bad,"Problems with lots of roaches and Management doesn't know how to manage associates. Big ""revolving door"" aspects when it comes to hiring and replacing employees."
bad,they did not train probably i ended up burning my hands with hot grease do to poor training managers meant well but you could tell they did not care about you personally.
bad,Did a lot of duties for Wendy's without benefits of any kind with the exemption of occasional overtime. If the team has fun on the job you should be having fun as well to make the time go by quickly.
bad,Mangers are very rude. They dont training you on anything. They have minors working things they are under age for.They didnt train me how to work grill and wrote me uo for not knowing how.
bad,the overall manager was a jerk . but the hired staff was a great helping to me . i also learned that dont choose to work at a place just because your friend wanted you to .
bad,It's a ok place to work pay is not all that. Crew is nice and friendly. Mangers are always nice to crew sometime it may be slow when we don't have any orders.
bad,"It was a nice job when I was young, but the management could care less because they too have to have food stamps to eat. Long hours make self improvement impossible and society degrades you like the corporate leadership. They even tried to convince me to not join the army saying ""it isn't better than here."""
bad,"The management was horrible; they are rude and unclear on what tasks you need to perform. When I first started working there, none of the managers trained me, they simply just gave me a position and expected me to know everything on my first day. The managers seemed to focus more on feeding themselves than serving food to the customers. They schedule you to work as low as 2 hours a day; they won't give you a full work day. It was one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had."
bad,Just a job to build experience. The A/C hasn't worked there in months and they go through employees alot. They also either cut your hours very low or work you 40 hours a week with no breaks. Terrible place to work for.
bad,My typical day at work was to clock in and work anywhere that i was needed. I learned that i was quick in a rush with bagging and that i dealt great with customers there. The management was unfair the main manger picked her favorites and they got special treatment and if you were her favorite she would point out your flawless and make you feel worthless. However i loved my co workers they were fun and great to be around ! The hardest part of the job was maintaining the dinning room clean on a rush or when were short people. The enjoyable part of the job were the employees.
bad,Very stressful environment with hard work that didn't pay well at all. Location I worked in was more sanitary than the others but other than that very stressful.
bad,Needed a job you cant make a living off working at a fastfood place the people that worked there were nice and did their job was not a bad company just not a career job
bad,"Overall working at Wendy's was not a bad experience, it helped me gain great skills while working with people and to be more outgoing. The working environment was not the greatest, but I did enjoy the people I worked with. Management was not the greatest either, they did not take anyone serious. If an employee was hurt, they were told to ""suck it up and continue their shift."" Unless, they were able to find someone to cover for them. I was always treated very unfair and poorly, especially since I was promoted to manager which does seem odd because I was always a fast and hard-worker, which usually that would be something you get rewarded for, but not at Wendy's."
bad,"my time at Wendy's had its ups and downs. "
bad,I worked with men from a certain country who did not respect women and I was offered a store managers position at the most dangerous store in the area because they said I spoke their language and the color of my skin they would respect me more there. Managers would not come in for their shifts and I would have to pull doubles sometimes even triple shifts.
bad,"Things here attempted to be professional, but couldn't actually pull it off. The other employees were disrespectful, and the Management couldn't handle those with any needed attitude adjustments."
bad,It was fun working for Wendy's good staff excellent services friendly atmosphere management was great they did appreciate the work we did.
bad,"My typical day at work would be coming in counting my drawer, stocking the work units, taking and handing out orders, making drinks, fries, and nuggets. Throughout the day vaccuming, sweeping, and cleaning bathrooms. End of the day scrub and mopping the floors, cleaning windows, and clocking out. The management is horrible they aren't patient, very rude and disrespectful. The hardest part of the job is trying to get the lobby clean and run back to take orders. The most enjoyable part was the discount and meeting new people."
bad,Needs help with management. Did not learn anything. I cleaned and cooked and helped customers
bad,"Very demanding, not so fun to work in. There always wanting more out of you to do with the little pay they give, its just not worth it."
bad,"worked in fast food ,customer "
bad,"I learned that Wendy's in Nashville they keep who they want. They have favorites the manager do want they don't suppose to do like leave work early and not work there whole shift like every other manager.Manager's Family working with family when they say we not suppose too that what we was told by the head manager. The Managers just don't follow rules, Except for one manager. "
bad,"steady routine, learned how to multitask, and make burgers and fries. Co-workers weren't the best, but ok. Hardest part was when co-workers was late or called out and had to work overtime or stay when I should be off."
bad,"A typical day at work depended on what day it was due to me being in school during my employment at Wendy's.  During the weekday, I usually had midshifts and came in to run the grill during the dinner rush and do some pre-closing activities (ei. Mopping the back floors).  Week-ends I was usually on closing shift and always ran grill."
bad,i was 2nd ic of Wendy when it was in port Douglas would report daily back to the manager
bad,A typical day at work for me would be very tired sometimes my day can go slow sometimes my day can go fast. I have my good days and bad days. I learned to work under pressure and communication skills .I didnt like some of my co-workers they had bad attitudes and they were doing things they should not been doing.Enjoyed working period but not working at a fast food restaurant .
bad,Workers doing drugs on the job. I did not feel safe at all. Management wasn't so greet. I was hired by one manager and the next day I came to work and it was another manager there that wasn't informed that I was working the and told me to leave and not to come back.
bad,"Its fast food, what else needs to be said. Smell nasty when you get home, just not very pleasant."
bad,"There is no job possibly worst. The entire environment is terrible. You go home smelling like grease after seeing the worst in everyone. Not a job for people with short tempers or any lack of self confidence. I was never once treated with respect and the ability to talk with my co-workers in a mutual language - forget it! You get in trouble for things not even your fault, the hours suck and there is no real benefits for working here minus holidays off."
bad,Was a hot environment. Customers were rude and management was rude also
bad,"i made food, i took money,i worked as a team, i cleaned. i was in the window giving orders out"
bad,"A typical day involved food prep, cleaning and stocking."
bad,Worked various positions with nice people at the crew spot. Management was up and down due to the high rate of turnover in the general manager position. The hardest part of the job was covering for people when they called of work...
bad,do not work at this wendys ever it was bad they never gaves us a raise and it was not good. it was a franchise not international.
bad,"As an employee i felt stuck in my position. I felt like advancement was limited, granted i wasn't really looking for growth with the company. The managers were completely incompetent and only cared about themselves. I received awful hours even though management told me i was a good worker."
bad,"Wendy's, although it offers competitive salaries, provides no health benefits for crew only supervisors and up. Be prepared to work anywhere from 40-60 hours a week with 10-15 hour shifts and a 30 minute break. Be prepared to do work that is not part of your job description and deal with customers that range from very sweet and understanding to very irate and hostile, includint threats of violence. This is my experience while working from 2004-2007 at Wendys in NYC. I base my review on my experience in NYC not on Wendy's overall as a company."
bad,"Worst job ever. Definitely needs to increase employee safety, customer support, and treat employees with respect. They do not treat customers with care when they order."
bad,"This company is not a good place to work for, they are incompetent and lazy and no real management is available. This place is a joke. If your planning to work here, I recommend offering to be management and maybe you could take the store managers position & get the store to actually run properly."
bad,"Terrible work environment, the manager is nasty and unclean messy hair no hair net no gloves fixing food in front of us, as a family like she lives in the back and has not been home in weeks"
bad,"I've witnessed racial and se*ual discrimination. They will make false promises and lie to get what they need from you and fire you if you complain at all. Employees are paid as little as possible while management enjoys luxurious trips to Las Vegas and numerous other conventions at very nice hotels. To join the elitist club of management is nearly impossible and all the upper management are very drunk with their power. I wasted 3 years of my life along with college tuition, taking management courses in order to get recondition for advancement. I won't even eat there anymore. Wendy's of Missouri is a corrupt company. I highly recommend everyone stay away from anything they have to offer."
bad,Will have you close open store while working 15 days in a row ask for help with coverage none given told it’s my responsibility.......................
bad,This job was not good at all they treat you with no respect and you get no breaks at all and the managers are rude and think they can talk to you any kind of way .
bad,"They schedule for 50 and expect you to work 60+ hours, apart from that they also want you to work from home like making schedules and stuff. Alot of promises but no one full fills. They will tell you about bonus but you will never get one. Training procedures are zero for GMs and they lead them to failures by just throwing them to stores. My review is only for Wenco Franchises."
bad,"Lack of communication, professionalism not happy with the way the company runs business, people always getting yelled at and cussed out by GM he always forgets things"
bad,"They hired a 14 year old even though that means everyone else will have to do the work he cant even though you are already swampt with tasks in the middle of a rush"
bad,They 100% need to raise their starting salary. People work so hard there and get barely enough to get by on pay day. It’s crazy how much they will work you and not even give you a raise for all you’re doing to help them.
bad,The job is horrible it’s no getting around it I guess you can say it’s good for somebody Older because this by far is the worst job ever. I actually liked it at first probably because of the people
bad,When I say this im not speaking for every Wendy’s in the world just the one where I worked.The manger is very unprofessional and verbally abusive. She treat her employees like their less than And doesn’t have respect for Anyone.
bad,"Very bad level of communication. Also no steady payment was witnessed by myself in the duration pf time i spent there. Distribution of hours, and upkeep on breaks was significantly low. Also no type of understanding in regards to means of transportation when coming from a great distance."
bad,"One may have to work a 10hr shift with no break."
bad,I was blamed for a mess that a co-worker clearly made. The management do not treat the workers fairly with giving time off and wrongfully suspended some people on the work place.
bad,The management was awful. They were very unprofessional and regularly cursed at employees. The management couldn't even multi-task or properly train employees on the various aspects of the food service industry.
bad,"A day at Wendy's would include grilling burgers for 6 hours and scrambling to close on time "
bad,Upper management lack the training and education to run stores properly. GM’s DM’s change stores ever few months not steady enough to have impacts on these stores.
bad,I hated everything about working at wendy's. the customers talk to you like trash. The managers are trash and they treat their team as such. Don't work at a wendys unless you seriously need a job
bad,"Suffering from horrendous management and lack of adherence to procedure, the Wendy's I worked at has literally given me PTSD. I cannot ever work at one of those establishments again. The company simply is a worse and less well-equipped McDonald's, with several customers reporting that McDonald's did everything Wendy's did but better. Food safety procedures are loosely enforced, communication between corporate and franchise is near non-existent, and rate of pay doesn't nearly justify the amount of work needed to be done to maintain the establishment."
bad,"Used to be an amazing place to work. Now all they care about is money, regardless of how you make it. They add more stuff to do, but take away the amount of people you can have. Belittle the managers that are trying to get them to quit so that they can hire in for less money. Can't wait to leave this place in the past."
bad,Wendy’s was a good company to work for up until they got new managers who had absolutely NO KNOWLEDGE of how Wendy’s works. They are very disrespectful and cannot do their job correctly. Always had to work extra days with little to no help in the store. Upper management needs to be fired ASAP.
bad,"I was treated like dirt there, tons of work to do and no team effort at that place....nobody helped each other out at all they were all in it for themselves, and that sucks......"
bad,"Not only was my treatment unfair but the management was horrible. My ""Bosses"" loved to pick favorites, it got to the point that employees would just no call no show with no consequences. Coincidentally, as one of the very few minorities employed there, I was also expected to do far more than my other employees and constantly given ultimatums that threatened my personal security and job security. There were also managers who felt more than comfortable groping a few of the employees""on accident."" Absolutely atrocious treatment for certain employees"
bad,Working with rude customers and there sarcasm. Didn't like for money to be thrown at me. Feeling unappreciated. Great work goes unnoticed. Had to take verbal abuse from customers because we are not allowed to say anything to them.
bad,"Some of the people I worked with were great, but others weren't. To be completely honest some of the workers there are complete creeps and made me so uncomfortable to the point I had to quit."
bad,"not enough pay for amount of work, have to travel for product several times a week because we aren't allowed to order anything. have to work all shifts, when managers below me don't."
bad,Managers were not respectful of employees and not understanding people long hours with only a 30mins break which u have to stand in line for about 20mins to order yours food which you have to hurry and eat and you don’t receive any benefits
bad,its not easy but it’s something small & manageable to put up with while being in school. i suggest fast-food because it hire’s at a young age with a permit
bad,i think they need more mangers and people that work as a team need more people to clean and they need mantancies they need more help mangers need to get it together in person
bad,Wendy's is a mess to work for if ur not there pick it nothing theyvtear I down make u feel less than what u are worth an u have to work there a ur for u can get any type of insurance if something broke it takes for ever to get it fixed
bad,"Not a place to stay and grow, but if you are looking for a first time job. Be my guest. This job's pay is not enough to live of off. Working here is overly stressed and exaggerated, for no reason."
bad,Opportunity to work with costumer service face to face Learn the bussness culture and also great opportunity for those who will like to keep on the field
bad,"Short, 4.5 hour shifts with no break (15 minute break was legally required, but was never offered/received). Working two or three positions at once."
bad,"I disliked working at Wendy's from the start. I would work from 3:45 pm to nearly midnight every night and as a minor who was trying to graduate high school a year early, that is an awful lot of work.  it ultimately leads me to experience a lot of stress and a deep decline in my mental health. The staff was rude and would argue in front of customers, the manager/store owner would not understand my need for a change in schedule and most nights I wouldn't even receive the half-hour break I was entitled to!"
bad,Not a very good place to work very stressful and not paid enough. To much drama about employees home life. And not getting more than 19 hours a week sucked.
bad,"not the kind of work i was interested in. general greasy fast food environment. managers were unkind when I delivered my two weeks notice, so i decided to quit sooner."
bad,"Always very busy between drive thru and front register. There isn't enough time to open and do everything, same with closing. Hard to get things done in such a short amount of time."
bad,"They barely gave me any hours. On the days i did work, the managers wanted to schedule me til 1am while I had previously told them I was still in high school and could not work that late."
bad,Constantly changing crew combined with outdated and often irritating management techniques make for a very frustrating work environment. Higher levels of management seemed disconnected from the actual needs of employees.
bad,"A typical day of work on the closing shift (6pm-2am) would be making sandwiches, Cleaning all appliances basic register operation, lots of customer service, and general cleaning."
bad,Working for Wendy's was very stressful. I had to deal with a lot of call outs and being short staff all the time the management team wasn't team players.
bad,"I don't like this job anymore. No bonus, very stressful for a minimum wage. No increase in salary after 4 years. Even the supervisor get a very low salary for the hard job that they do."
bad,Very understaffed and restaurant is not ran correctly. Not an environment someone wants to come to work at everyday. Very quick paced though it taught me how to work very quickly.
bad,it is not fully organised sometimes mess can be seen at workplace. not everyone Is cooperative which makes it difficultu to work at this place. culture is not that good.
bad,"I apologize if my review is a little dramatic but in my defense, I loved my job and I loved the costumers. BUT the management is very poor. sometimes it felt like it wasn't any manager working. me including a couple others constantly had to step in for the managers and do there job. eventually it became a horrific place to work. employees fighting everyday, arguing, name calling, more. right in front of the managers and they did NOTHING! I myself reported multiple incidents and waited months for something to happen, but it never did. Beware don't work here"
bad,"- mauvais gérant"
bad,I do not recommend this job the only good thing about it is the managers. The crew members are petty and the environment sucks. Costumers were always rude
bad,i gave my all to Wendy's when i worked there sacrificing 2 years worth of weekends....i even came in the snow with my minimal transportation i rode the bus for 2  years. the management was horrible except for a few who actually took the job seriously which none of us did really a typical day at work was being stuck in a hopeless drive through struggling to keep the time down the workplace enviroment however was substantial for the most part we got along really well some of us....others not so much the hardest part of the job had to be the drive through definitely makes you never want a fastfood job again but the most enjoyable part of the day was usually the first 3 hours of work. ultimately if i hadn't been fired for such a lowbrow act i would have more pleasant things to say.
bad,Had a hard time with higher management. Not willing to listen to employees. Worked hard but didn't get any recognition because of attitudes of higher bosses.
bad,i learned to be fast and quickly get done with my work. i learned to clean well and fast too. i also learned to manage and hold cash in my draw. lastly i learn and few cooking skills.
bad,We opened the store in a timely manner and tried to serve our customers to the best of our ability.This happened everyday seven days a week. No days off and no vacations.
bad,"Job is very stressful, You do many different task for only 7.25-7.50 an hour which is not enough money. Schedule is constantly changing its never a set schedule."
bad,The schedules are fixed and your ALWAYS in the same few positions causing workers to become overwhelmed. I wouldnt recommend this to ANYONE.The managers treat you as if you aren't anything. There is alot of drama. Most workers are rude to customers and they have no integrity at all.
bad,Wendy's was a horrible place to work once I went into management. The balance between work and life was horrible. I felt like I wasn't allowed to have a life because I needed to be there all the time. We were always short staffed and the store manager was lazy and expected everyone else to do everything while we ran the store for her and she hid in the office.
bad,Very Horrible work Environment Employees where sloppy and disrespectful too each   other people getting fired managers getting fired this was the most unorganized business I've seen in My 22yrs of Life  All Wendy's aren't bad I'm sure but my experience was terrible
bad,Working here is horrible you get paid $8.25 Is not something anyone can live on . They hire so many people and then give everyone 20 or less a week . That sucks . Plus your working with a bunch of teens
bad,"great for anyone under 18 for their first job. Good job for experience in restaurant industry. Wendy's has decent pay , flexible hours. Management is very kind and helpful."
bad,the pay was not good but the management would promote you if you were doing a jon and putting in an effort. the day/night went fast and for a first time job i would recommend but not permenent
bad,Poco espacio para compatibilizar vida privada y familiar. Horarios demandantes
bad,"Every day when I could come into work, I would hear nothing but poor language and awful remarks about other coworkers. When asking to have fewer shifts since I am a Highschool student, my hours would get dropped from 30-10 which is not what i asked for nor what i needed to live off of. Wendys doesn't care if you're contagiously sick or have family issues, if you call in sick with valid proof that you are sick, they will complain about it and most likely still make you come work and deal with the public and serve food."
bad,I worked with this place for 2 years. And went through 2 managers whilst working there. The first manager was not that great but then we had upgraded to a manager that actually seemed to care about her crew. This is okay for a first job but I wouldnt recommend it.
bad,"clock in, work , do everybody else job, no team work. they don't like to look into things if you face a situation. you can work your but off and still you lose in the end if they think that something went wrong. u don't have a voice when it comes to your job."
bad,"Wendys is a great plaxe to eat and get a frosty. As far as working there its pretty easy but everyone tend to n do what they want when they want, whuch makes it stressful for peopl wo do they job."
bad,This job is for kids I would not recommend this job if u have kids or a lot of bills this job will not pay your bills it will buy you some new shoes if that what u like
bad,It's a job if you absolutely need one but very poor management they hold back a week so depending on when you start you may be waiting 3 weeks to get paid as they only pay every 2 weeks and they will not let you get over 40 hours the crew members are pretty friendly but the managers are always rude and in a bad mood the hardest part of the job is how many times they change what you are doing in a day the best part of the job is when you get off and get to go home cash register is the easiest position
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Wendy's if you can't handle a rude customer or rude manager who always wants you to do the stuff they don't want to
bad,Very bad place to work they treated me poorly over worked me and ungreatful of there workers not a good place to work i would never work there ever again
bad,Its a good place  fast pace  but the managers are really sorry  there is good people on the world some people are just mean a low down but I love what I do when are where I'm working at just don't try to use me cause I do my job I love to work an have my on money
bad,Fast food fast speed service.   It can be aill headache at times we stay open late and weekends be busy it depends who work and sometime we leave at 2 am
bad,"hectic miserable depressing"
bad,I don't necessarily have anything to say about Wendy's other than the fact that the staff I currently work with is fun and nice but the way the management runs the store is absurd and disgusting.
bad,"Paper checks are always late. The managers are all backstabbing. You won't get any hours or if you do they will often send you home early. In a word, TERRIBLE."
bad,"typical day working at Wendy 's doing the parking lot ,unloading boxs and running the grill. Making sure the store stayed clean and stock . Hardest part of the job was when rush hour hit to keep meat on that grill and store clean."
bad,The company was decent but it was just a lot of stress that I was dealing with at the job. although I would always get my check loaded to my card I always had money that I never received.
bad,"The manager at the time of my employment was a man with a large temper who was not afraid to show his anger, no matter how irrational the cause. The work environment was very hostile and tense due to this."
bad,"Working in Wendy's was a rush, its was fast paced, hot and served a lot of people with in a matter of hours. When there's a strong team in place, the store runs smooth even though the workers are underpaid."
bad,A typical day at work is very stressful. They have a hard time keeping workers because of the stress. Management needs a lot of work. Hardest part of the job is closing and the most enjoyable part of the job is some of the employees are interesting people.
bad,Miserable managers. The managers are always in some kind of fight with someone. They like to point out very small flaws. There is a lot of closing work in every position.
bad,"Great first job just to get you going, had great employees very open and fun to be around. the employees made it fun to work there. Easy straight to the point job."
bad,"Ordering and counting inventory deposits"
bad,"It's an easy job, but can be very stressful. You have to deal with rude customers every second of the day, not enough pay, lazy co-workers and managers and very understaffed."
bad,a typical work day was 4 to 6 hours a day working in the hot kitchen. I've learned more about hoe to deal with co workers and customers. the management was horrible they were mean. the work culture was drama all the time. the hardest part of the job was cooking food and serving customers. the most enjoyable part was that it was a flexible schedule.
bad,"bad always miscommunication "
bad,A typical day at Wendy's was sometimes stressful it was very unorganized. Management was very rude at times and unprofessional. Customers being upset because of slow service. Hardest part was just trying to stay positive when dealing with customers and other employers attitudes.
bad,Does not pay you enough. The Gm was very rude and angry all the time. Does not give yu 40 hours a week. Close really late and they can send yu home when they went.
bad,You're expected to do everything perfectly although they do not provide the appropriate training. There is room for growth and for the most part Wendy's always made work fun.
bad,"this place is one of the worst places to work. ""shift supervisors"" are rude and privelged by general managers. night shifts are constantly understaffed while openings and mid-shifts are over staffed. constant pressure into coming in on days off and staying late to work. typically, night crew is left with mid-shift's unfinished work. get insulted and constantly told you will be fired by GM. lack of respect for employees. favoritism is a huge problem within the store. difficult to call out, and constantly given attitude if you cannot come in to work.  night crew is the only somewhat enjoyable shift at this establishment, but is constantly left with extra work and left short staffed and widley disrespected by whole store."
bad,"Typical day for me when I worked there is to clock in, usually get started from there. While I was working there, I worked the fryer. Making fries and nuggets. Preparing them to get put in the bags. I also learned how to make baconator fries. My coworkers I didn't like. They were rude and mean, most of them. There were some that was nice and helpful. I was also getting burned with the oil popping up on me on my skin. Being asked to sweep while orders were coming like crazy. It was a lot trying to keep putting in fries and nuggets when they went so fast especially the fries. I just didn't like that job and it wasn't for me."
bad,The crew is good but the management is not so good. The way its managed makes it difficult to make the work environment fair to work at.
bad,"Bullied by the GM a lot, heartless management team, even for there hard workers."
bad,A day at Wendy's you had to prepare yourself everyday. I went through 4 different General Managers. I lost count on how many managers and coworkers came and went. It was my first job but also my worst. I learned work experience and management work also. My management was all over the place. My schedule was horrible and my daughter was a toddler at that time. I was working so much it felt like I was rarely at home. My coworkers would walk out on the job or nor even show up. The hardest part about dealing with that job was that you to put yourself in a mindset to make it through the day/night. The only part that I enjoyed about that job was I received management training.
bad,"volunteered for a few years learned alot, employees weren't happy with management, I had a good relationship with manager. ok place to volunteer if your goin into healthcare."
bad,"This place had the best management at a job I could ever ask for. Great hours , even the staff was awesome. Had way to much drama for me though, constant rumors and problems and I hate that in a work place."
bad,"This company was a drag to work for the company was decent but the co workers were so immature and un professional ."
bad,A typical day at work i was always rushed. It was way to hot in the tight spots and i was doing 2/3 things at a tine with no help.
bad,"a typical day working here was fast paced with plenty of customer interaction."
bad,I put up with verbal abuse and mistreatment that never got dealt with and was never able to quick because I need money. They don't even pay managers a living wage. They are good about taking time off for whatever reason but many of my other coworkers also received mistreatment. It is not a place I would recommend.
bad,"Working at Wendy's was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. Definitely not worth minimum wage. The general manager was horrible to work with and schedules people on days they tell him way in advance that they can't work. I was a student when I worked here, and gave him my availability, which ended around 10pm on school nights but there were times that I was scheduled until close at 2 in the morning. Many times we ran out of certain (popular) food items and had to tell customers that it wasn't available. We ran out of cups and plasticware and potatoes a lot. I heard that after I left, they ran out of burger meat a few times."
bad,"dealing with co workers attitude, busy dealing with customers attitude bad pay for the work i do. boss has favourites over someone"
bad,Manager made workplace hard to work at because she was very disrespectful towards customers and employees. She was always yelling every time someone seen her.
bad,"not very respectful only care about themselves, pressure you to do everything, need to learn everything on your own with no help."
bad,"While working at Wendy's I did have some enjoyable moments, but it just isn't a place I wouldn't recommend anyone to work. yes a agree its a nice job if your in high school and its your first job and you need extra money, but as a job your working at as an adult and you need to pay bills a strongly wouldn't recommend"
bad,My experience at Wendy's was not very good. The working environment was not very friendly and I guess I didn't learn that much except cashing.
bad,"Wendy's is one of the absolute worst jobs I have ever encountered in my life! Management is poor, Co-workers are by fair professional ! The hardest part of the job was keeping your personal belongings in a safe place away from your co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting a happy pleasant customer."
bad,"Poor management, they didn't have control of the employees, lacked proper training skills."
bad,"Job is hard work ,at times during rush hours. I cook over 100 patties in a days time.  My supervisors help at time.  I enjoy my co-workers we work well together. The hardest part of my  job is  no have a break for 5 and 6 hours at a time."
bad,they do not pay their shift managers enough for all the things we deal with on a daily basis
bad,"Most day's it starts out alright, but when it picks up people start to losing their heads. I learned you have to stay on your feet, do all you can, help out as much as you can, even if your one person. Management there is okay but the co-workers and some of the managers don't get alone so well. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep a smile on your face when you know things are wrong, but that how life and work is, it is not easy. But most of all at the end of the day things become more peaceful, and it time for you to go home."
bad,"Stock every credential i needed to bag food, and as well take care of the customers in the lobby, while keeping my station and the front lobby neat and clean."
bad,"Everyday I worked I was not being trained properly, I would be on one thing then taken off of it to go to another. I learned how to grill meat and cook and package the fries, the co-workers some were team players and some were not and the ones that were not made it difficult to work with. The hardest part of the job was picking up the grease pan at the end of the shift. See happy customers was the enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"minimum wage, no benefits, cant work more then 30 hours because they do not want to pay for benefits, had to sign a letter saying so."
bad,My days consisted of coordinating my work team and being overshadowed and handled by my manager every second. Did not enjoy my time there.
bad,"To be honest, this Wendys that I worked for has horrible management. The managers curse there employees, throw things and take their position to far. The oldest manager was 22 years old. They have no respect for any of their workers. Its honestly the worst place I ever worked in my life."
bad,"I would always be out of something when I got to work."
bad,"Although I enjoyed my fellow workers, Wendys was managed very poorly. Job advancements were not given on ability, but on friendship staus."
bad,I've been working here for about a 2 months now. But when I first got here I did get no training so every time I did something wrong I got yelled at.. that smiling shxt they say to do is never done. getting ready to leave this through
bad,No team work. Management was terrible. Nothing good came from this job.
bad,"A typical work day consisted of working 8 hours sometimes more, and a break was only given during certain hours of the day. The place closed at 11 or midnight, and if you went to work at 5 and closed the restaurant your break would be 30 minutes anywhere from 6-7:30pm. if you opened the store and worked a double (all day), they would still only offer you one break not 2 even for working a 14 hour shift. The co-workers I had were great people, everyone there was hard working most of the time, really friendly and honest. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the corrupt management and some of the manager's disregards for DHEC violations. Also if you were asked to work overtime regardless of having lifes' plans such as having a baby, birthday, going out of town, you were required to work or consequences would occour. I had to work 14 hours when my dad was visiting me in town, for one day, that I have not seen for 2 years. The District Manager had a daughter who was in the management position named Melina, two positions under the General Manager position, the manager one position under the General Manager position was fired over her joking with employees', (everyone like her and noone ever complained about her while i was there working 40 hours a week mostly on her shift). Now the daughter is one position under the General Manager position, since the first week I listened to the way she talked on how very soon she was going to be the General Manager of this store. The General Manager was fired for no reason at all. Everyone moved up one spot, so the the daughter is now the"
bad,I would always have to do other employees job ive gone home crying many times because the managers would treat me so badly they were not professional at all. My coworkers were nice though. The only thing i did like was leaving home from work eveyday.
bad,"I enjoy working at a fast pace,I work well with coworker and management. I gained great customer sevices skill in which I apply on a daliy bases."
bad,"I prepared the orders. I learned how to make sandwhiches. The management was very unprofessional. The co-workers were somewhat immature, but tolerable. The hardest part of my job was gaining the speed at lunch time when I first started. The most enjoyable part was mastering how to make the orders with speed and accuracy."
bad,"I thought Wendys would be an ok place to work. I was sadly wrong. I worked for only 3 months before I decided enough was enough. The General Manager was very ruthless, not an understanding type of person, and expected more out of me then other members of the crew I was working with."
bad,"Managed all phases of operation crew scheduling. inventory control, customer service cash management"
bad,ever day i had to cleanup.it waz bad.employees was not good.service was bad.the hardest part of the job was the service.no management.
bad,"A typical day at work would start at 11am the students come in around 12:10pm . I learned how to count change back to customers without a calculator . Management didn't really care about anyone's duties outside of work . They changed the schedule every week knowing we had prior commitments they were aware about . My co-workers were pretty amazing besides everyone coming & going , quiting here & there . The hardest part was dealing with the managers that would talk bad on you in spanish to other co-workers or not getting any health benefits. The most enjoyable part was getting some work experience under my belt ."
bad,like wendys and was fun place to work. friendly staff and customers
bad,"Managers treat employees like they are worthless and stupid. The customers treat employees like they are worthless and stupid. You rarely get treated like a human being, people will cuss you out on a daily basis. If you decide to work here, leave your pride and feelings at home, and prepare to be a Slave that gets overworked, yelled at all day, and barely paid."
bad,Working for wendys could have been more enjoyable if everyone who worked for them were treated fairly.
bad,I worked for Wendys before and had gotten a call from my area's DM requesting that I come talk with her about an offer she had. I agreed to meet her and was asked if I would be willing to return to the Wendy's family once again. I was offered a few specific things to get me to accept and those things were never honored. NOT ONE THING! Empty promises are all I received.
bad,Customers are terrible the coworkers wear really good and nice. The managers were really good and were really helpful. The customers suck and we have to be nice to them. No. I’m a person and deserve respect.
bad,I honestly hate this job but it pays my bills. I like it because it gives me the flexibility to take my son to school and pick him up from school. I am able to pick up hours if I need to and I am also able to take of any time I need to but the down part of that is I don't get paid for not working
bad,the managing ain’t allat . Day crew and night crew is a whole different ball game. They only care when inspections are about to happen. Pay rate is never on the same day.
bad,"If it’s not your coworkers job then they won’t do it, much less their own jobs. Working here is stressful and fast paced, it takes some getting used to."
bad,"This was a very cut  throat company, very poor training. No support. I prayed 1 year would go by quickly, as I do not like resigning and job hopping. They lie to ou in training you are admonished for asking questions. Threatened if you give an honest answer."
bad,Very productive workplace although the pay is very below average and no benefits and the workload is to much for the pay and there is no growth in pay just work load.
bad,You sacrifice your social life and mental health for nothing. I've begged to have my schedule changed for years and all I get are excuses. Upper management only cares about themselves.
bad,"- crew is NOT reliable..."
bad,"Management cut hours then refused to have a conversation as to why. I was acceptionally good at my job of working the sandwich line. Typically it's 2 to a line but I was always scheduled by myself and still kept up with orders, was unaware of why I was getting my hours cut."
bad,Very little to no appreciation to the hard workers. Manager doesn’t care about problems outside of work and does not handle problems with other managers. Lower level managers very immature and unprofessional are not qualified but receive no repercussions for behavior because they hold manager title. Also raises are non existent
bad,"If you want a paycheck this is for you. If you want to be heard, valued and respected this is not! Managers lie to fire people they don't like. HR dept never gets back to employee concerns. They have constant thing wrong with the stores. It takes months to fix things that are simple repairs. Such as putting new wheels on a fryer. They have health department compromising situations and they don't get fixed for weeks/months. Such as the coolers temping in the danger zone. The managers don't listen to employee concerns. They jump to conclusions and yell at who they thing started issues without any facts. DO NOT WORK HERE! ESPECIALLY THE MINNESOTA STORES!!!"
bad,"The management is terrible, nothing is done professionally they talk to you as if your beneath them. Actually scream and cuss at you as if you were a dog. They can't keep help because they run everyone off. They have a tendency to only hire family. And only give them the good hours. And extremely prejudiced"
bad,"I didn’t like it here, the people and the work load was insane. I got injured at work and the manager didn’t file a report or anything. Once I turned 18 I was getting paid under minimum wage for 2 months."
bad,"Really busy place to work, especially during sports events. Always have to ask permission to use the bathroom."
bad,"work too many hours "
bad,"Much of management was biased or inappropriate, I ran into a lot of situations where employees could smoke weed on the job and fool around with others.There of been many times that employees would go in the back and rolled her joints or smoke in the lobby area after closing. It wasn’t worth the minimum wage to me."
bad,"At first it was okay but then the managers started to show their true colours. They pick on and make fun of their staff, the owner of the restaurant does as well. I felt like I was not welcomed."
bad,No one below General Manager is empowered to do anything necessary to properly manage a shift. Employees were allowed to literally sleep for hours a day on the clock. Equipment was falling apart and dangerous. Upper management was completely ineffective.
bad,"I really liked the customers that I served they were friendly and nice, it got to be where we were family because they came in every day. The job and life balance weren't really good for me because I had young children at the time and I didn't get to spend any of the holidays with them. But like I said before the company has been bought by another company so it could have changed."
bad,Too little employees working in the restaurant. So the few that works is given so many duties and are always made to stay longer than their scheduled.
bad,They don’t tell any of the employees about not using they’re phone or when 3 employees are late no one gets a write up and the first shift have to wait till they get they’re
bad,A typical day at  work was verry stressfull and fast paced. I learned that people can be verry ill mannered and will try to take advantage of you. The main manager wasnot verry agreeable with any of the employes. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet all day and keeping my temper under control while dealing with rude customers and a rude inconciderate manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was the food and little i did earn.
bad,"Alright Job, yet again a alright job for High School Student who wanting to build up their experience in the Work Industry . Management was Great but the job Hours would be more then 50 a week."
bad,This job was overwhelming and the management was good however they barely had trained employees and the way they treat employees at times I did not agree with
bad,They overwork their minors and i am sure if someone from the state came in to investigate they would be fined. They made me work past midnight at age 16 and for 12 hours a day.
bad,"General manager didn't follow guidelines they enforced i.e. (wearing gloves while handling food), favoritism, unethical tampering with your hour log. The rm (gm' s son in law) did drugs on the job."
bad,I love working at Wendy's . It was an easy job and easy to learn. Everyday their was always something to do. Their was never a dull day. All it takes is a positive attitude and good energy to get through the day. Its always busy at Wendy's so if you are not a hard worker its not a job for you.
bad,Most of the managagment was micromanaged.  If you disagreed with something you got fired  the corparate stores are not bad its the ones that are franchised.
bad,"No free shift meals, demeaning managers, NO breaks. Overall i hated working for the Wendy's company. As of 2018 they took away the free $5 food limit for shift meals for half off. You would think a company so large would at least give their workers a break or a free sandwich!"
bad,"No holiday pay, no sick pay. Would only recommend if you can't find anything else. Worked hard there for 6 months and can't get a raise. Only way for raise is to become a manager."
bad,"Clock in get to your staton stay there until its your turn for break or to go home. "
bad,"Was plain and simply a mess at all times. I can remember countless times of mass turmoil and confusion. just overall not a good place to work honestly, would not recommend the slightest bit."
bad,"terrible management. the GM thinks about no one but himself, very quick to make you feel guilty for putting your life before the restaurant. also always rude to the workers."
bad,"Costumers are just mean although management does stick up for you if needed.  Generally a rough place to start but great references and flexible hours, workers can act petty alot watch out for that."
bad,wendys was a great fast food place but I didn't like it to much stress and I live in lorain so I didn't have no transportation that much.  I did stock boxes and put food in the bags . I couldn't do cashier cause I don't know how to do it . I'm trying to teach my self to count change. I know how to count dollars but not change.
bad,I Really did not have a good experience at wendys. The enviorment is okay its just the people that work there. It not flexible and it makes you feel uncomfortble.
bad,"The most enjoyable portion of my job was my coworkers. The unloving bunch was only upset when the GM was around.She was awful always criticizing as if we haven't done our jobs while we are completing them, on time if I may add"
bad,The only promote lazy people who put on an act rather than work hard all the time. They promise you a promotion than keep postponing it. They hardly ever tell you when you do a good job.
bad,Horrible management.  Cussing at the employees ( the gm and the female rm). There is never cleaning being done unless the shift managers do it. The gm tells customers to go to h***
bad,I only worked there for a year. I closed the place 6 nights a week. i heated it. Fast food it the worst place to work. I will never do it again. The people I worked with was the only part of the job I liked.
bad,"Been working at Wendy's for A while and it has been awful, long stressful nights. Management to to say the least horrible, will be happy to leave. If people don't like you for some reason you get treated bad. They pick favourites I guess you could say."
bad,Worked there since I was 16. The culture in the workplace is awful. Everyone including management hates their job. The only raise in pay is if minimum wage goes up. Regret not looking for something better a whole lot sooner...
bad,The Managers are over worked and under paid.  The work the crew and management team do is not appreciated.  The problem stems from the higher level of management.
bad,I just learned alot from Here that's all I know and will say.  Sometimes it was fun when we worked as a team we accomplished Alot together. I learned working against one another will get you nowhere in life
bad,Paid less than minimum wage. management showed favoritism. hours were cut less. although i was already working less then part time. overtime was not put on my current check. it carried over to the next check so that it would not pay overtime rate
bad,Calls asking to work last minute~ scheduled shifts when they know youre unavailable~ no heat during the winter ~ we had 5 coats to share for the drive thru which got extremely dirty fast. The managers would give you attitude the second you walk in and expected you to put a smile on  your face afterwards.
bad,"I spent over a year working there, earned top employee for 7 months straight. Did not receive a raise for working the job of 2-3 people at a time. would not work again"
bad,It remind me of slavery. It's not enough help. So people is leaving.everyone they hire can't close so basicly every since I was forced to relocate from the store  I applied  for all I been doing is struggling to find help to run this store. I wouldn't do this again.
bad,"wendys is a good start when your still in high school. but overall i wouldnt suggest staying there for long. the job is very fast paced, the only thing that i see that benefits employees is being on your toes at all times. management was bearable, coworkers were friendly but kept to themselves. the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers, and rush hour."
bad,"management gave absolutely no communication, never help me. A typical day at work at Wendys consists of me coming into work to find out that someone has called off usually. Or a manager messed up the cash and needs me to fix it. Or i come into work where my boss just yells at me over very small things that she does herself. There is no communication, the training is not up to speed when i was in training to become a manager i was doing the same things as when i was a crew member and they didn't really teach me anything on how to run a store. This is by far the worst job i have ever worked at in my entire life. i would never recommend anyone for a management job at wendys. By far worst job possible."
bad,"I would never get of at the time I was scheduled to, I would be scheduled to work until very late on school nights,still being realsed after my scheduled time, they dont even let you have a drink, they want to charge you for a drink. Unstable, impatient managment."
bad,Wendy's on Baseline is very unprofessional due to some of the employees/ managers. If some of the negativity was  to be removed it would be an excellent environment to work in.
bad,"this is a company with little or no advancement stressful environment"
bad,Pay is minimum and too much work the don't have any benefits and manager are picky. nothing is really enjoyable they make you work a lot  and do other peoples work
bad,"I don't know much about this company as a whole. All I can say is that it allows for poor management to go on. Between he district manager covering for the general managers  must assume the managers above them do the same. Most of the complaints I have are time based, seeing as it is a rarity to leave that place even close to on time. That wouldn't be to much of an issue if it was done well, but some days I was left in the kitchen at the grill for hours before I was even notified that my replacement wasn't going to be in for awhile, leaving me to wonder why they scheduled in a 2-3 hour gap between grill cooks. They also seem to lack common sense as they have cashiers set to come in and leave at the same time, even though the process for changing out took upwards of 20 minutes. Breaks were a joke for all but the minors, and even though it isn't required for people over 18 to get a break having a shift manager take several smoke breaks through out the day and say that there is no way to give anyone else any sort of break is very poor for moral, especially when working with a crew of five people pulling 8-10 hour shifts. All of this, as I said before, might be tolerable if it hadn't been for their ""So what"" attitude about people bringing up the fact that they were still there with no explanation for hours over their time for leaving. This is why I give them a very poor rating for both management and work/life balance, as it is hard to have a life when you are randomly being forced to stick around regardless of plans. It very quickly became a running joke that when an employee was"
bad,You work with great people at a fast pace. It can be a very stressful environment but you get a very accomplished survival feeling at the end of the day. You work long nights which can be very physically tiring but you learn a lot.
bad,"I would never work in fast food ever again! The customers could be so rude. I didn't get along with one of the managers. I only worked here, because I desperately needed to make money."
bad,no appreciation for hard working dedicated crew members. There is no balance or consistency and the management was far from elite. There was a lack of focus on customer service based on the managers and supervisors needs to produce a desired service time. I will never want to work in the fast food industry for any company again.
bad,"Sandwich maker, Fry station, Grill Operator, Register, and Coordinating"
bad,"This was my second job, got hired on the spot. The managers her just dont know how to treat you & you were only allowed to work part time."
bad,job is really just based on pleasing customers and cleaning. not hard but not very fun.
bad,"i was a prep at Wendy's international.. I helped out with other position in the company I was also cashier, and fry cooker"
bad,I've been working here for about 4 months and I can't take this place anymore because the management is horrible. The workers talk bad about each other and harass each other
bad,"Expected to treat everyone as if they will steal everything as soon as you leave them alone.Very hard to work for someone that does not take the time to listen to you if you have a problem? You have to ""figure it out yourself"" because no one is there to help you with it! The most enjoyable part of my job was servicing the guests. Ten to twelve hours working for someone that doesn't care if the guest were taken care of they just want to see the profits."
bad,"The experience working at Wendys was good in some since. However, it was unprofessional and made me realize it was a good idea to finish college."
bad,somedays would be good and somedays i didnt like it but still went to work.
bad,You could go in there and work your hard but they never showed appreciation by even giving you a raise once a year.
bad,"A typical day at work was extremely stressful and difficult to get through. My location struggled to keep management, which in turn left the rest of the ship sinking. In the year I spent with the company I saw three different District Managers, and I left the store after it had been months without a General Manager and without my promotion and raise that I had signed paperwork on four months prior, this being the ultimate reason for my departure. "
bad,rude employers. Horrible service and poor management. Horrible food. Dirty restrooms.employess get treated horrible. horrible working hours.needs maintenance
bad,Their is good District Managers but not all are honest Starboardwendys is the worst franchise to work for. You put in a lot of hours and even on your Days off your District Manager calls it don’t matter if your on vacation you have to answer your phone so you never get a break
bad,"The management at this specific Wendy's was terrible, coworkers bickering, managers bickering, covering other coworkers when I was not obligated to do so, staying well over the time frame I should have, working at Wendy's whilst also attending High School."
bad,My boufriend and i were assulted by two different managera and then fired for sticking up for ourselves. We were verbally abused and physically abused and the general manager didnt want to do anything about it for the longest time then when she sid ahe fired everyone but one manager and that was only because she went on maternity leave.
bad,"Will penalize you for taking time off even if you are sick and it is doctor ordered, I went from 30-40 hour a week to less than 20 for my last two weeks because I got sick and my doctor told me I could NOT go to work around food. I was on my dad's health plan at the time so did not sign up for the one at work."
bad,"The store that I worked in was great for the 1st 6 months, but after that, it went wrong. We became understaffed every day, lack of communication between employee and managers. Customers got impatient and rude after 5 minutes and didn't care to hear the reason why. Customers also wanted the store to be more like McDonald's, as in stay open until 1:00 a.m, even when there are only 3 employees, including the manager, working there; meaning we'd be in the store until 4:00 a.m, but the customers won't care."
bad,Worked there for over a month and NEVER got paid. Manager sits on phone all day and touch food with bare hands. Disgusting would never work there again. Slow paced. Favoritism shows.
bad,"I can only speak to the franchisee that I regrettably worked for. The District manager had a mantra of her own, “I don’t care about managers and staff, they’re always gonna come and go.” The pay as a manager is the industry minimum. Nothing is ever good enough even if short staffed. The owner of the franchise is a total snake and beyond cheap. Avoid this franchise. It won’t let me type anymore   "
bad,There was some times that we had some fun but for the most part of the time i worked there it was just stay busy all the time. We was busy all the time due to being near the community college.
bad,"i generally did not care for the Wendy's in Lindsay i completely get your not suppose to bash your employment but the place is ran so poorly people have no idea how bad it truly is, the people who have been there forever felt so entitled i had to argue with them on the daily i truly didn't think they cared about the crew i was dealing with a new born at home but wanted me to work all the time the wages are done so cheap that its beyond dumb."
bad,"Wendy's is only a job for immature kids. The management sucks everywhere and corporate sucks too. Corporate only judges, you based off of what's in your file so they let management get away with a lot of lies. They forge employee signatures on legal documents and make you work for hours with no break, wendy's sucks badly."
bad,"I started working at Wendy's in June of 2017, the location I started at had a really tight atmosphere and in no time I was stuck on the midnight shift short handed and management didn't care... In the day you see a full staff, at night you're lucky if you have a two man crew.... No joke.... After informing management that my car was broke down they ignored my pleas to work earlier shifts... Instead I was placed still at night... After a while I moved to a store closer to my house... this store was great. The people were great and they give great customer service..."
bad,"This is the most hostile environment I’ve ever experienced. Management is rude, and often physical. I honestly would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,The people you work with are cool people. Its just the management that sucks. They cut their employees hours but continue to hire new people. Then when you ask your GM for more hours they get rude. The work is not hard. Its just they make bad choices in choosing managers.
bad,"Wendy's was not my first job, but it was probably the job i learned the most at. The first thing i learned was APPLICATIONS DONT MATTER. i spoke to many managers, filled out lots of apps, did all the right motions. Then my mom asked for a favor from one of the managers and got me a job, pretty much on the spot. Anybody who has a job, has it because they knew somebody or were around the people who needed someone. Then, i got into the actual training. I had never actually cooked a burger before in my life. so, i learned how to cook a burger. i also learned that i prefer a slower paced work environment, because my brain doesnt move fast enough to keep up with fast food. i also suck at making change so cashier jobs are really not the fit for me. Mostly what i learned from the wendy's experience was what not to do again. and that being sign up to do a lot of work for a little pay. i also dealt with the public a fair amount while i worked at wendy's, and learned that is not something i want to do again either."
bad,i worked there for six months while doing volleyball and had school. i tried to balace both which was fine up until my boss felt like i had to go which was not notified of i had no knowledge at all
bad,My typical worked day contain of being in the drive thru taking order and cash handling.  I also washed dishes and stocked the store.  I learned that how to work in a fast paced environment.  They need to hire better management. The workplace culture was good we all got along fine among the employees. The hardest part was learn how to work on my own and just get what I needed done.  The most enjoyable part was making new friends.
bad,"I would not suggest working with the Wendy’s company, because management is poor. And I left the Wendy’s company because of that. The management did not care about the work place or for its other employees"
bad,"This place of employment is very stressful and the managers are very rude and show favoritism towards other employees ,no breaks are given , pay is very low , no air conditioner"
bad,"The management there is awful, they treat you badly and act as if you are stupid. They brought down my self esteem, and they call employees names. They will not let you have a shift off unless it is covered, even in emergencies. The work place is constantly hazardous and unclean, in the back room there is always pools of water on the floor and boxes thrown everywhere. One of the soap machines for employees dies not work and the hot water is broken."
bad,"The job required me to do many things, but I spent most of my time there cleaning dishes. I did other things, such as taking customer orders at the drive-thru, and mopping the floors. The long hours were the hardest part of the job, especially when I was closing the store for the night."
bad,"It's basically a store full of children because they people in the store are so childish it makes no sense. Nobody wants to come to work or clean , I don't understand how you expect to get paid if your not doing your job."
bad,a typical day at work for me would be coming to work with a big smile. hoping to be a good day and survive that day. the hardest part of the job is train the new people.
bad,I did others jobs I was sick and got told 2 bad come in anyway or don't come back when I called the night before to let them know I would not be there
bad,Crew members are a big problem. Management acts as if they take care of problems. Benefits are not a thing. Hours will be cut if management doesn’t enjoy you.
bad,Honestly my opinion of Wendy's isn't that great they encourage you to neglect customer service to have better in and out the door speeds. This is also an outdated opinion because of the location I worked for is under new management so it could be a great place to work now. You'll have to form your own opinion.
bad,"The only thing they have to offer is a food discount, flexible, and poor management. In my experience, management picks favorites and is very unprofessional."
bad,I will never work here the location was awful the Management doesn't stay on top of things! the employers didn't do their jobs. The hours weren't bad at all!!
bad,"Terrible place to work. Very stressful, always short handed, teenagers would always come in and trash the place. Free food was probably the only good thing about this job."
bad,It's slow sometimes and not all the mangers are nice. You get went home when it's slow so you don't get all your hours. Some people call out so you have to work the place they were supposed to have and yours
bad,They were rude to their employees... They talk to them harshly... They yelled and screamed and treated them unfairly... Customers where rude also yelling and screaming... Calling the employees out of their names... We couldn't move up (position)...
bad,"It is a stressful, quick pace environment, where only minors get any kind of breaks, except mangers they get to sit in their offices. It is close to slave labor, employees should deserve basic rights, like 10 min breaks every 4 hours, and a 30 min lunch if working 6 hours our longer."
bad,Need n want better I don't like how they treat men.they overwork the men the general manager does not know how to treat the men in the company no team work at all here
bad,We are fast food so we do have to be fast and serve the customers and make sure the customers are happy. You also have to make sure that you are polite and friendly to the customers. You have to be able to work well with people and not fight. You have to be able to clean and do what the managers ask you to do. You also may have to train new people doing different positions.
bad,When I worked at Wendys they didn't have a full crew. On some days only 3 people showed up to run the whole workplace. With not having a full crew and people calling to have it off was just a mess.
bad,They hire everyone which makes it not that great.  I worked morning most the time and the fry grease smelled bad.  You would be surprised of the amount of food you get to eat at night though so that is a plus!
bad,They get smart with you and I was only working there for the summer never again. They talk about their employees like that's not very professional and I reccomand nobody works them
bad,The management was very awful. They often didn't hire and schedule enough people so everything would take a lot longer than it needed too. They were also very un professional and rude to their crew members.
bad,"Wouldnt reccomend working at wendys to my worst enemy. teribble management, i think everyday i worked there we ran out of something and had to tell customers we couldnt serve them or just closed down because we didnt have meat"
bad,I was really fast paced and the people were nice most of the time.I like that we got to try the new Items on the menu and I could pic up extra housr to.
bad,It was a good job. The coworkers were pleasant and nice to work with. The management at times could have been better. Such as the fact that sometimes was not able to get enough hours.
bad,"I enjoyed it but when I started getting my own bills, I realized that wendy's was no longer the job for me. Although I enjoyed the customers I still had to do and work at a place that would help me financially."
bad,"the management there is uneducated and unproductive, the have no idea how to run a shift or treat crew members would never recommend working here, the management is the main problem"
bad,"great opportunity, but the restaurant is old and broken down. There is no heat and minimum employees. 1 or 2 good managers"
bad,at the store I was at the management didn't get a long with one un nether. The best part of my job was going home. I left because my store manager cut my hr.'s because she was mad at me.
bad,"Team members were given a two week notice of a new system for the store. Therefore, cashiers were aware of the updated format in which we had to learn how to operate. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the new format because the old format seemed to be much easier to use. The most enjoyable part of learning the new format was everyone helping each other learn. It was always a pleasure of helping my co-workers. They were the most fun and humble people to be around."
bad,I would not refer anyone to this company. The environment is well kept and fun.
bad,"days would be long and no breaks"
bad,A typical work day at Wendy's would consist of running the cashier and between bagging food and taking orders and cash you had to keep the dining room  and rest rooms clean and customer friendly. What I learned is how to keep calm in stressful work situations. Most of my co workers were great and friendly. but as far as management they were  unorganized and indecisive. also they played a lot of favoritism. the hardest part about the job was dealing with rude unappreciative customers and knowing that your working very hard for barely any money and employers who don't appreciate the work you do. the most enjoyable part of the day would be seeing my coworkers and regular customers that would come in.
bad,Great fast paced industry. It was a fun place to work and full of history. Great food good people. Except upper management. Maybe it was just one person. Quid pro quo.
bad,"An typical day at wendy's honestly get in get the job done and go home. the things i've learned is how the business opperates, the management was ok certaing managers come in focusing on getting their hours and going home unlike one manager i know is an great manager good for business and make sure every aspect of the job has been accomplished before leaving off her shift. The hardest part is when you're an good team worker and become a very dependable worker and you constantly going into work without any complaining, but when you need a break your hours get cut back for mare than you exspected,and ofcourse to most the best part of the job is payday,but honestly mine is satifying every customer we recieve."
bad,"A typical workday at Wendy's started with one comming to work with a positive attitude. But management is rude and very disrespectful to  its employees."
bad,I learned how to work with others in a fast pace enviorment. Dealing with people attitudes was hard to deal with some times.
bad,it was good working for a few moths but many got fired and many quit and that place started to be unstable.
bad,Our managers would make sure our crew was having a good day at work.I love to be busy.
bad,"i clock in,get straight to work. no breaks neccessary. i've learned to greet customers better, make sandwiches,talk on speker,stock. My co-workers are great. The hardest part about working atwendys is theres alotof work to do at all times. the most enjoyable part at wendys is the discounts."
bad,This had to be the worst jobs that I have ever encounterd. I miss all the great people I met but I will never consider this a good work enviroment.
bad,"I was the front cash register associate. I also helped make sandwiches and pack orders for drive thru. Management was very unprofessional and had poor leadership and customer service skills. My co-workers know the value of team work and our store worked very hard for minimal pay and no benefits or holiday pay. The hardest part of the job was making sure I always kept watch on my drawer so my manager wasnt able to steal money, which he did often. The most enjoyable part was the customers remembering me and asking for me. My regular customers, mostly elderly, made me smile and made my day easier."
bad,"This restauran was rated one of the worst Wendy's restaurant. The enviroment was very comfortable for me, but the co-workers and I didnt agree to enomorus of things. But we still got the job done. Thats most important!"
bad,They were very horrible with their employees. The place was always dirty and nasty. When I went in the back to work on their computer I found tobacco on the computer and around it.
bad,i learned everything there but i really like the grill it is peaceful there. it calms me.and the people around me are fun to talk to and i like the heat in the winter.
bad,Wendys was my first part time job while I was in school and for the year that I worked there I felt completely miserable bc no one ever really got along there was always arguing between someone
bad,Working at this Wendy’s was overall not a bad experience the whole time but the staff was very rude & unprofessional. Our store was very unkept & needed major updates
bad,"I started working at Wendys thinking that I would like the fast pace nature of the business. What i found that it was not the business but the toxic environment that I was surrounded by. "
bad,A day at Wendy's was hard considering I was on the closing shift and there is only one Wendys in Hope Mills. I had to learn to multi-task very quickly .
bad,The work place was productive. Management was not good. I had fun when the main manager wasn’t there but that was rare. They have a lot they need to work on.
bad,it's easy work. but I'm professional. they let people that ain't of age or hired through corp. work and pay out pocket. they serve food that's been out all day when it's supposed to be refridgerated.
bad,"what else can i say its fast food who cares the best part was sneaking away free food bc not even that you dont get free food and you are at risk to hurt yourself every day and no one care dont work here although who applies for fast food on here, just walk in and you got the job they're that desperate."
bad,"the managers become friends and do what is best for them instead of the whole work crew, they don't care about their customers, and higher managment should put their foot down and fire some of their managers and get better ones"
bad,"When I applied at Wendy's, I was looking for a part time evening and/or weekends job. My availability was 4 days a week but sometimes when someone calls in sick, I don't mind coming in. The management at Wendy's took advantage of this. When coworkers left the workplace, they never got replaced and everyone else is expected to take the shifts lett behind. I am now working 6 days a week as do most of my other coworkers. The work is also not easy. I run the drive thru and is also expected to wash dishes, mop/scrub backroom floors, and clean washrooms. This is not that hard on slower days but that's not always the case. It is hard to take days off and when I do, I end up feeling guilty because I know how hard it is for the remaining people when others take time off."
bad,I love working i have real life bills i was told I would start off with ten dollar's an hour that was a lie they now cut my hours from 7 hours to 4 that's not no money for me and i kids too
bad,Wendy’s is not the worst job but as an teen I’m sure nobody wants to be stressed out at work. The brief time I worked at Wendy’s it was more then a handful.
bad,"A typical work day was long and hard lots of work to be done with not lots of workers, Management never helped out when we had little to no staff. Management was always mad."
bad,"That store needs some seriius help when it comes to workers. It isn't so bad when the right workers are working, byt when the lazy ones are working there are alot of disagreement temper tantrums. It makes you feel like toy have to hold their hand to do anything and in fast food tou don't have time for that."
bad,"Working at least 8-10 hours a day full time during mornings, days, nights and weekends. Competitive and out going employees and management. Working fr"
bad,"Was puking coffee ground like and coloured substance for to clock in I was healthy and about to eat lunch and forced to clock in early. Had been sent home twice by managers and written up by her the next evening in her words as an example."
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful, but if the administration is good and organized, and you are fast, you learn to work in a team and under pressure. A very good thing has Wendy's, is the employment policy, because the worker selects his work time."
bad,this was the second job I worked they made me work too many hours with not enough pay the manager had a bad attitude and so did the workers wasn't a friendly environment at all
bad,I liked working here but the workers and management made it hard to like the job. They work you all the time I barely saw my son at times. Wouldn't work here again.
bad,"This job is great for a second job and trying to pick up extra cash. Staff is friendly , as well as laid back.You can enjoy half off lunches. Shakes are delicious too."
bad,A typical day at work is a fast pace environment with customers desiring to receive their food hot and fast. I have learned to multi-task into different positions while still maintaining the role as manager. The hardest part about my job is not being able to give the customers exactly what they would like such as substitutions for particular items.
bad,"too many work. Not enough employee. Some of the boss is good . my  co-workers are nice . I  learned how to deal with my difficult co-workers,"
bad,"I made sandwich, when the people came at the restaurant. I enjoyed this job but after I worked a few hours and I didn't earn well."
bad,"The only good parts about working for Wendy's is the co-workers and the fast pace. The company doesn't care at all about it's employees and is trying to get as much work out of them for as little money as they can. I worked at two different locations and the story was the same. The customers were so rude, but really,  I don't blame them. I would be grumpy too if I were paying for quality food but getting old garbage instead."
bad,A typical work day consist of having to get your shift ready from preparing food to placing employees in the proper places to ensure customer satisfaction. There is a lot of stress involved with this job. Being a manager is very hard as not everyone follows the rules they pretty much pick and chose who has to follow the rules. I wouldnt recommend this job if you have a family because you will never see them.
bad,"It was hard to maintain my lifestyle at home due to the extensive hours put in at work. I was on salary. Worked late hours, then early mornings."
bad,the job is ok.but not enough hours.i enjoy the afternoon when its busy.
bad,In the start it was just like any other job. Working hard for good full-time hours was the best part with good high standards and a friendly work environment. I learned how to multitask and and to hold my composure under pressure and dealing with difficult people. The hardest part was holding my tongue even when people were very disrespectful to me and working much harder than what i was getting paid. At this point things are very rough. standards have dropped and hours have been terribly cut. I am curently seeking another job that has more care for its employees.
bad,the training was very interesting... the sandwhich making was very easy
bad,"Long but rewarding days, co- workers were mostly friendly and good to work with. Store was in need of some more experience managers but other than that good work environment "
bad,management sucks they don’t know how to manage the work place was fine the crew was fine. Got payed pretty well gave me many opportunities. But really need to work in management didn’t treat workers fairly
bad,"low pay for high work expectations. we had to take abuse from customers, even if they were wrong. long hours, short breaks. just not a great work environment"
bad,I was excited at first but didn't like management for taking money out my registrar.I couldn't do anything about it because she was the GM of the store that was doing it and getting away with it.
bad,I must admit this location trains poorly ... “managers” don’t acknowledge new associates then blame you for not knowing jobs you weren’t properly trained on .. this was an interesting two days working 😂
bad,"Honestly the job wasn't ideal, most days I'd work 8-10 hours straight with no break unless asked to stay longer to cover someone else's shift. I was consistently disrespected by certain managers. The only real reason on why I stayed as long as I did was because of the other workers. They genuinely made the job both enjoyable and easy."
bad,at times it was working there but it was stressful because some people couldn't keep up with the work or would mess up most of the time but the technology that was there was useless because the battery didn't last an hour.
bad,The store that I worked at in Booneville i loved working there. Management was wonderful and all the employees just took to me. I really didn't want to go to my store when it was time to move.
bad,A typical day at work was up in the air because you never worked your full shift. I learned money managent.  The most recent manager i had was very poor at her job and made working there difficult. The hardest part of working there was dealing with the manager. The most enjoyable part was the customers and the crew memebers.
bad,I really enjoyed working with this company until they were bought out by new owners which was kathi food management went down no one got raises food cost went up
bad,"Ok environment. Quick pace work."
bad,"Working at wendys internationals was so hard knowning the fact that this was my first job that i had , The mangers that worked at wendys was so mean to me , and customers was mean and racists"
bad,"A typical day consists of stocking, cleaning, and waiting on customers. The management was decent. The hardest part of the job again was during the rush hours. The easiest part of the day was when there was no customers which happened a lot and it was slow so then stuff could get done."
bad,"The management was horrible and they were all rude. It is also very dirty and greasy in the back where you have to work. I can not eat there anymore, it gross."
bad,Poor management and scheduling. Coworkers were rude and the customers were extremely disrespectful and unappreciative of the service received. And management was also unappreciative of what you do when you try and earn extra hours.
bad,all in all I like Wendy's food for the most part. my dislike comes from the experience I had while employed. I actually had the shift leader leave a voice mail calling me a white devil BIT@h. management never trained me but stuck me in a hole with a head set in and said there ya go. employees let their children run in and out of the building in the parking lot and through the store while they say behind the restaurant and.took turns sitting in the shift leaders mini can getting stoned. work a complete shift being the only one who spoke English which was fine up til one of the other ladies kept pointing at me saying something to one of the men and rolling her eyes. same lady also shoulder checked me twice in the same night. I WILL not even go back to that store or any Wendy's to even get food again. worst job experience I've ever had. I was even told to figure it out after I told them the vacuum cleaner was broken and I needed to vacuum the dinning area
bad,"I loved working here,but once the new management came along it was horrible! She would yell and blame everyone else but herself. I loved serving the food and interacting with the customers. Once the manager leaves I'm going back lol"
bad,u get punished for doing what you was told to do horrible place and all the managers do is yell at you it not a place that anyone want to work at i hated it
bad,This is not a very good place to work at all. The boss was trying to have an inappropriate relationship with me and I was only like 17 years. But over all it was nice to be on the beach
bad,My hours were so low the job was not worth it to me. The pay was also rather low and the workload was crazy at times but hey that is fast food for ya.
bad,Fast food workers are held to high expectations with minimum pay. Management isn't the best. This is not the ideal job for anyone.
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job if you already have prior experience this is more of a starting job than anything else. Its difficult to move up the ladder and hours are very scarce.
bad,over worked under paid is the best way to describe it. they say flexible but they really mean no personal time. there is no fun  anymore use to love the job but now everything's is so serious. its almost like you make a mistake and they will find a way to get ride of you
bad,not the greatest job in the world. doesn't support any cost of living. I doesn't suffice for any cost of living expenses.
bad,"I'd always have a good day work, everyone was friendly and outgoing. I learned how to prepare food, take orders through drive thru. I got better at my communicating skills with other people. The most hardest part of my job during rush hour, when a lot of customers would come in and we'd all have to rush at doing a lot of things, like getting the food done and serving there drinks, also getting there orders correct."
bad,"The managers are mean and nasty. They don't help you at all. When your young, a fast food restaurant is always a great start. I learned you work with all types of human beings. Its up to you, you either make it or break it."
bad,"Experience:"
bad,cashier learning experience and taught me a lot and showed me how to run cashier and serve peoples need at the same time
bad,I always got my work done but the management was awful here. I learned to not let things stress me out. The hardest part of the job was the management. The most enjoyable part of the job were the regulars who would come in just to have my customer service and see me.
bad,Absolutely horrible. The Managers would yell at us in front of the customers; the pressure on one person to clean up the entire front area AND the bathrooms in just ONE hour was IMPOSSIBLE.
bad,I wouldn’t wanna work in a fast food place at this time only because of the smells and me getting sick on the job wouldn’t be so good . That job made me really sick .
bad,Not a good place to work. Everything is very stressful and the manegers do not try to help or make work any more enjoyable. Do not care how the store is working.
bad,Most of the managers take some getting use to but then once they realize your a good worker you get used you do more work then what it's worth most of the managers don't believe a word you say the managers are there for them and don't really pitch in to help they prefer demanding you around most the time the kitchen air was broke I honestly hated this job with dealing with two faced managers
bad,I needed my bills paid . It’s the train my I left the team was lovely  the way management handles situations are not fair to the staff. Manager don’t listen to their employees & are rude if not being treat to a high standard at all times
bad,Terrible hours no work life balance. just a body and I was a AGM and I have to say its a joke give 70 hours a week and its still not enough yet if you ask to leave 10 mins early after an 10 hour shift everyone loses their mind!!! just don't
bad,"I didn't mind the job itself, because I did the very best I could do, In the morning's its not as bad since your setting everything up to get ready for the day. But when lunch rush hits, you are going as fast as you can trying to drop everything in the fryer because you have customer orders to fill in. And not only that but you also have to take care of customer's orders from the inside of the building, not just the drive-thru"
bad,"I was told that I would be paid a certain amount due to me starting with previous experience , and that was a lie. They would not give me direct deposit. I had to beg another manager to set it up for me. My set days would change through out the week."
bad,hours sucked pay sucked unless you've already graduated high school and need any job no matter what don't work here epic sucks only good thing were my coworkers we all suffered together haha.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of making sandwiches, being cashier, or coordinating orders. In this environment, it is very fast paced, so you need to work fast but efficiently at the same time. Management is very nice, and are willing to work with you on your schedule depending on where you work. Hardest part of the job is negative customers, the most enjoyable part of this job is the co-workers you're surrounded with are very fun to be around."
bad,The management was not very professiol.  My hours were always differed every week and I did not like that. I would like to have a steady scheduled every week.
bad,Wendy's is a great job for people who are just starting out. When I worked at Wendy's it was ok. The employees were nice. The hardest part about Wendy's was when it was lunch because they are really busy and you have to get the people out fast and sometimes that is hard to do when there is a lot of people waiting. The managers are okay
bad,"I worked from open to close. If someone called out of work, I always was the one to stay for that person's shift. If someone calls out for the opening shift , I would come in early to help open the store."
bad,Not a hard place to work. Unfortunately they pay crew members a low wage. Really high turn over. Not much help from higher management levels. Really long hours.
bad,"management was not the best."
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's on 517 Hickory Ridge Rd, Greensboro, NC. I've learned to may quality hamburgers, I've learned how to make every sandwich and salad that Wendy's offer. The management is wonderful except one, that I feel take her position over her head. My co workers are great, we work together to deliver hot and quality food. The hardest part of the job is trying to make everyone happy. The most enjoy able part of my job is making the sandwiches fast and accurate for the customer so that they get in and out in a timely manner."
bad,"my job duties at wendys consisted of taking guest orders,preparing their order,greeting them as they entered,operating the register,helping to maintainin a clean and welcoming facility.I learned how to compromise with, and how to handle angry customers,my co-workers were very helpful and they displayed team work,i would describe the managment overall as ""unprofessional"" and not very considerate of the employees.The most challenging part of the job was operating the drive thru window.the most enjoyable part of the job was getting the job done, and creating a satisfying experience for the customers."
bad,It a great place to work and a funny place to work.The company is all for they peolep
bad,"Work 8 hours on feet, providing excellent customer service to all guest, learned excellent customer service skills, great management and great co-workers, not a hard job just not much room for advancement or security, most enjoyable part serving customers"
bad,a typical day at this job was go in clock in stock your area for you shift then start working. what i learnd was how fast past this job.the management was okay but need some work you had your bad days and your good with them.all my co-workers was fun to be around and i loved to work with all of them.my most enjoyable part of this job was to see all the people there and making my customers happy.
bad,"My overall experience at Wendy's was poor. Management was a mess. Scheduling was non-existent, no one ever knew who was working when. The other crew members were nice, however, the managers all treated us like garbage."
bad,Working here is very stressful. Boss depends on the location. Old General Manager was a sociopath and created unnecessary workplace drama. HR needs to be more present within these types of environments. The treatment was horrible. Would not recommend working here if your mental health cannot handle added stress.
bad,"It was fast paced, I just didn’t get the proper training I was only ever on sandwich that’s all I learned when I had worked there. Other than that the employee discount it’s nice"
bad,"during the time I worked at Wendy's I noticed that our checks were dated for Friday but we were unable to pick them up until Monday at 2 PM. When I asked the district manager/owner he told me I was uneducated and misinformed as to how payroll works. He told me that those checks are not in the store until Monday, which is a bold face lie judging by the date and time that they're printed clearly being on the check in black-and-white."
bad,The specific store that I was employed at there was very little professionalism from the managerial staff the employees did not take their job seriously and felt as if they didn't want to be involved with the franchise at all
bad,They are very disorganized. They have a lot of kids working here. They call out or just don’t come in and they won’t let them people go. They all go out drinking and partying together. Didn’t train me at all on the cash register and it was my first time ever.
bad,I liked the job I worked alot of hours and I was let go because of another managers mistake I tried to explain but the other manager had more senority
bad,This place isnt a good place to work for. People come in drunk or high. And bring it to work and give to other people. Not a good environment. No place for someone who can only work certain hours and wanting to advance in the company.
bad,They're the worst company to work for they don't care about their employees.the general managers are children ranging from the age of 18 and 22 rying to run a store their shift managers are overworked and underpaid it was a horrible experience all around and stores are dirty
bad,this place is soo messed up They only care about their money thats it! i worked here for a very long time and i had to miss my childs first everything because they wouldnt give me time off! noone ever wants to be in trouble so they blame other people and get someone else in trouble the management is horrible the team members are ratchet they wanna beat you up or wanna be two faced  noone cares in the work place you dont get free meals after working 8-10 hours a day and sometimes dont get breaks and half the management tram doesnt even have their serve safe certification they are nasty because noone cleans
bad,"Not for the weak willed. It was fine as a part time job but even still, I struggled to fully grasp the rhythm and never reached the full speed that was expected. I regularly dreaded coming in whether it be difficult shift time or if I would need to do a miscellaneous task that would inevitably injure myself with. Also, customers have little mutual respect for those who work in the fast food industry."
bad,"When I first started at Wendys it wasn’t a bad job at all. I was still in school at the time, so i was part time. Management was great at the time. Then after a year everything changed. Nothing would get done correctly. Nobody would get proper punishments for their actions. You could walk out on the job and be rehired. It was just ridiculous."
bad,I hated working at a fast food restaurant. The manager was no help. Every time we get busy the manager will leave you short handed and we was already short staffed.
bad,i was trained well. i was treated badly by manager. yelled at constantly. the only good thing about my experience working for wendy's is the meat was indeed never frozen.
bad,"I worked there for a week before the place burned down in a workplace accident. After repeated calls and visits, they refused to give me more hours due to employees being reshuffled after the accident, so I resigned."
bad,It could have been better. The general managers are always rude and the district managers always act nonchalant when it is brought to their attention.
bad,Stressful work environment. Very fast pace.  Many not to big. Long work days. Understaffed. Its fast food. I would rather not work there every again..
bad,"I wouldn't recommend for anyone to work there. The manager in Grayson, Kentucky wendy's was rude and kept others that didn't need to be there. I will not work there again."
bad,I didn't like the fact that they didn't give me any hour's but 8hrs for a whole week and didn't wanna give me hour's I mean it's ok working there but they not going to give you hours like they should.
bad,They expect u to kill yourself for a pay that it isn't even worth it. I use to work 15+ hrs a week with a 30 min break. No help. And I trained myself. The managers were lazy and they hire young immature kids. I hated working for wendys
bad,Had the wrost time working at Wendy's. The communication over there was really bad. When something new came up or something were to change the managers were never talking about it until he/she would get in trouble for it then the upper manager would then explain what changed and why it changed.
bad,If you want to work at Wendy's you should think again. At least for the one in Napanee. One of the managers would sit in the office and not help during a rush and then when it is over would offer to help. The managers go out on smoke breaks at least every five minutes. Would leave you alone no matter what was happening so they could go and smoke. And the manager who is on the health and safety committee would make you do the most unsafe and unsanitary things.
bad,"Just “a real waste of time”. Pay is bad, people are bad, the managers are bad, the food is bad. All Wendy’s too, not just one. All in SWFL. Terrible environment too and it’s dirty. Smells bad too."
bad,"Over worked and under paid 20 years and 12 bucks an hour  ! I lost a lot of time with my daughter asking for days off was like pulling teeth you work a lot 50 hours to be exact under appreciated I could go on , I stayed because I love some of the people I work with"
bad,They treat there employees like slaves and dont follow the osha rules and change the way of handing out checks without talking to their employees. Also they only hire Hispanics
bad,"No care for employees, makes you stay longer than scheduled. Management is not good and rude to employees. Bugs and rotches all over the place. Not kepted clean at all."
bad,The management at my store was very disrespectful and did not care about her staff. Had to complain monthly to HR regarding issues. Made 16  year old children work until 3am.
bad,"The management team up there is terrible, Almetra as the DM needs to be let go from the whole company itself. Because when I work at Enterprise Wendy in Alabama it was awful manager s would just hire anyone without a background check. We could have been murder because of almetra actions of being other place outside of her store to anyone so. The drama that went on I have never seen a more diafunctional restaurant in my live. The management team, shift leader, general manager, assistant manager it sucked because it was ran by the wrong person include Mike who is above the District manager. I love the company & the franchise dislike the people who are in charge."
bad,The management was not very good and didn't work with employees well. I ended up getting fired for morning sickness and always thowing up at work and having to go home.
bad,New DM/GM belittled staff changed procedures to the point the entire staff quit promoted then demoted me but wanted to keep doing the same job so bad.
bad,Working at Wendys was one of the hardest things that i ever had to do. I would do all the work while my co-workers slacked off. The management did nothing about it because i was doing such a great job and they knew that the others weren't as good so they made me do extra labor for the same amount of pay. I often found myself working with a low staffed crew during busy hours. I also was asked to stay later than what the schedule said 4 days out of 5.
bad,"Management was poor and location was terrible. Not a big complainer but I'm really glad I left this hole. Nothing but the most respect for fast food workers, but my scheduled hours and manager were pretty poor"
bad,"With this company no appreciation, long hours and always short staff. Rude management, never recommend anyone to work them. They expect so much with little pay."
bad,"The managers do not run the business they just yell and get stressed out which causes the kitchen to fight and get off pace, well there’s never a pace set cause the managers don’t do anything to help. They don’t give there employees breaks and they are known for stealing hours off the employees pay sheets never happened to me but seen it happen to others so keep your time Sheets. Or just save yourself the time and apply somewhere you’ll actually enjoy"
bad,"The first store I worked at was an amazing work environment."
bad,They dont care about there employees or there managers at all. As long as the job is done even if its a 5 man job an you only have 2.  Its more about how much money the company is making an not about that plus the well fare of the employees
bad,"Wendy's is by far the worst job I have ever worked. $9.25 for all of those hours that they make me come in, complaining that I wasn't fast enough as if I hadn't just started training, and just overall a stressful, annoying, and tiring. And on top of all of that, you still have to pay for your food. It's 50% off but you, an EMPLOYEE, still have to pay. NO BENEFITS. I would only recommend it to somebody that I don't like."
bad,"Terrible management who are think they are running a kitchen for Gordon Ramsay, but somehow still manage to be super inefficient and unsanitary. "
bad,"I had worked at wendys in Billerica MA for about 2-2.5 years, i found out that it was a huge mistake after my first year. The original manager had left and they left us with this guy who didnt know he was doing. The other managers weren’t terrible, but, they did not know what they were doing. Terrible work environment, grease everywhere (well, Thats a given), unsanitary cleaning area, and coworkers who were clueless are just some of the reasons why tou should not work for wendys."
bad,"Their procedures don’t make any sense. Using tongs to get things out of the oven and turn trays is my best example. Come on, get some oven mitts! Store manager said we have them but they are gross. Are you kidding me?! They give too many jobs to one person. I was new and store manager decided to leave me by myself and then got mad that I wasn’t fast or did something he didn’t like. There’s no breaks for managers although you work a 10 hour shift."
bad,The general manager was fine but most of the other managers under her were just awful. They were extremely rude and very pushy. Also all of the guests sucked on top of that.
bad,"The management at the Wendy's I worked at was terrible. Any issue I had in regards to how things were done, or issues I had with my check were blatantly disregarded. When I went and told them that I was quitting they scoffed at me and then practically laughed in my face."
bad,My experience working at wendy's was horrible. you are expected to kill yourself for minimum wage and the only benefit is the discount which you only get once a day but only on days you are scheduled to work.
bad,The management was racist and there was a lot of favoritism. Safety and sanitation was loosely followed. There were no benefits and no overtime pay. The shift hours were not consistent.
bad,The place was ok alot of lazy people who just came to collect a check. The general manager didn't enforce their duties so that made more work for everyone else poor management will make someone leave a job
bad,"Working for the Wendy's company was the most trying 3 years of my life. I gave them all my time and energy only to be fired after my child ended up sick and hospitalized. I really appreciate the company for the opportunities in advancement they gave me, but the district i worked under did not appreciate me or my work skills and therefore i have nothing nice to say about the company."
bad,wendys for me was a trap that took along time for me too get out of from bad managers pushing for unrealistic goals because they hve been tempeted by bonuses or managers that had been down right abusive.
bad,Did not like how the manager was hardly ever available. When she was there she stayed in the office making demands. Instead of talking to someone sensibly she'd yell and scream even though it didn't work. she was NOT  a good manager. she was mean.
bad,"Working for this fast food giant provided nothing short of a miserable memory. Management had no control, shifts had constant complications and most other employees had little to no respect."
bad,Day would start off with setting up for food stations. Then going through and making sure things were stocked properly. As well as making sure everything was clean.
bad,"The adorn their walls with catch phrases like ""do the right thing"" etc etc but the management team (directors on up) say one thing while doing something different. Very political"
bad,I made sandwiches and wrapped them for the costumers and cleaned up anything that was messy or looked to be cleaned and clean the sitting and dinning part
bad,Me gustaba trabajar ahí porque tenia muy buenas compañeras.
bad,Took the job for experience.  The management was poor. It just wasnt a fit for me other than to gain some work experience. I left to have my second child. Went back to work at another place.
bad,Working at this job sucked the management was horrendous. They would cut your hours and just not schedule you at all. They would have you work feom ioen to close 5 days in a row which is 9 to 1:30 in the morning.
bad,"staff and managers treated other employees very poorly, making from of people who had previously ordered food, not a very uplifting work environment. dont do it."
bad,"Unless you love working 30-40 hours a week in a hot kitchen covered in grease, surrounded by ineffective managers and angry customers, find some other way to spend your time."
bad,"the food was never cooked all the way through, not a clean place to work , horrible managent , low pay , poor customer service , no team work , bad schedule"
bad,"It was a good blow off job, not if you want to do something in life though. Management was very poor, and most of them did not do what they were supposed to do."
bad,"The managers were soo unprofessional . The workers know how to work together. They pay is berry little, The customer service is pretty good..........."
bad,Very unprofessional there were no leadership involved as well as no. Guidance none of the managers were working they would just come and sit in the office
bad,"I've worked at wendys twice ad both times i hated it, the pay is no where near the work they wanted me to do, they treated everyone differently and the managers showed favoritism, everyone i know that has worked here say the exact same thing."
bad,i was a manor  working at Wendy's and i was still going to school but the time i was working there it as great i grew to know great people and build a working family there that help me through school and taught me how to take on real responsible
bad,The management at Wendy’s was at its best poor. The lack of sanitation was over the top and not fair to the unknowing customers. The crew did not work well together and leadership is absent.
bad,"It’s a cool place to work , but mostly it’s like a high school full of messy people . The managers was nice . The job do get tiring and you would sooner see that you don’t get paid enough to do half of the things you have to do"
bad,"Fresh out of high school, it was a job, and a job beats no job. Otherwise, it's the food industry and you shouldn't expect anything stellar in hours or pay or any of it."
bad,"did not like the environement , was very hot and sticky and smelled after work, fast paced, rude customer , greasy food , managers were not friendly , however nice coworkers"
bad,I was not trained for the job. I started work without training or experience. It was difficult to find a spot on the schedule because I had to set up times each week instead of having a set schedule for each week.
bad,"this is the worst company ever to work for besides long johns silver. its a shame, they rip off your hours, no vacations, no benefits. this job is terrible."
bad,The management where I worked completely disregarded days off and scheduled shifts and would change my shift without notice. They also make the high school employees stay until 1AM to clean even on school nights. Don't work there.
bad,The General manager promised me 11.00$ an hour and never gave me my raise. He went MIA and just left. I ended up leaving because it wasn’t worth my time to stay there if even the Gm couldn’t.
bad,"Horrible work place and horrible management, they didn't know what they were doing and they treated there employees with disreaspects a d where always trying to find ways to make people quit"
bad,I found that as manager I was not allowed to decrease the hours of very unreliable workers and replace them with staff that turned up for their shifts.
bad,"good place to work an good way to communicate with others an meet new people. face work place but can be stressful at times., everyone gets alone an helps one another out if needed.."
bad,disrespected constantly by not only the crew but the DM. I was a manager but felt like I was just a customer at times. I was once told I would could step outside and get my a** beat by a male manager in training. I wrote him up with others statements and he still continued to work there. I worked 40 minutes away from home in the same city with out my approval and was not given a raise. I was fed up!
bad,Wendy's in Dublin is an absolute terrible place to work. They treat you very poorly and don't care at all about anything that may happen to you. I was injured in a workplace accident and my general manager couldn't even find out how to do the accident report.
bad,It was a fast a pace job with a very tiny kitchen that always had too many people inside it at one time.  None of it was enjoyable it was a first job.
bad,"Customer service sometimes gets put to the side due to lack of workers and compensating for those that called into work."
bad,The management was poor. They want you to do the work of at least 2 people at once. The hours were not fixed. Other than that its an okay place to work at.
bad,It was okay but there are a lot of lack in the crew members so a lot is done by yourself or your doing more then you should unlike it should be a team
bad,"Managers are rude, the building is dirty, bugs everywhere, use old buns or expired food. Nothing but water in salads, buns are hard, ranch is expired, fries are salty"
bad,This was an great experience being this was my very first job. I was working the salad bar at the time and all I had to do is keep stocked. I learned a lot there.
bad,wendy's is a job where you you always got to be doing something. you can't just stand around and do nothing. it's a great place to learn how to work with others and get to experience all type of customers mood and situations with them. but it's all about having a good attitude and being friendly.
bad,I was a general manager for Wendy's. I out in over 70 hours a week. Mostly fixing other stores issues. You were severely underpaid and taken advantage of.
bad,Not much to say about working here.  Dislike the management.  Very unprofessional and negative.  Employees are treated poorly and is not a very positive environment.
bad,Drive through was very fast paced. We had a lot of rude customers everyday and the manger was super cool about taking over and dealing with it. Would recommend it to a friend.
bad,I would recommend people who have an opportunity to work there. Employees work on team. I didn't make good money but I really got experiences. The salary  is not bad just you have to work hard in order to achieve your goals.
bad,Not a very good ran company. Very disorganized and managers really dont know their job at all. Very poor food safety.  And no breaks and very low pay... And managers always pass the blame and never get on the ones who dont do their job.
bad,I was a grill man at Wendy's but wasn't making enough to be able to take care of my daughter and woman plus I was getting payed every 2 weeks and it wasn't enough
bad,"It was a typical first job at a fast food restaurant. There were rude people and business was always fast paced. Down time was rare and time at work went by fast,"
bad,Hot and grease. work hard for every dime u get. the management is understanding in most cases. u enjoy the free meals and most customers.  the hardest part is starting up in the morning.
bad,"keep your business in order at all times,flip burgers constantly,make sure fries are always steaming hot,drink must have lids placed on tightly for customers"
bad,Great food great people and great chance to move up but management needs a lot of work. They live by there own rules and dont do things by the books and do not train correct
bad,the management team is not the best team they have they will lie on you they will pick who is the best they treat people like trash and they take a bout you to other people
bad,"A day at Wendy's was completely unorganized. Besides training, i didn't really learn anything work for Wendy's franchise. The culture was common but somewhat unprofessional. The hardest part about working with Wendy's cooperation is the management. Very unprofessional. I enjoyed meeting new people and learning new skills/ways to complete a task without any errors."
bad,"working here sucked. after my first month i hated it, i loved my co workers and they loved me but i hated all the rude, nasty customers. i worked here for one year which was my whole senior year of highschool. After i graduated, i quit."
bad,"I was 16, homeschooled, overworked by this company and underpaid. Forced to work through mandatory breaks given to underage workers. I was harassed and discriminated against by fellow employees and management."
bad,"Wendy's is a job that you would have first out of high school. It will teach you customer service, Finances, and how to interact with other peers different than your own."
bad,"I loved my coworkers, but the management was bad. Situations were poorly handled and training was less than okay. There was a lot of drama that was never addressed, the boss picked favorites. The general manager would be petty and cut someone's hours just because she didn't like them. It was by far my least favorite place I have ever worked."
bad,"A typical day at work, well they tranied me good "
bad,First you learn a lot about Handeling the money and not giving people back the wrong change very friendly community friendly work hours
bad,"Terrible. But only cause i was a teenage so i had to work in order to help my mother out at a young age. But we had our fun, here and there."
bad,"good work place great people great customer service "
bad,i feel like wendys promised me alot when i was hired 40 hrs and more of a professional environment then what i received too much drama that lead to work conflict  favoritism in punishment and cutting hrs after promised 40
bad,management was very poor and unorganized. the hours that was given was unfair. the coworkers was friendly the shift managers was very lazy and did not help much.
bad,Lol I was just about to text u wen I get off at the house and the other hand is not a problem with the baby and yetta and woo and still have a great day
bad,"ok for a summer or high school job not something i would do long term, half off on food and its a nice environment schedule friendly but raises are short to none"
bad,"it wasnt my favorite place to work, no one likes it i dont even think the manager liked working at that craaap hole, it was a pain for hours they would yell at you if you asked fir one day off"
bad,"Working here is based on friendships and how much the store manager likes you. Your hours will get cut down without reason or consent, your schedule will change on a weekly basis, and they are never able to accommodate anything into their schedule. I would recommend staying away from this place if you love your sanity."
bad,"Working at Wendys had to be the worst experience of my life i dont even know how i handled being in that place for alittle over a year. I was treated like a piece of trash there , i did everything i was suppose to. Some nights i had to run the drive thru , front end, and sandwhich making all on my own."
bad,Management is what made this job difficult. some store are better than others. Depends on which store your decide to work at.
bad,"It wasn't the best job, not treated the best as one of their employees, not very good hours and shifts. Pay was okay but could have been better."
bad,They worked us very harshly and we did not receive any benefits. I worked at this job for 5 years because I had responsibilities.
bad,I worked for this company previously when I was a teenager and when I started back as an adult I felt so upset about the management and the unprofessional of the business.
bad,I did not have a desirable experience in this company but I am not able to discuss (at this moment) anything that concerns the company.
bad,The place was a disaster. I was always being called in to do someone else's shift. The employees there all did drugs and I felt that it wasn't a good environment
bad,this enviorment was not as good as it should have been it was not cleaned at all the managers were very disrespectful to employes
bad,It wasn't some where i would prefer to work for a long period of time. Not an career i would choose to do. Work site wasn't some where i seen myself blending in at.
bad,"Not much to say. Will never do fast food ever again. Just not worth it, especially for what they pay you or how you get treated."
bad,"typical fast food environment. if you apply here you already likely know what youre getting yourself in to. All stores have a different environment, but managers only sat in back office on their phones"
bad,I was a full time high school student when I worked there. I learned how to work better as a team and under a specific time limit. Management was poor. The hardest part was trying to do my job with the managers.
bad,working here was alot of fun i really enjoyed te people the job kept me real busy the day flew by always good people good work good place nice friendly staff
bad,"I worked the night shift and a typical day included taking orders, cleaning the various machines, cleaning the floors, washing the dishes, and prepping stations for the next day. I did not like the way management was at Wendy's. Many of the managers were lazy and did not want to do their job half of the time. They were also quite rude to the employees much of the time. It was a very busy restaurant and we only worked with three employees on the night shift so sometimes mistakes would be made and rather than coming up with a productive solution the managers would get angry about it. My co-workers were good people and fun to be around for the most part though there were a lot of lazy ones. Someone would quit every couple of months and new people were getting hired all the time. Many of them were just getting their first job and didn't really want to work. The hardest part of this job was having to train someone different every couple of weeks while still having to take care of all of my other responsibilities like taking orders, mopping the floors, cleaning all the dishes, cleaning the fryers and ice cream machines, and prepping condiments for the next day. I can't say that I found any part of the job enjoyable."
bad,"I hated working here. It got in the way of working on my degree. I did not enjoy myself at all there, but I am still glad that I did."
bad,"The team i worked with didnt care about no one but themselfs, Working at wendys was fun and fast paced but there was to much fighting with each other and managers were not good at all."
bad,Working at wendys was a horrible experience. The mangers were not good at doing their job. One manager would answer a question with one answer where as a different manager would answer it differently. They were not on the same page ever.
bad,"From the managers to the crew members, very unprofessional no discipline in the work place. I hated the whole experience and I will not recommend this place to anyone else."
bad,"It is stressful and not a lot of pay. You work really hard for a very small amount of money. The co-workers are a lot of fun but not a lot of people stay working there, it is a revolving door."
bad,"Had a mold and bug problem. the managers were rude, to much drama... They changed my hours daily. they changed my hours daily ."
bad,The best part of the job was greeting and serving the customers. The lack of cooperation from other members of staff is what made the position there very challenging.
bad,"You were place in whatever position the manager asked you to work, and a few times you might be able to switch stations after your breaks were over."
bad,"Cashier"
bad,I loved working at wendy's because of the customer and I loved that is was near my house because i could just walk there and home and be on time .. Great place for a first start .
bad,working at this place brough joy to me eveyday the more i worked there the more i got to know my customers each day i would learn what they liked and didnt like.
bad,"This Wendys is located at a truck stop area, so the crowd was always busy and very interesting. There was days when you would meet the sweetest people that would be a blessing to somebody else and then there was the days that you could hear and see some of the meanest things."
bad,This was my first fast food job and it was differnt but i learned how to adapt
bad,"the fact of preparing food in a timely manner, but  the team effort from others was amazing.. the customers love the outcome of the product tht was purchased and the great customer service followed by a smile made their day"
bad,"My typical day at work goes well as long as everything runs smooth and no one drags around. I learned how to manage people, how to deal with ignorance even when you don't want too. The hardest part of my job I would say is the afternoon rush, reason being you're constantly moving and all orders must be correct. The most enjoyable part was the management that I was under and the whole work crew."
bad,It was and ok job to work at it just I wasn't getting that many hours and the pay suck wasn't good at all
bad,"The work area was to little for more than 2 people to be at, the management had some personal issues they would take out on the workers. Overall I wouldn't suggest anyone to work here"
bad,I only worked here for 4 days because they fired me for not a good reason... management VERY rude
bad,"i Worked To Hard For What I Got Payed, The workers Didnt Really Even Speak English so i Never Understood What To Do My First Couple Of Days. It was Horrible"
bad,"This company I should have never left.  Good ethics and upper management, just not enough pay."
bad,"The turnover rate was incredible, and also everyone had their way of doing things, so this meant the you were always learning a new way also."
bad,"a typical day at work was to prepare food and take orders."
bad,Management was rude and didn't like the hours. Co worker's were very friendly.
bad,Getting yelled at (everyone) by managers.  Being told you are incompitant.
bad,Everyone including managers gossiped. A good place to work if your young.
bad,"my first job, learning experience, was a good first job but not enough hours"
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's consisted of organizing so as to make sure you were ready for your shift, preparing the food that customers ordered, and ensuring that the customers were happy. Working at this establishment taught me a lot about customer service; I can now deal with the occasional upset customer without being impatient, or unkind. The hardest part of the job would have to be getting through the busy times of your shift, it took a lot of fast paced working, and team work. My absolute favorite part of the job was working with a group of people, and making my customers happy. A simple smile, or getting their order to them fast, and correctly, and a little polite conversation seemed to make most people feel so much happier, and I enjoyed that."
bad,I was a cook as well as a cashier here. I ran the grill and did inventory on the days our food truck came in. As well i would go outside and power wash the parking lot and keep the out side clean.
bad,"Prepare hamburger, potatoes frosty, and keep the area clean. This daily shift that was assigned."
bad,the hardest was counting change in my head to give customers but i overcame it.
bad,The environment was not for me and was not getting paid enough. I decided to look for better opportunities.
bad,This was by far the worst job ive been at just because of the management and staff
bad,"fast food, what do you think. not fun. what else can i say. i dont really have anymore to say but have to fill this box i guess.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "
bad,"A typical day at work was very fast pace to much going on, and confusing. Working at Wendys I learned how to work with a team, Also how to work under pressure. The co-workers were very nice. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the different cheese burgers and the meals."
bad,I disliked working at Wendy's. I was harassed and insulted a lot by managers and employee's. It was most definitely not the best experience for me.
bad,"a typical day at work was okay, it was my first job ive learned how to cook on the grill, be quick about things. The management was nice and so was my coworkers, the hardest part was when we got busy and trying to keep up, i enjoyed working with people"
bad,"I worked at Wendy's for two summers in a row. The First summer I was there in 2010 they let me go because I was pregnant. The second summer I work from Aug 2011-Dec 2011. I was Ok with the co-workers but the managers I didn't like. They were very unprofessional, and they way they spoke to us was surely unprofessional as well. The best part about the job was when I got to do the cash register cause that meant i got to talk to the customers. But I also like when i got to learn how to use the different station, like the fry station, the grill, I got to use the headset to the drive-thru and making the sandwiches. "
bad,horrible atmosphere. the work conditons are very unfavorable
bad,"its a very fast pace place,you learn about the food, and customers.you have alot of team players you work around to get the customers in and out with a smile.when you cant satisfy the customers no matter what but when you see all the young and the elderly people with a smile makes you feel good"
bad,my typica day there at work everyday i got yelled at for no reason stay too myself what i learned experinces in resturant my co workers was ok cleaning the grill making friends on the job and they help me get the hang of everything there
bad,Absolutely dreaded every day i had to work at that place i would give it negative stars if i could
bad,overseeing the the qauilty of the restuant and making sure all customers are satified and the business is ran correctly
bad,Not enough opportunity for me personally. Good people to work for and with
bad,I like my postion but had to work with people that were not team players and saw stuff that shouldn't have been in the work place.
bad,"I did not enjoy working in fast food. However, it introduced me to cash handling and register use."
bad,I would work here again if you paid me $15.00/ hour. great coworkers though
bad,"At Wendy's I would have someone telling me something to do constantly. Customers were rude, management was rude, most of the older co-workers had graduated 4 or 5 years ahead of me and thought they could also be rude as well. Hardest part about the job was cleaning behind the fryers. I don't think there was really an enjoyable part about this job I just did it because I had to."
bad,I was mostly a line cook. Helped fill french fry orders. took out the trash.
bad,"A typical day at wendy's I had to make every type of sandwhich they sold, work the fryers, manager the register, take orders, make salads and chilli. What I learned from working at Wendy's was it's very hard to work in a very small enviroment with lots of people. Management was absolutly horrible. He was utterly rude to everyone, and doesn't show anyone respect, but he expects everyone to respect him. Most of my co-workers were very nice to be around, they helped me out a lot when I first started and had no idea what i was doing. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my manager. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customers happy."
bad,Was with company for over 5 yrs when my uncertified maintenance guy was electricuted by the frosty machine. All corporate was in Chicago for big get together and they had no care that I had just watched this and performed cpr (which I was not trained  in ) unsuccessfully. Their main concern was the public not to hear about it. They made me use all my vacation time as well as sick time due to the fact I was not ready to come back through the doors my co-worker of 5 yrs had just died at.
bad,It’s Was A Good Job But They Wasn’t Paying Good Money To Live Off Of If They Was Playing Better I Would’ve Stayed At Wendy But They Paid Didn’t Cut It
bad,I learned a lot of different machines.  I was able to learn fast and they worked with my college hours.  Over all I had a great experience working there.
bad,"managers are rude and don't respect privacy "
bad,"hated the job  , everyone who ik either quit or still still works there and works harder then they need to , its stupid and im very happy i quit . like super happy"
bad,The company is not a good company to work for the pay is terrible. The hours are ok and you do get two weeks paid vacation every year. The management is terrible.
bad,This was my very first job and I liked and disliked it the most I learned everything I need to know in the work place on so many different levels. Self control
bad,It is a good company to work fo no complaints. I enjoyed my time working here. Taught me valuable skills. Room for advancement. Easy to learn and training opportunities available.
bad,The hardest part of my job was to do more than what was expected than helping close out the lunch or night shift.My work time would be mainly be cross trained on multi- positions.My favorite position was being the grill cook.Also this company needs a remodel for then will get a better review from me. My follow co-workers some I liked some I could not work with at all it is a typical shift at any fast food enviorment.
bad,"fast speed and its a lot of pressure on you , the pay was minimum wage, the management was not that great . employees were all over the place and not following directions ."
bad,This job sucked never got my last check they acted as if i never worked here
bad,Pretty cool coworkers but the management really sucks and they are always in need of supplies. Its a stressful job and there is always a short of staff.
bad,"Cashier"
bad,"I got layed off because I wasn't making enough sales, which is beyond my control. Not enough room for advancement"
bad,"Good hours, friendly customers and coworkers, great mangers."
bad,"A typical day at work would probably be coming in right on time, putting your uniform (hat and apron) on, saying hello to everybody, then going to my manager and asking them what to do, them telling me to get the money counter and counting the cash register, then going to drive thru and putting the drawer in the register and waiting for people to come to drive thru to take their order."
bad,I enjoy working with my co-workers. I enjoy interacting with the guests and making them smile
bad,I wish i was still working there i just let someone there get the best of me and i couldn't be pushed around no more. 
bad,"hated going to work, almost quit my first day and all I was doing was shadowing and learning the ropes. they are very flexible with availability though, I had an injury and they lowered my hours for me but sadly I couldn't keep up still."
bad,"I worked at Wendy’s for 5 months. It was a fun job. I liked working with my sister and my friends. Unfortunately management didn’t treat me well. I switched stores hoping it would get better because I liked my job. I was still treated poorly. I did front, coordinating, and fries. I knew how to do every station. They made me train 3 crew members."
bad,It was a nice job to work at  and it was a lil difficult but I got through it with out having to be told how to do it  but the job could’ve been a lil more challenging
bad,I love my job I love to see my residents smile and knowing I can make their day better. I learned to love everyone no matter their disabilities and to always uplift them most enjoyable part is interacting with everyone and enjoying their company.
bad,Working for Wendy’s was alright. The management is super bad and its not somewhere where I would want to go back. It’s good for a first temporary job tho.
bad,"Excellent reading and comprehension."
bad,"it was fun while it lasted had to quit because relative beck and a Manager, but ya know it was cool. It would've been better if I was able to keep my job tho instead of being ""forced"" to quit"
bad,Wendys is a very easy job but you have to worry about the customers been rude or nice. Being a manager is a lot you have to make sure every thing is I place before the store open up. A typical day at some times it becomes stressful but when you get thru the day you will be ok but most part is coming to work happy and enjoy the others that's there. the hard part about the job is that you gotta make sure all the money is correct and not short and worry about the food product is all straight for the next day and making sure u have the food prep for the next shift. I had so cool co workers but they only can be your friend on the outside because coming to work is a job but the over come I love working with different people.
bad,"I really enjoyed my job at wendys ,"
bad,It was always a good experience being able to walk in to work with smiling faces everyday loved the job. You learn a lot of hands on skills.. customer services skills are being used everyday.
bad,A typical day at work was very busy an I've learned how to work in a fast paced environment along with my co-workers an managers the hardest part of my job when I first started how to use the digital cash register. The most enjoyable time was working with peers that I attended school with.
bad,Very busy at lunch time. Co-workers could be difficult to work with. Hardest part dealing with rude customers. Most enjoyable part break time and payday.
bad,At the expense of ones physical limitation and value placed on hardworking emloyees. The price of the products customers consumed was increasing but nothing was talked about wage increase. It seemed like more of a liability to advance to management because why would you work for 11 dollars an hour 12 dollar as a manager.....
bad,Wendy’s is an alright place to work for however there are some concerns with the management because of favoritism which is extremely unprofessional and unfair to the employees.
bad,Management is weak and employees aren’t appreciated! I personally spent 99% of time at work busting my butt and I got no appreciation or respect from management!! Also I was an employee running shifts because management was weak
bad,"If you want a job that you can just get by, then you should work at Wendy's. They don't care about their employees, and you are easily replaced. They pay minimum wage"
bad,"Fast Food Cashiers process orders and collect payments from customers in a fast food restaurant. Their chief duties include greeting customers, responding to inquiries, and maintaining public areas."
bad,Management was awful.The general manager was a creep. But upper management would not do a thing about him. I loved my crew and my customers. Unfortunately I could not deal with it anymore and I am happy I left
bad,"Wendy's was a hard job for me. The management is unorganized, they use phones all day an only really work if a head boss is around. The employees do bare minimum. I think this is a good job for anyone looking for work quick they fire everyone because no one stays. Long term its not fun!"
bad,A good first job to learn and practice skills. I have learned to have patience and tolerance for difficult people and situations. The fast paced environment can be highly stressful when the turnover rate is ridiculous.
bad,"Not only was I hired two minutes apart from someone else and paid a (lower) 25 cent difference, but I was forced to do most of the managers job without being placed in a management position or getting a raise above 7.25 for my first two years working there. The managers were always in a bad mood, never listened to the concerns of the workers and cut hours off of our checks so they wouldn't get in trouble for having us work overtime. Worst job I've ever worked."
bad,Looking to find full time in warehouse jobs. Need to advance in my pay grade. Looking to find a way out of food industry. I would like to be elugible for to buy a house but cant on Wendy's salary.
bad,this was the worse job I ever had in my life! there is one manager who actually hit me before and did it SEVERAL TIMES! I eventually just stopped caring about the job itself and gave up.
bad,"I used to go to work not wanting to be there sometimes."
bad,other Wendy's I worked for was fine but the last one I worked for was horrible bosses were inappropriate and rude. cut your hours if they don't like you or get into an argument with you.
bad,"talked down to us and acted entitled to us on our days off. should have hired more people instead worked me and one other employee overtime. also, gossip between management and employees was really unprofessional felt as if the employees were adults and the managers were teens."
bad,"I was pregnant while working there, and they could not care less. They had me lifting really heavy items, didn't let me sit down for 6 hours straight, and they had it so hot behind the counter, I almost passed out."
bad,I worked Wendy’s when i was 16 it was fine back then now at the age of 30 i went back to it and i wish i wouldn’t have!! Over worked and no pay $8 an hr and working short staffed so closing with me and the manager and i have to do majority of the work i hated that job i quit without another job in place
bad,"Managers, employees, and customers will all treat you the same. With disrespect and attitude you mess something up one time and they make fun of you. Some managers will get on to you about eating then go to the office and have a feast of their own."
bad,"Ive worked here over a year, and I have not had many opportunities to move up, or hourly increase. They keep me a few hours short of 40 hours a week, every week. Managers do not understand personal or family issues, and will write you up for calling in unless its anything but being sick, and you'll need a note everytime from a doctor. No opportunities for overtime, even a few hours a week. Schedules are never posted on time and usually do not get posted until 10 or 11 at night, Sunday night's. The managers treat you as a replacement, and youll never feel job security. I would NOT recommend apply for Wendy's."
bad,If you are a manager they want you to work 12 to 13 hour days so you make less money than when you were a crew member. You will do your employees work for them because they will not care considering what they are paid. Each crew member is expected to do three peoples jobs.
bad,"Besides paying rent don't go to Wendy's on 16th"
bad,Poor work performance from management when training new people. They just stick u some place the other employees don't want and that's where you stayed. No fair splitting if chores...too much gossip bullying and favoritism
bad,Store was disgusting. Mold everywhere and standing water in the back. Management would allow everyine to go on smoke breaks all at once leaving non smokers to run the store alone. Some co workers came to work high
bad,I am sure things have changed considering my employment was 4 years ago and the building has been completely rebuild from ground up. I mean it’s a job but I would recommend for high school students
bad,Management are not held accountable for mistakes and favoritism is rampant. Food safety logs are faked. Food served after expiration date. This company is terrible to work for.
bad,"Did not like working at Wendys. The management was rude and didn’t care about their employees. Said i would get paid a certain amount and never saw the amount i was supposed to get paid. Talked badly about customers right to their face. Overall, horrible experience"
bad,"It was not the best place to work, that’s why when I found out that red lobster had a job opening I took it. I was there for over a year, before I decided that the restaurant industry was not something that I would like to do forever."
bad,I enjoyed working here but feel as if I wasn’t treated as well as I should have been. I did excellent work on a day to day basis and feel as if it was never appreciated.
bad,"Management was SO unprofessional. Even long after I had quit, one of the managers came to my new job and attempted to get me fired from there. No one was happy, we were all extremely depressed due to the environment."
bad,"A typical work day consisted of being short handed and just all around short staffed, doing paper work, running shift, and just doing whatever needed to be done to ensure smooth operations during peek and non peek time. I learned how to run my own shift and how to better manage mine and others time. The hardest part of the job was always being short staffed and still expected to meet time deadlines. The most enjoyable part would be the people I got to work with and a lot of the times the kids that worked with me."
bad,"The store numbers itself were horrible. Drive thru times were horrible, managers were just terrible. Nobody is consistent, nobody can get a thing done on time, nobody listened to anybody, and it was a constant stoner lounge."
bad,"The location i resigned from was horrible. Everyone there had attitudes all the time and it felt like being in a high school cafeteria with the gossip and the cliques, it was annoying."
bad,If you like doing different tasks everyday this job is for you. They put you on everything in this job. one day is drive thru if you are slow they will scold you. one day youre the cook making a million patties. next day you do dishes the whole day. Be careful if you have a weak stomache about the meat for whatever stew they sell or whatever its always old meat. Theres like a million salad packages to organize. Good luck with being a cashier here its the most stressful job possible.
bad,we was always short people so we always had to put in over time they dont pay enough and the managers treat the workers bad they dont care about your out side life or your kids
bad,"Management was bad, there was an abundant amount of infighting and drama. Customers were extremely rude and inconsiderate. Awful place to work, if needed only work there temporarily."
bad,My boss is always mean. Like to yell at people. And when you're having a hard time and need more hours you don't get them instead your hours get cut. I don't suggest anyone works here. They let crew get away with whatever they want. And the boss always leaves early than what he's scheduled it messes up everything.
bad,The pay is low for the work the crew does they need a raise for the crew members. Also dirty as heck. Manager is rude. Upside some crew members are nice
bad,Since there was a change in upper management the new dm plays favorites and gives free meals to her friends and only hires people she personally knows. She refuses to give proper promotions and wages. Wendys has went severely downhill since she has become the dm.
bad,Granted this was quite some time ago but the overall atmosphere was very crude and not very professional. But then again what fast food restaurant is between those particular hours. The manager at that specific given time was insulting in some cases.
bad,That place is a  joke!!!! Worst place I've ever worked at!!!! They need a new gm... She says its Wendys way but that's not true its her way!! Or the high way!!!!
bad,"if youre capable of doing it and they know, they will have you doing it all"
bad,In my experience at Wendy's was not that could they needed better and more proper training for there works they lack to show how to run a fast food  with proper consistence they rush you throw the training and then throw you to  the dogs
bad,"Wendy has good food however it takes at least 14 people to make the operate correctly and sending home all but 4 or 5 at the same time which happens to be when you get busy not good. They are more worried about drive threw time then making sure the food is made correctly or the fact that 4 people can not do $530.00 every thirty minutes and expect things to be right. then employees are the one getting yelled at because food is wrong, cold and people are going to gettired of their food being wrong and waiting 15 mintues or longer for food."
bad,"Very fast paced and extremely busy no matter what time of day it is. Bad management skills and very dirty work conditions!! A lot of conflict in the workplace!!! Corporate doesn’t care about the employees, it’s a money hungry company in my opinion.. we don’t get paid double for working on holidays.. I work 10+ hour shifts with no break most of the time.. on the clock until 1:45-2am. I’ve been with the company for a year and some months now and requested to use my paid week long vacation and I’ve never got the pay.. most people that work at this company in my area HATE their job. I wish you the best of luck if you’re applying."
bad,A very faced paced work environment and if one person was slacking the person down the line had to work harder to fulfill customers orders. Felt overworked a lot always given more work because of those who would slack not being seen as dependable like myself.
bad,The management never really cares about the workers. They only care about making money and looking good in the eyes of people in higher positions. They don't follow regulations properly.
bad,Very rude management. Poor pay. No time off. No training. Bad hours . Horrible pay all the way around even for adults. They steal your time. They let you go without a break the go back and put it in like you had a break
bad,I liked it because it was money but i felt uncomfortable because the workers inworked with an i was real sick then so i was real sick still working it was too much but overall its an okay place to work at
bad,I felt like I was a manager at job I wasn’t getting paid enough yet . Overall I helped costumers with their problems assisted them and as well got everything they needed out the door .
bad,Management doesn't understand that employees have a right to privacy. It's like high school at the verity Pkwy Wendys store in Middletown Ohio.  General manager has no sense of how to deal with an employee. The employees personal lives are no ones business but their own. It is very inappropriate of all the managers to discuss employees personal lives with other employees..  it is rude and very unprofessional. The store is luckily I am not saying them for slander
bad,I learned how to work faster and learn faster.I learned how to multitask better than ever before. I started doing things to get more hours but I've yet to have seen them.
bad,"I was kitchen staff, dining room etc. I was treated very poorly by the staff & managers. Everything was done to slow and nobody had the attitude needed for the job. The hardest part was coming to work but I needed the money."
bad,"getting ready to open, Do what ever asked, keeping dinning room clean and stocked as well as run register.. Meeting customers.I learned to stay away from fast food"
bad,"A typical day at work was very stressful, not enough hours and poor"
bad,"due to the issue of management, it has caused me the urge to no longer continue my job there. the management expected me to not go to school and continue to work endless shifts because I am young."
bad,No room for advancement. Only a good job if you do not have bills . More so for someone in high school or someone with previous manager skills in order to get the pay you deserve.
bad,"The food produced from the Wendy's I worked at was disgusting. It was so revolting most of the crew members wouldn't eat it, even after an eight hour shift. The management made working there even more unbearable, they made it feel like you were very insignificant and expendable."
bad,I worked there for almost a year and advanced to being a manager but they didn't train me to be a strong enough manager for when we had our meal rushes. As well as they fail to schedule me enough workers that know what they are doing.
bad,every day it was all was something bad happening and the managers are rude and ive learned you cant please all managers and stay out they way at all times
bad,"I didnt like it here because the lack of managment, one of the manager wasnt fair with the workers. The hours depended if she liked you or not. Days off wasnt fair about them. A stressful place to work at overall."
bad,"Very fast paced and never able to catch up, end up doing way more work then you are paid to do. It will teach you how to keep a pace. The hardest part of daily work was lunch rush. No part of this job was enjoyable. Management in my facility was terrible."
bad,I hated working here the managers used there power way too much. Over all the work environment sucks and i would never want to go back. Management is horrible
bad,they treat you bad they dont care about your needs they nasty people work at they own place they take old food and serve it to the costomers i cant work in a enviroment as such
bad,"I like the restaurant as a customer but i would never step into the food business again because of Wendys. Over working, terrible management because of low wages, with terrible management comes terrible service of food."
bad,"The management was terrible, only certain managers cared for the workers and store. Hours were always changing and schedules sometimes weren’t made. Work the night shift one day and than be forced to open the next. No overtime was payed."
bad,"The job required me to handle money, work fast paced, be organized and handle food. my managers were not helpful, they were rude. They would not work with my school schedule after being told they would upon being hired."
bad,Didn't know how to talk to their employees treated employees very disrespectful and if I was to say anything to the other managers they would act a certain type of way so I just quit and to find something better because I wasn't getting paid enough to go through that
bad,Terrible time of my life. Employees here are unfair and rude. No compassion for customers. Service was terrible. People acted like they're better than you.
bad,I didn't enjoy working at Wendy's. Management was cut throat. Trying to work with crew members that didn't care. Always felt that the job was just that not a career.
bad,"I'm never down about a job, but Wendy's was terrible. The management was horrible, and they had favorites. Being in a big company like that, everyone had a big head. Noone wanted to help you and expects you to do everyone on your own. We would get new people and they would quit after being there for 2-3 days because how horrible it was. Don't recommend this place at all."
bad,Do everything including managerial stuff do drive thru all day including through the break you're supposed to get. Pays no attention to if you had to call off cause of a medical condition
bad,Honestly I was pregnant at the time so the smell of food would make me extremely sick. I had the worst boss who would try to make me use chemicals I shouldn’t have been working with and it was all around dreadful.
bad,this is a job designed to be your starting point. The workplace culture is friendly but too many were not determined to see you move up and advance yourself
bad,Would not recommend current location. Managers were not on the same page at all. Store was always slow. Not enough employees. No type of communication between workers and managers.
bad,Decent job just to get by if money is needed. Management is awful worst place to work if looking for good management. The manager was very rude and does not care about employee.
bad,"The job was meh, even if you work hard you're still underappreciated. I think it's a great fit for someone who likes to do everything at once. Sometimes the employees there will tell you what to do even if the manager or supervisor didn't give the employee permission to."
bad,mangement really sucked and wasnt a group i would ever want to work for again. they were disrepectful and rude. didnt understnad anything anout us. just wouldnt give people the time there
bad,I worked hard here 2 years none stop. I came in when ever they wanted me to. I put in my 2 week notice because I was getting older and was trying to move but wasnt making enough money to.
bad,the managers want you to do your job and theirs until the general manager comes in and then they want to act as if they always on top of their job. they give all the older people the time off they need but the younger they do not care about. they are not fair with hours
bad,While working at Wendy's i did not feel like apart of the family and was not treated very nicely. The managers didn't care about the employees and didn't care what happened
bad,"The hardest part for working at Wendy’s , is the lack of communication, being apart of the crew an not knowing what items are what . To much Creole speakers not enough English ."
bad,Responsible for taking food order for diner’s as well as running a register handling cash and merchant services. Lobby cleanliness as well as stocking the restrooms.
bad,"Bad management, scheduled for times I was unable to work, rude employees, lazy employees, rude management, rarely received breaks, broken vacuums, dirt carpet (needed steam cleaned and hadn’t been in what looked like years)"
bad,It was not cool it was not good there the manager was sleep  all the time people were not coolit was a lady that all says yell it was total hello   I never seen anything like it
bad,"This is a horrible place to work. Between the unfriendly co-workers, incompetent management and the hours its safe to say this is the worst place to work."
bad,"I disliked Wendy's a lot. Poor management. Bad hours. They lied about promoting to manager , went to burger King and was manager in under a week. Wouldn't recommend at all"
bad,"Worked at this job because they was the first one to call with opportunity. Extreme stress on the job, non-management, lots of time and dollars spent on LAZY people."
bad,"fast food to begin with is one of  thee most unpleasant  jobs to have."
bad,"A typical day at wendys  is not busy, I found it very boring. there was hardly any advancement for some people, and more for others, I didn't feel I was treated with the respect I deserve."
bad,These types of stores are run by teenagers and young adults; the store cannot function if it is not fast paced or well coordinated.Expect to work hard and have a sore body at the end of the day.
bad,I did everything a manager did while he was in the office on the phone. I was told i was too young to be promoted even though I was ready. The manager wanted me to do all the work with no benefit.
bad,Would not recommend Wendy's for employment to any of my friends or family. Although the food is decent and the atmosphere ok the employees are not the greatest.
bad,Management does not under stand the word Can't or No; when asked to stay late as someone is running late. Management walks outside to smoke during the dinner rush.
bad,"Upper Management is very poor, don't care about your outside life if things where going on at home. Makes you drive to other stores almost every week. favoritism is really high here. poor pay"
bad,"We are always working long hours, I do not get any break anymore because we are short of so many people. It is very fast paced but as a whole the team members do not get things out and ready fast enough."
bad,"Overall working here was not the greatest experience, I only stayed as long as I did because it was extremely flexible with my lifestyle. The experiences I had helped me shape myself into the hard worker I am now,"
bad,"The particular store I worked at was not a cohesive environment. I found it very stressful from the environment.  "
bad,"The management at my Wendy's was composed of lazy, disrespectful, and careless people. They never managed the bad employees and basically put up with everything, but they still made the good employees pick up all the slack. We were always short staffed and I personally had to cover 3 or more people's positions every night. We were also compensated terribly. I was a part time employee but I was scheduled for 45-50 hours each week with no benefits and hardly any breaks. The raise system is terrible (only 20-40 cents every YEAR. The employees there already make slave wages). I couldn't put up with this place, so I had to quit."
bad,"It's trash, honestly their's nothing good about this Wendy's location. the management is always slipping up, we run out of product entirely too much, staff placement is horrible, we're understaffed, and on top of that they're always messing up schedules and sending them out to our e-mails at the last minute. honestly the only reasonI'm still there is because I don't have and can't find another job at the moment."
bad,fast paced environment dealing with people from all cultures race and ages. Helped me learn how to prepare some basic food items and how to ensure food is stored property to prevent illness and to preserve shelf life.
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with but unfortunately they couldn't offer moms hours and I have to resign my job due to lake of child care during the evenings and look for something with better hours.
bad,"•	Clerical duties such as setting up new patrons with memberships, answering phones, shifting, photocopying, faxing, printing as well as counting and sorting money"
bad,the hardest part of the job was dealing with more than 30 angry frustrated customers but maintaining a self confident to please the costomers.! these typical things are known to be much needed working in an enviorment such a company dealing with truck drivers and many more and frustrated coustomers that eats on the daily at this company
bad,"Cooked burgers, chicken, and fries. Prepare food for the next day."
bad,Wendy's was my first job it was a easy job you can learn quick. Management at that job was the worst ever the manager was lazy and would never tell you anything to your face she send someone else to tell and business shouldn't get ran like that.
bad,i was asked by the store mgr to help out a few nights a week and it turned into a full time job I did not want. I was currently working at auto zone and love that job
bad,"I had a terrible first job experience at Wendy's. The managers were terrible with scheduling, they always forgot to put me on the schedule, they always changed the schedule without any notice, so I would think I have the next day off, I later get a call that I am supposed to show up and on schedule and then they later would tell me they changed the schedule the night before. I would not recommend Wendy's a place to work"
bad,"If you like going back to high school repeatedly and love to gossip, this is the perfect job. You don't move up fast. Always remember the customer is right. Also that crew members don't eat for free but managers can buy for their whole family and eat for free."
bad,"As a single mother, who became recently homeless, i wish my employer would of cared more instead of just firing me. i had some problems and i know that being late or calling off is unprofessional, but i was in a very hard place"
bad,This was a job that required learning how to clean kitchens. One of the main responsibilities were opening or closing the kitchen and prepping everything for the day. Working cash register was part of that well. Responsibility was often switched around between workers.
bad,Working for Wendy's was extremely exhausting. Not because of the work but because of the management. They provided video training and that was it. The staff was rude and unforgiving when it came to making mistakes. I was not treated like a team member at all.
bad,"Not a good experience "
bad,the crew was very stuck up never helped anyone manger was never around and did not get the proper training that was needed nor the proper uniform to due the job was hired for
bad,"Its a racist place to work...they only want to hire non.speaking Hispanics..."
bad,"I worked there for a while, When i was promoted into a supervisor it was great. I was trained on everything that a supervisor needed to be trained on. The work place was fun. The old owner sold the place to some new people and they came in and turned everything upside down. Not paying you after a time and would fire you if you walked out without finishing your job. treated their staff very very poorly"
bad,"I have been working at Wendy's  since May of 2016. I work in the Henderson Nevada area. The most thing that I have learned at Wendy's is Patience LOTS of it. You will have a typical day of slow days and really fast pace at  times. It always changes and  never stays the same. Management is okay,  it could be better. The main manager of the store to me is like a cloud over my head and she makes it rain all day.  The other managers are more like sunshine and rainbows they make having to work at the job fun and also serious at the same time."
bad,lay back and easy work and is fast pace at times. my faav part of the job is to put fies and nuggets down and then help out on getting the customers orders.
bad,"Typical day i had was fast. I learned how listening closely and fast that customers were pleased quicker. Management as i witnessed was not fair. Everyone has their own experience. Workplace culture, not too friendly, but was friendly to customers. Hardest part of the job was always fast pace. Most enjoyable was talking to customers."
bad,"i did a couple of things here i was a cashier, sandwich maker,and grill operator. when cashiering i would take orders and money and make sure they get the right order. sandwich maker i would make sandwiches, salads, and wraps. grill operator i would lay meat, drop chicken drop fries"
bad,"A typical day at work was getting things done. None stop screaming from managers because they were very unorganized. I learned how to properly greet and associate with customers. The workplace environment was just horrible. The managers were very unorganized, the employees weren't sure what to be doing or where to be going. I was sent home one more then one occasion because they got in trouble for over working minors and then my hours just began to skyrocket in a downward plunge. The most enjoyable part of the day was on the rare occasion that everyone was getting along and we worked as a team."
bad,Wendy's was a great place to work. I learned how to operate the grill and the proper way to keep the orders together. I meet and see people.
bad,"Mostly on your feet all day, have to be a fast learner have to learn to work in very hot temperatures, be able to work with many different types of people."
bad,"""managers"" sit on their phones in the break room and they dont do their job. The ""managers"" also gossip about co-workers. the hardest part of the job was pretending to like working with rude people."
bad,"This was a horrible place to work for lack of respect for the employers who bend over backwards for them.  An so much more"
bad,"i was just hired and i would take orders, but it never failed there was always that one costumer. i would read there order back to them and the would say that it is all correct then come back and say that i screwed up s they could get free food. "
bad,The manager was not a very good guy to get along with. He always was complaining about something not be doing done correct from the video. So it isn't a very good place to work
bad,its really not that great...Its a fast food job.  Typical day is you go clock in. about noon is the lunch rush so if you holding on product you'll be yelled at and maybe written up.(seen it happen to a coworker). Always give you something to do so you can't really sit down. Some managers are nice  while some aren't.
bad,"The general manager was great, but the team leads kept up alot of havoc for the black minorities. So the hardest part was listening to your boss belittle because of authority."
bad,"Typical day was full of stress"
bad,"A typical day was fun,learned  how to make burgers and work grill, lazy management, fun co-workers,rude customer, seeing co-workers everyday"
bad,Management was very bad and the work environment was very toxic. This was due mainly to the main manger and the the regional manger. Also the work area was not very sanitary or at least up to the standards that i thought they should be.
bad,"Prepare Store for closing, while using customer service and training to become a manager."
bad,This is a great job for someone who is very fast paced and has a lot of patience for customer service. The hours and labor are sometimes challenging as well as the disrespectful customers that come through occasionally.Patience with difficult customers really helps.
bad,This workplace was unacceptable due to bad treatment from employees towards me and others. However I did learn a lot of operations while working in the kitchen on how the flow of the day to day operations worked.
bad,Sandwich artist very early hours preparing for the day. Co workers change often. No medical insurance. Cooking cleaning was a steping stone to moving forward.
bad,"Productive with a learning curve, trained out in Brandon, Man. Have 35 years in this business. Fast food chains are competitive, sales went up with more hands on. Staff was easy to train, The hardest part of the job was too many bosses, The most enjoyable was the starting day of my own store."
bad,Very unprofessional and full of drama. The staff is pretty much all family and pick and choose favorites. They talk about people and are not willing to help you. They are sometimes rude to customers and make you do other peoples job.
bad,"The store that I worked for was ok, however management was not so good, just a lot of broken promises.  I did enjoy the staff."
bad,"That's all I can say, it was my first job and I was taken for a ride tell I found a new job. only with there help sadly did I get a better job."
bad,"a typical day is working on the register, getting customers food right, cleaning the dining room. make sure you come to work with a smile, because e people can be rude."
bad,"During my short time with Wendy's, I discovered the supervisors seemed to but under a lot of pressure and as a result were not the most encouraging lot. Also there was quite a lot of illegal and unsavory conduct occurring amongst the employees."
bad,Wendy's as a company is poor overall. There's really no reason to work if you work for Wendy's. There's no benefits and the pay even in management is a joke.
bad,"Treated employee's unfair , refused to make repairs to establishment , When Idea's for crew incentives brought to mind was told I could do them out of my own pocket , I was even unable to get a raise for crew members who had been working for years . The only raise given is a federal minimum wage raise and then it was given on the deadline and not a second sooner !"
bad,"Part time only, minimum wage, performance based, no room to advance"
bad,Wendys is very busy for lunch and and during carowinds.  IT is very fast paced and you have to wrok as a team to satisfy all the customers
bad,"Greeting customers, serving their food, cleaning my stations and going home-typical day"
bad,when I worked at wendys I got 4-8 hours every 3-4 weeks. when I did work I prepared food and cleaned the dinning room and kitchen. I collected money and helped keep all stations stocked and prepared for rushes.
bad,no one would speak english all would speak spanish and not help you at all.
bad,"no, not very good, wouldn't suggest working in fast food. working with customers sucks, people are bitter, and the break tine is horrible."
bad,A typical day at wendy's was if someone called in. I learned the value of teamwork and why it's important.
bad,the whole way the store was operated was disturbing. they dont care about there customers.
bad,Management there consisted of people that had no interest of being a manager or doing their job for that matter. The crew members were constantly complaining and getting into fights with the customer.
bad,"A lot of elderly people come to Wendy's so you get a lot of different personalities. My co workers are very friendly just like me. The hardest part about job is getting those type of customers who likes to make other people lives difficult but to prevent that I just continue to be nice to them. I enjoy the laughs that I have with my customers the most, it makes my day go by faster."
bad,All aspects of what it takes to run safe clean and productive fast paste fastfood establishment..
bad,hardest part of the job was dealing with rude and inconsiderate customers
bad,it was a little challenging at times but all in all its okay I had my days but I loved the people there
bad,"Definetely isn't a place i would go back to, unprofessional management."
bad,my typical day at work is to wait on my costumers w/ a wonderful happy attitude because a majority of my customers are on the way to work so I try to make their visit pleasant.. the hardest part of my job is trying to give speedy accurate service along w/ correct money skills.. I not only am at a goal of getting my cars out in 95 sec from the time they order to the time they pay I also have to make the drinks and give the correct change back the most enjoyable part of my day is to see my regular customers come in on a  daily and leave happy...
bad,"My typical work day consisted of talking to customers, taking their orders, customer service, inventory"
bad,"A typical day of work would consist of clocking in and going to count your drawer. and doing your daily duties you were givin."
bad,"A typical day for me working at Wendys was very hectic. Too many people on one shift, the order were always wrong, customers and team members were very disrespectful, and it seemed as if the manager was oblivious to it all. The hardest part of the job was closing time, the cleaning up was alot to handle. the most enjoyable part of the job i truly cant say."
bad,Fast food is tough but it taught me a few things professionally.
bad,Not enough hours. Store was very dirty an unhealthy environment.
bad,Working at Wendy's is okay we get our job done at the most some workers do complain more than they should but if you are about your money it doesn't bother you.
bad,"Good employees, fun to work with. it is stressful, the pay is very little, and no compensation. "
bad,"typical day was 3pm-2am. I learn that people have the right not to be harassed at their workplace, yet was unable to get any one to listen. Management verbally harassed me on all my shifts, co-workers would only encourage it! My experience at Wendy's on Landsdown Street in peterborugh ontario was terrible! thats all I have to say about this store!"
bad,A typical day would be dealing with some very friendly but also demanding customers. I've learned that doin a job that doesnt excite you or that you do not love doing could really affect your experience. Yhe hardest part of the job was to basically sit and consume insults from custmers who really don't even know your name.
bad,"Very low pay, no benefits and no real advancement unless you work for years and years at minimum wage"
bad,As a cashier I served customers promptly and with a smile and in between orders I cleaned and stocked the lobby and cleaned the restrooms.
bad,"A typical day for me was very busy for a person to be getting paid 7.25 an hour. I cooked all the food, worked the register if needed, swept the floors, cleaned the front lobby and restrooms, took out all the trash, and had to wash all the dishes before my shift was over. I learned how to work a cash register. My co-workers was ok. everyone was struggling and complaining about their hours and pay rate. The manager was mean and really didn't care for no one. He would send you home just cause he in a bad mood. The hardest part was to hold my tongue because I knew I couldn't afford to get sent home because I was already struggling trying to pay whatever payments I had at the time. The most enjoyable part was meeting all the customers that came and lifted the spirit and getting everyone back in a good mood."
bad,"Wendys on Kings Hwy is a unorganized organization, there are many times we will run out of small things such as ketchup or spoons. I am looking for a better work environment as of now. My coworkers are fun to work with."
bad,"Wendy's was a fast-paced, fun work environment. I was given the opportunity to work with a diverse group of people, while helping achieve the highest level of customer service."
bad,Worked there in high school. It was terrible. Worked every other day and didn't get home until around 1am every night. Management definately did now help in making sure employees were on task.
bad,Managerial properly trained but no to treat Employee Staff with Respect in the workplace
bad,unprofessional and unorganized..management has no idea how to run a store according to dave thomas standards
bad,"I worked for Wendy's my senior year of high school. I worked part time, and didn't have many hours. It was a busy job during the summer, because of Busch Gardens. My coworkers weren't as friendly as the customers, but I delt with it, and did my job."
bad,I was 16-17 when i worked there and I dont know how it is now but I didnt like working there after all my friends either left or quit do to the managers ways. I liked how we could get along and work but when we got new managers it all went down hill. They ended up taking hours away to where no one had any because they kept hiring new people. It became more of a waste of time then what it was when I started. The food was good but no one ever got along on the other side of the counter.
bad,Seems as if everyone was their own boss.
bad,"A typical day at Wendys is very stresing due to the poor management.I have learned that sometimes you have to put up with people no matter how they act. I feel the management was very poor because they did not communicate,they did not care for there workers, and they provide poor customer service.The hardest part of this job was knowing i had to go to work at a place that i did not like.I had no enjoyable moments at this job"
bad,Not enough pay and too many hours. It feels as if your breaking your back to get paid nothing.
bad,"A typical day at work always busy, have to be moving fast and making sure all orders are correct, if wrong customer complaint. I learned how to correct my mistakes and value cutomers.The hardest part of the job is to close at 3 am."
bad,"a typical day at work, why just this morning,i didnt even get a good morning from my big boss not that i ever do...i learn to filter machines.managements need to step up to the plate,i always clean after co-workers,the hardest part would be ,getting yelled at for what i think is bad training on teir part.the most enjoyable part is when im done, eventhough you can""t live on 4hrs aday."
bad,Long hard hour usually hot. Customer interaction great.Pay lacking.
bad,Wendy's has little chace for advancement. The only goal is to get your order completed and out the window in less than one minute.
bad,"If you want to be ahead in this employers eyes you have to be willing to put forth effort, and take critisicim well."
bad,If this your first job it's okay I guess. The management at the time I was working was poorly. The mangers at the time just threw you out to work. I wasn't trained right at all. Everything I learned at the job was self-taught.
bad,"understaffed made it harder at work, had to stress and work very hard for low wage. drive thru was always busy and we had no one to help bag the food or receive the money or get drinks. front register was the same as drive thru. managers spent most of the time talking and using their phones in the office instead of helping the team with busy times."
bad,Working in a fast food environment such as the Wendy’s I worked at was very hectic poorly managed since the day that I started. The Wendy’s never seen improve as in due time only seem to get worse.
bad,"Wendy’s is just terrible to work at in general. I got treated terribly, the pay was not great, there was lots of drama going on, would get talked bad on behind your your back and sometimes to your face, and if you didn’t stick up for yourself you would get walked all over."
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's is very fast paced, no bathroom or food break, and no time to relax. You are taught all the basics of the store and what is needed to be done. The management depends on the level of stress, because some of the managers are severely rude, unappreciative, and inconsiderate to your personal situations. The workplace culture has a variety of people, so you meet different people. The hardest part of the job is coordinating your orders and trying to make sure your customers are satisfied and make sure your moving at a good pace to knock the orders out. The most enjoyable part is interacting with people who enjoy your service and appreciate you enough when it's busy to know that your trying. If your looking for a job here, you have to have a strong backbone."
bad,lots of preferential treatment and newbies had to work late. was let go after cut my finger and was unable to work. most of the people quit right after i left.
bad,mangers are not doing their jobs. They to worried about them self. co workers are disrespectful to older co workers. Teens there don't take their job serious. Mangers treat teens better then older employees.
bad,Unprofessional to much work for what they pay. A very bad experience for me. They punish you for having your own opinion that can better the company. One manger spoke up and they took a day from him
bad,I worked there for six months. It management is horrible. It's like you're in kindergarten again teenagers are bulling everyone. Then when you say something you're in the wrong room it's just drama
bad,I worked there for almost a year and honestly was not my favorite work place. They work you like a slave and make you clean bathrooms and multi task for minimum wage. Barely gave any hours either.
bad,Fast food is cool for a high schooler or felon maybe but someone trying to get ahead won’t be satisfied because they ask team members for a whole lot especially the closers and they start people off at 7.25 or 8 bucks fast food can never hold at least 10 team members for a whole year because the job is stressful at times we get paid by weekly an it’s not even much and most employees have to pay for transportation that’s y fast food never satisfied me an I only work them temporarily
bad,Wendys was a horrible place to work. All of the management gangs up on employees. The managers make fun of their employees with disabilities. The management team made fun of me due to my limitations. I was discriminated against with my hours. I would not recommend anyone working there. It is stressful workplace culture. The food is not fresh at times. They do not do vacation days or pay health benefits.
bad,I was very unhappy at the way they treated me and being a manager with not that much pay was even the worst ever. Then they are in the need of managers and they get very desperate they start hiring people that don't know a thing on what they are doing as well as people that used to work there quit without notice and play to much.
bad,"Wendy's at 19 & Coachman, in Clearwater is not a good place to work. Favoritism is shown highly, and they do NOT let you out on time. I have a 6 month old and they knew my baby and my husband were waiting in the car for me every night when I got out of work. Several times I was supposed to get out at 10, but didn't leave until between 12 and 1 am. There's also no respect there, Everyone bad mouths everyone but acts likes friends when they're around each other. Nothing is ever done about it."
bad,"It was alright because of the people i worked with but it varies not every wendys had to deal with what i had to take on, such as poor management, unfair pay and so on."
bad,This job had me missed trained in my job duties. The commute to this location was difficult not public transportation to establishment when asked to transfer to another location request was ignored. Management was insensitive to the employees needs and was careless in maintaining company policies. The pay was low not enough could barely make it to work on the pay they gave let alone pay my bills.
bad,"If your not in high school or not retired looking for something else, got thick skin and can tolerate high school hijinks, this is the place to work.  Between the managers acting like kids and the kids hijinks, like a large daycare behind the counter making your food."
bad,"Long hard work days, kept busy and always on the move. The job is hot  and a typical wor kday is very hectic. the hardest part of the job was the speed and pace at which we needed to work at."
bad,"Correct comme première job c'est tout rien de plus."
bad,"Often under-staff, managers do not train new employees then become outraged when they are not doing their job well. However, many of your coworkers created a better environment."
bad,Management treated employees very poorly. Work was stressful and was an environment of people yelling at each other and people working long hours. Always asked to stay later on a regular basis so it wasn't uncommon for a 4-5 hour shift to turn into 8 hours.
bad,It will take forever to be promoted. The customers are rude. You are over worked and underpaid. Can be fired for any reason without much warning or explanation.
bad,"i learned how to make chill .how to work the deep fryer .,work the pressers fryer work the  grill. you  make $ 9 an hour , the staff is some what friendly"
bad,"A  typical day at work was stressuful especially when nobody helps or laughs behind you. I learned to not jump for a job i dont deserve. the manager what barely there, was irresponsible, and wasnt helpful. the hardest part of the jon was closing since i was always alone. the most enjoyable part was going home from this place."
bad,"On a typical work day, I would clock in, and take over for whoever is grilling at the time.  When the drive through and interior eating area had customers who requested grilled food, I would cook the food for them as well as assist in making and packing the food.  When the restaurant wasn't very busy, I would be spending my time cleaning around the kitchen, doing the dishes, or taking the trash out.  I learned a lot about fast food and how stressful it was, and more about cooking and making food.  The management I personally did not get along with, we did not see eye to eye on a few important workplace discussions which resulted in my leaving."
bad,Poor mgmt she gives all the hours to the new ppl that ends up calling out instead of giving the hours to the ones who deserve them. She also promotes the ones that hasn't been there long instead of the ones with experience and time.
bad,"I’ve been working for about 3 months now and I’ve asked several times to train me on another station and they won’t, they don’t listen to the crew and the few managers that are actually helping improve the working environment get fired. Absolute dirt management.I’m regularly harassed for my orientation  by the management, the crew (even the ones who don’t support me) still treat me with a little respect. I absolutely don’t recommend working here"
bad,To much expected of one person I one shift so you always spend more then 40 hours a week there. People never worked together as a team which made it very hard to work there.
bad,The worst part about Wendy’s is having to pick up the slack of the high schoolers. I understand they need jobs but when those of us that are adults and out if school have to pick up after them it makes it difficult.
bad,"Fast paced hard working job, I love the fast paced enviorment. The staff was friendly and had strick guidelines. It was a good learning experince for me."
bad,"recommend being a high school or entry level job but other than that its a waste of time, being called in on days off, no raises, managers not training new people and staying in the office all day. half off meals only under 10$ but only while being on break. worked as a part time crew member but worked over 40+ a week when they were understaffed."
bad,"Wendy's wanted to work you all the hours but do not want to pay you what you are worth.  It's a hostile work environment.  There's no reason to work there when you can go down the road and obtain a decent, self respecting, good paying job"
bad,I do not enjoy my workplace.  It is too much stress and responsibility for the pay. The hours don't fit what I want and the management doesn't seem to know what they are doing.  I have worked there a little over 3 years and nothing has improved. Bottom line: management and executives expect entirely too much from their employees for what little they get payed on top of the amount of stress it puts on them.

I have worked there a little over 3 years and nothing has improved. Bottom line: management and executives expect entirely too much from their employees for what little they get payed on top of the amount of stress it puts on them.
bad,"Honestly, it's a decent job if you're just doing it between jobs. Don't expect to be able to stay long. NOTHING IN PLACE TO PROTECT WORKERS! Almost got attacked though the window and I've been harassed by customers in the dinning room to the point I was too scared to do my job. I complained to management multiple times since our store was in a bad area as well. They took no steps to resolve the issue. "
bad,"over worked under paid, lack of company mission long hours middle of day , computer download a hour to close doing nothing place was a play ground at least that one"
bad,"After awhile they showed true colors. Very disrespectful. Could never find the manager when needed. And you got talked to like you was a dog. We wasn't allowed to eat, but let people in their family come in they was all getting free meals."
bad,Honestly the workers were hateful people and didn’t care about nothing . I had many situations where I would fear my life but still worked because money is a big need when it comes to me.
bad,"Other employees frequently slack off and don't do their jobs. The managers didn't ever enforce rules or enact any punishments on employees. Often times employees wouldn't do all of their duties and the managers wouldn't notice until other employees brought it to their attention and instead of having the slacking employee finish their duties, it would be left to whomever brought it to the managers notice."
bad,You’ll only like it if you can have a good attitude even when everyone else is in a bad mood for no reason. Good luck to anyone who ever works here. They will take advantage of you without a doubt.
bad,Fast Food is no place to look into when looking for a job and i would only recommend this job to someone looking for a temporary job of a year or less.
bad,"I was a cashier in high school and it was undoubtedly one of the worst experiences in my life. Very stressful environment which led to a decline in my overall mental health and my grades. In the 10 months that I worked there my GM only complimented me on a good job ONCE, all she did was criticize everyone while she barely helped. All they care about are their profits, the employees are just a faceless labor force. Would not recommend to someone currently enrolled in school. Co-workers were pretty cool though."
bad,"Very cut throat, management always in their feelings, had a personal vendetta against me for not sleeping with them, then tried to over work you, worked two years without missing a day, very disappointed"
bad,It was terrible the worst place to work and I advise no one to eat there my old manager drop a burger on the floor and picked up like no one saw and served it to a customer
bad,"The management didn't care that I was a student and would stiff me on hours because I couldn't come in due to class. Management was petty and would punish you for requesting a day off by cutting your hours for the next 2-3 weeks."
bad,"I don’t know about other Wendys but at store #990 the general manager is awful and she talks to you as if she is trying to be little you, she makes you want to quit on the spot and she also tries to make you work harder than your pay suggests."
bad,"The job is a pretty good job , besides the managers . They don’t take their jobs serious . The managers always playing around during lunch hours . They run off the line while we’re busy"
bad,"Working at this location was absolutely terrible. The manager would not work with my schedule and would schedule me on days that I had school for about 3 years, nothing every changed. I never received the raises I was supposed to by company policy, and when asked they would state that they had to finish the management raises first. Except they never finished them it seems."
bad,Most managers just sit in an office and do not help employees with rushes. Lots of drama and disrespectful remarks. Harassment tends to happen a lot there.
bad,start up and under new management. good environment. good employees. good job to mentor and to teach and motivate. very busy and challenging at times during the day.
bad,Honestly throughout the duration of my time there we went through multiple managers who all deemed under qualified. The store seemed to have been in a state of confusion the whole time I worked there.
bad,"The wendys that I worked at is terrible. GM made me choose between my dying mother or my job, needless to say I left. Wanted me to work almost 2 weeks straight while she sent our only other manager on vacation. Horrible work environment, do not recommend."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time at working at Wendy's and would not recommend it to a friend.   There was poor management at my location, but the other employees were mostly bearable to work with, too much drama between employees and management."
bad,"They need some to find what causes this bad work environment and re wire the system. Just because it works doesn’t mean it is efficient. The company had to change many things to save money. They didn’t consider if saving a couple of bucks decreased efficiency, which caused more problems that the staff wasn’t able to fully deal with. These little problems could be avoided if you make it easier for the worker to work, and not at the gain to save just a little bit of cash."
bad,"The job started of great but then after a change in management, things got unstable. Due pour choice in hiring employees, the work environment terrible. So as soon as I secured another job, I quit."
bad,My experience at Wendy's was less than ideal. My manager was mean and expected too much from his employees. It was too stressful and I never got any help with anything. The crew members were running the store while the managers really didn't know how to run most things inside of the store. It was an awful experience.
bad,Working at Wendy's was stressful. You were always being watched and you never had a minute to yourself. The management was terrible it wasn't worth it for $10.75 an hour. Plus they took away our employee discount.
bad,There was heavy favoritism and a lack of organization. Managers lacked professional presence as they behaving childishly on the job and often spoke to others inferiorly. One person would be expected to do a number of jobs with out support while others lounged around.
bad,"Not a good job. Fast-paced and discombobulated. Terrible pay with not much chance for advancement or raises. Management doesn't care that much. OK for high school students, wouldn't recommend beyond a first job experience."
bad,"Some shift managers were good while others did not manage well. For example, did not talk to crew members well/talked about each other. Gave some crew members leeway while others had to work harder than most. It was basically a who favored who type of environment."
bad,The job is ok but when I was hired I didn't finish the training and they put me straight into the job. They had not told me that I needed to have slip proof shoes when I had started. They also want you to catch on fast when learning.
bad,"You feel unappreciated and worthless working at this job. You try your hardest and they literally tell you ""im not gonna praise you for doing your job right"" but they sure do tell you when your not."
bad,Just a temporary job while I was in school don’t plan on going back due to being stressed and frustrated after work everytime I left only good for someone looking for a quick job
bad,"- keep area clean, food stocked, customers taken care of their orders"
bad,I worked the late shift it was part-time after school. I would say it is no different than any other fast food company it just was not my type of work.
bad,I worked at Wendy's Old Fashion Hamburger Restaurant over 36 years ago.  At the time I was a teenager just graduated for high school and it was a summer & fall job.  I have no ideal what the work culture is of Wendy's Restaurant  in today's work place.
bad,"Wendy's was a very busy place; always quick paced and sometimes that made for stressful shifts. It was a helpful environment to learn to work under stress, but at times could prove to be too much. There were only a few managers that I felt were actually involved and aware of its employees. These few were always giving challenges, constructive criticism, and making the shift a good time. The previous general manager before the new one would often belittle employees and cause negative energy. The hardest part of the job was definitely working fast-paced, but its an easy obstacle once you get used to it. The best part is working with people who make the environment fun and efficient and of course serving happy customers."
bad,"The managers were always down your throat. There was drama galore. I always dreaded going to work. Without some of the people there to keep me sane, I would've quit so much sooner."
bad,"I handled the cashier, front counter lobby, bathrooms and did the dishes after the lobby closed. I would be there until about 2 am. they were very unorganized and didn't have the best customer service."
bad,This job has just been super stressful and they really don't like working with you. They hire managers that have no experience in the food industry at all and it's just more stress than it needs to be.
bad,"While working at Wendy's the hardest part was having to deal, a lot of times the customers would come through there with an attitude but after a while you would get use to it. The managers there were very unprofessional and unorganized, sometimes I would work for 7am-5pm without a break. One time I worked from 11am-10:30pm without a break. It's very stressful working there."
bad,i would only recommend Wendy's to children first time job. Wendy's is not a job adults with families to take care of.  when an issue comes up at Wendy's it is not handled correctly. issues are over looked.
bad,"The Wendys management team was terrible, very rude, unprofessional and just plain mean. It's like high school working there maybe worse. I feel someone needs to step in and really take a look at management"
bad,Many of the employees are often rude and aren't accepting of each others different capabilities. When one makes an error usually rather than simply correcting them they are yelled at.
bad,It’s a good job to work at. You have to be extra customer friendly . They pay good. Leave your problems at home. You adapt to the environment very quickly.
bad,"Too much to do without right management.  District manager was more verbally abusive and demeaning than helpful.  Long days, long hours with no benefit."
bad,"I  did  my  job. But  I  guess they did`nt like  me to take over.But  I did my work ,pluse  others work.But  management was not rite if you ask me.But I worked as I could."
bad,"Great place at first, but poorly run by the management. Runs you down, hours are too late, working here just constantly makes you feel tired.  It is fast paced, so if you are applying here make sure you can do things in less than 2 minutes."
bad,This is not a place that you would want to have as a career. This would be a good first job for a high school student. This is difficult to advance into upper management although lower management positions are always available.
bad,"A typical day here would be taking orders, cashing orders out, greeting people, prep for next day, cleaning dishes. I learned how to handle cash and stress from lack of sleep. Management was good depending on who you got if you got a manager you were getting yelled at a lot for the littlest things ever. It was a good cultural mix at Wendy's. The hardest part of the job is running around the whole store doing everything you needed to do before you got off and keep up with the dishes. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and the staff they were great didn't matter what mood I was in they would always make me smile."
bad,"I did not mind the day to day task of Wendy's. I found them to be quite simple. However, Management was often tideous within their work efforts, and weren't good at helping their staff members. Low level staff handled management because it was not ""Priority"". This area was also located in a frequently burglarized town. This Est. just was not in it's prime location and I believe with better staff members & a new location this would be a good work environment."
bad,Employers are very cheap. No one received so much as a one cent raise in over a year. This is an extremely stressful place to work and they have very poor benefits.
bad,"This place was Bad to work for under the management that was in place when i was employed there."
bad,"Not a very safe environment, a lot of the equipment was broken/ didn’t work right. The managers changed peoples times so they didn’t get in trouble for crew overtime. Managers break into houses. The managers harass/ trash talk employees on social media when things aren’t done exactly like they want it to. The place is very unsanitary anywhere in the store. They had a gnat/ fly breeding ground under the front counter for several months and they refused to get it fixed and cleaned out because they didn’t want to pay the money, It was never taken care of."
bad,This job wasn't my best preference to work there.I learned the adaptation to run every station at the facility.I left to seek better opportunities and better pay.
bad,I hate working there. The mangement is horrible and so is everyone else. Working with the company has taught me I never want to work fast food every again.
bad,"Well there is no overtime there is not 40 hr a week , no benefits poor management they can't keep people they don't want to let you go on breaks the new district manager does not know how to talk to employees without yelling at them"
bad,wendys is a good job when you first get out of highschool. other then that i wouldnt stay my whole life. the workers were rude and inconsiderate. they forced you to come in on your days off or stay late when you were already working.
bad,Come In at 2pm leave at 2am good part was you work 5 days a week depending on your store my checks was always about 500-600$ every two weeks just no place for advancements hard workers are not recognized
bad,A typical day at work was stressful and fast environment. i did learn to manage my time. the hardest part of my job was dealing with co-workers some customers.
bad,My typical day at work consisted of working at the first window. I took payment for food that was ordered. I also washed dishes during my down time. I got my first customer service skills working at Wendy's. The workplace was really nasty. The hardest part of the job was trying to clean up after everyone. They thought their job was more important than helping to keep the workplace clean. I had to make sure i had slip resistant shoes or else I would have been slipping and sliding all over the store. I rarely dealt with management so i don't have anything to say about them. I didn't work here long but it wasn't a bad job
bad,Not the best and not the worst place to work. No chance for advancement in company. Co-workers don't work as a team. Management not helpful in daily operarions.
bad,"Everyone there was rude, Jenny in particular was a complete irrational jerk who cared more about herself rather than the effectiveness of the workers. Would not recommend."
bad,The management was not very good but you learn to make the best of the situation. You never know what they have to deal with so  you just do your job to the best of your ability
bad,"Cleaning up and catching up sanitation from the previous shift. I learn how to deal with diversity in different attitudes. Some management new what teamwork was and didn't mind helping the crew when behind. The hardest part of the job was dealing with lazy co workers. On the other hand, I enjoyed building relationships."
bad,"I would get ready to be Wendy everyday."
bad,"•	Efficiently handled cash, debit and credit transactions. "
bad,managers spit on burgers failed health inspection many times no chance for advancement foul language in front of customers gambling at work no health coverage
bad,A day at Wendy's was very stressful there was never a good manager there never anyone to work it was a mess. They had people call off last minute so then they couldn't find another person to cover there shift. We would go without things that we really needed for days. I would not recommend anyone to work here.
bad,A typical day of work consisted of being the person who did the things nobody else wanted to do. There is a rule that each person had to dishes 20 minutes per day but I was doing all dishes for at least an hour. There are many many managers there and they do not communicate correctly with you or others.
bad,"As a crew leader I was in charge of making sure everyone worker was doing their assigned job. I learned that not everything goes as planned but there is always a way around any problem within reason, The workplace culture was disappointing. the hardest part of the job was being the burden making sure nobody was messing around not completing their task. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the happiness on the customers faces once their orders were correct and nothing went wrong."
bad,"a typical day at work included prepping food, and serving it to customers. the job wasn't hard, it was the coworkers and management that made this company hard to work for. the management was toxic, played favorites and overall was very lazy and didn't want to help. The coworkers were all high school students, so drama was rampant through the workers."
bad,All food service jobs are tough. Wendy's isn't a horrible place but their managers never get a raise or advance in their job in any way. They always hire for the crummy shift 7pm-3am which stinks. Not the worst place I've worked
bad,"The staff is very unfriendly and they create a hostile work environment for certain people. The restrooms are not well kept, the crew eats food behind the counter, and they care more about their phones than working which creates a distraction. In my experiences."
bad,I learned a lot that i use in my cooking. But i felt that they wasn't good at giving people breaks. I would be working 10 hours a day with not break or days off. I just felt like that wasn't fear. But everyone was nice and mad it a fun environment.
bad,Worked as a cashier during all hours of the day. I was required to service over two hundred people daily at a fast pace.I was required to meet goal times.
bad,This job was very unorganized and the manager/shift leaders were not professional. Also the workplace was very stressful and there was a lot of shady things that was going on that I didn't see right.
bad,"Too slow paced, too easy."
bad,It wasn't a decent job the workers hardly pulled their own weight and there were so many things that were unfair and not clean.
bad,Deben tener mas concideracion con sus empleados y pagarles mas un trabajo q exije tanto debe pagar mas por lo menos en Puerto Rico gracias
bad,Wasn't really what I expected it to be but it was a kind & it was also an God experience working at Wendy's as a sandwich maker
bad,"I worked for Wendy's for at least 3 years and I never got a raise! I barely got breaks when working 6 hour shifts, the management was not steady at all and I worked at two different ones and both were just horrible."
bad,The overall company is terrible they do not offer crew employees any benefits or compensation also no vacation only for those who have been there for a period of time.
bad,"Management hardly can speak English. They hire anyone with a heartbeat due to the fact that everyone is always leaving. The neighborhood is the worst place to build a fast food restaurant, let alone have it run by people who can't manage it. The majority of the co-workers are delightful to work with, while others... like I said: got hired because they have a heartbeat. "
bad,"Didn't work as a team"
bad,This job was gust to get enuf time so that other companies would look at my resume other than that the job was minimum pay and the worst management this is a starter job and nothing more
bad,"Honestly I had the worst time working at Wendy's, the store manager at the time was extremely lazy and never helped anyone with anything. I never actually got formally trained to work on the register."
bad,"You never knew if you would be sent home or not. I would be sent home because of ""not enough business"" all the time, it made for a very uneasy paycheck. Management was ok, but could have been more friendly. Co-workers were great to work with, used team work skills very well."
bad,It was a good job but they will work you all the time. Other employees would call out of work and they wouldn't have a replacement so you could get off. Hardly get any days off and the pay was not so good.
bad,"A typical day at work would be busy. I learned how to multi-task and move fast. I also learned how to be patient and speak to people in a proper manner. In my job management was unprofessional and did not follow protocols. My co-workers were hard working and we all helped each other and worked as team in order to get the tasks done. I did not consider the job to be hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with people and learn new skills in order to build and use little useful things like, customer service, for my future career."
bad,"I closed so I work 5pm to 2 pm and wouldn't  get out till 3 in the morning at times. I learned to treat the customers as polite as you can no matter what. They love staff that can be real with them but help them at the same time. So give them what they want regardless. Management only cared about themselves. They cut hours, and barely recognize you were there unless your playing favortism. The co- workers were lazy only wanted to take breaks and smoke cigarettes all through out there shift. The hardest part of the job is communication.  There is none, you can't state an opinion or talk to manage,ment about anything. The most enjoyable part are days off when you don't have top look at the place and you can relax."
bad,"Minimum wage for WAY more work than they payout but still did what I had to do. "
bad,"Schedules could be very long with varying hours.  I learned allot about customer service, quality food,  how to schedule crew, inventory and cash procedures."
bad,The job itself is too demanding they expect too much for. Minimum wage job. No benefits are given unless you become a manager. The store manager miss towanda Is uncompromising to the employees.
bad,if you're looking for a summer job this wendy's will help you out because they are always needed someone  to stay nd work long hours so you'll have a good amount of money saved up for school or rent .
bad,Management was very poor and it is too much gossip for a workplace. I enjoyed working with the people who actually worked. The hardest part of the job is always doing someone else's job because they are playing around or didn't show up.
bad,rude employees and managers careless low pay for a lot of work laziness not very clean and very self centered you do not want to work here
bad,Management is horrible and I don't recommend anyone to work here. They will schedule you for a 5pm - 3:00a Which is 10.00 hours and during this shift you will not get breaks .
bad,"although they do hire people with no experience,its a eally bad workspace with minimal to no benefits at all. bad pay, few hours. you must do the work of two or three people at a time at most wendys everyday. in my wendys the management was awfull to the point of being the reason why i quit. i have heard of people working or that have worked on diferent wendys throughout the city and they have said the management is very bad in general."
bad,Wendy's was a good company to grow but not benefit wise. I got to meet a lot of different people while working there. Management was okay
bad,it was a ok job descent employees bad pay and horrible hours I did a lot of drive thru work and enjoyed the customers the managers was not considerate of the employees needs and wants
bad,"Very unfair place to work, GM doesnt treat employees like he should.Very inmature, LOTS LOTS of drama. No free meals or drinks, only water. No breaks unless under 18 even fr 12 hour days. Personal life is brought into work by managers"
bad,"A great place for young kids but not so great for those that are older. They don't really care about you, you have to go to work even when you are really sick.  They have no respect for their employees"
bad,"The work day went by fast because I was always busy, and even when it's slow you can always find something to do. However, I would come home smelling like bacon grease, and I felt like my pores were so clogged at the end of my shifts. Also the management is terrible."
bad,"You must come in 5 minutes before your shift starts, 15 if you're a cashier. If you work 5 hours or more in a work day, you can ask for a 30 minute break, or if you work 7 hours, you're required to take a break. Not too many hours, not enough pay. $7.25 an hour is not enough for the stress of the job. I did learn how to handle upset customers."
bad,The only part i liked about the job was being able to work to support my kids horrible management team very bad customer service attitudes where customers were not put first
bad,"the wahiawa store is always  under staffed. Favorites are played very obviously, and if you're ""unliked"" By management you're treated like absolute garbage. They don't follow the availability you provide, and take advantage when you offer to help outside of it. You're also lucky if you get a break, some days you might, others? Nope."
bad,"I took orders and did dishes for closing. I was over worked and underpaid, and when i asked for my hours to be cut to balance out my life. I was refused. the management started to nit pic me about everything they found wrong until i asked for a transfer, and was refused that also. I was eventually fired. Do NOT WORK FOR. the best thing about the job however was the connection i made with the  teenage co-workers. They saw me as mom and made the place a little bearable."
bad,"While I worked at wendys I had already knew most the stuff they were teaching me, because i had a prior job before moving. I worked at wendys in NC a much faster and more busier Wendys. This one had its good and bad days. being such a young manger (18) no one had respect for me, not even my fellow managers. So those were my bad days but on my good days when I just pushed through and said who cares you are here for your job and yourself, it made it easier. As a person I learned not everyone can be pleased, nor do I think I can please everyone.. Wouldnt it be nice cause I love to see people smile."
bad,the Job Wasnt up to stanard to Customers The Manament Wasn't Every worthy to work with To man oroblems with Manament Hours Cut for no other reasons. Staff was quitting do to Manament.
bad,"Worked for the company for 2 years, never was treated like an actual employee was told multiple times I would move up to management and never happened"
bad,Ok place to work if you arent on the closing shift.  Never enough employees but flexible work schedule. Perfect job for high schooler part time
bad,"Barely made it through training and I was already doing a million things at once for minimum wage. Typically minimum wage is fine, especially in the fast food business but the way management balanced the schedules of its team members and trained them was not fair. Prepare to feel overworked and scrambling just to make it through one hour."
bad,There was no Advancement opportunities. Poor management there was more bad then good here not many good things to say about this job.
bad,The management doesn't give opportunities to move up in the business. Employees do not take their job seriously. Customers are rude and so is the staff. There is no team work.
bad,"Managers seem to not know what to do, the food, for instance, is horrible. Also they take so long to even make a sandwich. Everyone is always lost and as an order taker you end up with the most heat due to impatient customers."
bad,"It seemed like a great place to work when I got the job, I seemed to be promoted to manager fast, but I never really got the title. The higher up (District manager ) had his hands in the cookie jar. He told me because I told on one of his general manager for stealing from the company that I was more or less going to stay lower level management for ever. The salary managers think that its not their job to help out when you'er in a rut and stand around in the office talking all the time. The employees were great fun and made the day go by. "
bad,I would come into work already hearing the bickering in the kitchen. It was not comfortable atmosphere by any means. The tension between the employees was unbelievable. It was just an all together disgrace.
bad,"This job requires very little skills, but requires a flexible schedule, lots of brand training and most of your coworkers will be high school teenagers or college students looking for extra cash while going through the school year."
bad,"My day comprised of trying to be fast paced and have hot food ready, but not waste any of it. It also comprised of me trying to improve my ability to multitask and work as fast as i can. Management there was crazy there and could use a more friendlier approach to help make things run smoother. My coworkers were friendly and welcoming. The hardest part of my job was the hectic environment. The most enjoyable part was having a break to go in the back to prep and listen to some music with my coworker(s)."
bad,wont work there again. it got busy once in a while.they wanted me to wear a headset but that interfered with my work. the lower management had attitudes.i liked grilling bugers. i did not like people with less experience in the food industry acting like they knew more than me
bad,"Was trained: As a cook for meat products and fries, throughout the day a steady stream of people came to eat, while at lunch time it was always busy."
bad,"At first the experience was going well, learning new things and how to truly interact with other. However, not to long after the work became miserable not wanting to come to work do to the staff and the management i will not return."
bad,"Your life is not your own. Typical day is ten to twelve hours daily, and your off day you are expected to check in by 8am, if your unit had call off's or understaffed you are expected to fill in."
bad,50% of the time your checks would not show up on the Tuesday you were supposed to be paid.They would arrive the next day.Sometimes if they were on time you would only be paid for one week and not the two week you put in.They said you had to be there with the new owners for 3 years before you were able to get a raise.I worked with the old owners for 3 yrs then a new ownder took over.So I had to be with that owner for another 3 yrs before I could get a raise.
bad,"I enjoyed serving the college students and getting them their meals in a short period of time. I learned how to cook French fries as well as making the different sandwiches. I really did not agree with how the management was set up and how I was taught, but I overcame that and learned on my own. The pay was not agreeable for the duties that was asked from me."
bad,"long hrs, no pay, no room to grow, no health care, i have learned everything about the job including management and still only make 7.60."
bad,"clocked in, worked whichever station you were assigned (i.e. Cashier, drive thru windows, cleaned dishes, sandwich station) for however many hours then you were done. Learned things quickly through other employees. Management was helpful."
bad,The hardest part is  being understaff  and workin more than 1 position.
bad,"Management is a joke. No one knows what they are doing, all they know is how to yell at their shift managers and let the assistant managers do absolutely nothing.The only reason I stayed as long as I did was for the people."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this for a long term job. They don't treat their crew fairly. we were short staffed every single night.
bad,"-Mostly Customer services/Cashier."
bad,Horrible managers. Employees are not respectful to customers nor co-workers.
bad,This job required a lot of energy. Dealing with customers on a daily basis was no problem. Learning how to make new types of food often was troublesome at first but by being persistent and taking the initiative helped me learn everything i needed to with ease
bad,"ran drive-thru. accepted cash and returned change, ran credit cards, cleaned store, and stocked items."
bad,"Wendy's is a great stepping stone, entry level job. It teaches you hard work. But it also teaches you illegal work laws and that not all companies follow the rules."
bad,fun work meet new people i love to go to work and see  my coworkers and best customers and see a smile on their face
bad,Bad Conditions and Bad Managers. But it is a reliable job and a good place to make some extra cash
bad,"A day of working at Wendy's is fast pace at certain times but in other timeframes the time period would drag out based on a day of the week. I learned how to prep food and be more versatile in doing multiple tasks at once. "
bad,undefined career goal  sufocating prejudice to opposite race and dangerous for cooking burns with no help emotions or therapy
bad,I was a sandwich maker since the day I started. I asked to be trained on other things and they weren't willing to train me. I didn't have stable hours. My hours always changed. They weren't willing to give me more hours when I asked for them.
bad,"I would unload truck, sweet parking lot, clean bathrooms, clean dining area. I learned how difficult it is to work while going blind. Management treated me very badly they always thought I was drunk even when I told them I was not. I was loosing my sight. Co-workers were not treated very well either the turnover was constant. The hardest part was trying to get to work safely and do my job well despite my blindness. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
bad,I Iam a closer so that means I have to clean floors  and cook at same time Iam very good at multi-tasking.learned how be a time worker an be fast. The hardest part is keeping all the customers happy. The most enjoyable park is meeting new people.
bad,"the 3 months i spent working at wendys were the longest months of my life, by far. for the first month, which they consider training, you are slotted into a position and taught cleaning and functioning in your position. after that you are basically on your own. management (when i was working) was always at fighting, and only reached a compromised when threatened by management. SOOOOOO MUCH WORK TO DO. for minimum wage."
bad,The Wendy's I worked at had management that liked to scream at their employee's and thought it was funny. It's an okay start up job but to be there for good isn't a great idea. Not very many advancement's within the origination.
bad,"Working for Wendy's has been miserable. My fellow employees are often rude and difficult to tolerate, and the hours are long. The work is not hard, but there tends to be a lot of it, not to mention the mental strain and stress this job puts upon you as an employee. You are often asked to stay late and come in early, which I do not mind so much when I am working somewhere I enjoy, and I did not enjoy working here at all."
bad,The typical day was fast passed always rushing. I learned not to work in fast food. The managers were good people to work under. Then you got ones that go on power trip and sit around. The owner are greedy and uptight. It was ways fun to work with my co-workers. I made some good friends by working at Wendy's.
bad,I did not enjoy my time at wendy's. Every time they are slow they cut their hour of the employee
bad,Not a place to look for a career at but great for your first job. 
bad,"not the best job I ever had, management was off balance , the GM was always going through new managers so never knew who was who. very disorganized unpleasant co workers"
bad,"I'm sure not all Wendy's are bad to work at, but the location I worked at had a horrible manager. Very rude. She, nor did any of the assistant managers help train me although I kept begging for help. Then she had the audacity to threaten to fire me because I didn't know how to do everything within two weeks, so I quit."
bad,"Easy Productive days , You get used to it once you get the hang of it."
bad,"Worked 5 hours a night only three to four nights a week. Management was bad and played favorites. Large stock order on Friday night that needed two people to put away in a fair amount of time, but I was the only person that was doing it, followed by a write up because I didn't do it as fast as the manager thought I should of. Co-workers were stuck up and unfriendly. Management looked down on breaks."
bad,"Cook and package batches of food, such as hamburgers and fried chicken, which are prepared to order or kept warm until sold. Cook the exact number of items ordered by each customer, working on several different orders simultaneously etc."
bad,"Working at Wendy's was interesting. During my first year all was fine. I enjoyed working there with a few of my friends. Corporate started hounding the Store Manager about making our store 5 star quality, so the whole thing started going down hill from there. Too many managers brought their personal lives into the work place, and those who wanted to advance didn't have the option. Training was done by employees, not managers. And the Salary managers sat in the office hiding from the customers, while talking down to all the crew."
bad,"I thought I could stand working in the fast food industry, but that was probably my biggest mistake. Working in Wendys was probably my most horrible work experience ever! The manager I was working under, very power hungry and cruel. Would not train other employees on tasks that needed improvement and made sure I was the only one doing things correctly, which led to me being yelled at a lot for little mistakes I could not control. I resigned after 3 months of being treated unfairly by the manager."
bad,A typical day at work will have you ripping your hair out and making you want to scream. I have learned many people are rude towards other who work in fast food and the people you work for tell you and theother team members that they are replacable. Also I have learned that even though you try to be respectful and turn in a two week notice that the dont let you do the two weeks they tell you that they are just going to let you go early.
bad,"Extrememly multitasking, long hours. Customers can be really nice or really rude. Thats for any job."
bad,"terrible job, i wish i had never worked here. the managers were extremely pushy, the staff were not in tune, and the headsets hardly ever worked"
bad,"This job is very fast paced and you are always on the move, i enjoyed my time there and friendships i made with my fellow co-workers at the time. The management wasnt the strongest, but i got along quite well. It was really hard competing for hours, most of the time a lot of people called out, which gave me a lot of hours but on the other hand only 1 day off."
bad,work when ever they told me to when ever they need me. cook cleaned cash stock
bad,I like my job but I can not life a producive like without steady schedule
bad,prep food
bad,It will start out ok but end up in noit getting pay alot they put a cap on pay at 8.50 no vaction pay the incurse is not that good they dont give good hrs for less pay they dont keep all there equiment working all the time the employees only look out for there self they will over look for you moving up in the company
bad,When I worked at Wendy's the managers weren't the greatest. I was often picked on and the working environments wasn't any good either. I was only able to work for three months because of these working conditions.
bad,"its like other fast food companies. smelly and frustrating at time, but is good for a teen to get some experience in food industry. I don't recommend this at all."
bad,When working a Wendy's its a lot for a little bit of money. No one is actually to respect you of what hard  work that you have done to earn a paid raise
bad,Typical day at work was miserable. They expect alot of work with minimal pay. They depended on older employee and allowed younger employee do absolutely nothing. The chaos was always high.
bad,"When you first start your job, you are already stressed to the max. Once you get the hang of it, it’s not as bad. However, it is still way too stressful, and for minimum wage, it is not a decent job. I get along with most of my coworkers, and managers may seem nice to your face, but once they leave your sight they start talking about you and making fun of you. Unless you’re a teen looking for their first job, do NOT work here."
bad,Did not help people advance and what they requested to advance. Requested to learn other positions and other people that were hired after me got to learn the other positions
bad,The store that I worked for was very quaint when I first arrived. However they became family over the time I've spent there. Especially the GM he was easy going and very understanding. However not all stores have a GM like this so be forewarned when you apply for a position with the company.
bad,Fast paced environment with little to no growth opportunities. Good for a first job or high school students. If the regional manager is good thenthe professionalism will trickle down and make work easier in terms of structure and expectations.
bad,It was a fast food joint there isn't much to say about it. Not much money to be made and it wasn't often that they offered you a raise. Management was kind of terrible.
bad,"Wendy's is just a pit stop in life as far as I'm concerned."
bad,Working in fast food is never fun. Working for Wendys isn’t going to change that. Although makes a great first job to expose some one to the world of customer service.
bad,"Needs to improve management, need more focus from office and help from district Mgr’s. Stores need to get cleaned up, staffed , needs to pay more,attention to the store service,  needs to show appreciation, needs to return phone calls back when u need them."
bad,"I worked at wendys in lasalle for a year and it was fine, the crew was really fun but some of the managers were really rude and power hungry. it was still fun though"
bad,"Working at Wendy’s I’ve learned a lot about customer service, myself and other people. I didn’t enjoy my time at Wendy’s because the management and my co workers weren’t professional. There were a lot of drama and anger, I felt like the management was encouraging it more then fixing the issues. In my opinion a work place should be somewhere you go to do your job I feel that anything more is unnecessary."
bad,"Petty co-workers and gossiping managers. Everything was personal. Managers worked poorly with employees about scheduling. Essentially, I quit because I felt like management was trying to find an excuse to fire me baecause of their personal issues with me."
bad,Management is inconsistent and is ran by favoritism. Rules are so relaxed they are nonagsistant. I think if there were more structure and less segrigation this store would thrive a great deal.
bad,"At first, everything was nice. I was getting good hours, managers were nice and everything. Then after working for a while, everyone started to get comfortable. The managers would curse at you for making one mistake, they didn’t allow you anytime to think about what to do next, they always had us doing something, we barely got breaks (and I am technically a minor), and there was a lot of drama between all of the staff.Overall, it just  wasn’t a good experience."
bad,This job seemed more of a job for people in or who have graduated high school looking to further their education. Hours vary but are set if you have a schedule conflict (going to school/college). Management has changed since I left.
bad,"There was ups and downs but management was always lazy, arguing with each other and ever taking responsibility for their own actions. Management would get mad at you for something another employee would do if you are unfortunately nearby."
bad,"Working at Wendy’s, I was already very overqualified for the job as is so I was promoted quickly. I was told I was going to be paid a certain dollar amount per hour upon my promotion and by the time I was promoted, that number kept decreasing. During my promotion, I obtained my paystubs and saw I was paid even far less than I was told yet again. They will severely overwork you and severely underpay you. It was a very disappointing experience because the fast pace of the job was actually enjoyable. But the company is run poorly and they do not appreciate the hard work the employees put in."
bad,"It is your typical fast food job. There is room to advance into management. Most employees that show management potential though are isolated by the other coworkers because they are considered ""bossy"""
bad,"It wasn’t an job for because I was living paycheck to paycheck it wasn’t enough for bills and other important things, and management sucks and the gm is disrespectful"
bad,Didn't really like it there the restaurant was nasty everyday manage managers don't know how to talk to people no protection just didn't like it I worked there for about a year or two and I feel like I was a good worker work very hard and I was fired for no reason I don't recommend fast food for a lot of people if it's not your preference don't do it
bad,Managers and crew are not respected by higher employees.. They never say thsnks for whats done right but always quick to call out what you havent done to specs.
bad,"Extremely fast paced and obvious that the store was hanging on by a thread. Nearly every week someone new would be hired and then I would see them leave later in a few weeks, main complaints being the management. Any higher ups that came to visit didn't seem to want to fix anything, man what a cluster of problems."
bad,"Management is never happy or satisfied. Nothing you do will ever be good enough, and you can forget about getting raises. It’s okay if your only bill is a cell phone."
bad,"Not a good place to work at all. To much drama, careless workers. A lot of harassment from customers and very disrespectful. Always having to do other people’s jobs."
bad,"This company and the management team didn’t care about my safety or concerns I had regarding coworkers on late night shifts, which was the result of me leaving"
bad,I was part time with full time hours and not the pay I also could not see my friends with only one day off because ThAtS ThE WeNdYs WaY they will make your life worse good luck if you join them
bad,I worked with the company for 10 years. I started off as a crew member and ended up an assistant manager. Thre out the years it had it's up and downs but the last year i was forced to move store. after that its been nothing but drama with the general manager she focus eveything around her scedual and the crew saw that and started to resent her making it harder on all the managers workinf therw it became unbearable and very hostal place to work
bad,Wendy's is an ok place to work for if you need a temporary job but other than that I would not make a career out of it due to the low income it pays and the little hours that are given.
bad,"Very messy for a fast food place, management was never on the same page and you just got thrown in, with little to no computer training or face to face training."
bad,Shift managers only make one dollar more than crew members. You won't be appreciated. And the customer is always right even when they aren't. Stay in school
bad,They take forever to move you up to a higher position and when they hurry they get alot of bad things going on because it' new people that dont know the Wendy's way. Which makes it's harder. Then on top of that when asked who wants to move up they give you the run around from GM to DM telling you that well hes supposed to tell u and well no hes supposed to train you. They need to get it together already and communication is a big key that needs to be addressed.
bad,a typical work day is a headache. I learned how to dodge things being thrown at me by the general manager. management only cared about hooking up with eachother on down time. there was no hardest part of the job because it was all awful. enjoyable part was the pay. if you could stand to work a full shift
bad,"Working for Wendy's was okay, it was not the best job. Then again it was my first job so I guess it was just like normal first job experiences. I personally hated it management was bad and I was always over worked as a high school senior leaving me with no to little time for homework and other things."
bad,I didn't learn very much but I was an ok place to work at. I really didn't like working in the food industry at that time. The management was just ok.
bad,Merced's Wendy's has had the same general manager for 20 years and she only hires family and makes all of them supervisors. there is a lot of special treatment and no career advancement unless you are related or friends with the related employees.
bad,"I was paid minimum wage to do other's jobs while they sat around and talked. If the tables have turned and I stopped doing my work for 30 seconds, I'd get screamed at."
bad,Wendy's isnt a job that you go to when you want to make a living. This is a terrible job and they wont let you work over a certain amount of hours that way they dont have to provide any benefits to employees. They are also very strict and wont let you work anything other than what they tell you. My manager specifically was terrible and rude. They expected me to work with a broken headset and to manage doing a few different jobs at once. This isnt even the best starter job that a teen could get. I dont recommend this job.
bad,"Managers are Ok , some are lazy while others are more hard working.  "
bad,"Pay is horrible"
bad,"Not flexible at all miss a day and you either quit or get fired, hardest part of the job was keeping everything stocked when other people would take all the stuff you stocked"
bad,i have worked for the company for a little under 2 years as i was attending high school and even out of high school and i was by far one of the best employees there. I was always being offered management positions yet when i mention a raise to my boss it could not be done and i thought that was pretty unfair. While i was attending school my manager would often ask me to cut school just to work and when i refused my hours were cut for that time being. Management is lazy throughout all stores as i have traveled to other stores due to my good work ethic yet they management was slacking. i would work 10+ hours some days and not once in the 2 years I HAVE WORKED THERE WAS I EVER OFFERED A BREAK AND WHEN I HAS ASKED THEY HAD TOLD ME I WAS UNABLE TO DUE TO LACK OF LABOR.
bad,"Teaches valuable lessons for a work place, but not suitable for a full time job. You will learn the basics behind how a business operates, but management is not invested in anyone below them. It is a fight to grow."
bad,"I worked there for 6 months. Over 40 hours a week. Highest trained employee at the time. I never got any bonuses, never got appreciated. Never got a raise i was promised. They treated me with such disrespect, i had no choice into Leave."
bad,"Only two of the managers treated employees with respect. The GM and AGM often spread rumors and insulted workers behind their back, insulted work performance, ignored availability and days off requests and were generally invasive. Compared to other fast food places I have worked at, policies are strictly enforced, and many are nonsensical. Free meals are offered, but that is the only real upside."
bad,Need Better Managers And People Who Actually Want To Be There To Work. And Who Wont Come To Work With A Attitude All The Time Acting Like They Dont Wanna Be There
bad,they teach how to to make sandwiches and customer service. really bad place to work at.  managers will argue with workers if stress out. the most enjoyable part is just working with friends
bad,I was moved to several different store .  I would clean one up and they would move me to another.  I was not very well trained .  As a manager I was trained by the employees.
bad,"Work place was terribly cramped and outdated. Managers were terrible with schedules and hours for each employee. Co-workers were rude,customers were disrespectful. I had to do multiple jobs by myself In short time periods."
bad,it was slammed constantly management sits in back and does nothing but eat the product meanwhile the other employees are going at each others throats and customers are not being treated properly.
bad,Better then my last job. But not much very ubderstaff company to work for. Made me work extra hours and not being paid for them. No bonuses. Like any fast food place I guess
bad,Not a good company to work for. Only cares about themselves. Over looks bullying from managers and down grade the shift manager. Caused me a lot of stress. Called me fat and ugly. Told me I need liposuction so I lost 120 pounds and then tells everyone I’m on drugs. I have major health issues because of the stress and bullying I experienced and definitely don’t pay enough for the drama.
bad,"Didn’t pay enough, refused a raise because coworkers found out about it from a manager and complained. Worked hard and wasn’t rewarded properly. High stress little reward but still alright for a first, temporary, or part-time job"
bad,It wasn’t that bad other than the pay. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone who isn’t in high school or college freshman lol. The wages aren’t for anyone with actual bills. Work at your own risk.
bad,there are a lot of things that are positive for the BRAND Wendy's. It's just a shame that the District Manager is not really involved other than email. The General Manager takes his title to the limit of General. Just a constant MICRO MANAGER. To explain to a person who if 49 how to wipe down tables and chairs and how to vaccuum is totally ridiculous.
bad,"Management often  has their hands tied by corporate. They don't have any real say on salaries or even hours offered. While some managers can be great. Some have to resort ""guilt tripping"" to get employees to give more of their time when short staffed."
bad,Mangers were rude and always treating employees poorly. They don't show appreciation. They take their frustration out on the employees and it causes poor customer services. Lack of communication between managers and employees.
bad,"Working here was not terrible however the manager was very rude and impatient during the training process. Working here is a good place to start and get on your feet for a good job, I would not recommend trying to work here and making a career out of it."
bad,Work you like a horse with no room for growth or raises.  I would have to do my job and the job of people who were busy on their phones.  I was not believed by management when a customer lied about me even with witnesses on my side.
bad,"•	Maintained front of store & restocked inventory"
bad,"I would just never recommend to work here. It’s a start for teenagers and people who needs a job real bad . I will say this, when I started working there the team I was working with was GREAT!! The staff after everyone quit and moved on sucks now !!!!"
bad,"My time there at Wendy’s on  Panama  In Bakersfield ca was the worst I never wanna work for  an unprofessional company like that ever again,the main gm was so bad they were the main reason I left."
bad,"Well when I first had my interview I was told that I would be called in a week after for the job, but wasn't called in until maybe two months after we had the initial interview. Then the G.M. made me sit through another interview and give her all the information I provided the first interview (Cell #, Name, Address, Time Availability) and I wasn't hired until a week later after the second interview. Wendy's wasn't all bad but I barely had hours and my checks would be $100 or less. I only worked Saturdays and Sundays and sometimes Mondays and maybe a Wednesday. I would often ask for more days and never got any.  The managers we're rude from time to time and didn't know how to speak to customers or their staff. There was a lot of gossip and drama. Around the time I was laid off for no reason I was taken off the schedule because I couldn't work one morning because of school activities (required to complete for graduation) and was never put back on. The hardest part of the job was when it got busy and this one manager would yell and curse everyone out, even the customers from time to time. I was made to clean the bathrooms even though it wasn't in my job description. I worked in the drive thru preparing food and drinks."
bad,"My biggest issue with this company is that they move managers around so often and they don’t really ask if it’s okay. On Day you’re working in one location the next they tell you you’ll be working at  another never once asked if it’s okay with me .they moved me to a location 50 miles away from my old store . I wasn’t the only one I heard about this since I started with Wendy’s 6 months ago and in 6 months I have worked in 4 different restaurants. The reason why is because they can’t keep their managers , they don’t treat them fairly . They ask also t of them and don’t want to give raises or accommodate for their travels . They expect you to fix their broken resteraunt with an unrealistic time frame .  The last store I worked at had so many family members of the GM working in it . Even the reagional Manager was a family member of the GM of that location. So their was a lot of people doing what they wanted and no consequences ."
bad,"Wendy’s, is very slacked. They don’t do something when they said they would, they don’t give you the option to have a good time because it’s a poor attitude in the back. They need improvement if they intend on keeping workers."
bad,The assistant manager thought she was God. She would tell me to not take more that 4 orders at a time and then when the orders were being made I would help bag other orders and then she would yell for me to take more orders even though there’s already be 4 not handed out yet
bad,My job title was a crew member I work at the back window with taking orders I also was crew chief I would place other crew members at positions for there shift
bad,This job was my first job and it was terrible. The people were nasty and they would do nasty things in Baltimore. You cab not barely do anything there. The customers always complained but the mangers did not care.
bad,barely give hours and isn’t organized . it’s not as friendly as it seem and they aren’t fare . you have to paid time off or anything . they don’t even offer hours if you have very low hours
bad,This would be a great place to work for if the District Managers would get their hands dirty when a unit is struggling.  There is no integrity when it comes to the company surveys.  Those are suppose to filled out by actual guest not forced on employees to get them done.  Results are fake.
bad,Honestly I did not like the pay or the hours. Also the management was very poor in making the schedule and we were always short staffed. Most of the managers were also very overworked.
bad,Terrible management employees barely trained me i was thrown in the lion cage and had employees from different locations come to the store i was at and they were always rude and disrespectful so i couldnt really Settle  with my actual coworkers
bad,Working at Wendy's is extremely stressful and you are paid minimum wage. There is grease everywhere. Store managers do their best to keep morale up but corporate leadership is terrible.
bad,There were many days where business would be so slow that I may have gotten 10-14 hours per week.  The management did not communicate and would yell off the handle quite often.
bad,they couldn't care less about any of their employees or management as long as they're making money. the benefits suck and the atmosphere is very toxic
bad,They will work you like a dog there. It was easy to get hired but once you get hired you are expected to work 8 hour shifts with no breaks with one of the managers. You are expected to do everything if others aren’t doing their jobs. You have to apologize to customers about the loud manager’s mouth because she gets mouthy to the customers as if they were her workers as well. It’s just not a healthy environment if you are looking to be happy at a job.
bad,They were not flexible with the hours I was always on call and never had a set schedule. Was always called last minute when I happen to be out running personal errands.
bad,Would not go back to this company!! management was horrible. there are no benefits. DM and all above are very unfair. Company does not care about their managers or crew!!
bad,I enjoyed the work experience.The only issues there was the management. I wish they were non-judgemental to individuals w/ comprehensive disabilities.
bad,"bad management, bad hours no compassion. do not work here. not worth your time, They pay you unfairly and ask you to do a lot. Go to Mcdonald's. anywhere else is better"
bad,"Once the new general manager took over the store, there was a complete collapse in communication between the crew and the management, and the communication was terrible before. They don't always listen to your availability and then you get penalized for not being able to make your shift. There were fake promises of promotions. I witnessed a manager call an employee something completely innapropriate because she was a young mother and was telling a coworker about pregnancy."
bad,"Wendy's wasn't a nice job to have. In my opinion I don't recommend working here if you want a first job. No one in wendys helped you, always rude people, costumers complain about what wasn't made right or wrong orders being handed out."
bad,productive. that i despise working fast food. some management was alright the rest wasn't. when i had one manger expecting a sandwich to be done under 30 mins. working with some of the employees that i had gone to school with was enjoyable.
bad,"Fast food work, face pace, long days, you stand up most the day. Very humbling and a real check up on life sometimes you have to do what you have to. Work"
bad,its just all over the place. the restaurant had no good management. scheduling was always switched. employees including management needs to take a customer service course.
bad,"My typical day at work was working long hours without a crew. I would close the store with just myself and a crew person. We would work hard together, but we always kept a smile on our faces. I would do a target and deposit at the end of the night and would have to write all of our day part drive thru times down."
bad,working for Wendy's was stressful and rough. my manager was not able to help me when i needed to reschedule or was helpful with teaching me new information or technology. the whole experience was not what i thought it would be
bad,"hours were never flexible, management was poor, not a friendly and non-judgmental environment.  always was under staffed.  very fast paced and stressful."
bad,"Wendy's was a terrible place to work as we were often understaffed and the one manager had serious anger issues. Most of the staff was nice, but they cared more about service time than quality/sanity."
bad,they never have enough crew to work in rush and I need to do 5 people job at a time and they don't see that. the management is very poor none of them known how to do a good job.
bad,"I would not recommend this particular Wendy's as a place of employment. The management is poor, they are rude, and may I say a bit lazy in work ethic. They start you with only 1-2 days a week working only 4 hour shifts each day that you work, this goes on for several months."
bad,Forgive me for being blunt but my experience at Wendy's was that of constant stress with an unbearable environment. The demand for work and excellence is too high for an establishment that pays employees too little.
bad,lack of training
bad,"Being a crew member at Wendy's is relatively easy.  You take orders, make orders or bag food.  Usually the environment is fast paced, the hardest part of the job is unruly customers."
bad,Had 3 hours of training before I was on my own. Poor management. Dirty. Lack of authority and detail. Understaffed. Did not enjoy my work experience at all.
bad,"very hectic environment. a lot of work, very little earned. no acknolegment  from management for life events. a lot of physical movement. very little pay."
bad,"easy work but not a top pick for a comfortable work place. To much behind the scene work, and unfair pay to the deserved employees. Poor management and staff"
bad,"The franchise Wendy's that I have worked in was the worst ever. Manager fratnizing with an employee and favoritism, was not a goo thed idea around other employees. Maintaining the store was the worst store I have worked in.. I, as a woman was maintaining the cleanliness of the resturant.  I have have done cashiers job for drive thru and dinning room at the same time when other employees go home at 1 pm. Not really great working there."
bad,good food but poor working conditions new ownership no long term plans to keep employees but would rather hire off the street and pay less to get their cost down
bad,Worked there for two years and never missed a day. Was late to one shift. This was due to vehicle troubles. Never written up. Though for some reason my hours were cut to less then 12 a week.
bad,When i worked there it was really easy but the pay rate was low and the managers would tell you that they are doing raises once a year but you will never receive one ever even though its like a .10 cent raise. Managers are terrible with working duties and gossip to much.
bad,try to work you like a dog  treat you like shitt you would think you would be a high salaried job the way they treat you in management 7.25 hour is shameful to say the least promised .50 an hour raise every year got one .25 raise in 6 years they could not keep help put a manager in charge only goal was to fire you local wendys here manager has personality of a witch that's nice? good was my manager where I worked ie managers appreciated hard workers and told u so
bad,"You worked all day with no break or sitting down also they dont no bonus suppose to have a raise every 6 months i just got one in 4 years the general manager is rude an inconsiderate about her crew am other managers.  You work 50 hours a week but when you go on vacation you get paid for 40 hours a week. Never have enough people staffed to work, never get off on time. I feel like its not worth it for a career type job"
bad,The mangers don't  care about you. I was in high school working for Wendy's. I worked part time but the company was so unorganized I worked the hardest and longest then went to school the next day.
bad,"There are very few good/cool coworkers, the other ones have terrible attitudes and suck at their job. some of the managers are cool and really nice, but the other ones are rude and don't know how to treat their employees."
bad,"Not too much of a career job. I will not recommend anyone for employment there for the simple fact that they don't offer any benefits or paid vacations for crew members no matter how long you have been with the company..You can not move forward with the company to succeed,"
bad,"The location that I was working at had very poor management, lack of communication, and poor training skills. Due to short staff and lack of training skills."
bad,"When I was just a crew member, I enjoyed this job a lot more. However, when I became a manager, the job just was no longer enjoyable. There was too much responsibility without the pay to go along with it. Being a manager was hard, but I was able to handle it. I just found another job that I enjoyed a lot more."
bad,"If you can not keep up with a fast paced work environment, I do not recommend this job to you. Management and employees are not professional at all..."
bad,Management was terrible and I had to leave because my dad was sick and they fired me for not being able to come in. The job was just overall disgusting and fast food is not a good place to work.
bad,"Job is alright, could move a lot faster and have better service. A lot of unnecessary conversations between co-workers that make that complicate the job. Simple job."
bad,"Nothing is every in stock, something is always out. The mangers a petty. Mangers also lack sympathy for customers. They don't care for background checks. And they do not give liable hours unless you been there for 5+ years"
bad,"Just no- it's not ever worth working there. If you need a job that bad, pick anywhere else. The higher managers (i.e assistant store manager and higher) don't care about you, nor do they care about if you have any emergencies that come up. It's not worth it."
bad,"The job itself wasn't bad, and I did quite well.  The problem was that I would be thrown around because someone quit and we needed someone to take their place.  They had no way to keep people for more than a week."
bad,i think Wendy's management was horrible she was very personal i don't think i to much like working with Wendy's they showed no respect  and also had a unclean working environment Wendy would but the last place i ever apply to.
bad,"Dirty Kitchen, bad managers, poor attitude in the workers. Speedy customer service though. If you want food it will be ready VERY quickly. I refuse to work for Wendys ever again"
bad,"At Wendy's I learned how to do everything. Drive-thru, Sandwhiches, the grill, and front line. A day at Wendy's Is a fast pace but it can also be stressful."
bad,"I worked for this company in TN and their management was inappropriate. Management wanted you to Flirt back with them and you can get the best hours,extra pay, best positions. But God forbid if you are engaged or blood sugar dropped and you are told to just work through it. I must say I know every establishment can't be as bad as this one. But I'll never work for them again."
bad,"Working at Wendy's isn't great. I did not get paid enough for the amount of work I did, I did not recieve enough hours either. Avoid working here if you can."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. The mangers wasn't to nice, neither was some of the workers. The place was never kept clean and it wasn't much team work involved."
bad,Working Fast food is torture. nothing is hard about the job its just getting used to the pace and remember things very quickly . The people are typically kids or older people whose never graduated highscool.
bad,The Wendy's I worked at had horrible management and worse employees...  I was over worked and never thanked for going above and beyond all the other staffs performance.
bad,A normal day at wendy's for me consisted of making sandwiches and occasionally working on the grill or fry station. I learned how to keep up with fast paced work and deal with customers.
bad,First off the degree of favoritism is just mind blowing. The is no equality at all at this store. The GM is a joke and doesn't deserve the current position due to the fact that she doesn't work. During heavy operation hours the GM's idea of helping out is to start cleaning the store as opposed to hoping on line and assisting wherever there is trouble. The RM is great though she is very helpful and doesn't mind lending a hand whenever needed. When I first got there I assumed the GM was the RM and the RM was the GM do to the levels of involvement.
bad,"This job has too much drama. Whenever the district manager comes in we had to do things ""the right way"". I did not know why we didn't do things the right way from the beginning. The managers didn't make the work environment comfortable when I first started. They expected so much from a new person and they don't even train you."
bad,"Being in management at a fast food can be very stressful. It was by far my favorite place. I maintained a crew of 12 people. Trained and managed. Worked the day and night shift. Covered hours that were called off, and volunteered to work on holidays, so employee's that had children could be at home."
bad,"There was a gender bias, managment came down on me for personal relationship decisions based off of their own emotions in the situation. Was usually a productive work enviroment unless there were conflicts of interests between myself and my relationship decisions with my managers. The vulgarity and disrespectful demeanors of management made it difficult to keep employees which made it harder for the ones who stayed, it also made me and others uncomfortable at times because it was bot professional. I was bounced around from all locations ranging from cashier and drive thru, to cooking, making sandwhiches, and dishes."
bad,"Managers are bad and unorganized, Wendy's is never really that busy but even so it is a stressful place to work. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company."
bad,Scheduling is all over the place. Management sometimes unaware. pay is too little and the job can be too stressful.  training isn't always done correctly.
bad,It was a very hard job to do. people never worked together as a team. not enough time for breaks. The management was unpleasant and everybody slacked on there work
bad,I think working fast food can be a good or bad experience depending on your personal preferences. I was over worked a lot and the management was not as strong as it was when I got hired.  Many issues with co workers and caused hectic work days when drama broke out.
bad,A lot of the rules were broken during my time there. Many of the cooks did not wear gloves. The floor mats were washed alongside the dishes. There was no clear order. A manager would use the employees at the store for orders that were never filled in.
bad,"I hated it here it was so unprofessional , and thats alot to say for a fast food restaurant. The managers are horrible they dont know how to run a business. There where many times that without me they would have been closed for the day."
bad,"Worst work experience I have ever had to deal with when working with certain managers. They're unprofessional and add their stress on you, as if it is your job to do their job! Sorry don't get paid enough for that type of drama. Also you get blamed for everything that could possible have nothing to do with you.. "" the employees did it, and its coming out of their pay check"" ( I overheard)"
bad,"Hard work was rarely ever acknowledged. The staff wasn't united or very friendly, and harassment ran freely between employees. The management caused unneeded stress."
bad,Typical day includes helping several different people from several different backgrounds with several different personalities. Great starter job for those who plan on staying in retail for a while. Helps you learn how to deal with extremely rude people.
bad,The Wendy's company is not a very good place to work at lack of communication poor management skills unsatisfaction fast food restaurant on a scale of 1 to 10 it's at a 4.
bad,The employees where some of the nicest people that I have worked with in years. All of the managers were really nice and accepting. Only one manager didn't show appreciation. Nice place to work. Even the guest are nice.
bad,Fast food is soul crushing work and you don't know till you leave. thats my warning. I liked the people i worked with. But tell the truth on an inspection and you will get fired with a phony reason.
bad,typical its busy learned how to work around people management was lazy and young .no real hard part to this job but i did enjoy the company .
bad,Not a Good place of business always forgets something from your meal when ordering. The wait is unbelievable two customers and 10 minutes later I'm still waiting on my food
bad,"Wendy's was my first job. I learned so much for example I learned how to work as a cashier,make sandwiches,grill area basically I learned all the positions and also worked all shifts to."
bad,"They don't teach you how to do anything, they just expect you to know already.  No advancement, very cruel to there workers and strict.  They make you wear a headset to hear car side orders."
bad,Istuck with my job because i needed the job.Ialso didnt want tojust leave them without finding a replacement....but one day a week a 5 to 6 hour shift at 8.50 an hour just does not even pay for my gas or pay even half of a utility bill....
bad,"Wendy's is a good start to your career life, you have a flexible schedule with a good staff. Wendy's is definitely a good place to start, and if your hesitating, do it!"
bad,"Most days I would come in and prepare the food stations, clean the grill and oven and scrub outside. After that we would open the store and I would have to do one of three jobs, either make sandwiches, work the grill or work on a drive-through register. All three jobs never end, we always had customers and it was always hectic. No matter which job was going on it would take a lot of focus and attention to do a job, since there was so much sensory input going on at once."
bad,"Its wasn't the best place to work, workplace was very stressful. Lack of communication but gave a lot of hours. Co-workers were really rude and it was so busy rush every half and hour."
bad,"A typical day at work wasn't enjoyable. I know that work in general isn't great, but working here is worse. I learned that working in a fast food restaurant wasn't for me. Management did nothing. They literally sat around all day and weren't friendly to us at all. My co-workers were okay. Some of them were a little out of control. The hardest part of the job was working until 3 AM. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the restaurant closed for the night."
bad,A typical day at work was to take orders either in drive through or the orders for the dining room. I would work non stop for at least 6-8 hours with not one break. While working at Wendy's I have learned to communicate and work with people better. As well as getting used to stay on my feet for eight hours straight. The managers at the particular Wendy's I worked at was very unorganized and no one got along. The majority of the co- workers I worked with were very cooperative and we worked good together. The hardest part of my job was not having anytime to rest and eat and the unsafe work environment (mainly flooding). Performing great customer service was what I enjoyed most about Wendy's.
bad,"Co-Workers were not so nice.  No training  Mangement worked very hard,  Customers were frustrated because the orders were wrong.  They did not help just make fun of me"
bad,"My very first job meeting people and leaning also building great customer services skills. learn sanitation ,cleanness ,learning to work at a fast paste also debit and credit transactions."
bad,"It is not the best place in the world, but it is a good first job. Management is often late for work at least where I work, and most people lack motivation."
bad,"Its Wendy's. Was decent at times. Not unfair, but nothing special."
bad,"The job it's self was typical of fast food work.. really fast paced, easy work, VERY LOW HOURS (managers have favourites) no breaks etc. However the management and employees are worse than any high school clique I've ever heard of! Crew members making others lives miserable, bullying to the point of one girl having a panic attack and needing an ambulance! It is an UNREAL work environment and not in a good way! They took away employee discounts because the GM was stealing money and they decided it was due to employees discounts. Management still gets a free meal though.. No perks for regular crew!!   If you have a chance to find a job else where I'd do so! I spent 6 years working there and it was the worst six years of my life."
bad,"The GM will make Employees use power tools to Modify the store, Sand or Water blast for cleaning, Fix pot holes outside, and force employees to stay when they are Ill and/or make them stay past there clock out time. TERRIBLE"
bad,"Wendy's is again your basic fast food experience. Impatient customers, managers who want more than what a minimum wage job should require and teenagers and young adults who don't really care as co-workers.Other than that its not so bad."
bad,"wendys was okay great opportunity for lots of hours. horrible pay rate. Environment of work place not good."
bad,"Fast paced for a couple hours is a typical day at work."
bad,"Not enough hours and when u did work the pay was not enough, the management  could of treated there employee's better, I learned that the beef patty's are really square and fresh there was a truck that brought them in every 2 days."
bad,A really nice work environment but the company did not offer any benefits or much financial stability to their employees.
bad,"I enjoyed the first year until new management changed everything. The work is a lot for little pay. The work culture was terrible. However, I learned a lot working here as a teenager. I learned how to develop leadership skills and how to work under stressful conditions. If you are a hard worker it is easy to be recognized and become a manager. The only downside is that if you are a hard worker they take advantage of you."
bad,"we work so hard for so little pay with no benefits , because they refuse to give us full time . the manager there sexually harassed me and denies it . which is the most hilarious part of the situation . but my co workers are very sweet though i got along with everybody even my customers"
bad,i loved the people but i hated work at Wendy's. My co-workes were unreliable even though they were fun to be around. Never enough works. Accountability isn't something Wendy's or the manger truly looked for in all employees.
bad,"While working here, I really enjoyed the fast pace as well as my co-workers. However, I was sent home more than once because our labor was too high. I would go to work the next day I was scheduled and I would find that we'd hired new people. I was scheduled three hours one week and told it was because we had too many people and had to cut everyone's hours. The next week, I was scheduled once again only three hours, we had hired two new people, and when I explained that I could not justify driving the distance to work for only three hours, my boss again told me that we had too many people and had to cut everyone's hours. I handed in my two weeks that day. The good things I learned when working here were how to multitask very quickly, how to keep track of different food stations as well as the dining area. Everyday was busy which was very exciting, the only difficult part about being busy was how small the kitchen is."
bad,"The first day I started it was okay, but after 3 weeks it got bad. I got fired because I had knee surgery. I wouldn't work here ever again."
bad,"Always keep motivated and always smile."
bad,"Working hard to start my new life in the United States started with working at Wendy's. Even though I had a hard time during that period of time, moving up motivation pushed me forward."
bad,I have 8 years total experience for Wendy's. This particular location is the WORST run location I have ever seen and I have been to 3 different locations. They wouldn't give me back my title as just Crew Leader after working there 2 years!! The new managers are horrible and lazy and I am doing their job and not getting recognized for it.
bad,"I learnt how to manage the people along with regular day to day activities. Also, I got a chance to do manforce scheduling and cost management and profit building."
bad,"stressful job with a lot of drama depending on the people who works there to get use to but the work isn't that hard to do, it gets hacked and crowded a lot, you have to be able to work at a fast-pace at all times, sometimes the managers are understanding and most time they just don't give a you know what."
bad,"Wendy's was for the most part a clean enviroment and would work with your schedule if possible. the general manager was great but the assistants clearly let ""power"" get to their heads too quickly. can be a stressful enviroment during specific hours of the day."
bad,"I don't like talking bad about company's that I've worked for in the past but Wendy's would have to be the worst company to work for. I actually loved working in fast food but the Wendy's store that I worked at was horrible. The management was never clear about job duties and we were always short staffed. A positive about this job is that I was guaranteed 40 hours every week which I enjoyed. My coworkers were lovely, but everyday complained about how bad they hated it. I am a very positive happy person and the workers were always so negative. I am the type of employee to work and do anything that I need to do to get the job done. One day I worked for 17 hours with out any breaks, and I was so tired but didn't complain. I reminded the shift leader or manager twice but there was no luck. But wait, that's not the worst part of my job. The assistant store manager started hitting on me and touching me while at work and during night shifts would talk about crazy nasty things that he's done. At the time I was only 16 years old. I felt belittled and so disrespected that I couldn't handle it. I went to the actual store manager and told her about what has been happening and she promised me that she look into it. I waited a week and nothing had been done. So I went to the store managers boss and told her and asked her if I could relocate but she said she couldn't relocate me at the moment so I quit. Once I opened up about my situation I found out another one of my coworkers went through the same thing with the same manager. He quit because he found out I told. He quit before he was even"
bad,"The managers didn't teach us anything, the workers who had been working there had to teach the newbies how to use the cash register, make the food, take orders, etc. A lot of us didn't get breaks like we were supposed to. Over all, I wouldn't work there again. I hope its just the restaurant here that's like this."
bad,"They were usually good at working around family events, etc. But lacking in team work, very poor communication between GM and managers. I would literally walk in at the beginning of the day to find a complete stranger working at the counter. The GM didnt feel it necessary to introduce us or even give us a heads up that we had a new hire. Expected to attend weekly meetings around 2 hrs each week with no pay. No retirement plan, health insurance only available at full cost to me. Was injured on the job and told I didn't need medical attention or even time off. I repeatedly expressed my concern about the continued pain of the injury and my inability to move the area correctly, I was afraid I might have permanent damage. Then ridiculed by GM in front of customers and the owner when he suggested to owner I ""wanted"" x-rays. Constantly made fun of and humiliated in front of customers and other employees."
bad,"The staff/managers there in this workplace are very rude and childish. They do not know how to get the job done without being messy, or instigating and interrogating others. I've had better attitudes and team work from my past jobs, but I am desperately trying to ween away from the fast food franchise."
bad,"Being a member of customer service which consist of many different types of people, personalities and emotions, i've learned how to consistent attitude and to stay positive."
bad,"Go in and they tell you what station you are assigned to. I worked mainly drive thru or eat in sandwich stations. I learned how to prepare a burger, make fries, manage a cashier, and about food wait times. Management was very strict and always threatening to fire people. Co-workers were very enjoyable and friendly. Hardest part was closing because sometimes it would take hours and hours due to lack of working equipment. The co-workers were the most enjoyable part."
bad,To work in fast-food is a full time job even if you r part-time. Always remember the customer is always right. Be prepared for anything even fries being threw at you
bad,I wiped down table in the morning stocks the front end and then apply myself to the registers and serve my customers. The management was poor and the hardest part of the job was dealing with the stress of the other coworkers.  I like running the fries and nugget machine.
bad,A typical day at Wendys is fast paced. The other employees were great however managment lacked in communication skills
bad,"The #1 thing I hated about working at Wendy's in Paducah, KY was the hours.  At my interview, I was promised a manager position and plenty of hours.  In reality, I was put on the schedule for maybe 10-15 hours/week, in order to make me desperate for additional hours so I would come in when they blew up my phone on my days off.  I never agreed to be on call 24/7 - I begged them to put me on the schedule so I would know when I was expected to work.  They refused, so I quit.  I learned the hard way that ""Open Availability""  meant you cannot make plans on your day off, and if you refuse to answer your phone, you get attitude from the managers when you come in on your regularly scheduled day to work."
bad,"I really did not like working for this company, maybe it was just the  exact one I previously worked at, but overall it was terrible. There was no teamwork whatsoever, I learned everything by myself, I even did most of other peoples job just to get something done. My coworkers would just procrastinate and text on the jib which was really frustrating."
bad,i have not enjoyed any days working here except my first couple weeks but they killed the joy i got from that. the hardest part of my job is putting up with managers that do not know how to lead
bad,"There is nothing spectacular about this job over any other fast food job. The job culture is often either high school, college, starting adults or older adults working and they are all there with the attitude of 'it's a job'. "
bad,If your use to mis management and mis communication. broken promises with little pay you go right ahead and enjoy that lol.
bad,"Nice place to work, but didn't like the General Manager. Cooking for them was good. Getting into an argument with management was not professional on their part."
bad,"Typical day on the job means to be constantly bombarded with complaints that can either easy be avoided by cook or costumer is just an angry lost soul. "
bad,"My co workers are always making me feel like I am below them, always ignoring me, and treating me rudely even though I try to be nice to them! On October 12, 2014, the shift manager on duty at 7 pm started calling me a liar just because we miscounted my till. When I attempted to give the explanation as to why it might be less, she would not allow me to explain and kept interrupting me and calling me a liar for an additional ten minutes. Then, when I attempted to leave the restaurant to go home, she followed me, screamed at me- in front of every guest in the dining room!- and humiliated me so much that I was so angry, I got physically ill that night."
bad,The shift managers were always in the middle of somebodies drama.  I have worked 10 hour shifts with out them allowing me a break. I never once was able to take  a break the entire time I worked for Wendy's.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of prepping food, making orders and cleaning the store. I learned how to operate the registers, and work in a team environment. Higher management was not that ethical and treated employees very different from one another along with making racial stereotypes about migrant employees. The environment was segregated among cultures in the workplace with some employees and managers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the unfairness and cliques among employees on certain shifts. Most enjoyable was operating the front register or front line communicating with the customers waiting for their orders."
bad,i worked at wendy's for a week and couldn't take working at the one i worked at because the management based how many hours you work on how well you perform the job and i worked at McDonalds for 3 years before and they told me i don't perform my job well enough even though i know exactly what i am doing and that is why i am getting less hours i find that bull there is nothing enjoyable about working here you get treated like a dog actually i think a dog gets treated better.
bad,"Take guest orders o the drive thru. I earned that management cut corners and cheat the guest out of food to keep down food cost. Management was very nasty and confrontational with employees. Most coworkers were lazy because we were under paid and not appreciated. Dealing with an irate boss who didn't respect anyone. When reported to her boss nothing was ever done about her behavior. Seeing and working with the few helpful, fun coworkers I had."
bad,i liked the job i liked working with the customers but the managers are not the greatest
bad,"Greasy, very hard to get things done. Management is lazy and all the good people quit."
bad,Learned friendly customer service. Gained patience and understanding. Kept a clean environment and dealt with cash registers. Learned to work in a team.
bad,"By the time I left I knew every position because I forced to step in and do multiple jobs every night. The managers wouldn't train the new employees correctly and more than half the time the training would land on our shoulders, us being the other employees. When its late at night and we got bar rushes, covering every position and training everyone in between because the managers wouldnt step up and help made the job a joke. "
bad,"Wendys was not the best employer. We would cook and clean all day and then get cut short on our hours. Have people urinating in the food. Customers were not happy, the managers would rob our checks. the hardest part was workign with harmful chemicals."
bad,"-cashier"
bad,"just like any typical fast food restaurant, not very good advacement opportunites, your stuck as a cashier forever, too many managers letting teenagers run their store, very little courtesy, sucks."
bad,"I gradate college in May 2014 with my associates in Health information technology, and I cannot wait to start the rest of my life in my career!!! Wendy's has taught me a lot it will be bittersweet!"
bad,Most managers are not a good influences to employees. They are rude and use vulgar language.
bad,"It was a good place to start getting back on my feet, but now it is a place of getting away with rule breaking, and only female employees advancing."
bad,"The manager there is very rude. He comes off as nice at first but he shows his real colors later. He really makes it tough to enjoy work when he's yelling all the time, calling people pathetic. He also like to gossip about people right behind their back. It's really sad for his age."
bad,"prepare salads, stations and sandwich fast pace and team work working together."
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's was clocking in and getting prepped for whatever my job duties was that day. I loved doing something different everyday. I was very good at every position. The hardest part was getting rude customers that wanted to argue with you, but I always kept my composer and always found a nice response to say. I was able to speak with my co-workers whenever we had down time. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making my customers happy."
bad,I was let go because i could not do my job as fast as they needed.
bad,"I was constantly on my feet, running around, following commands. On any given shift I could have been working at the cash window, the bagging window, the fryers or the the front registers. Everything was done by the drive through timer and we tried to keep the time below a minute for every car. The timer started when the car pulled up to the speaker to give their order and it didn't stop counting the seconds until the car drove away from the window with their entire order. We also had a timer for the registers on the front counter for people who wanted to dine in. Those times also had to stay under a minute. Everything was done in an assembly line and if anything was out of place or off on timing it slowed everyone down. My co-workers were very unsocial and it made communication challenging. Management was unapproachable for questions and learning anything outside of one position was not endorsed. "
bad,we had a lot of complaints but i think that customers only wanted free food because i thought we were great with time and food. little cleaning and some managers are not all that good.
bad,It was not fun and did not pay enough for how hard of a worker i am.
bad,"at the time I worked there it was badly managed, they would double shift me and work me all day without my consent. The staff was ill trained and would take forever to complete a task."
bad,"You do all the work, all the best, care about the store but doesnt mean anything to the management. No growth, no salary increase, no place for development."
bad,"To give a brief description of my working environment I've been established with the company for a total of 3 years this was my first job as a high school student my senior year and i valued hard work and money so it was a easy job for me to make my own income. After a while i received recognition for my hard work and dedication to my job with raises and more hours. Management working for my a corporate store and franchise both together sucked terribly I've worked with so many general managers who abused their authority from stealing money to other types of chaos bringing their personal life on the job including co workers I've worked with. Working for corporate Wendy's my managers valued my hard work and thanked me because i stood out from other employees with my work ethic like I've mentioned its such a easy job with basic fundamentals you just have to work at a fast pace. Now here is where my relationship with this company goes down hill i relocated to another state from FL to VA and the area i reside no corporate stores are located all are franchise. So at the interview my boss explains to me that corporate and franchise cannot combine although they are both the same company so long story short i ended up having to start my pay over to minimum wage, the management at franchise sucks you don't get any recognition for any work you put in you have co workers who don't put in as much work as you and still get the same pay you receive i really don't mind the work because it isn't difficult because of my experience but what i don't like about the current Wendy's I'm located at"
bad,"Take orders make fried products. I learned that i didnt want to work fast food for the rest of my life. Management was sloppy, co workers was nice, the hardest part of working is working this hard for minimum wage. I enjoyed the food."
bad,A typical day at work will be a hard working day and getting the job done.
bad,"Staff/ Management enjoyed their powers, a little too much."
bad,"There wasn't much stability, I got no more than 8 hours a week, the customers were wonderful but my staff treated me so disgracefully, I liked my job but I couldn't take the terrible hours an treatment."
bad,"Wendy's Ethics, Policy & Procedures need to be reviewed and observed by ALL employees and must apply to ALL employees. They don't protect employees of 27 years of tenure for hiring of new employees for lesser money."
bad,Good first job for someone in high school. Not for someone who wants to make a career out of it. Pay is not good for all the hard work thats involved.
bad,"Wendys was a great experience to work , where I gained the proper skills and teachings to gain future growth ."
bad,managers were more of a problem than a solution. other than that they were very fun and nice ppl
bad,I was a manager at Wendy's and there are not fair and they do not care about there employees or managers. I have a son and I am a single mother and they would put me on the night shift and I asked to be on day shifts so I could spend time with my son and they did not care. I hardly got to spend time with my son. I got into a car accident and couldn't work the 50 hours and they got an attitude that they had to find someone to cover my hours.
bad,No work ethic. Managers don't manage and employees get to do what they want.
bad,I was interested for the job at Wendy's mainly because it was walking distance from my home. I was hired under the impression that promotions are done from within due to knowledge of various workstations and that work hours are distributed thru effort placed in the jobs assigned.
bad,They have absolutely no benefits. You don’t even get maternity leave unless you are  manger. Their management team runs the store horribly. They talk down on you and curse at you
bad,"Everyone there was uneducated and messy , at first it was okay when I very first started but the managers need more training and the crew is always short handed plus the managers show favoritism not a good place for me"
bad,"Busy but the General Manager is rude to the customers and to the employees. Throwing things, yelling at her workers, and very disrespectful. A very hostile environment."
bad,"The other workers don't always do their job so others have to do it for them, management doesn't usually listen to the workers, ........................"
bad,"Worked 50 hours a week minimally, on my feet the whole time. Had a family emergency and job was threatened when I called out. After being offered a leave of absense, I only agreed to return if I can make my own schedule. In order for them to comply I would have to step down, so I did. After 2 months I was told my schedule was not going to work and that if I can't work longer hrs I'm fired."
bad,The food service industry if the issue. I'm not sure why I have to fill this out. My review will not sway people to or away from this job or this industry.
bad,"It was a typical fast food work experience, especially in highschool, I would go to work after school, operate the fry station, go home, repeat taking out the trash was a pain simply because they would get the most flimsy trash bags so you'll have to actually lift the entire trash can up and dump it into the dumpster."
bad,"My experience at Wendy’s was very difficult. Management was not the best , but I made do and worked to the best of my availability. Despite the problems i faced i did learn a valuable lesson from being there which I’ll never forget."
bad,"Manager was terrible while I was there, constantly yelling a degrading the workers. Made a real uncomfortable environment for me to be in especially as it was my first job."
bad,crew was nice till harassed then quit because management said I was at fault when they touched. I quit because they decided not to do anything about and some of the crew followed me out the door. the most enjoyable of the job was helping my customers.
bad,"Some managers don't know how to talk to their employees & too many family members work together at the bluefield, va Wendy's.  Wendy's need to pay better.  Not enough on the hour."
bad,A typical day at work is busy and I didn’t learn much at Wendy’s. Management needs improvement. Workplace can be a little messy at times. Hardest part of the job is making sure all orders are correct and satisfying the customers needs.
bad,I only worked at Wendy's for six months and I absolutely could not stand it. The management was completely awful and careless and the team members got away with whatever they wanted to and spent most of their time talking about the other team members that worked there.
bad,"job had bad manager, lazy workers, bad food quality management, rude customers, and very low pay, scheduled high schoolers too close overnight. lame job."
bad,"First and foremost, management was terrible, super disrespectful and they give bad hours, made me work 3 hours daily for a month and 3 hours never felt so long and boring, definitely wouldn’t recommend working here."
bad,"Very fast learning experience. Multitasking is a must, a lot to learn every day. Not much room for advancement, overall Wendy's was a decent job. Somewhat of a good environment."
bad,"The people you meet internally and externally are interesting. The job duties are easy. Management is not so great. No matter if you work hard, the management show a great amount of favoritism especially if you're related or the same race"
bad,Management was not good at all. The scheduliing was crazy especially if you had school or another job.  My co-workers were good. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers
bad,A typical day at Wendy's consists of sometime a good sometimes a bad day it all depends on the mood the manager is in I learned a little bit since I been there like how customer service works & also how to handle money
bad,"If you cant handle fast pace, frequent call outs of crew, schedules being made the night before new work week starts, inconsistent work schedule hours, you’re not very adaptable to situations, or aren't used to customers being rude to you for mistakes than wendys isn't for you."
bad,Proper traning would be nice. Never had the training that was needed and corporate does not care for employees. They do not follow procedure nothing is consistent
bad,The manager was racist and made me do most the cleaning and prep that should had been done in night shift.I felt like i was not being took serious. I got fussed at for every little mistake I done.
bad,I received no training at all I was thrown out onto a register on my first day by myself for a 6 hour shift. Scheduling was very inconsistent and my manager would use personal bias when making the schedule. I would not recommend.
bad,It’s fine some days but lack of good management and structure takes away from the job. They cut hours then expect you to come in when they call. Lazy/unqualified managers. Not enough flexibility with working different areas. They also take forever to bump your pay up even after you do the trainings.
bad,"Your advancement depends on if the manager likes you or not, alongside patience.  I like the work there, but it's super stressful on days you are slammed.  I would only recommend this job to someone needing something on the fly. 2.5/5 stars. "
bad,"the actual job isn’t bad. the stations aren’t too hard but aren’t boring either. not bad. "
bad,"I worked at the manager training store, in which all employees are exceptionally well at their job yet underpaid. Some members had been there 2 years or longer and never gotten a raise. Scheduling is always a nightmare- every week. There isn’t a week that goes by where someone doesn’t have to stay late or come in early or are asked to work an extra day, most of the time all of the above. I personally work sometimes 10-4, 11-8/9, 8-2am, 4-10/11. If you are not a set opener or closer, you will work different hours every week. Typically every week I’m asked to stay over or come in an extra day. Every regular team member works at least two 11-8/9 shifts a week if not more which is a miserable shift. There is a book where you can write in what days you would need off for things such as a doctors app or vacation which is nice, but never expect a regular schedule. You typically would need to work at this location for 5 or more years for a shift management position; however very unlikely for the manager training store- you would at least have to be relocated. Night and evening shifts are usually always understaffed and stressed especially during dinner rushes. I love ALL of my coworkers but the scheduling there can make life a nightmare for people fixated on maintaining a regular schedule/fitting a specific lifestyle, and chances for raises are slim and advancement are fairly slim and take a long while. Training is exceptionally well and working at the training store, and you will end up helping train managers without trainer pay. Overall, this could be a job for someone who isn’t concerned"
bad,Not paid enough to make a living not enough hours very dirty work for a very low wage only pro is that your meals are discounted other than that not very many pros.
bad,"If management changed, it might be a better place to work. Until then, I wouldn’t recommend it. Co-workers were nice enough for the most part, but it wasn’t worth the bad attitudes of managers."
bad,"Fast food didn't seem that hard to me, but it is very fast paced, very cramped, and overall a very horrible experience. My management could have definitely used improvement, and I couldn't even begin to find a place to start. The other employees were bearable, but we were usually all so stressed out that we lashed out on each other. Customer service obviously comes with nasty customers, but when it comes to working with their food, they are relentlessly picky and rude. The hardest part of the job is time management and speed. We were worked to the bone in order to get all orders out in a ridiculously short period of time, while juggling a bunch of other tasks, such as stocking and cleaning. It was really hard to keep a smile most days. I only really enjoyed the job because of a few select co workers, and the fact that I got a check at the end of the week."
bad,Would not recommend unless you feel like getting yelled at and doing things for other coworkers before you can finish your job and if you fail to serve your coworkers you will get yelled at
bad,"Management is just a bunch of fools. There's no reason someone in their 30s should be making fun of teenagers working the same job. They're also hypocritical, giving their friends free food while chastising those who work there for having free drinks."
bad,I’m not at all fond of this company. The managers were irresponsible and they were never reprimanded. Workers were treated poorly. It was nearly impossible to advance your position.
bad,"A typical day a work was just working at one station all day with only a 30 minute break even when doing a long shift. The management skill was not good, workers would get in trouble for not doing anything wrong.  You will not get out on time, if you were schedule to leave at 10pm you would leave close to 11pm on a weekday when you go to high school."
bad,I would take people orders and make the food and clean the bath rooms and go out in the lobby cleaning the tables vacume the floor restock the food and drinks
bad,This job is very stressful and empolyees dont like to work as a team. The manger has no control over the staff and the staff runs the store instead of mangment.
bad,"Friendly staff, flexible hours, discounts on food. Overall good work place environment. It’s a dead end job that i think is only really good for students for people who don’t need much money without being stressed out."
bad,"Most employees didn't do their part, so the environment was stressful. The other crew members would bring their stress and problems to work and get everyone else in a bad mood, making it difficult to work with a smile."
bad,I did not enjoy my time there. There were not enough pros. There was too many cons. Poor management and crew didn’t really care about what they were doing. Corporate had tot come in several times just to help the store get to an okay position.
bad,"I was payed well but it wasn't worth the stress and harassment I went through in my work place, when i reported workplace harsassment it was not solved or taken care of"
bad,My opinion of Wendy's would be that it would be a great job if the manager hired great managers who actually knew how to manage someone besides themselves.
bad,I worked there for three years with no real advancement. Started at $7.45 an hour and by the third year was only making $8.50 per hour. I couldn’t keep up with bills at all. Poor management and favoritism were a constant and just the work environment at that location was trash. No one there was ever happy and we were treated like poorly for the most part.
bad,The Wendy’s i work at is under staffed and under management there is no type of team effort within the crew or manager most nights it’s just a manager and one crew working from 5pm til 2am
bad,"To much favoritism "
bad,"Changes your daily schedule without notice and if not part of the social club is treated like an outcast.  Gotten to the point is to be silent, not care, and keep to myself.  Management is young and somewhat clueless.  District Manager is there 3 times a week because of them and that's the ONLY time procedures/rules are followed.  Thinking about transferring to another Wendy's maybe in Bangor (work at the restaurant in Ellsworth)."
bad,I never want to go into work because I dislike the job. It easily gets overwhelming and stressful and the hours are inconsistent. The hourly pay is not good enough to live comfortably.
bad,"Since I was opening my responsibility was to clean the lobby , wipe off all the tables and counters , clean my stations and start heating then up for the day , and stock up all stations with all appropriate condiments. After that I would officially start my 8 hour shift."
bad,"Without a doubt, the best part about working at Wendy's is the culture that you get when you work at Wendy's. Working with a good team of people can be very enjoyable. I had a lot of fun when I worked at Wendy's. However, that was mainly on the night shift. When you work a night/closing shift at Wendy's, usually it's not as busy. Meaning there is more down time. A regular morning shift or mid day shift was torture. My general manager was awful at scheduling, ordering product, handling employee and customer situations, etc. So, the management is poor. The work conditions aren't good at all. For the pay that you are going to receive, this job is not worth it at all."
bad,"High turnover, low training, next to no investment in keeping employees. Equipment tends to break or go missing, essential supplies run out, and stress is constant."
bad,"We had three managers there total. One manager, no one liked, another one some people got along with, and the last one everyone loved. He was the best!"
bad,The job I had at Wendys was a great beginner job. I learned customer service and many different skills. I was able to meet many great people. Promotions were easy to obtain being that a lot of people didn't want to become a manager.
bad,"It was a very poorly managed place to work. They would not teach anyone anything. You would get thrown onto a position without even knowing how to operate it. I basically had to learn everything on my own. The hardest part of the job was probably closing. That's only because no one ever wanted to do their job, so I would basically have to do it for them, or we would be stuck in there until almost 4 in the morning, every morning. There were no enjoyable parts."
bad,"When I worked at Wendy's, I only worked Saturday and Sunday and worked 10 hours each day  with breaks far too early into my shift. I do not recommend working here."
bad,not enough hours given and manager is a big mean woman who is obviously racist. you feel used and abused and you are taken for granted. the salary is absolutely ridiculously low paying.
bad,"It was a good job to begin with. The management sucked unfortunately, they didn't care what you did or if you needed help. The people there are good people top work with."
bad,"Worked for years with out growth in company, and no benefits, and only got a raise when  wage increased. Fast pace, with some slow days. Management called me in during a blizzard"
bad,there was a lot of drama that was started by management and had to be stopped by workers. Managers would take hours from you if you called in sick or if something came up with school ( i am currently in high school so it did happen)
bad,"Horrible management- although had the pleasure of working with great staff, and received 25+ hours per week as a part time student, the location I worked at in ontario was run horribly."
bad,"It would work for a minute..."
bad,I worked there for years it was my first job i never had any problems until the last couple of years when managment changed.They dont know how to talk to employees they slave you.Not all but most of the employees are lazy and always have attitudes my honest opinion corporate needs to take over before it goes out of busines. #justbeinghonest
bad,"Working there was a daily, or in my case nightly hassle. Half the time management didn't know what they were doing. You would see people get hired one day, and be fired or quit two weeks in. Just by walking in and looking at the other employees you could tell they've been through some stuff. Every night was a struggle to keep up with the demand of ungrateful customers. The type of customers that would drop and/or through food at you for messing up their order."
bad,I think that the overall cleanliness of the store was terrible. Management was taken over by crew members that think they know better. It was great when I first started but now it’s terrible.
bad,I enjoy working there with staff and some of the manager it was for you to be nice and friendly I enjoyed also doing cashier you have to be really friendly I'm really friendly app doing that and also you have to be quick and fast and that's me that's why I used to do sandwich and drive-through cashier
bad,Poor management as well as hours. There was always someone trying to take your hours if you didn't show up. Most of the other employees didn't care about serving the customers.
bad,There were no occasions where i enjoyed my job and the only thing I learned from Wendy's was how to use the register and  make frys. The hardest part of the job was being in the terrible work environment the managers had created.
bad,"Management can be a lot better, favoritism was shown none stop towards workers that rarely showed up and were not on time and rarely did any work throughout the day"
bad,"In short, Wendy's was only an extended temporary job to begin with. Now between the no foreseeable advancement options and lack of leadership I am forced to relocate."
bad,"just went to work "
bad,"I was took for granted when I worked at Wendy’s. By me knowing all the positions they used me to my best ability. I would have still been working there, but the general manager didn’t like me so she fired me just because she could."
bad,A day working at wendys is very fast paced with slow times in between they do not provide any type of ways to advance or benifits to their workers and are very quick to fire you if a customer has words to say about you.
bad,"being a part of the crew was great, but there was way too much drama that went on. Many of the managers were unfair and would play favorites. Also the customers ended up being rude and thinking everything was the person taking the orders faults."
bad,"By me being an employee at wendys, I would not refer any one to work their cause the environment is selfish. i have dealt with so many things working with them that it made me feel that working for them isn't worth it. it was even impossible for me to call in if i was sick."
bad,This is a good beginning job to start out with fresh out of high school or still in high school. Teaches you how to interact with different people and how to be friendly.
bad,I loved working for fast food but I don’t like how wendys treated me. I didn’t get very good pay. I would get screwed over constantly. And the employees do not respect each other.
bad,Wendys is not a complicated job but the management team and organization is horrible. Sometimes a person can work up to 50 hours and not have the sufficient amount of pay.
bad,"hostile workplace, the company can't make up their minds and stuff, store manager does not support their crew or other managers. Stress full, they keep firing managers and only leaving 1 manager till they find someone to take place"
bad,"They have poor management, and they are very slow, they're not organized.  When an employee needs assistance ad asks for help from the manager, they are hesitant. I had just started working there and they had already expected me to know their menu like the back of my hand. Wendy's is overall not a good place to work at, especially with a lot employees not speaking english, so their communication skills are not the best."
bad,"During my time at Wendy's I saw and heard many repugnant things. Old men tried to flirt with me, my picture was taken without consent, and more. However, management was the worst part. They were ruthless and did not care for anyone but themselves. They always made sure that they were well staffed during their own shifts and left everyone else with the short end of the stick. I would never work at a fast food place again."
bad,"Crazy."
bad,"i came back from, but i was texting my mom still then the manager ask me to give her my phone i said no. honestly no one should be touching your personal belongings period."
bad,I have been there for several years. You  get along with your co- workers very well. They treat you as family. It is an ok place to work. It can also be very stressful at times. If you like that type of job . it would be job for you
bad,I worked as a cashier. Taking customers orders and handling money. Some customers are difficult to work with while others it's not a problem. Working at awendys was fun.
bad,it was okay would I do it again no. too much no break it was super stressful manger suck. and wasn't understanding at all about me still being in school at the time and they waste so much food and that's sad
bad,Very demanding. I would constantly cover shifts and any time that I would ask for someone to cover for me they never would. The manager was rude and treated the leads as well as the team members with little to no respect and value.
bad,"My GM worked a second job. My assitant GM took all the best shifts and wouldnt share so I never got to see my family. They are always blaming everybody else and never taking responsibility for their own actions."
bad,The wenyds I worked at was in Portsmouth Ohio they didn't pay enough and I left for medical reason I was a cashier the whole time I was there but I started at the frier cook .
bad,Do not go to fast food as a first job. You will literally see what makes them so different in all the bad ways. Don't get me wrong it was fun at first but new management came then it got horrible.
bad,If your in highschool or college it is a good starter job. Career advancement not easy. Not a lot of teamwork. Shift leader thought he was god. Too many couples working together.
bad,The day I started Wendy’s I thought it would be a blast. My first day there I was so uncomfortable I was ready to leave right there in that second. Employees were very rude. The manager very unprofessional!
bad,"The amount of appreciation given is minor compared to the work done. Even with a sever injury acquired on the job, I was still not allowed to leave early."
bad,"The company in general is fine, but management at my specific store is a train wreck. We are all dealing with it the best we can, but most people are actively looking for new jobs, both those who have just started and those who have been there for years."
bad,was there when my children where at school helped get me back into the workforce wendys at Campbelltown has been closed for years did school hours 5 days per week
bad,"Not my favorite job. place was horrible, basically left alone all the time with not much help or training. management was unprofessional. on the upside business was fast pace and a lot of regulars you got to know."
bad,I would come in and not know what station I would be at. Management did not care about what was going on in the store and was very rude to staff and customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with customers. The hardest part of the job was to learn to make sandwiches and dealing with the names. I learned that many people do not enjoy larger people.
bad,Wendys had alot of younger lazy people there was no orginization wanted you to work 3 to 4 10 hr days no overtime no time and a half no consistancy then the next week ypu would work six days some 6 some ten some 2 hr shifts it was crazy
bad,Basically the only good thing that you can get form it is the food and probably funny jokes anything else is a 1 star. The workers can be serious when they want to but then they’ll start messing around again. I was one of the hard workers but felt disrespected and underrated because I’m 17 which is unfair. I believe that if I work harder than a person who makes 8.00 I should get it too but I didn’t even get a raise.
bad,"I worked for Wendy's in my small hometown and it was quite an experience for me. When I first started, things were fine and I was getting the hang of the products. As time progressed, the management wasn't the best and it showed at the restaurant. It made it hard for others actually working there."
bad,"For this to be my first job , this was one of the worst experiences ever. The managers were very rude and disrespectful. I enjoyed the culture of Wendys. The hardest part of the job was to keep a calm additude"
bad,"The team work was never there"
bad,it was stressful and expected a lot. I had nice coworkers that made the job more fun. The management was organized but overly organized. They made me do things that werent right.
bad,"Managers don’t know how to separate business from pleasure or outside life. They can be disrespectful. They are in compassionate to what your going threw in your personal life. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this job for a career job."
bad,Working at Wendy’s was a once in a life time experience for me. I liked it but not that much. Wendy’s is one of the most outgoing food places in America.
bad,"As i got to know everyone, it was fun. Besides having to deal with business i got to learn how to create a fun working environment and manage time. Also dealing with customers which is the number one thing for cashiers."
bad,The opportunity to grow at the Wendy’s I currently work at is very thin and that’s a huge problem. The hours I’m given is a waste of me even being there I wish management was a lot better I’d probably be one of the leaders in there
bad,"When the store manager, Derry, was there it was definitely more enjoyable. I had a male co worker push me in the freezer with him where he pushed me up against the wall and I had to escape."
bad,"Working for Wendys was very stressful, at the time i was hired they were going through a bunch of changes with the managers which led to absolute chaos ranging from managers not showing up to minors staying well after the time they are supposed to"
bad,The managers don't know what they're doing it seemed like and we're rude. Curtain people/manners were lazy and didn't help wit the mood afternoon rushes and no body listened to the managers
bad,"The manger was rude to  thecustomers , eveything was slow  , employees where rude , the place was dirty ,nobody gets a break even if you work over 5-6 hours"
bad,"The crew members are fun to work with but managers over there aren't professional in my opinion and i don't feel safe, emotionally when i'm on shift.  and managers over there tend to take advantage of your kindness"
bad,"It had its ups and downs. Fun atmosphere, but at times a lot of drama."
bad,My typical day at work starts at 11:00am. My first task is to make sure that all supplies are ready to serve for lunch hour. Clean the kitchen and Grill. Take customer orders from the lobby and multitasking to take order from the drive thru. Make sure that everything is in place and stack all necessary supplies. Keep up a great energy to deliver great customer services at anytime. Responsible for closing the store and making sure that kitchen is ready for next day.
bad,fast pace and stressful always moving never enough coverage to help ease any build ups not enough pay for the type of work demanded of you. can move up fairly easy just need to show the drive and skill for it but the pay does not match the 10 hour shifts u must put in for it
bad,"Absolutely the worst job I've ever had. When I started I was working very hard. A couple days in, I noticed I was picking up the slack of other crew members."
bad,"There is nothing worse than the atmosphere of working in Fast Food...Not only do you know you are serving unhealthy food, but that is what you eat most of the time yourself. Then take into account that management is often horrible, in my experiences they like to play favorites, and not with those that work diligently."
bad,"not the best job, if you need to find one elsewhere. my first manager was great then we kept switching them every few months and the schedule  was always late due to this."
bad,Wendy's was my first job. The management of the company was terrible and they were not flexible with hours. The management staff always were angry and took it out on the workers.
bad,Wendys provided terrible management which would never work with us just over us. Management would not help us but boss us. I would have liked more of a leader instead of a boss.
bad,it made it to where i ended hating my self and its to stressful for fast food. best part was going home. learned to clean and cook. as a typical day you walk in to clock in and then you are left with everything to do from the previous shift
bad,"The best part about this place was the crew that I worked with, a majority of my crew members were upbeat and ready to go into work that day even though there was a lot of work to be done as result of others not pulling their weight. Often times this lead to stations not being cleaned, terrible environments, and constant complaints from customers who came in earlier in the day."
bad,Never had dependable co-workers. Worked long hours even with being too young to work late at the time. Rude managers. Revolving door of employees. No benefits.
bad,the owner only care about making money for them. Everyone is rude and self centered. You have to fight to get any type of hours or promotions. If you are not an owners favorite you will not make it any where
bad,"A typical day at work: just get to work, and that's it. Just try to get it clean at the end of the day. Management didn't care about the workers there."
bad,"Don't bother, store management is very unprofessional, one of the managers screamed at me in front of a lobby full of customers for TAKING ORDERS, totally humiliated me and made me cry in front of the customers."
bad,they only put me on for 2 days a week and gave me a few seconds to learn the whole menu before leaving me alone to figure it out. 90% of the employees would speak in a different language that only they could understand
bad,"I didn't receive my first name tag until after the first few months. I wasn't even on the schedule for a while. And was called in as needed. Despite being full time. "
bad,Management was incompetent and disrespectful . The workplace was full of drama and gossip. It was not a good experience at all. It's got that as long as I could.
bad,"Long hours with minimum pay and no overtime offered, very conservative salary wise. Management is unorganized. No benefits offered. Typical shift is 5-7 hours a day maximum of 39 hours a week ( they want to keep you just under 40 ).  Employees get 50% off food and are expected to sell key tags ( seasonal ) with no commission. Overall it's a good way to get cash quick but don't expect to have any life other than work."
bad,My experience here was not a very good one. I was sent home or waiting for hours to clock in after a bus ride that took almost 2 hours. There was way too much favortism.
bad,"It's fast food. It's not going to be the best place to work at, but it's a job. Really though, if you have to work at a fast food job work at McDonald's, they give you free lunches."
bad,it was a job work place but need better management. I did drive thru fix food rung up customers food and help clean the parking lot. the head manger did her job but had a very bad attitude and didn't know how to talk to her workers
bad,wendys was a place were teens start off and become who you want to be. seeing new faces everyday was a good advantage and never bored me. the hardest part of this job was the managers because they were not supportive nor did they help out .the workplace itself was a good environment that I learned how to get over fear of anxiety by seeing new faces and meeting them. something I leaned here was how to work in a team and get the job done together.
bad,They don't know how to communicate with employees.  They have great customer service. They should communicate with their employees better and I think they'll be fine
bad,"Stressful, high pressure job, with little to no benefit or room to move up.  Management is shady and sneaky.  Compensation is almost never given, favoritism is abundantly clear. Putting wear and tear on personal vehicles and no money being given for gas. Hours are cut as a means of revenge by the GM (at this particular store).  Drug use and alcoholism run rampant throughout the store and company. President of the company is constantly taking away supplies and shelving/storage areas that make the crew's lives easier."
bad,I have never worked for such disrespectful and degrading employers. Employees are treated like dispensable trash and manager only lie to get their way. They teach the bare minimum but expect you to know all within a few weeks. There is more drama than in a high school locker room and franchise owner does nothing. General manager was the absolute worst and not fit to manage.
bad,"Fast food is a stepping stone that everyone, in my opinion, should experience. Typical day is preparing food and working with customers. Management feels a little distant. Hardest part of job is standing for long periods of time with short breaks. Most enjoyable part is the workers."
bad,"Working in a fast food restaurant, you learned how to be patient with the customer and also how to work under pressure. It's not easy at the beginning but in time you get to handle it if you want to find opportunities at work."
bad,The place need new mangers over all its a job. the hours could be better 24 hours. the pay only 8.25. I dislike the job but a teenager might like it..
bad,"everyday i am running a shift which i enjoy. But the problem is that, that's not in my job description. I'm a crew member but i work as if im a manage"
bad,"Can be very busy or very slow, managers yell at you a lot, crew members are mean. You occasionally get free food and get belittled for doing so because they don't pay you enough to support yourself and get mad when you can't."
bad,You work hard and do your job and the manager job and get treated bad. We we're only getting paid $7.50 and they worked us none stop with no breaks. They drunk and smoked weed will trying to work
bad,Busy in waves (lunch and dinner rushes) usually got little to no breaks. Most of the time I got one 10 minute break for a 8-10 hour shift. High turn over rate due to tense working environment.
bad,"Wendy's was my favorite place to eat but my least favorite place to work. The management was either nice or mean, no median. Really fast pace. a lot a learning and remembering quickly"
bad,Wendy's had no organization. Work schedules were never on time. Workers where unhappy because of working conditions. The building needs major fixes and updates.
bad,"My time working at Wendy's was one of the key components that drove me into serious depression and mental illness. I don't blame the company, of course, clearly, most of the problem was on my end. Regardless, if you enjoy having customers treat you like a human being, I recommend looking away from fast-food."
bad,"This was my first job ever. I learned a lot about customer service. A typical day for me would be to make sandwiches all day and if it gets busy, I would be told to go on the till to take orders since we were always short staffed. The management could have been better. They cut a lot of hours so there was no point in working there. The hardest part of the job was to deal with the manager who always yelled at everyone. The only enjoyable part of working there were my fun coworkers."
bad,"my first experience working with Wendy's wasn't bad at all. I worked at destiny USA, management and customers were amazing. my second experience working at Park St was horrible. That location is known for poor management. That's why i quit, and that's why they're always hiring"
bad,Wendsy's is an okay place to work. I met a lot of new people and had a great time talking to some customers. On a typical day at work it can be stressful because customers can mess up their order or employees can and they would come back arguing talking about we got their food messed up or they didn't get all their food.
bad,The management of the place would treat some of the worst employees with the most hours and best pay just cause they were friends. While I tried my hardest I was still given little to no pay with no hours.
bad,"It has been 11 years since I worked here. The thing I remember most is the terrible schedule. 4pm to 2 or 3am. Now, 11 years after leaving, my sleep schedule has never been the same. This is not the fault of Wendy's, it was my choice to take the night shift. Do not take night shift schedules lightly."
bad,"This is one place that is full of broken promises. This particular location could never keep a store manager for more than 5 months. One would tell you something, then the next wouldn't follow through."
bad,its alot of work with a fun crew downside you need a thumb print for everything so that slows you down greatly but that's a corporate problem drive thru is ridiculous how the system is set up makes it way harder than it should be
bad,"Pay is very poor but it is an income. Managers will cover their culos when they need to, and treat everyone of their employees like lesser individuals, but they will bend to you if you are intelligent enough. Customers can be such Culeros when they come to order for anything but every once in a while you meet someone who has worked in the food industry who understands."
bad,"Will over work you for 10.75. Very unprofessional, will cut your hours with no say. General manager is very rude and is very quick to fire anyone she dislikes. Workers do not like ti come in so they make it your responsibility to cover that person shift. And some daya you dont get no break because short staff"
bad,The management at Wendy's felt like the store was run by children more often that it felt like it was ran by adults. There's nothing more to tell all I have to say is that I will never go back there if I don't absolutely have to.
bad,"Just go in and do job nothing more nothing less. If someone needs help wether it b a customer or a co-worker help them out. For the most part its an ok job it can b a relaxed enviroment, but also chaotic at times."
bad,We had recently gotten a new GM and new RM & it felt as if they had no clue how to run this store. So many employees have quit because of this. I have been there for two years and it was my first job. I really hate to leave but if they cannot get this under control it is going to drive me away also.
bad,"The management doesn't make you feel like they genuinely care about you, the crew member."
bad,"I liked working ar Wendy's I actually learned Alot like how to work a cash register it tool some time when I first started but once I got the hang off it. It was Great & I was on the move everyday. My managers where like Family they weren't to tough on me they made things easy for me & didn't just throw me out there. The hard part about the job was dealing with So many customers at once & especially at lunch time & the lines get long, but I pace myself & work things out & still have a Great day."
bad,"The managers were disorganized and gossiped and had no regard for prior commitments (even when notified well in advance) and sometimes forgot they hired someone, never had enough uniforms, and frequently forgot who was trained on what. Sometimes employees would work 12 hour shifts, and employees only got breaks if they worked at least seven hours."
bad,"Each shift was pretty stressful at multiple times during that shift. I didn't learn much besides all the fast food things that i had to learn. The management wasn't that great, i had four managers during my time there. only one of them ran things smoothly."
bad,"Typically exactly what you would expect from working in the fast food industry. The most enjoyable part of my workload would definitely be my customer because I find myself being such a people person (especially to the regulars!). The days tend to pass in a rather tedious fashion,not that I had any complaints about the workload. Something that I will turn heads to was the lack of professionalism not only by the management, but also the entire staff. The hardest part of my days working here would have been the task of trying to focus while so much entertainment and extracurricular is occurring simultaneously. I am all for having a great time while taking care of my business, but more times than less it seemed as though the crew couldn't handle the second while prioritizing the first. Don't get me wrong I loved my crew and value the relationships that were brewed in my work space,but due to serious lack of effort I do not believe that anyone will catch me working behind the counters of any restaurant for a very very long time!"
bad,"the managers there are horrible. Most of the time they leave and do not show back up until hours later. The attitudes there suck , it is unbelievable. There is no structure what's so ever. I would not advise anyone work there it is just a mess"
bad,"Working at Wendy's was certainly an experience. The team were always friendly, kind and positive people. I learned a lot about time management, the benefits of a positive attitude and keeping a smile on my face even on the hardest and most trying of days. I worked at wendy's for about two years and I found the hardest part of the job was trying to provide both a quick yet friendly and reliable atmosphere for our guests. Management could be very pushy and not very encouraging which made working in that environment very trying and difficult. I love providing excellent customer service, showcasing my skills and providing top class results in my work but I don't think it was the ideal environment for me."
bad,"I honestly liked this job but it really isn't for everyone, it's always a fast paced environment and you hardly get any time for breaks. A typical day at Wendy's was rough and I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"Hostile work environment under certain staff. Little to no hours for part time employees. Dirty, unpleasant, loud, rude staff and coworkers that want to gossip and date other coworkers."
bad,The management at Wendy's is mixed with different types of moods. Some are constantly on your back they tell you to do outrageous things. They make you go on a break when you are busy but complain when you return.
bad,In my opinion they do not care for there employees well being or stress levels or allergic reactions to there santizer. They promote people who dont know how to do all positions while the ones who show progress dont get recognized like they should.
bad,"I worked there for about nine months and recently they hired a new manager, that myself and my coworkers find to be unbearable. He is rude, has severe anger problems and treats the employees with nothing but disrespect. He's the reason I handed in my two weeks notice two days ago."
bad,My time at Wendy's was alright went through a few general managers in my time and most were not that great.. people call out for night shifts and the day people don't try to get anyone to help. Almost always short staffed at night
bad,"Childish work environment, customers treat you less than, terrible pay, a lot of cleaning, at times sucky management, & stressful."
bad,Not the most comfortable or friendly workplace environment. A lot of favouritism. Not getting enough requested hours. Some very unpleasant managers and coworkers.
bad,didn't really have a good time was singled out of a lot of things. also the food wasn't up to date. typical work day was terrible I didn't now what to do cause they never taught me right kind of had to figure things out my self
bad,"I was fine with the fast food job and the hours and the pay, but when i was getting made fun of by the managers themselves in a different language, i cut the ties."
bad,"Working in fast food is always stressful, but I made the best of it. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I'm always up for a challenge, so busy is good. Fast food isn't where I want to be working in the future, but it was an experience."
bad,The management was very unorganized but they were pretty laid back when it came to getting time off. The customers were annoying but that's what you get with fast food.
bad,"Disrespectful managers,but overall great place to work.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
bad,"At times it was not a bad place to work and other times it was real stressful and unprofessional when the managers decided to act rude and aggressive towards me. They would get on to me while I was doing what I was told to do, telling me to do something else that others were told to do, while those people stood around on their cell phones. Miscommunication came into play often and eventually led to me being fired. I would call to see when I was scheduled and I was told one time and day when it was really another. My coworkers put a spider in my car one day and a snake in it the next. My babies ride in that car, if they had been in it before I discovered and removed the animals they could have been seriously injured. The hardest part of my job was the people I worked with, the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work to support my family. I learned a lot about how to do things I already knew how to do in different ways. My overall work experience there was terrible; however, it did not seem typical compared to the other employees there at the time."
bad,Management is horrible! They will hire anyone. They hire many people who barely speak English and expect me to communicate with them.
bad,"Unorganized"
bad,Fast Paced work environment. New sales technology and various personalities of co-workers. the management of the company can be rude sometimes and it is hard to advance in the company even with years of experience.
bad,"People were not nice"
bad,It is fast food.  It is exactly what you think it is going to be and you are not going to make any money.  People stay there because they are afraid to keep looking.  Work hard get nothing out of it.
bad,The hardest thing I have done so far. When there is only two people and the boss is one of them it gets complicated. Other than that she is really nice and caring to the children.
bad,I do not like this job very much but I do this for the love of the customers because they are what make Wendy's stay in business.
bad,At Wendy's I would maintain a good flow of providing customers their food in a honorable time with positive and flamboyant customer service. I learned that its not always about the job that can make you love what your doing but about the confidence and the feedback your getting from doing you do under any circumstance. Management and co-workers never got the concept to just do their job so no confusion ever took place. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a positive flow because of the lack of professionalism within management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Making me have a better day throughout my job duties and shift. The customers gave me the reason on how no matter what I was doing my job well.
bad,Hectic and chaotic work environment. Learned that you cannot trust anyone and to always second guess yourself. The other managers with were very deceitful and untrustworthy. Crew was always the highlight of every shift I Managed. The hardest part of my job was handling embarrassing customer complaints.
bad,fast food with long hours on your feet for little pay. accuracy and timing is needed. the people you work with helps get you through
bad,My experience is that the managers and coworkers did not care that they were there to make money. They take the job for granted and think no repressions will come of it. I did my job right an safely and when i needed help and didn't get it i went the manager and was disciplined for coming to the manager with a problem.
bad,They are slow to advance workers in the work area. You learn to work with customers and employees. Learn something new or different everyday.
bad,"I would take peoples orders and be at the register and would stock things and clean a lot, the co workers were ok, didn't say much really, there was really no hard part of the job."
bad,"I have worked for this company twice. The first time, the management was pretty good, and my co-workers were very nice and teamwork was encouraged. Now, we're under new management and it's terrible. Most of the co-workers don't respect the managers. We've had several people just up and walk out. There's no cooperation. Management doesn't listen to people when it comes to scheduling. If you're going through something, there's not leeway. Managers play favorites by allowing some employees to do stuff, but not allowing others to do the same thing (i.e. taking food home without having to pay for it). This is just some of the many reasons why I am looking for another position with a different company."
bad,I learned a lot from a few managers who cared about the company and their store with how to manage better to how to have a great business with happy co workers. They learning system was to me not the best but its effective. I defiantly understand how they got their reviews by working their.
bad,"it was disgusting, there was no advancement the managers varied but were usually not the best, the coworkers were great but the managers would constantlly hire people who could not do their jobs"
bad,Wendy's started out fun. However there were things going on that i did not fully agree with such as the actions of the district manager and the way the management company decided to handle things.
bad,Only good if you're just graduating high school and are looking for basic work skills and multi tasking experience. Only good for basic customer experience and diversity of traffic flow.
bad,Okay place to work for those who need a quick job and must be on their feet as soon as possible. A typical day at works just like every fast foods restaurant involves lots of communication with those in your workplace.
bad,"- typically management is paid so low that they have trouble keeping good help. 12 dollars an hour to be a manager. It's not worth it at all. Hours are long and the District manager is breathing down your neck constantly. This is not a job I recommend for anyone over the age of 20, even for managers."
bad,"I was told they can make me work 1 hr a day on the note that should tell the rest. I learn how to work with customers the management was ok. Co-worker ok and the hardest parts was dealing with a manager, other then that i enjoy my time there."
bad,"Wendy's is a great place to start off at, but as you get older, it gets boring. Working there makes time go by fast due to heavy volumes."
bad,i worked the cash registry and placed orders.working at wendy's i learned how to operate the cash register and how to order and stock.Learned the proper way to store and stock items.
bad,My very favorite part of the job was the customer interaction I had. I also enjoyed my co-workers. Prep was an enjoyable experience.
bad,Everyday There was a new problem. Customers constantly complaining about wrong orders being wrong and the management was horrible. I'm not saying every Wendy's is like that but the one I worked at was horrible.
bad,"A typical day for me would be to come into work to prep in the am or to go in at night and make sandwiches.This job had taught me nothing really. The management was very manipulative, they would say things that would make you have to work on days you couldn't or that you may have not been scheduled for, i.e they would say things like if you don't come in for the person who called out i don't know how many hours you'll be getting next week. My co-workers were outstanding and very hard working. The hardest part of the job was when a rush came sometimes i wouldn't see a manager come to the line and help. The most enjoyable part of my job was doing the transactions at the back window with the costumers."
bad,"Working at Wendy's was probably the worst job I have had. The managers were extremely lazy and always had a habit of blaming me for other peoples mistakes just because I was new. As soon as I started getting better, they cut my hours and only worked me maybe one day a week and had me 'on call' for the rest of the week. The food quality was good, and other than the management, the employees were very nice and supportive. But other than that everything else was absolutely horrible. Not to mention my first day I went to work my jacket was stolen and luckily I didn't have my wallet in it. After a while my name wasn't even on the schedule anymore. I'm hoping to get a supportive job soon so I can quit this career."
bad,"Promise of semi annual raises and upward mobility that are never fulfilled. Incompetent and unpleasant management. Inconsistent hours and sudden schedule changes with sometimes less than a day notice, including cutting shifts only 45 minutes in to ""save on labor"". Frequently asked to do work not in my job description (repair equipment, operate heavy machinery)."
bad,"Every Wendy's is different so I am speaking for the one on Stirling and palm avenue, go some place else! fair warning from me, doing three positions and more some days for 7.93 (MINIMUM WAGE) with a five cent raise every 6 months. Run far away from here with your resume and go to any place like publix that has benefits."
bad,"This is an okay place, to work if you are Under 18. And are in High School, before going to College. However after 18, it's not worth it. Assuming that everyone goes to college, to find better and also actual real jobs, that pay actual money."
bad,"I only worked there for four years because it got me through college. If you're looking for a job that can be flexible or if you enjoy smelling like grease when you go home you might be interested. It's also easy to transfer to other stores too. (I worked at 2 Wendy's during college.)"
bad,"Wendy was my first 'real' job. I worked until school started. I wouldn't eat there if i were you. Is all i have to say about that place, on record."
bad,I remember this day at work it was July 4th year 2012. This was one of our busiest days on the drive-thru . All off the crew was working as a team helping each other out trying to finish everything within 40 sec for every order.  We met our goal the only hard part of it has having trouble understanding customer over the speaker due to the fireworks.
bad,"in the time I worked at this particular wendys we have 5 general managers.  This would have been an amazing store to work at if there were bosses that knew what they were doing and trained their employees correctly. All in all this place could have been much worse, but no two bosses are the same and this place was no different. It was hard to get used to one manager when you had 5 general managers who brought something different into the situation every time, and would shift the already existing managers to and fro or fire them and hire on ones that could not do their jobs correctly. When I left they were changing general managers again, so I can not say much about the store in it's current state."
bad,Women dominated the culture. That only became a problem because of employee discipline. They rather just have a body in the building to work instead of teaching good moral business practices. My location got robbed because of bad hiring practices. Wendy's is the typical fast food environment. Little professionalism coupled with a corporate system spells disaster
bad,"Typical day at work would be as expected. Preparing food, serving customers, keeping the place clean, taking orders, etc. Far from the most pleasant experience, but still an experience I believe that many should have."
bad,"Mostly busy work, co-workers were quite friendly. Learned a great deal about how to handle a variety of customers. Gave me a lot of experience dealing with stressful situations and difficult tasks."
bad,"I feel that working at wendys was a very strong hassle in my life, The managers picked favorites, and made the schedule basing on who they like the best, in reality they had to pick the hottest girl they wanted working and cut others hours. A typical day of work was very stressful because of that fact."
bad,"A typical day at Wendys was always a challenge. Meeting the needs of the customer and their requests for food to be made a specific way. I learned a lot working in the fast food paced environment. Multi-tasking is something you have to be good at. Working the registers was an on-going battle with all of our promotions and the changes that occurred daily. Management was very helpful. When I had questions, and was unsure about something, I asked and made sure it was handled appropriately. At times there would be complaints of something, and that was probably the hardest thing about working fast food. There were fellow employees who would pitch in when I was swamped, and I enjoyed the help very much. I enjoyed working for Wendys, learning what it was like has led me to understand how frustrating even the simplest of things can become."
bad,"I mostly worked register but there are many positions like I also did drive thru taking oders and passing the food out or back cash where the costumers paid and also was responsible for doing dishes, always making sure dinning room was stocked and cleaned. The hardest part when working there is big orders and a line out the door. The  most enjoyable part is the people I work with."
bad,My days for working at wendy's would be random nothing crazy. I learned that not all employees do their job correctly and call-off frequently and the management isn't firm and strict. Some of my co-workers get along with me very well. The hardest part of my job is when the store is busy we have no staff due to the fact that people call off. The most enjoyable part of my job is putting a smile on customers faces.
bad,"Great place to grow in the fast food chain, but it depends on which Wendy's you want to work at. Management at the Wendys I worked at was horrible."
bad,"DO NOT WORK HERE. If you are pregnant, do not work here. You will be subjected to lift heavy equipment and don't get me started on breaks, they don't believe in breaks. I was 3 months pregnant and I had really bad morning sickness and had to vomit on duty. So I ran to restroom and was in their for about 5 minutes. I went back to wash dishes and vomited in the trash can by the sink. The general manager came out the office and told me that I couldnt throw up in trash can. I told her that I couldnt make it and my condition and she waved me off. Im surprised that I didnt have a miscarriage because they also had me lifting heavy equipment. They hired teenagers that didn't really care about the customer. There is no good part of the job because all the good managers switched job locations."
bad,We took old fill out and put new fill in the place So that it could cool the water. The workers were mostley Indians and Mexicans
bad,"A regular workplace, management was nice, my co workers were always great the hardest part of the job was the hours, the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet new people"
bad,"Clock in, clean all the tables, counter, doors, greet customers, take and fill orders. "
bad,"above all Wendy's gave me a backbone, this was my first job so I learned a lot over the 6 years there, I learned how to manage my time with work and school. I quickly learned the importance of speed and a high work ethic. I was promoted to manager as soon as I had meet the age requirement. i worked in two different locations dubois pa being the first this location had a very strong management staff and awesome training. i then moved erie and moved to a store in that location worlds different ! the second store was in a rough part of town so finding good reliable employees was hard to come by and the management staff was far from stellar in the 2 years i worked at the erie location we had been through 15 managers me and the general manger were the only management to stay longer then 3 months. i learned quickly at this store the importance of enforcement and in a way that didn't make unwilling employees completely shut down and refuse to listen at all.  at one point the only management at this location was the general manager and myself so i had to work 7 days a week with 10 hour shifts while also taking 5 classes at pennstate. also at this location no breaks were offered to management.  i also received no benefits and although i had been filling the position of the assistant managers for 5 months (two ranks above my title)  I hadn't even received  any type of raise or promotion  the 2years i had worked at that location. those reason in turn leaded me to search for  a different job in which i would be able to grow with the company"
bad,The job help pay the bills but I wouldn't recommend this job for just anyone.  The professionalism is null and void.  Everybody in the store are friends.
bad,"A typical work day is tiring, but I go for the check to get what needs to be done. My co-workers are the high life of my work day."
bad,"work you to hard for the pay,no benifets,the owner never fixes anything"
bad,Its somewhat overall steady day at work . Pretty much no drama everybody in their own thing depending on what managers are their that evening. But overall for me It`s very easy for me.
bad,"I did not like working for Wendy's, because the customers were not always nice, the managers don't show you very much respect or appreciation. I did learn how to talk to customers and make people happy. I enjoyed the fact that my work shift seemed to go quick because we were always busy and I always had some thing to do."
bad,It was a great team n we work together hard everyday. I like working for this company but I had to seek better job opportunity.
bad,I felt that there was very little opportunity for any kind of advancement within this company. The management was very friendly and willing to offer help in most situations.
bad,"it sucked lack of hours and didnt get paid for all the hours i did, no benefits at all suced good thing i quit!"
bad,You don't get paid for what you work. They had me work long late hours barely even seen my family. I worked for Minimum wage and it was the 2nd busiest store in the company.
bad,"MY typical day at work at Wendy's was to work too many positions at once. Training various amount of people while pleasing my costumers was very challenging and sometimes impossible. I did learn how to better spend my time doing the many assigned tasks."
bad,I did not have a good experience working there. Mostly do to small work environment and feuds between co-workers.
bad,"drama, no recognition for exceeding expectations, Managers like to point the finger at the wrong people"
bad,"Maybe it's just me but, the managers sucked, they didnt pay me on time, very difficult hours to accomodate with, and too cramped. The too cramped part is probably just because im 6 foot 4 but it still doesnt face the fact that the managers were terrible. I wouldnt ever work at another Wendys in my lifetime."
bad,this is a great company to work for if it is your first job or maybe a job for a student or beginner
bad,it is a very stressful job. At times you forced to deal with angry customers by your self. with no help from superiviers because they told me there to busy.
bad,"Fast food isn't really made for those of my age group we sort of just fall into it.  In of itself there is nothing wrong about fast food, it provides a necessary function in society. "
bad,I learned how to deal with customers and it has helped me builded up my experiences. I also learned how to work as a team to get the work done.
bad,The managers at that wendy's were very mean they would talk down to the crew members and lower managment instead of help them.
bad,its a slow store to work needs more bussiness needs to improve
bad,Working for Wendy's is alright. I wouldn't recommend it though.
bad,Not a good work place need something to keep me working all the time I there.
bad,"A typical day for a crew member is clocking in, asking what will you be responsible for that day ie. cashier, coordinator, fries, sandwich maker, etc."
bad,I would only work up to 3 hours a day. All i would do was keep the dining room clean
bad,i think wendys is only a temporary job for students so they can have a little cash on the side but not good for a career
bad,I started this job as a freshmen in high school. This isn't a job i would go back to. This type of job is more for kids getting started with their working lifestyles.
bad,"A typical day at work was a headache. The management was young and didnt know how to conduct business properly. Workers constantly got over and did what they wanted too, never cared for the satisfaction of the customers and also came too work only when it was convenient for them.The hardest part of my job I think was being so young working there, people chose too either pick on you or volunteer you for all the hard labor work while they sat around and did absolutely nothing."
bad,I worked for Primary Aim company they were not very in touch with what there customers and or employees needed. It was very much about money and speed and that was it.
bad,"this was a learning experience to say the least. the managers were not the ideal people you would want to work for. i didn't think they were approachable, and at times were just plain rude not only to employees but customers."
bad,It wasn't a very fun place to work...
bad,i really liked the job its just i was really tired the next day coming back to school because i got off at 1:00am and had to get up for school at 6:00.
bad,More of a job for a teen because there is no room for advancement.
bad,"While Wendy's pays well you have to work 10x harder then any other job. Wendys wants to own you and take every bit of time you have. They make sure you have no time for your family, friends, and yourself. Wendy's expects you not to have your own opinion and if you do they fire you. Wendy's is a terrible company to work for."
bad,fun place to work but when you have the gm favor her friends over other people that work there nothing ever gets done and they get to do what ever they want
bad,not many hours worked i was disappointed wanted more hours wanted some benefits and was looking to advance.
bad,"Extremely poor. The owner of the franchise was very discriminating and favored some employees for self gain. I was wrongfully terminated for conspiracy of trying to get a supervisor terminated. They accused me of writing two email reports to the owner playing like a customer. They even did a ""formal"" investigation on the situation on my two consecutive days off without my knowing of the situation or involvement to defend myself. I returned to work after my last day off unknowingly i would be terminated as soon as I walked in the door. I had no chance to defend myself. The situations in the emails how customers had pulled me aside and discussed the supervisor were correct in which saying the customer reviews/ reports were in fact legit. I had talked to my General Manager after the emails were submitted about the aforementioned supervisor and the situation was handled then. So why would they accuse me of this if I handled the conflict professionally?"
bad,They don’t appreciate their employees at all. They are very unprofessional and some of the managers are rude. They don’t know how to talk to people. I would NEVER work at that Wendy’s again.
bad,"Good: you get the hours and friendly co workers, easy job, fast pace environment, NEED PEOPLE WILLING TO WORK DRIVE THRU "
bad,This job is an ideal job for high schoolers to work part time it is not a stable job with stable hours. I would recommend retail instead and save coming home smelling like food
bad,"Cleaned and maintained grill stations and fryers, cooked all fried and grilled food, made sandwiches, stocked fridges and freezers, kept clean store, handed out food to customers."
bad,Wendy's was not very considerate of employees and their lives.  People there would agree with me. Nobody wanted to come to work because they made us all slave away.
bad,many of the coworkers were lazy and didn't do their job even saying the hate working so they just went to the back and usually be left handling many jobs at once; they'd always switch my hours from 10-8 one day and after that 5-12 every single day of the week it was back and forth
bad,"Working at this Wendy’s was very rough because the management does not care enough to help you advance in ways you need to. They care more about the happiness of their boss and customers than the workers, which does not motivate its employees to work hard and effectively at all times."
bad,The overall job at Wendy's is not bad at all. Unfortunately the store I work at is so mismanaged that it creates a hostile working environment. We are often out of product and that infuriates the customers and the customers take it out on us. I work as head cashier so I get the full blunt of the situation. Poor management does not know how to appropriately simmer down the situation causing for a very long and unsatisfactory experience for all.
bad,"The workers were fine and very nice. I quit after a few days because the head manager was super rude and mean. She yelled at everybody and even the other managers would try to save everyone from being yelled at. Even though you only had to deal with her for an hour, it was an hour of hatred and it lingered. The work was fast paced and a little hard but okay."
bad,"This job will teach you wonderful customer service skills. If you don’t have any patience now, this job will show you how. I’m happy that I have the experience ."
bad,"In the time that I worked there I got less than 12 hours training and then I was on my own, then management cut my hours because I was undertrained and didn't want to give me additional training"
bad,Too much old people who need help for everything specially the women. They need A new vacuum and to and to make sure everyone works equally as hard. Being honest
bad,Pay the employees more because they work hard and fast for low average money in rhode island. The management is terrible. There is never enough people on staff. Food is always cold.
bad,"The staff would speak a different language ( they were Indian ) made me feel super uncomfortable, some of the manager weren’t the nicest, they’d get frustrated knowing that I was new"
bad,"Horrible management "
bad,"The job had no benefits, no financial aid help and I had to fight tooth and nail for a raise. They work you to the bone and are never satisfied. I was expected to come in on days off and was not guaranteed the hours I wanted for time off."
bad,my first day i showed up the managers were late and i had to call into the place on a morning shift at 7 am and they didnt know i was supposed to be there because the managers had no communication skills and didnt tell the crew anything none of them really knew what to do to train me so i stood around for like 15 minutes for the manager to show up before she put me with someone to train me and she comes in and tells me dont worry about it i always end up showing up late like?? lol thats not a good thing and i noticed a lot of people had same experiences i had with training they never trained me properly they just had me watch a few videos then had me go up to do burgers they had me watch a few times then expected me to just know what to do on every burger even at one point told me i need to be faster even though it was my first time doing burgers they made me feel very uncomfortable and other employees that were nice must of even seen that they was being rude about it cause he turned around and told me dont worry ill get used to it the other places i trained the trainer would stay with me throughout the day doing some letting me do some and reminding me to do something if i do it wrong these guys showed me a few times and left me out to dry it was one of the worst training experiences i ever seen with unprofessional management when i told them i was going to put in my 2 weeks and gave my reasoning with the training she basically just said i need to watch more videos and she doesnt know what im talking about then blocked me from messaging i was mindblown and i dont think anyone
bad,Legitimately i stole a bag of nuggets and left by jumping out the drive through window. They still asked me to come back months later. Legit show up theyll hire you.
bad,"The owner is a joke, and the fact that his son is a district manager explains why they cannot keep decent Management on board. The only decent person they had for the last 25 years they fired for no reason common and one of his managers as well for unprofessionalism, although all she did was enforced the cell phone policy that Wendy's has written. Several other people left  as a result of these terminations, leaving them very shorthanded and sales have definitely suffered."
bad,On the interview they say u get paid 8.80 but on the check you’ll get paid 8.46 it’s a scam! To get employees.........................................
bad,"The staff I worked with were all nice hard workers although some of the equipment that the staff had to work with are poor standers that hold a risk, I saw no improvement so I left."
bad,i started work for wendy’s when the were owned by Davco but once box took over the place has gone down advancements are harder pay is less not worth the trouble
bad,"They keep on hiring too many people and when I ask for more hours, they never give us any. Instead, they ask us to stay longer than our shift and tire tf out of us and get mad if we say we can't stay longer."
bad,I personally feel like Wendy's does not treat there workers fairly the employees only get a 50% discount once a day not even a free meal and the managers barely get a break I have worked as a manager for about a year now and the only break I have received is a 10 minute sit down to eat food then it's back to work on a 12 hour shift
bad,the manager was mess and they did not try to solve the problems just added to it. They did not give us off time or nothing if you put in time you needed to be off they would not give it to you and the head manager never answered the phone it was never fun
bad,I didn’t like working on Wendy because the was bad I was good on the cashier trading with the customer bud very time the Wendy was full and they paid bad
bad,"I gave low review because the assistant manager is not professional yelling at employees ,talking about there employment issues and hitting on pretty girls ,he has left while on clock lots of"
bad,"Over all , the sanitation at Wendy’s is poor , most employees are on meth and it’s not somewhere I’d advise working . The customers aren’t any better ."
bad,"Your entire career at Wendys will rely entirely on who the gm at your store is. If you have a great gm and coworkers it’s amazing- fun environment, achievable goals, help to progress through the company. However, there seems to be a high turnover rate among higher management even, and as soon as your store gets questionable management everything goes to garbage."
bad,The general manager that I had at Wendy's was very unprofessional and not good at managing the store. It was a stressful job because when it would get super busy and we were usually short handed so it made it hard to keep up with all the job duties.
bad,"It was a good job i had fun, the coworkers i had were great. I was there for 3 month (my probation period) and then I got a call saying “ we don’t want you anymore.”"
bad,I was a cashier so my typical day would take the drive through person place while she leaves and start taking orders from customer and proved them with the food that they ordered. my manager was really good to me and then out of no where she dropped my house down for no reason. the most enjoyable part of my job was the coworkers they were funny and brought you in life family.
bad,"Horrible manager who was power hungry, phased me out after one month due to being “overwhelmed and never spoke to me about my performance before letting me go. What a joke"
bad,"pay is horrible, no benefits, no vacation pay, 6 day work weeks.  there is no communication between other managers.  Gm is solely concerned with his shift. Other shifts not set up for success!!!"
bad,My previous manager would consistently yell at their employees and would make a scene in front of guests. We have had numerous complaints regarding his attitude/behavior towards guests.
bad,I learned how to work the drive thru window typical day at work wen we are busy the hardest moment of work is wen we are closing the store for next service day
bad,The culture is not good. Most of the people there are not very nice and are mean to you if you cannot get something done right the first time which is one of the reasons I left.
bad,"Me personally, Wendy's was not for me. The food there is good but in my opinion, all of the work I was required to do in my opinion I feel I deserved a little more money."
bad,They dont do team work and they dont give u nothing for being there after 4 years they dont believe giving people wages. They dont respect people there about the money they post to get paid.
bad,Taught me me my people skills how to file things and how to order the things the store needed and was easy on scheduling understood I had children. And at times was fun
bad,"Lots of work for minimum wage job. Management sucks, they don't treat you like a person-never are appreciated for the hard work you do but if something wrong happens then you are definitely reminded of that."
bad,"Usually, you come into work, clock in, put anything you on the rack, and head to your assigned station for the day. It's very simple work, with set guidelines to follow. You ""train"" using online computer assessments, but it all really happens when you start training with a co-worker. The people you end up working with are generally not motivated in life and create a very disappointing atmosphere. Management has probably been there for 10 years or more because they lacked the drive to move on. Most management was very nice but never offered much in the department of making sure their employees' requests were met. I started strong with good hours until about a month and a half; I slowly started losing them to new hires that weren't needed anyway, as we already had 35-40 workers at a small location. I trained most new hires and still made fewer hours than them and eventually found out less pay as well. I requested my hours to be moved to night shift for more hours but they further decreased them. This left me struggling to make some payments, I explained this to them and they still left me with maybe 15 hours on my last month. When I came in and told them I wouldn't be returning for my shift they refused to give me my final check until I returned my $2 worth of nylon t-shirts."
bad,A typical day at Wendy's was kind of hectic. I learned some tricks for working in fast food. The management at Wendy's wasn't horrible but could use some work.
bad,Unorganized unfair I just am ready to move onto better things they hire a lot of young immature children feels more like daycare then a work place . Under staffed
bad,I will discuss... I would not like to say I can discuss in person.. I do like working there I got use to seeing customers and knowing there names.....
bad,"some employees didn't wash hands or use gloves after 7 PM. It was really gross. Closers also left drive thru person alone constantly to handle EVERYTHING in the kitchen. management wasn't nice to their employees, save for maybe 1."
bad,"Very poor management, no communication. Cannot not trust an environment that people undermine another character based upon race, immigration status, sex. One of the worst work places I have ever to endure."
bad,I learned a lot while working at Wendy's. Cashier and customer service skills. Workplace culture was difficult at times. Turnover is really high. Management is not always  easy to work for
bad,"I worked there for five years and three months, despite hating it from day 1. It is ALWAYS busy, and often with unruly customers. Police and security were called multiple times."
bad,The management is average and the upper management likes to play games when trying to promote people as they rather pay you less for more work. They do work with you for your available  schedule.
bad,"Most of the people there are rude, disrespectful and all about themselves. They talk bad about costumers when they're in hearing distance and most of the employees dont care about anything. The food some of them serve makes me sick. The general manager cuts corners inan unsanitary way to save three cents a day. The company itself is good. Lets people leave for family emergencies no questions asked most of the time but this particular store is horrible. I would not go here if I didn't work here."
bad,Students only require part time hours and would be sufficient.    Management is very difficult to go to.   Fast paced employment.      Not everyone is a team player.
bad,When I  started working there everything seemed cool but after a short while i realised it wasnt as nice of a plaxe as I thought... They cut lots of corners and they obviously had favorites. One of my co workers would repeatedly miss work and they wouldnt fire him but I didnt show up for a reason that was out of my control and I almost got fired. They would also repeatedly change the schedule after it had been posted. I didnt work weekends and they would change the schedule on Saturday or sunday all the time
bad,I wouldn’t work there again. I don’t like the way things were ran. Seemed unorganized and didn’t give me hours/ days i wanted. I wasn’t happy working there.
bad,"Very stressful, District Manager always has a negative input on everything. No compliments when a job is up and beyond from District Manager. Advancement is not based on what you know and can do but more on how the district manager likes a person. Not a great place to work."
bad,A typical day at work was a fast paced day. Typically can be stressful. When I learned was how to multitask and be a fast worker. Management was ok. Workplace was uncomfortable at times. Hardest part of my job was having to cover front registers and drive through.
bad,"The most I enjoyed was helping customers on a daily basis, but most days was chaotic and most staff was unreliable. Didn't enjoy my job most days. The best thing I did learn was how a company and a store should be run."
bad,The workers were very rude and obnoxious. Food was always slow to be recieved. Overall hours and pay were good but there were no breaks. Atmosphere wasnt the best either.
bad,busy restaurant and sometimes fast pace. you had some people that didn't have a good attitude. The job was easy. some of the employees that I worked with was good.
bad,"I was mostly on the closing shift, which for me was five days a week 3pm to 1am. I would come in and make a list of tasks that needed to be completed before day shift was able to leave, and then I would make a list of tasks for night shift to complete during their shift. I would coach them to ensure tasks are being completed and customers are satisfied. I however, had a bully situation where another manager was bullying me, when we worked together, She would ignore me, intentionally run into me (pushing me out of the way), and side with other employees against me which made team work very hard and shifts did not run smoothly. I called talked to my manager as well as calling corporate and nothing got done about it. I would have left sooner but I needed a job until something else came along."
bad,"I only worked here during high school , same as any other fast food job. they had good coworkers but the managers sucked. hours were kinda bad for high school"
bad,"I would only recommend this job to teenagers or college students looking to pay minimal bills like a car payment or cell phone bill. You work for hours without no breaks. I come home tired and exhausted after working 7 hours on my feet. I bring home around $350 after two weeks of work, I always have to wait until the next payday to pay off additional bills. I will be leaving but like I said this job is recommended for teenagers and college students."
bad,It was my first job so maybe I'm being to critical. The average day was slow to me just my coworkers made the day rough by not helping and the managers were not to nice in my opinion. The reason I left was because I was disrespected by a manager too many times and had enough so I quit instead of making a scene
bad,"It was constantly fast-paced with no room to breath. The management did not care about your personal life at all and taking a necessary day off requires you to constantly remind them and hope they're in a good mood. They also were out of touch with what customers want from a fast food restaurant, which is a fast food service. They required us to have a full conversation with each customers and customers don't want that, they just want their food. We were constantly being yelled at by customers because they just want their food, and constantly being yelled at by management because they want us to talk more to the customers, you simply can't win."
bad,Easiest job I've had. Work culture was terrible. There was a lot of disagreements and little management to solve it.The hardest part of the job was closing at 3 am.
bad,"I will agree that they did give me a job and promote me. The overall environment was terrible. The management was even worse. If you had a family, forget about it because Wendys came first not matter what."
bad,"Trained new crew members, dealt with money and customer service on day to day basis. Management was sub-par. No workplace culture. Hardest part was the fast pace, most enjoyable was comradery with staff members"
bad,nobody gets along and you have to clean all the time. the job is very stressful and is very fast paced and the managers are very annoying you get paid less than what the job asks for
bad,When I worked at Wendy’s there was very poor management. My manager would boss everyone around and just watch us do work. He would never help out or do any work. Usually he would be outside smoking a cigarette instead
bad,Its an ok job for a beginner not sure what more u want its a restaurant job thst would be a great place to work if management would appreciate their employer more and follow the same rules as the employees
bad,"Very quick paced restaurant, always have to be on your toes. Have solutions to problems that aren't even there yet but they will be there at one point throughout the day."
bad,"Working for Wendy's was very stressful to put the least. I witnessed the crew and management did not work towards the best service possible for the customers. In turn I can see why the crew didn't, no benefits, part time only for crew, we were made to do everything while the management sat in the office or stood over our shoulders criticizing our work instead of actually being part of the team. In my opinion the managers should be the super hero's among the crew be able to take on any task as well as work with the crew too. I do understand there is paperwork needed to be done, inventory, count drawers, and double check safe all that i do fully understand because I've been a manager before and i was able to do all that in little time to make sure i was there for my crew. As for the customer service food wasn't cook to temp often, they kept patties that were accidentally burnt, froze them for months on end and used them in the chili. Ummm shouldn't there be meat there specifically for the chili? We were made to use expired products before getting into the new product because they would go up on food cost, but by the time we got done using the expired food, then the newer products were on the brink of expiration. Is that really in the best interest of the customers or the company? On another note on one occasion i was doing morning maintenance which required me to change out the grease bucket underneath the grill, no problem i did it a bunch of times. Well one day the bag broke as i was lifting it into the dumpster and the nasty really old grease literally covered me from the neck"
bad,"Okay place to work of you like lack of communication, Poor work ethic, rude customers, and love cleaning for little pay. District manager is an unfair and judgemental person."
bad,"In the short period of time that I worked for Wendy's, I was cleaning bathrooms and the dining room, washing dishes, helping out with drive-thru and working as a cashier. For all the work that I have done, I really do not think that I was paid enough. $8 an hour! I left because of bad management, and bad environment, and also because it was really stressful."
bad,"Not many employees,  so all part time workers got full time hours,  few days ,  but they were good with giving you what you requested  had weird scheduling times"
bad,"Wendys Was A Very Experienced job for me you moved at a fast but steady paste..its a very interesting job I really liked but the pay check wasn't enough...i Loved My Job,Crew Members,and Customers!!!"
bad,I feel like Wendy’s would be a great new 1st job for someone who has never worked before or has never had a job... the pay is very lien and the work isn’t too much. It’s a laid back fast food environment but very friendly and very productive
bad,They don't listen to common sense.  They do not discipline employees according to policy.  Management disregards operational procedure constantly.  They do not treat people fairly.
bad,"I hated working here, it is very rough on your joints due to the flooring and shoes required to work there. I would not recommend anyone to work there."
bad,The managers act like they care about you but they really don’t.  Plus it’s horrible during the summer because they have the ac in the kitchen on low.
bad,Customer service is the worst possible department you could work in within the Wendy’s company. Everyone else at corporate had cushy normal hours and got to attend all scheduled “corporate” events. Customer service did not. The department is poorly managed and over run with 30 something’s acting like they are in high school again. Department needs a complete overhaul and I would NOT recommend to anyone looking to enjoy their job or the people they work with. Everyone is miserable. AVOID CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL COSTS. The rest of corporate seems like a much different and warmer place with lots of room for growth. The managers in customer service want to keep everyone in the department as long as possible and not help employees find growth opportunities.
bad,The managers are disrespectful and rude to workers. They pay very little. Schedule you more hours then you can actually work. There is poor communication between the workers and they dont train people well at all.
bad,"Really crowded, no space , Co-workers wasn’t cool and kept asking me why I don’t talk. It’s only because I was trying to work and I was younger. Like shouldn’t we be working anyways?"
bad,"Treated poorly, worked their for three years not once did I get a raise manger posts about you on Facebook when all you do is try your best never would work there again"
bad,"My experience at wendys has been rough my gm does not care for his workers, he does not appreciate nor does he thank them for things that are accomplished or goals that are achieved throughout the day. This may not be every wendys but at the one i work at it sucks.."
bad,"If you’re not the type to deal with customer’s attitudes all day, fast food is definitely not the place for you. It’s good for a first job or if you just need some pocket money. However, if you’re looking to pay your bills, and get by in life, I wouldn’t recommend."
bad,Wendy's can be a fun place to work if they had better pay and benefits. They also need to give better raises to the crew and managers. Since wendys because franchise alot of things changed.
bad,"Wendy's was the worst job I've ever had. They played favorites a lot. Supervisors always seemed like they were out to get one another. If they did not like you, you would know it."
bad,"The main problem with this company is the managers, they do nothing to improve store performance or increase staff productivity. The staff themselves are extremely lazy and do not do any work they are assigned even when told to by the manager."
bad,"a typical work day was kinda busy, I learned the importance oF time management.  I did not like one of my managers but it was a good work environment."
bad,I worked for this franchisee more than 13 years ago. They are no longer in business and therefore this review is irrelevant. But i need 22 more characters.
bad,"Can't expect a great paying and easy going job in fast food. "
bad,"competitive scheduling "
bad,"Most fast food jobs such as this was to make extra money through high school until I could get a better job when I turned 18 August 21,2017. Poor work environment with horrible management."
bad,Fast food is not for everybody you really need to have patience and need to know how to multitask . The managers are cool depending on who shift it is . The workers are slow And sometimes we a rush and some days it’s slow . It’s not a career that I would make out of it but it’s better than not having a job .
bad,"I would close the store, so a typical day at work for me was to come in and pick a job I wanted to do to close the store. I knew how to work anywhere in the store so it wasn't too hard and I got overtime."
bad,"I worked for Wendys for 7yrs and they were not up for advancement. The people I worked with and the customers , plus a couple of the Mngmt was the reason I stayed so long. That job is definitely for teens."
bad,Working at  Wendy's was rough. They never gave me enough hours but they would always keep me late without my approval. I told them one time it was almost an hour passed the time I was supposed to be off so I spoke  up and I got in trouble.
bad,"I have been working there for more than half a year now, but I still just get minimum wage."
bad,"Well first off the pay was very low, I needed more hours being as I had Bill's to pay.  I didnt enjoy working there either it was a constant thing you never got to take a break and breathe for a minute."
bad,"If anyone works for Wendy's any of them or any fast food restaurant. good luck handling the stress, employees mostly on cell phones, not working. They will not put it away, customers comes second. Mostly in my last location. Partly due to General Manager lack of discipline and afraid to not having sufficient employees to function"
bad,"Wendy’s has poor scheduling, understaffed, they alsways have new people working and most people leave shortly after the training period. The pay is to low."
bad,Co-workers were not friendly to new workers and from experience I have been yelled at for 'not moving fast enough' which did not make the environment welcoming
bad,Worked there for 6 years...got promoted to manager but never got any raises. Minimum communication with upper management. If you mess up it’s the worse thing in the world. They treat their employees like garbage.
bad,The upper managers don’t care how hard you work the company is always under staff crew and managers. You have GM from other store that are never in the store and are getting paid are home instead of working and they can only do that cause they faug the numbers so they look good plus the company is very racist with Spanish employees
bad,"I worked at a Wendy's for two months and the management at my restaurant was poor, they trained me to do things and later told me what I was doing was wrong, the work hours were crazy we would close at 10:30-ish and not get out of the restaurant till 1 or 2 am. It was ridiculous. I am sure not all Wendy's are the same but I did not enjoy the one I worked at."
bad,Did not like working here at all but I was in highschool and needed the money. The only thing I enjoyed was being able to make some new friends and learn a few helpful skills.
bad,"no support from District manager,all they do is expect  positive changes and bonuses from the restaurant team."
bad,"Wendy's is probably the best out of all the fast food resturants but is still fast food. I learned how to make burgers and chicken sandwiches, so can't be upset with that."
bad,"Although the other staff of the store were very nice and friendly. The managers of the store were always very impartial, mean & would try to take other peoples good shifts"
bad,Wendys is a very cool job at times . But the manager are not so considerate of others . We have some respectful co workers and customers. The food is made fresh and it’s clean. We keep Wendys clean at all times we’re always cleaning and making Wendys better .
bad,"Ma mère disait que la gérante me harcelait psychologiquement"
bad,"There wasn't very many days that I enjoyed going to work, in fact I often dreaded the idea. The management was very unprofessional and often inappropriate and only cared about ratings by higher up management and not the employees below them who helped get those ratings."
bad,"Working for this company was my first job, I worked very hard and didn't feel like I got the appreciation I deserved, it was a very stressful job, I didn't feel like I had an opportunity to learn and develop my skills"
bad,Wendy’s is a great job to start off your working life as adolescent but I would definitely not recommend it as a long term career. It is a very fast pace work environment and customers aren’t respectful.
bad,The culture at Wendy's changed when they were sold locally. Stores are not fully staffed. The cost of benefits tripled.  And you have to rotate stores.
bad,"At this job I did not have good managers if you weren't doig things for them they were upset talked about you, put you down, alot of drama. There was alot of arguing,and fighting."
bad,"I grew up around Wendy's and I used to love it; now I can't even eat their food. The stress involved in working at a fast food restaurant is always high, but it felt like the management made it much more stressful than it needed to be. I liked interacting with the customers, and how fast the day went and how active I was working there, but the strain it puts on a body, mentaly and physically made it not worth the $8.50 an hour, especially with all the drama and hazing involved. Will never do fast food again, because if this experience."
bad,Dont want to say much about this company i didn't like it they suck they don't know how to treat people they have working for them without getting personal
bad,"This position isn't what it was said to be, after only 8 months of employment the company is looking to downsize people in my position, there isn't any job security"
bad,"It wasn't too bad of a job, to be honest, it was fine, albeit stressful and face-paced, but was fine overall. The only thing I didn't like about the job was that I didn't get any kind of breaks after I arrived, I always arrived 10-15 minutes early so that I had time to relax before diving into the chaos that is the typical fast food business. I quit the job four months into employment due to the fact that I went nearly five weeks without any kind of working hours, I worked only three before they let the constantly new hired employees take over."
bad,"I was not satisfied with this career I have been working for 5 years but now they are making you work off the clock and that's against the law. I would not recommend this job to anyone who wants to advance, I am a manager and It took me a while and they still seem like I did not meet the criteria. and it has a sucky pay. they start u off with minimum wage and give u only 25 cent raises every once in a while if they agree to it."
bad,"Needs new management, needs new grills, new work equipment, an a better person to run the store. Needs someone who does outside work to keep with the garbage an lawn. Needs RE painted on outside."
bad,I was  student at time working here and the hours were really bad. They didn't work to help work with my school schedule knowing I was a student. I had to close about 3 nights a week and worked 5-10 pm majority of the time.
bad,"This job taught me how to deal with angry customers, and how to multitask at the same time. When you first start you have to catch on quick to the things people tell you and be able to keep those things fresh in your mind because the training is nothing but videos for those of you all that are hands on learners, and when you do start to get your training you are placed in the field which only lasts for about a month or 2 with few days a week until they feel that you are up to par with their expectations. those who work in the back wash dishes and cut bacon while taking orders and collecting money those at the front register and the second window help create the orders while taking orders wiping down the area at the end of the shift is mandatory. I enjoyed the job but the staff made it kinda depressing so if you don't like angry people or if you like to take your time and get things done to your best this job is not for you."
bad,"a day at work is as stressful as any other fast food chain. Angry customers, stressed management, unfair treatment by co workers and management, and you're lucky if you get a break. What more to expect from a fast food restaurant?"
bad,The Wendy’s I worked at had a very rude GM. It was not a bad place to work don’t get me wrong but my manager was rude as I said. She asked me personal questions that were not even close to true multiple times. I would recommend working at Wendy’s but not the one I worked at.
bad,Don't work there. The management was awful. There was no moving up in the ranks. The workers were lazy. Terrible Place to work. Terrible place to work.
bad,If it was more up to date the job would have been better. The staff was never included in on meetings we were not able to speak our minds on anything to the higher up staff. There were no incentives such as employee of the month Christmas parties for the crewmembers just managers. I enjoyed the people that i worked with.
bad,"No benefits; poor management; very disorganized and chaotic; Most of the people that work there are either spoiled high school kids that don't want to do anything or lazy adults that call in all the time. If you are actually there to work and get something done and make customers happy, then you get stuck with all the work. 99% of the managers there want to be people's friend and won't tell anyone to do their job."
bad,"my first job ever, working in a fast food place was not my career but a great start. it taught me responsibility and the beginning of managing money and working and going to school"
bad,"Poor work envirorment, workplace never clean, food left wide open inside freezer, and refrigerater. poor workmenship. aboslutely no team work no help."
bad,Bad manager not a good place to work at all very poor constructed the pay is not fair been there a year have not had a raise at all or vacation do not
bad,An ok job for a fast food chain. They really seem to try but you are more likely to get incompetent business decisions and a possibly abusive environment due to its lack of diplomacy or competence in navigating problem solving.
bad,"Fun environment but more of a high schools child's job.Some of the workers are lazy. The customers are rude. Working at Wendys is fun on some days, others it is just stressful."
bad,you work lots of hours for little pay. Money is good if you dont want an outside life or have a family. Company is full of empty promises. co workers are great but upper management doesnt care about anything but making themselves money. This company needs to care more about their employees. You cant come in and tell someone how to do their job when you havnt done it yourself.
bad,Everyone talked badly about each other and the pay was horrible. They don’t pay enough to deal with all the stress the job brought. Even the managers would talk behind each other’s backs. It’s worst than high school drama
bad,"Wendy's was a stressful place to work. As a single parent, 9-15 hour work weeks does not provide an income conducive to survival. New employees are singled out and made to look foolish when they have questions about how to do things."
bad,Very demanding job especailly during rush hour. They want you to work like a slave no joke. Couldn't even used the bathroom during my shift when we had over staffed people. Not to mention the managers were illiterate and incompetent.
bad,The managers are very rude.Once you do something that they think is wrong they take your hours away from you . They think they can talk to employees any kind of way.
bad,"Barley had days off, even when I was scheduled off. "
bad,I would not tell people to work here due to the GM being rude to all the employees but if you need a job and this is the only thing that you can take or that is on the market then you have to take it.
bad,"work load are too much"
bad,they care too much about the company and it's money rather then it's employees. only things I really learned from this job is sandwich making and salad prep.
bad,Business was very unprofessional didn’t like the way the manager treated employees. Never called out but always got least hours then others. Just a very unprofessional organization
bad,"It's great if you're a high school student needing a summer job. Manager doesn't work with you on hours, no benefits, pay is minimum and not many opportunities for advancement."
bad,because it was my first job it was alright but now that i look back they would not change hours barely gave hours and didnt care much for their workers.
bad,I enjoy making food for people but the store I worked for did not give me what I was looking for in a career. It was fun learning different types of food and prep. Hardest part of the job was working in a negative space
bad,i enjoyed working in different areas in the store. i like moving around a lot. working with a lot of different people. i enjoyed making the sandwich and salads everyday.
bad,Don't work at wendys . I say that because there very unorganized. They don't know how to manage their store. But I guess that's only at certain ones. Idc
bad,poorly managed from the middle down. i heard after i left they replaced the gm and district manager. i hope things are better there now. i enjoyed the crew and the customers
bad,"Very fast paced environment to work in. The pay was hourly, but one could work as much as 16 hours a day and  up to 70 hours per week. The compensation was not the best."
bad,"Honestly when i first started there it was great, but due to bad management the place went down fast. If you've been there the past 3 months you'd be able to tell. 20+ minutes in drive through just for a frosty. I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,"Come in on-time, often to a store that was not prepared or fully stocked for the coming shift.  Worked with some employees that are paid minimum wage and give only minimum wage work.  When air conditioner is broken, there is not a high priority to fix it, and crew members are forced to work in bad conditions with temperatures up to 95 degrees.  "
bad,Great company managers are cut throats and really don't care about employees . Some manager need more training and there is a lot of favors being done as well stores not up to date as well as
bad,"Work is alright, not nearly worth the rate of pay. And has absolutely no career advancement opportunities. Stressful coworkers as well as management staff. Overall wouldn't recommend to someone wanting job."
bad,If you want benefits or incentives this is not the place for you but they are flexible with your schedule. They also give you half price on your meals
bad,"En mi experiencia no tuve un día típico ya que me encontré solo con problemas  tanto en la dirección de la gerencia como aprendizaje el cual fue al cabo del día a día sin la preparación apropiada "
bad,They didn't care about their employees. They didn't pay us on time. They didn't want to give us raises when they said they were. They came and didn't try to help us.
bad,"I'm enjoy working with and serving customers. I learned how to manage a crew,  stock merchandise, customer service skills,  I did food training,  cross contamination, being sanitary,  working the cash register and counting money."
bad,"Poor employees are rewarded while good employees are stuck doing all the work. Poor pay+poor raises. Some stores are wonderful to work for, others not so much."
bad,Wendy's is like working at your average fast food place! It's more for the younger crowd as a first time job or something. Management isn't all that. It's ok.
bad,"- The typical day working at wendys was constant moving and doing whatever needed to be done."
bad,A typical day is very tiring and frustrating.You get burned. I learned how valuable teamwork is because if one member isn't doing their job right or too slow it weighs on the whole store. Right now management is not too great. They need help because they don't know what they are doing. I would help but they refused me advancement in the company. They also have schedule problems most of the time. I like the people i work with so that's fine. Hardest part is not having enough help when times get busy. Most enjoyable part would be when they ask you to go home early.
bad,"Wendy's was/ is great for acquiring experience in the retail industry, especially for highschool students. Beyond that, it is nothing more than a starter job."
bad,I hated this job I only held on to it because I'm in college and I needed the income to help pay for school until I found better. Almost everyone seemed unfriendly and always mad during shifts .
bad,"I have been working here for almost two years, and it's been two years of managers who don't care for anything else but the store (not including their employees) and high stress because of understaffing."
bad,"This was a franchise operation.  Honestly, any review I give is going to be completely different from another review from 150 miles away.  What can I say, it was fast food.  The pay was poor, the work was hard, the customers were the whole spectrum from awesome to evil, but it was a first job and I was hired on the spot.  Not too much I can complain about there."
bad,Most of the workers there were great to work with. Although many people didn't get along there they did not bother me much. I enjoyed working there for the most part.
bad,I like working in the public im very indenpended I like working with the community im a people person im reliable I can see myself as a manger one day... I really in need of a job if yu hired me I will show yu im all bout working
bad,"You will advance quickly in this company, because they fail to take care of people that work hard for them. They have a high turn over rate and you are constantly training new people. They will hire people at higher pay rates than those already working there, and give a hard working individual a .10 cent raise. If you value fair treatment, look for employeement elsewhere."
bad,"The crew is awesome, but management isn't here. I only have an issue with one manager at my location. Every other employee has the same problem with her. I opposed to work with someone who doesn't treat people with respect or the same treatment as others. Now that i do not work with her, everything is okay. Everything should be a team effort and it is currently."
bad,"it's very fun at times and very busy for the most part to keep you on your toes, it's a very fast pace you have to be cautious around the grease so you could be safe but it can be fun at times or stressful."
bad,"Working a wendys can be stressful , during rush hour it gets very busy and crowded and overwhelming. sometimes working as team can get stressful also because some people could be focused while another person is less concered which can get difficult with the task you are doing"
bad,cooking / dishwasher / drive thru . I learned how to be everywhere in the store and management was ok Iguess the hardest thing was the turn over it made it hard to find a great team
bad,"Maybe fast food just isn't for me but I hated it. I don't get paid enough to salt fries for 6 hours for 4 days out the week. They expect you to do eight different things at once soon as they put you on some real work. I went from wiping walls and floor boards and getting sent home after 4 hours to getting yelled at and pushed around about fries and nuggets. Then I'm told ""you work your way up to cashier"" as if that's some type of superior position"
bad,"Meet good new people and teaches you how to cook but to a certain degree, nobody wants to be in fast food, the job lasted while it did off and on from other jobs"
bad,Wendy's is an easy job. For the most part it is all self explanatory. You get switched positions when asked. So if you work fries and you want to switch to register all you will have to do is tell a manager. So that's the easy part. If you are looking for any type of raise or anything or to start higher than minimum wage this job is not for you. The 8-9months I worked there I was promised a raise and never got it. I was promised my referral bonus from referring someone to the job and I never got that.
bad,You have to deal with the customers attitudes. The pay was not that great. Some of the managers were cool to work with and some were not so great to work with. They wanted you to do so much but paid so little.
bad,Store closed down where I worked in Lakeland Florida. When I was there a while ago it was ran well. The managers picked their favorites. I started a minimum wage but had no work experience.
bad,hated going there to work. it paid good but jut isnt worth it. i wouldnt recommend it to nobody looking for a job unless they really needed  job. awful
bad,"as a company the company was overall very productive and thrived on serving food to as many customers as possible, no customers no service, no business"
bad,"You are constantly running back and forth completing different tasks. The workday would depend on who you were working with. A lot of the staff would do the bare minimum of what they had to do so before I could leave for the night I'd almost always have extra side work/stocking to do. Half the managers would assist during peak periods and the other half would come out of the office occasionally to complain and criticize the employees for longer than acceptable drive-thru times or long lines of customers up front. Overall, a very stressful position unless the staff/management work together effectively."
bad,"The people at this job were not safe. The environment was scary, and the conversations were inappropriate at best. Employees would come in high and nothing would be thought of it. Some duties assigned to the managers would be given to associates which should not have happened. Not a clean environment and probably not even safe for the food. At part time you are working 35+ hours a week."
bad,"It was nice for a first job but I refuse to ever work at Wendy's again. The management did not keep a cool head in the face of adversity, despite the fact that that is their job. I will never work at Wendy's again as long as I live."
bad,Always short staff co workers always calling in and managers not assisting their staff. Fast pace environment not enough training. Always running out of products.
bad,"a lot of drama in the workplace"
bad,Taught me a lot but you know how come on iPad 2 drive-thru cash register of meat sandwiches it was a very energetic job this job was very multi-tasking and I meant different people from all across the world working on Bourbon Street
bad,"I would clock in. I would go in the position they put me, I was usually up front. It meant that I would serve people their food or coordinate at the same time. Our management was somewhat good, They cared about the people but us co workers not so much. I loved seeing my coworkers, but the hard part was making sure the customers were happy too. Once my replacement was there they would count down my drawer and then i would clock out for the day."
bad,"I learned that teamwork is essential to completing tasks efficiently. Without my coworkers, I would not have been as successful as I have been. It is absolutely important to be able to cooperate in order to complete a common task."
bad,People are very rude and cruel there it just a bad place to work for i wouldnt recommend it to anyone id rather work somewhere else then there why i quit
bad,"It is making ends meet, but I want to experience more. The management isnt what you would expect and it is not organized as i thought it would me. I believe if it got new management it would be alot more organized."
bad,"I worked handling money and counting money out of my register. I was a crew member. Cooked, cleaned, managed money, and made sure it was a safe environment. Good upbeat people."
bad,Started with clean up then moved to fries the food is good real meat is used cooked fresh daily all in all was okay except the fact that ias was in a bad location
bad,management is a tyrant. the job it's self is toxic. decent place if your in high school...hard to get shifts off of night crewand very little room to grow
bad,a typical day in the job is do what you can to survive through out the day. The management is understandable but still have lacking of organization and cleanliness. The hardest part is keeping up the high speed pace and help make the customer experience convenient.
bad,"Had to work random hours; The managers would not work or enforce others to work so there was more work for others to do. I was 16 and in high school, and some nights would not get off until at least midnight."
bad,A typical day will include cleaning all work areas inside and outside of the building.  Preparing the food is a major part of this job. You will learn how to prepare food in a fast manner assuring that it is presentable.
bad,The Wendy's I worked at unfortunately had horrible management. Day crew never did much for and would usually leave all the their mess for the graveyard shift. There was plenty of hours. Decent pay.
bad,"Not ran well, but a very helpful first job. The staff was very friendly but the managers were rude and not very understanding."
bad,"The job was fairly easy, but I couldn't stand working there for two months. A typical day involved me doing the same, simple job. I could run an entire McDonalds, but at Wendy's, everyone assumed I was just some idiot. They treated me like I was dumb and the management was always flustered. We were always massively overstaffed along with managers. I would often find myself wiping tables, the same ones, for hours."
bad,"Nothing but a run around..constantly giving new people all the hours, and leaving the full trained people to search for new jobs because of the lack of hours."
bad,There aren't many jobs in this area.. so you work where you can and they pay you what they want!! No matter how loyal you are to them.. they will not give full raises but they'll give you good hours sometimes..my depends on who made schedule..
bad,"It's a decent temporary job for a student, but there no real opportunity for advancement. There is a real lack of advancement in raises and promotions."
bad,"This was my very first job, and my last minimum wage job for a long time. I vowed to start my own business and build a career after working this job. The management was extremely unprofessional, and the balance of work/life was terrible. I was not approved for a raise after being one of the only crew members to continuously come in on my off days. It was very hard balancing school due to the constant pressure of feeling like I had to give more time to the job because the managers constantly belittled me into thinking I was not good enough. I took a lot of life lessons from the job; however, I would not go back."
bad,Wendy's was a okay place to work I had got pregnant and needed to find better work to make ends meet at home why I was working there my jobs was to make sandwhichs  stock food back up clean tables bathrooms wash dishes some of everything was just team work
bad,Wendy's might be good for teenagers and people with records but it's not a place to have a career. I would never want to work there again.
bad,"At Wendy's, you are only shown videos for your orientation for two days, I only had 4 days to learn all of the techniques of the grill before I got fired, the management except for the employees were really trying to push the limits of what some people can't do and the co-workers are more used to it."
bad,I would not recommend this company/area to a hard worker. You get no breaks and work long Hours as a minor and your check will get screwed up. Also the management is not very good.
bad,"It was an OK place to work.  Management was very sketchy and I felt like I was in high school again,  alot of drama. All in all it was an alright place."
bad,"No one really taught me how to do anything, i had to learn by mainly watching and figuring it out on my own, the staff wasn't very good at working together and there was a lot of drama."
bad,"Did not train me in every position, would not answer my questions while training, managers were rude and the supervisor/hiring manager did not give persona information besides first name"
bad,"I worked here for a few months, I was disrespected by the crew and the management and was treated unfairly. The managers talked down to me and I quit on the spot."
bad,the job went OK had a hard time getting into the job because i didn't like the environment of the work area but i did want needed to get done
bad,"This is by far the worst place I've ever worked. Since I worked there for about 2 years, the managers made me open every single day because they refused to train anybody else for that shift. That being said, as a long time employee, I received two, 10 cent raises my whole time there. When the franchise owner raised the starting pay up to $8 an hour, my raises were not included with it. I asked about it, but none of the managers nor the franchise owner gave an answer, saying they'd look into it, but never did. The worst part about this job was the workload--because the managers saw me as ""more experienced"", I had to work drive thru all by myself, even during a rush, which is exhausting and incredibly difficult. Meanwhile, I'm getting paid the same as a new hire who stands around doing practically nothing because he hasn't been trained properly. The management was consistently poor and we've had around 5+ managers quit or relocate to different stores because they disliked our store so much. While I was trained on almost everything, they flat out refused to put me on as a full time worker. We didn't have any full time workers in our store because the franchise owner wouldn't allow it for some reason. The customers that go to this Wendy's are incredibly rude and love to take advantage of the employees and managers. We often had customers that would repeatedly call and say that we messed up their orders and would demand that we replace them. My managers would practically give customers anything and everything they wanted, even if the customer was wrong in the first place. I officially"
bad,"My typical day at work was cleaning the lobby and the bathrooms. Management not so great. I was pregnant at the time, I asked the manager if I can take a break and she told me ""NO"" because she didn't have anyone to relieve me. So I went 7 hours with no break."
bad,the manager work with you most of the time with getting 40 hours. there is team work half of the time. The other half your on your own to do the work yourself.
bad,Room to advance to short length management stays at the locations. Pay is not competitive with the market. Procedures are outdated and the environment is not safe around the workplace late at night.
bad,I worked there for a year and absolutely hated it. My boss was terrible. Most of my bosses were actually. They would always be late to work and would not respect you in any way. They were inconsistent with everything. They often left you short handed. There was never enough product for the store and there were never enough workers on the schedule. The bosses wanted 200% from you but gave the workers 50%. The worst part of the job was dealing with angry customer because we were constantly short on product and employees. I would not recommend you work there. They pay is also terrible with no pay raise at all. Also if you upset your boss in any way then you can guarantee your hours to be cut.
bad,"its a good working place "
bad,"this jobs is an ok job for a starter but if your thinking of doing this for a full time, i wouldn't recommend this. when i worked here i was having trouble with my work schedule. they wont even let me work for 8 hours and they don't give you automatic breaks you have to ask or else you won't get any."
bad,I learned nothing I have no pride about working here nothing I would not recommend anyone to work for this company it is absolutely awful.
bad,"The Marion, location of Wendy's restaurant is a good spirited environment. Working here, I've obtained customer service skills."
bad,"Good for high schoolers but bad for adult. The pay is loosy, no raises and management is a joke. Favoritism is big in this place."
bad,"Picked up on a few things while working for the company for so long."
bad,Typical day at work you clock in begin your task for the day. Usually starts off with cleaning the mess someone else left behind then begin your work. The days as a cashier you would clean the bathroom and lobby and make sure the customer was having a nice time at your restaurant. Food makers would just make the food and prep the food for the workers that come later that day.
bad,"Prepare for open and also nights for closing. To try and keep people from walking out due to management issues. As a manager I enjoy working with my crew we get along well, they take direction well when asked. Other managers we get along and have respect for one another.   Things have gotten progressively less enjoyable. I try to keep a positive outlook everyday but quickly get floored. The customers."
bad,I worked for the Wendy's on bemiss in Valdosta. They had me handling beef and poultry at the same time. They promised to start me off at $9.00/h and turned out I was getting 7.25. Needless to say they are gross. BTW the chilli meat is always from left over hamburger meat from a week ago to the date.
bad,"Going to work was a bummer sometimes cause MANGERS were rude and didnt really care, i didnt learn how they really cook there food. EVERYTHINGS FRESH and cook properly."
bad,"Wendy's is a wonderful place if you are looking for a job coming out of school and need to gain experience for the work field. Having said that, its not a job that gives life changing benefits if you want to further your career with there company ."
bad,"All I do is stand in front of the grill, I only learned how to use the grill and clean things, since I haven't done any other position. I think management is fair, but they can really be nepotistic. I have some good co-workers, but most of them are not very bright, and they are too lazy to do certain tasks at Wendy's. I can't think of any enjoyable part of the job, since most of the time I'm just standing around flipping burgers. The hardest part of the job is keeping up through rush hour."
bad,While working at Wendy's it taught me a lot. I had fun days but I also had bad days too. Wendy's doesn't have a great management team at all. The hardest part about work was the long shifts with out any breaks. although I enjoyed my co-workers and pay!
bad,"Working for Wendys wasn't exactly my best/favourite place. The management team was neither friendly or very helpful with training. A shift would be crazy, people bouncing around and yelling at eachother. When I first started there was no guidance."
bad,"I wasn't in good environment for work. Horse play was involved and I worked around females where they gossip all the time, and certain managers was rude."
bad,"Its a good first job as a teenager, but u shouldn't make this a career if you want to succeed in life. This would be a terrible choice as an adult."
bad,"Our General Manager quit in the middle of the week, I ended up working every night closing the store. On occasion working 80 hours in a week. The store was robbed under my shift, and because the cashiers hadn't had a chance to make a drop; I lost my job."
bad,"While working as the Grill associate, my experience at this select Wendy's was confusing and disgruntling in general. Employee trainers were inexperienced in their positions, as well as misinforming of the regulations and procedures of their daily tasks, partially due to the computerized training in orientation that is expected to give new employees a weeks worth of training in 2-3 days. Rushed into the workplace, expectations for new hires were above capability and over demanding, causing constant positions to be available for hire. The job was simple, but due to the poor management and sustainment of the workplace and employees, the unorganized start of the position caused underachievement of the many tasks and responsibilities of every employee. Many times, I found myself doing the task of another crew members position due to his/her lack of multitasking abilities."
bad,"I did not fully enjoy the job because there was no hours, and I felt like the job advancement was not there. the hours they provided were terrible. I worked from 11-5 on Saturday and that was it. I felt like they did not want to work with my schedule with school."
bad,"Horrible wages. Run by a District manager that is too busy out at the bars. Lying managers and not professional at all. Long days on your feet, because they don't always give you your required breaks. If you work 40 hours then if you pay close attention, on your check you might get paid for 39.99 hours just so they don't have to consider you full time."
bad,"My time at Wendy's was never easy. I didn't get proper training,if any, in any position. Management was very irresponsible with their scheduling as well as inconvenient. Environment extremely lacks communication within the team. Staff would not achieve tasks in timely manner, causing interruptions and lag at important times. What i enjoyed most was the very few times i was able to stay in one position for a whole day and have enough time to really master a skill, which was on the grill. Co-workers were always late, always calling in sick and would not complete their daily tasks, which other hard-workers constantly had to double up for. I would stay longer than 8 hours in a day and not get paid for the over time."
bad,"Wendy's s a quick way to earn a little cash, but will not last long for the excelling mind. You will only be satisfied if you are satisfied with settling."
bad,The managers there clearly did not know how to be managers.  They did not like their jobs and therefore did not care enough to provide proper management and unity of direction and because of this the store suffered and was the worst Wendy's around.
bad,"The general manager was unbalanced. She'd threaten the employees when angry. She'd also make unreasonable demands, EG: I was asked to prepare expired chili meat."
bad,I am a very social person and like meeting and serving people but working at Wendy's is more of a drag then a normal day at work. My day consist of serving customers and taking their orders. Only thing I really learned is how to handle money at a faster paste. The management team is horrible! I only like working with one manager because she knows how to treat her employees with respect and don't mind working with another one. Other then that I dislike working with the other managers especially the general manager. He is a very rude and sarcastic person who talk behind his employees back.The hardest part about my job is to clean up after really messy people and very rude customers but it comes with the job. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to joke around with some of my good co-workers and the manager that I get along with all while being able to do my job. I love working with my co-workers because we are all very social people who like to be social with our customers and with ourself.
bad,Crew is disrespected you get promoted with no incentives unreasonable expectations. Not all about how you grow and develop but more about money. More cons than pros but that's expected of big companies
bad,"Time goes fast, rules are to be followed, managers are somewhat nice people, and co-workers are easy to get along with. I learned that you must stay polite at all times! However, you may receive shifts that you wouldn't like such as late nights 8pm-2am."
bad,bueno aprendí que nada es fácil y mucho menos trabajar en locales de comida rápida pero fue una buena experiencia
bad,"Very busy job, mostly for high school students or for people who cant get a job anywhere else. not worth the pay unless you are management."
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's consist of employees arguing over a mix up of orders, it wasn't all the employees fault its the managements fault for not putting the workers where there suppose to go at the beginning of there shifts. My co-workers always had a new story to tell about there weekends life over all thee great when they aren't arguing with each other. ill have to say the hardest part of the job is nothing if your working as a team only time the job was even considered hard was when orders were misplaced or never made."
bad,Lack of communication between Managers as well as crew staff. No team work. Instead of managers being managers they allowed the workers to be managers.
bad,Wendy's has poor management and they expect me to know everything without them telling me a thing first. Co-workers and manager work poor under stress. Many complains and returns.
bad,"The owner keeps all the money from the tip jars, so if you think you're tipping the cashier or the other restaurant staff, guess what, you're not."
bad,"A typical day is slow at first, but once rush starts it becomes hectic, and sometimes chaotic."
bad,the hours were long and with poor management it just made everything unenjoyable and hectic. To be fair the store has been placed under new management since i left so it may have gotten better.
bad,"A typical day at work would include handling money, taking orders, bagging food orders, stocking, cleaning the dining area, and washing dishes. I learned how to treat people and to treat people the way that I would want to be treated. The management was horrible. the managers would talk to us employees any kind of way, they would show favoritism towards different workers, they would spread lots of rumors and gossip about the employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers and their constant threats to fire the employees."
bad,"While this is a great job for preparing to enter the work force, it is not a recommended long term employer. The job involves hard work and while it is not a very appealing job, the coworkers are amazing. It is essentially a family atmosphere, or a close-knit community with everyone being close friends with one another. On most days, the crew has a lot of fun on the job."
bad,"Poorly ran company, if you weren't a favorite of the owner you basically had no chance of advancement. No job culture whatsoever. Everybody is pretty much overworked and underpaid"
bad,"I have been working here for 3 years, and there are no raises, I work with other co-workers with 10-15 years experience and this still receive minimum wage. Money hungry business that couldn't care less about their employees."
bad,"Place orders and prepare food for customers, and at the begging of my shift I would count my draw down and also at the end of my shift I will count it down and make a drop. will make sure I gave great customer service to customers"
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's consist of a few rushes and its a 100% chance you will hear our top manager snapping off about something excessively. I learned a few things that pertains to how my manager runs her store and plenty about Dave Thomas and how he was in the adoption system like me. Management makes it hard to struggle but i will say they have motivated me personally to stay on top of my stuff. Co-Workers come from all different backgrounds, but we work well from my opinion. The hardest part of the job to me personally is the lack of hours for those who really like to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction I get when I come from behind the grill and ask how was that Burger?"
bad,"The managers are not professional and the pay needs to be increased because of all the work you have to do, but other than that the workers are alright."
bad,It is like every fast food place. Not a good place to stay and try to move up.
bad,I would ring people out at the check out and keep the lobby clean and organized.  The management and co-workers had issues with respect.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the drama from co-workers/management.  My favorite part of the job was the interaction with customers and making them feel happy with the service I provided them.
bad,"Working at Wendys was fun at first because it was my first job, but then it started to get boring an unprofessional. The managers were so rude to the employee. They didn't know how to talk to they workers. Sometimes my customers were being more appropriate than my managers. My job was mostly a cashier and I use to love when it use to be closing time because it gave me time to clean the lobby and be away from my managers. The store is a good place to work at, when you have great an professional managers."
bad,Pretty stressful atmosphere. No benefits. Horrible hours. Unrespectful job
bad,"A fast pace, unrewarding job. Even with a great work ethic, it's difficult to work in an environment where hours are so irregular and jobs and duties change drastically everyday.  My customer service background was highly satisfactory to the company, but I was taken advantage of because I always did my job by the book.  When others failed to complete their tasks, I was always brought in to clean up their mess."
bad,It pays minimum wage and for a guy trying to pay rent and get into college it is hard to make it buy. the work space is cramped and the labor is okay but not involving large muscle activity
bad,Mangers didn't tell the employees what to do. Was very slow when busy and no one wanted to do their jobs.
bad,"Having to wait to clock in until you're told to clock in by management, I learned that I can handle difficult situations with customers without taking it personal, Management was more like friends than managers, co-workers are a big family- each shift has there own way of running things, the hardest part of the job is that it's a drama induced environment, most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all different kinds of people."
bad,"such an unorganized store filled with managers that talk to you any type of way, prices are crazy expensive, and management positions get offered to just about anyone.. honestly i dont mind working in fast food but working in a store that is SOOO outdated with machines falling apart its frustrating."
bad,"Most of the people you could get along with and the customer service was fantastic, however some of the workers held personal grudges as well as create an unbalanced work schedule for most.  At the very least I enjoyed my job until some of the upper management did numerous things for their own personal gain.  I could no longer be a part of the shady workings of the store."
bad,"A typical day at work was just insane!! As soon as you walk in the door, it's ""Are you clocked in yet"" ""When do you clock in"" ""When you do clock in do this and this and this"" like you didn't know what to do already. What i learned is how to treat people! They treat people TERRIBLE. I have never seen a worse management team! I don't think i could ever do that to someone. Management use to be great. When they started sending managers away it all started going down hill. One because all the other managers were working more shifts and were frustrated.Two they would hire new people when not even needing them and lower everybody else's hours for no reason. A lot of people were mad. On top of that, their gm didn't really do anything but sit on her butt in the office. Don't get me wrong, sometimes she would do something like make the schedule but other than that it was playing candy crush on her phone, or eating. Other managers would go out to smoke when they were slammed out the doors and out to the road but wouldn't let any of the employees go until a certain time. Yes, okay i understand there is times to go smoke but if that's the rules for us, that should be the rules for ya'll as well, especially when were busy at that moment. The hardest part of the job was being so hot in the building. It wasn't hot in the lobby but in the drive threw it felt like there was no air at all! When your standing in that window and its 80-90 degrees outside plus the heat coming off of the cars it sucks when you even shut the window there's no relief of heat! The most enjoyable part of the day was your"
bad,"To be a cashier at Wendy's you have to be really high energy and you must be good at memorization. You must master the art of making sandwiches and memorize the steps to prepare said sandwiches before you are even welcome to the register. The job is very fast paced and not meant for everyone. I say this because sometimes you will not be given a break, but the discount sort of makes up for it."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of chores, making food, customer service. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of my job were the days I would go in and open and the be asked to close. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with."
bad,"do not maintain employee's  schedules,"
bad,Was good place for being a crew member but once into management it was a tough place to work at because your job was not secure. They did not really take care of their employees.
bad,you have to work to make this job a place where you would want to be.
bad,Typical day taking orders cleaning dining room and rest rooms managers were okay
bad,"needs better management as a whole. "
bad,exciting and fun to start working to have alittle extra money also you meet new people
bad,"Although this was just a fast food job, I thought that I learned what it is to work hard for recognition and advancement. I did go from server to crew leader."
bad,"Performed daily operations of keeping the work area sanitized"
bad,"I loved my job at first. Then there was a big change in Wendy`s and now it is no fun, you get micro managed so much it drives me crazy. You will be gone 11-12 hours from your house because of work for 10.5 hours due to working a 10 hour shift and .5 hour for a break. Plus drive to and from work and you never leave on time. Training people and crew member do make it fun some days. Hardest part is the hours you work and are scheduled. Almost impossible to call off."
bad,My day started at 5:00 am and ended at 2. Some of the employees we're easy to get along with. Others just loved to start drama. Even if you kept to yourself. There are managers out there that will do anything and everything they can to get to the top.
bad,fast paced. rude customers as well as other employee's. not enough pay for the type of job it was.
bad,I did not have a pleasant experience. It was all rushed with little to no training and my schedule and duties are not very flexible with my school schedule.
bad,"During my time at Wendy's, I've gain great customer service skills and networked with people from different areas. I've learned how to handle different situations under different circumstances and I've learned to adapt. The hardest part of the job was to deal with my co-workers."
bad,It was kind of hard working there some days. People always want to do things their way instead of the policy way. They was always trying to get into people personal life. They did not offer regular employees benefits.
bad,"Although I learned a lot at this location, I was promised work but have been reduced to 12 hours per week.  There are way too many management people every day and they do the work that the hourly workers usually work."
bad,"it was hard at first but you get use to it, managers showed favoritism towards some employees, most coworkers were friendly and helped a lot while others were unkind, the most enjoyable part was discounts and rewards for doing good."
bad,"over all the job was okay. I cooked the hamburgers so the job was easy. I didn't really care for the management team, it wasn't that they were to bossy, it was the fact that it seemed to be all about the management team and not about the rest of the staff.promotions were slim to none.the only thing that i really liked about the job was the fact that i worked closing so we got to bring home food."
bad,I learned patience and also my manger was nice and friendly and my co-workers are a good team they really helped me out.  The hardest part of the job was maintaining orders when it got busy but I get through it. The most enjoyable part is working with people and getting the job done.
bad,"The management can be extremely poor, and the working conditions are less than favorable depending on which restaurant you work at.  Expect a lot of burns and angry customers.  The hardest part of the job is getting used to operating the WENPOS registers, standing with extremely limited breaks, and learning to remain clam while dealing with problems as they arise."
bad,The Work environment is too tense due to all the drama between coworkers. Management is pretty good while they don't schedule enough people at night. Coworkers most of the time are annoying and don't help me out up front as a cashier. Hardest part of this job is being able to work happy when you already know all the drama is going to happen. I love some of my coworkers because we make it fun to make it through the shift. Overall the hardest part also is when you do well you are not recognized or rewarded. It feels like slavery
bad,I was the main store opener. I would get to work at 7:30 in the morning and prepare the food and set up the store. I learned that communication and team work in very important for any job. My co-workers were always helpful and we always worked together. The hardest part of the job was getting the food orders out fast and correctly but the most enjoyable part was pleasing the customers with loyal and fast service.
bad,"Typical day at work, my hardiest part of the job was being on grill. I enjoyed my co-workers."
bad,"The workers and managers where very dramatic. It was an interesting place to work, most of the workers were friendly."
bad,The hours are good. Actually very flexible however I've worked over here for almost 2 year and i think i need a change and explore my option. There is no further progress and it is not my field of interest.
bad,"-there was to much favoritism between management and employees, dating co-workers and not enough work  "
bad,"Had a great experience at first. Gave great customer satisfaction, Maintained keeping a clean workspace."
bad,"i would come into work at 6 am and rotate stock, then i would start and clean grill, scrub clean deep fryers, stock fridge with food for the day, make chili, sweep and mop floor and dining area, clean equipment, scrub sidewalks with degreaser and drive thru and parking lot and trash area, clean trash cans, wash windows. etc"
bad,The pay wasn't good but it was a laid back environment and management was good
bad,"not so much a cook job as it is a cleaning job"
bad,"I found the management to be very gossipy. It was my first job so it did pay the bills. There were never enough people on duty. There was a few managers who actually cared about the employee's, but school was not of value to many of the workers. From other experiences in a working environment, I've moved up a lot quicker, things were done more efficiently, and enjoyable than working at wendy's.   "
bad,Wendy's is a very challenging fast paced environment. I have learned so much about management and customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers. The hardest part of the job is keeping all of our co-workers involved.
bad,"I would arrive to work about 5-10 minutes early and be sent to do various jobs such as janitorial or cooking. The manager was not professional at all, my coworkers broke all of the rules and did not respect the managers, except for myself. The hardest part was leaving my job late at night and being chased by homeless people or harrassed by prostitues. I did enjoy having something to do during the day. "
bad,A typical day consisted of just run controlling drive-thru and stocking supplies with alot of customer service
bad,I was 15 years old and Wendy's was one of the only company's willing to hire me at such a young age. I started off as a sandwich maker and worked my way up to working the grill. I enjoyed it at the time because it gave me my first experiences as a employed worker. There were many things i found negative working for Wendys. I found it to be very dirty and the management and staff very negative. I would go home smelling like fried foods and the grease from the food made me break out in acne at that time in my life when i could have gone with out it.
bad,"Have to make hambugers for clients.Cook the burgers,fries.nuggets,do the dishes,clean the floor,clean the grills,costumer service in the cash register.Haved very good co-workers."
bad,"Hostile and Hectic Environment, Disrespectful and Inconsiderate Managers."
bad,A typical day at work would be someone is always calling out. leaving the crew short. Cars and customers all day non-stop with minimal down times. The management does not do their job well. Customers always complaining and having to wait long to order. Unfair treatment in work place
bad,Working at Wendy's has taught me how to be respectful to others even when they aren't respectful to you. The most enjoyable part about the job is making sales. I've also learned how to multitask!
bad,"work was on going and simple. working here was easy but always came home smelling like grease. The management wasn't very good, and other coworkers. I liked working during the rush hours. there could have been better management."
bad,I found a typical day at Wendy's to be more troublesome than it ought to be. It had come to the point where my outcome of my day ways solely affected by which managers are on the clock. The GM was verbally abusive to staff and would more often than not create a hostile work environment for employees and hinders everyone from performing at their maximum potential. It seem as though all the managers were in cahoots to see who can get the most employees off the clock as i f found myself and many others taking mandatory off-clock breaks when working very short time frames ex. 6-9 . One instance i was told to go on break after having only worked for 45 minutes .
bad,"I learned good work ethics working at Wendy's, I learned customer service, dealing with money/cash registers, I learned the proper way to clean and prep food and food areas. If the right people were working we were able to work together as a great team and get everything finished. The hardest part of the job was how fast paced you had to be, I learned there that I actually like working in that fast pace once I got the hang of how to do everything,"
bad,"I wanted to quit everyday. Co-workers are nice, but that is the only good thing."
bad,"You aren't treated well, it is not a fun job.. The work sucks."
bad,Didnt really get to work here for long because it was a tempoary position and so I didnt really learn much.
bad,"Majority of the time, I worked on drive thru. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday. The management team was somewhat difficult to work with, alot of them let their power go to their head. Co-workers were always dependable. We all stuck together as a team regardless of management's attitude."
bad,"I was assigned on a board when i got into the restraunt. I went to the place on the board. Within 2mnths i had been trained Cashier, Window, Dishes, Sandwichs, and cooking. Once closing time came we cleaned the restraunt and did a walk-through/inventory."
bad,"The restaurant I worked in was poorly run, there was always tension between the staff and management and I felt that I did not want to be apart of a company that worked in that way."
bad,"Hard fast pace work, with little pay great for a part time job if in school"
bad,"While working at Wendys i've learned they are hypocritical , judgmental and rude."
bad,Great for your people with no social security cards
bad,Best part about job was the constant interacting with the customers.
bad,"This position is a stepping stone. Not a career where you can spend allot of time with your family. Wendy's has a low cap on their wages and does not compensate you over their wages even if you receive a highly effective rating. At Wendy's you will work in a very hot environment 90 to 95 degrees with being made to ware a tie. Wendy's will send you to different stores up to 30 miles from your home , even if you have a store near your home , with out any consideration to your needs."
bad,"When I first started working here. It was the best place to work. They were organized, I received plenty of hours, and the people were welcoming. As the years went on an management had changed and many of my former co-workers left, the job had went down hill. Management was lazy and they started to hire employees who did not want to work. I was there for over 2 years before I left. My first year an a half, before the management changed, there were no problems. The second management changed there became a problem with stealing, customers were always complaining about the rude behavior of my fellow employees."
bad,It was a great afterschool job that taught me how to deal with the public.
bad,"You always wonder about why that tasted so funny, or even why is it cold. I ate maybe twice, but will never do it again. I now all about the grossness."
bad,working at wendys was very fast paced i learned alot of different jobs
bad,that was my first time at fast food and it was nice different i got the job on the stop my first birthday and i was so happy and they were happy to have me as well it was a nice job
bad,I felt like the wendys in Arkansas was racially different. It didnt matter how much work you did or how you came to work on time they still wouldnt show any appreciation.
bad,"I was asked to clock out early and finish my work so they wouldnt have to pay me overtime. We were understaffed most of the time, and ran behind frequently."
bad,When i first got there i had no training or nothing i just had to basically teach myself how to do things the right was i loved how my coustmers love my personality and see that I was working on a fast time base what i didn't like was the manager was very rudewhen towrds me when i need help
bad,Hopefully since I worked they have improved in their volume of management and organization but when I worked there scheduling was horrendous and I barely knew where I was going every day I worked at a different store everyday and there were times that I was told to go to a certain store and then when I arrived found out they forgot to tell me to go to a different store that day.
bad,"it was a good first job, but it just wasn’t for me. it may have been because of the area and the staff there, but in total, it was just a bad experience for me."
bad,the work was okay but the pay didnt add up to the hours also the attitudes with managers sucked and it was all out of order .. need more structure other than that it’s kind of a good store
bad,Its okay. Its a job. Honestly Im not too found of it; but I needed somewhere to work while I went to go get my CDL license. So it came in handy for that purpose.
bad,"Managers are very strict and get frustrated over the littlest things. Working in fast food is very difficult at times, and the managers can get very stressed out, which makes it harder on the crew members to stay calm as well. There are clear favorites when I worked there."
bad,"pay or a question about something, they get a terrible attitude and assume things and are very unwilling to help you unless you get mad and yell at them. I recently called to check why I wasn’t able to see jobs on job stack and the lady automatically assumed and got an attitude and said cause of No Calls, No Shows. First of all I have never had a no call no show, we got into an argument and I called her an idiot."
bad,A typical day at work is making  sure everything its stock  and clean and that grilled station and sandwich station and  fry station and make sure the customer are satisfied
bad,"I worked at this job for a year, not the best job not the worst job . I don’t like the pay period but every 2 weeks , and up the raise, I wanna work to be stable"
bad,i learned if you work as a team you can achieve any thing. if you do it alone you might not succeed. from open to close most days are non stop. food prep to order taking. to cleaning  and unloading the trucks and going to the banks
bad,"To cut costs and save money Wendy’s laid off some of its most loyal employees some who have been there for decades. A sad end to a company that had great potential. Not the first executive blunder either, all downhill from here."
bad,The management favored employees who had been there awhile and didnt help newer people succeed. But this was also years ago so I'm not sure how they are now.
bad,"Very bad! Horrible management! But, first couple days were okay, but after I done everything around the store! Including cooking bacon and everything to do with bacon! Wash dishes, do everything for pull-up window ! And do cashier my original spot! Also fix pop machines! And take over other peoples spots! Then they’d talk bad about me! And saying I smell bad! That’s very disrespectful! Also yelling at me while talking to customers! It’s bad when I have to say sorry for my managers actions! Never followed protocols! Only when the big bosses were around! It was very insane! Never had anything in stock! Even coins! Also the store wasn’t clean unless I cleaned it! They allowed people to sleep in the store, while customers were there, passed out on drugs! Have had the police there too! It was just a bad experience over all!"
bad,"It is pretty job like working there work is easy. Well I clean cashier cook and stocker and I will give in if they need me,but that's going to stop. I dont see my self there for the rest of my life"
bad,"They have flexible schedules, but very little staff. They do train you for every position. You have to constantly stay on top of things because they will not assist you during your job."
bad,The management and establishment doesnt really care about the crew just their service times. They didnt know how to divide the work evenly amongst the crew therefore over working one person
bad,My location I worked at had very poor management and we were always short staffed. The schedule was never made in time and there was very poor communication
bad,Working at Wendys provided me with opportunities to earn extra hours since i was an extremely competent employee. I enjoyed working in a fast pace work environment because the work day would fly by.
bad,I think Wendys was an okay job. But maybe the location I was at was maybe a little more intense because people was just trying to half work. I think some people would like it .
bad,the store is disgusting and has flies everywhere I found a fly in my mayo one day when I was working sandwiches the mangers are trash but the gm is amazing and will work with anyone's schedule
bad,"It was fun there management is ok sometimes crew was great"
bad,Honestly I wouldnt reccomend working at any Wendy's unless u have fast food experience or your in desperate need of a job and even then I would say make sure your looking for another one while working there.
bad,Wendys is not a good job t work for. i like the atmosphere at first but i realized that i am worth more than wendys. although i love the food i alsio like my co workers
bad,Poor management  amd no respect for crew. Work crew like they are slaves for a very poor pay rate there is no structure to jow any of the locations are run rules are diferent at all of them
bad,Good for teenagers for after school or weekends but not adults who are trying to provide for there families. The manager that was working there when I was there was rude and downgrade the employees
bad,"Most of the employees here are kind and have good senses of humour."
bad,this job was somewhat rewarding for me . but I felt it was best if I got out and find something better. maybe your experience might be better. so gooluck
bad,"Got this job while I was in college and the environment was not one that I wanted to continue to go back to.  Stuck with it until I graduated but even at that, I wasn't happy with working there."
bad,Worked weekend only and hours were cut while they were training other people . I had a attitude with another employee and got hours cut for 2 weeks and no one informed me till I asked.
bad,I never liked working the night shift there was only about 2-3 employees and a manager for that shift. Schedules were unfair and the assistant general manager horrible(that’s if she’s still there).
bad,"I liked the job, it just wasn’t worth the pay. You did way too much only for $9 every two weeks. it’s not worth the stress, and money wise it just wasn’t working out for me."
bad,Was a decent starting point for young adults getting their first job. Management influences the culture and unprofessionalism of the job. Hardest part of the job is seeing people come and go and days where you have to work alone.
bad,"The job itself was ok but it was ran poorly, they never wanted to give pay raises or when they say you get one they never really want to give it to you"
bad,They were very professional and patient. They will give you as many hours as you ask for. They give you plenty of opportunities to advance in the company
bad,"I would say working at Wendy's wasn't really all of the greatest experience for me, I like the hard work I just dont like the fact that nobody does there job correctly and everything you accomplish isn't good enough"
bad,"They don’t let you have overtime, management honestly is horrible. I wish we had better people running it, people who care, and we should definitely be getting paid more. The best thing about it though, is the lovely employees I work with, they’re the best team !"
bad,"Just like McDonald's, it is not for you if you can't handle any criticism from customers or even from people you work with. It can be fast paced, depending on the location of the store."
bad,Management are choosing who can work long hours and its not fair. usually they sent employees home when there is no costumer so that they can save profit
bad,"Wendy's had roaches all throughout the time I worked there and I got tired of them as well as the fact that my mother was not able to keep taking me back and forth to Easton everyday that I worked when she had to go to Cambridge everyday, it was hard on the vehicle."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend anyone to work here. Management sucks, there's all kinds of secret deals being made, and broken promises. There's constant mistakes being made with customer's orders"
bad,Well as a part time job it sucked. It was hot. Worked ridiculous hours. Work till midnight the night before come in at seven the next morning to open.
bad,"they did not train me, this was my first fast paced food service job. they were rushing me during lunch time it was my first time on burgers worst time."
bad,"Working here honestly was very stressful. Management was very sloppy and made workers carry most of the weight. There were shifts where I had to step in as ""manager"". Pay is horrible and you probably won't ever get a raise at your time here."
bad,Managers seem to pick favourite employees and give them more hours. Hours get cut down to almost nothing. Talked down to by management a lot. Treated poorly by customers and staff
bad,"Depending on management, it could go either way, but I would not recommend working in any environment that disregards your education. Always better yourself and don't let anything get in your way."
bad,"Wendy's is a stressful place to work for, dont think we are treated fairly, other employees there are amazing and we all become one big family .hours are difficult,  we all work as a team to do what is best for the customers"
bad,Need educated managers who know how to talk with employees. The general manager over there is so rude who need to be replaced. Overall colleagues were good.
bad,Customer service sucks mangers suck work environment sucks. Went into labor @ the job no benefits job all around sucks I hated working there not professional environment
bad,"The crew members that ran the grill, the sandwich station ,the cash register and made the food were great people to work with (most of them). But the management there was. Well, bad choices all around, and played for favoritism. One head manager was not as experienced as they said they were, and would cause stress to all of their employees. Some of them cussing them out and quitting on the spot. some employees would drop out and I would be forced to pick up said shifts. (went to work a solid fifteen days straight, overtime pay was only included on a following week pay). Some co-workers ended up crying in the break room daily due to the stress of the environment and the managers yelling and demanding the staff to do tasks they could do themselves despite the fact the staff needed help. They would cut breaks short whenever a lunch rush would occur as well. and if you stood up for yourself they would forcibly cut your hours."
bad,The employees there were lazy. I actually got cursed out by a coworker one day. I had to come in at 7a.m every morning and do a three person job by myself.
bad,"Working at Wendy's as a student gives you the ability to make a decent salary while being able to focus on school and hang out with friends.  That was, until you begin to get less shifts.  Typically, the company will ask you to do something like make sandwiches and by the time that's done, your shift is over.  I learned that working at fast-food is not as bad as it seems , as long as you develop good relationships with your co-workers.  Management however, does not care about most of their employees and will make your job way harder than it needs to be for their sheer happiness. At this particular Wendy's they speak more than one language which makes it harder for other employees and customers to talk to if their is a question or problem.  The hardest part of the job is getting the shifts that you want an booking off because it is hard to get in touch with the person in charge of the schedules and ensuring they know what you want. The best part of the job is the discount (25%) and when you do a good job because sometimes food and other snacks are brought in."
bad,Fast pace job I liked Wendy’s but I just wasn’t making enough & I was spending more to get to work then actually what my checks were so I had to find something better
bad,Not a good place to work manger is very wrong in situations don't go by there we are a team saying will tell you to get it your self that it's not another employees job but you are dealing with customers and can't just walk off at that Moment
bad,"Not the best fit for me. Opened restaurant at 7am, set up kitchen, maintained lot, prepped for future, stocked inventory, organized and put truck delivery in proper places."
bad,"The hours are alright, but dealing with the general manager does not make this job working at. She would yell at everyone for no reason. She was always rude to the workers and get up in everyone's faces when she would yell. Blamed everyone else for her mistakes. The other two managers worked better and were more forgiving and understanding that the general manager."
bad,I would not recommend any adult to join the Wendy’s crew. You get paid so little you physically can not support your self let alone a family. Management wasn’t great either
bad,Management was extremely disrespectful and would scream at minors. Expected you to know exactly what to do on your own on your first day. Stressful environment; would not recommend to anyone.
bad,Noone sticks around for long. The management while good can cause some issues.  Which is what led to the cause of the fire that burnt the store down causing my employment to end.
bad,I prepped sandwiches and salads. Sometimes I would even prep fries. After my shift was over during closing I had to clean my area and then clock out. The staff were very nice.
bad,"The management when I worked there was shoddy at best. I am not sure if it has changed or not so I can't make a proper, current review."
bad,It can be better more crew members it is a very stressful job alot of. Employes get treated better and we are underpaid for the wotk we do it would be more fun if we cahnge things and stop having the same people do the same stuff
bad,"Wendy's has great training for new employees in the management program. Unfortunately, the training is not used. Because the stores are chronically understaffed, a manager is mostly working the floor at an open position. The management position is salary based on forty hours, but you have to work fifty+ Therefore, the pay is much less than advertised."
bad,Not enough pay. Judgemental. Hired too many peoples hours cut. Paid 7.25 BEFORE TAX. Not very clean. Wouldn't trust making myown food. Mangers mean without any action from corporate
bad,"Take orders, bag them , help with drive thru, clean the lobby throughout the day, clean the bathrooms, deal with wrongs orders, drop food, stock alll the belongings up, wipe down lobby"
bad,"The management team was always on edge and hollering at the workers.  If a bus pulled in they act like they lost it because it was busy, but in actuality the staff did they part so it was no need for the attitudes."
bad,Wendy's was one of the first jobs I had it was a decent job but I found myself  picking up on a lot  of things on my own you had to work several different stations at once like washing the dishes working the windows and maybe a food station all at once and If you didn't finish you weren't leaving until it was all done
bad,"Wendy's is getting better, but from my experience working there, the pay was not justified, the management was about as rough as it could get, and the overall morale was downright sad."
bad,"A typical day would include customer service, cleaning bathrooms and front of the store, food preparation. Management was terrible, they often stole my hours and paid me less than I should have been paid. They would yell and say bad words for no reason. Workplace culture is very negative, stressful and quick paced. The hardest part of the job was rude coworkers and customers."
bad,"you will be always required to do more than you are supposed to do, besides that there is always a lack of employees so you end doing double work without any compensation you just keep earning your $7.25 per hour."
bad,"very stressful environment to work in, too many high school kids, problem with authority from everyone, including managers. pay isnt enough for the travel that some make."
bad,My personal review on wendys is that its a great job for a teenager who is still im high school but as far as being as for a grown up its better jobs out there
bad,"I enjoyed working there until we changed company’s I liked the pay and overtime ,new mangers did not treat us the same way but we were constantly busy ."
bad,"This is a good job for teens looking to start working. It will teach you how to deal with irritating people and working with people you hate. However, not a job that will help you pay bills and maintain a well off way of living."
bad,decent ppl not to much of a hostile environment but can be at times most ppl decided to do what they wanted and a lot of the time it flowed ok but sometimes ppl caused issues
bad,"Dont ever work here, it's stressful, you are underpaid and overworked, you have no rights, managers are unfair and yell at everyone, act like people are stupid"
bad,The hardest part of the job was working someone else's job when you're already assigned to one. A typical day would be really rushed during lunch hours and from 2pm-6pm it would be nonstop.
bad,"I started working there in high school. I did not know anything when it came to part-time jobs. I did not realize they were hiring new members after me and paying them more, while I was still at the normal rate they said when they hired me. I asked them if I was being paid correctly, and they avoided the question as much as possible. I kept calculating that they were still not paying me correctly for two years. I was barely making money compared to the newly hired employees so I decided to quit after my winter break. Best decision of my life."
bad,I was being disrespected by the manager that was working there. Always had a really bad attitude whenever she came into work. She acted like it wasn't room for error.
bad,"Management was terrible, but the customer would always make me feel better. Management would make me would crazy amount of hours while still in Highschool."
bad,i didn’t like it at all. The customers we ignorant along with managers. Sometimes i didn’t get the days i needed off. And i didn’t work as many hours as i wanted
bad,This Wendy's was terrible. Lot's of disrespect and conflict. Customers not happy or satisfied. Inapropriate things gong on in the workplace. Manager was not very good.
bad,The work is easy. There's a good chance to get more hours if needed or wanted. Can be stressdul at times. Pay is minimum. Decent wkeming environment ..
bad,This was a fast paced and difficult job because you are not paid much for what you had to do.  I did everything from cooking to cashier.  The hardest part was making sure I got the orders correct and the customer was happy.  I did this job well though.
bad,its great . job was great . i enjoy the people and the management and the cleanliness of place. although it was fast pased. i enjoy the customer service i provied
bad,"I did not like manager, she would not give hours to employees, and was very rude, and nasty. wendys has good food. ok to work there.they need to move staff up"
bad,"very stressful, they accused me of stealing, they told me i was no longer allowed to do proper refunds. instead i had to just open the drawer take money out of it and give it to the customer."
bad,"Not much to say for most people its a dead end fast food job with small raises and upset coworkers, stressed out bosses with their bosses stressing everyone out. Not a particularly enjoyable place. Its a job and ifbu need something to get by temporarily it works. Dont expect to advance only a small amount of people ever do."
bad,"Everyone was always playing the blame game, managers never cared. I was able to move up a bit in the company but it didn't feel worth it based on what they were paying me. Very fast paced, busy, not a fun job at all."
bad,I seldom had days off. The expectation of everything to be done with little support. Senior management seldom played a role in day to day operation though there was a need. Wouldn't work for this company again.
bad,its a first job only. unless you apply as a GM other then that there isnt much to say this place is a fast food joint. hard work low pay but its experience.
bad,"Ridiculously long stretches of work days.  As the GM you are expected to cover positions when your employees or managers call out sick or don't show up.  I worked 14 days straight and was not allowed to have an extra day off.  I didn't start my career in Fast Food, so the transition was difficult.  The caliber of employee was not what I was used to."
bad,"overall did not enjoy my time there. the owner lacked investment in his own store, terrible hours with horrible management at times. old and out of date equipment."
bad,"Unprofessional, unorganized, rude. At times inappropriate. Not a place for growth, and definitely an underpaid job. You're technically responsible for a customer's food, meaning you're responsible for any health concerns that has to do with the food. (ex. meat that isn't fully cooked, E.coli, etc )"
bad,"it was my first job while i was still in high school, it worked well with my school hours and was easy to catch on and learn the ropes. the staff were easy to get along with as well."
bad,"I worked here a little through high school and my first year of college, I feel they did not pay enough for the drive I had to make to get there. I was also only working 5 hour shifts and it didn't pay well at all."
bad,If u need a quick job and don't mind working around teenagers have open hours and able to be called in at any time then this is the job for you but must  always pick up extra shifts to get a decent pay check
bad,Never enough employees and lack of management. The company always comes out with new sandwiches like they trying to kill us. The rude ness of the customers
bad,"Management just saw each person as a tool. It was obvious they didn't have enough workers and it didn't seem like much was being done to hire new people. Manager once yelled at me while we were in a rush telling me I'm too slow instead of trying to help. Other workers (including managers) didn't care for company policy, would eat some of the food while on the floor. Other workers were also rude and would use very crude language to each other (it didn't matter if one was 30 and the other was 16)."
bad,"It is very easy to move up the ranks in responsibility, but very difficult to raise up the ranks in compensation. I learned how to work multiple positions and only received a 25 cents raise."
bad,"A typical day at work would of been stressful stuff going everywhere, the manager was throwing stuff most of the time. "
bad,Would be a good place to work if the higher-ups would care and help you advance instead of holding you back and it was a fair place where all rules are followed by everyone not just favorite
bad,"The store is understaffed the work barely makes any money can not survive off the money they pay,  they put garbage out side on the ground, could be a better work environment"
bad,"Poor management, very unorganized, attitude problems. The Wendy’s in Centerville Georgia needs workers but won’t hire any to avoid more pay checks, very stressful environment and the managers are rude."
bad,Ok job to start not money to live off of. Maybe a good place to work if you have another job or another mean of financial support definitely not somewhere to make a career.
bad,Work was fun with the employees were friends. Stayed busy. Manager is harder worker. Kept employees with scheduling. Easy to learn and clean environment.
bad,"Some of Management is Lacking in common sense"
bad,You have customers yell at you with minimum pay and  work hours this place was the worst place I have ever worked before and I do not recommend anyone to work here
bad,managment was very poor. team members were not palying ther part in the job. unorganized.  not very good pay at all for the hours you are wanted to work
bad,I really don't have much to say about Wendys.That was a terrible experience for me. I got harassed one day and they didn't wanna do anything about it. I honestly wouldn't recommend working at Wendy's for anyone.
bad,"Working here was my first job and things started out well as everyone was at first friendly and helpful but after the honeymoon phase was over everything changed, My own coworkers were rude and belligerent and it was just a hostile environment with random hours that took away my social life for the period of time in which I worked their."
bad,No structure and little to no benefits. Too busy focused on money rather than satisfaction and quality. Don't care too much about employees or helping them advance.
bad,The overall environment was poor from the start and the people hired did not care for each other. Problems were not fixed by management and any disrespect between anyone was ignored.
bad,I was very disappointed with the Wendy job it was enough hours for me to work i probably worked less than 20 hours a week but i continued to work there until i was no longer needed at the Wendy
bad,"Take orders and prepare food for customers."
bad,I work for this company and excelled at all position from the front of the house to the back of the house. I did inventory and stock counts. end of day paperwork and never became a manager.I trained all new employee 3 months into my employment. Then i was wronged by management thru harassment sexually and verbally. Life threats and possible civil suits. They mix personal and professional and terminated me for not going with the flow of their operations outside company policy. I witness management borrowing against the company safe like loans. selling food outside the registers count. extortion and exploitation of minors.
bad,"A lot of the times there will be a call-off or just not enough scheduled staff making the employees that do show up work extra, management is very poor with barely any communication"
bad,"A typical day of work consists of cooking food and keeping the environment safe and clean. It was a hot environment, and a stressful one too. You're expected to do multiple things at once and the stress comes from managing time. I had to close and that was the worst part of the job. On weekends, it wouldn't be uncommon for me to stay 2-3 hours later than intended with a coworker I did not get along with. Not sure if things changed over there, but I don't intend to go back. It's probably a more relaxed environment at other Wendy's restaurants, but not that particular one."
bad,"Working at wendys would've been great if the manager would've been able to keep her word. Everyone was very unprofessional, it wasn't no organization what so ever."
bad,It was ok as a first job to learn cash handling experience and customer service. I was 16 when I started and got a better job soon after. staff was friendly and we had some fun times
bad,Working at Wendy's was really stressful. Management did not treat us with respect and we had to fight for hours which was necessary in order to pay our rent and bills. We were way underpaid and MGMT had no intentions of either give us a pay raise or promoting us for a better opportunity. I left as soon as I could and hope they do a better job in maintaining their employees content.
bad,"As a crew member, I discovered the incredible amount of patience it takes to work in food service. Not only are there disrespectful customers, but this job is very fast paced. That being said, it was definitely a stressful experience for a 16 year old high school student. Personally, I don’t think people know the amount of loyalty, diligence and resistance to a disrespectful customer’s attitude and words. Although the job wasn’t all that great, I had wonderful, supportive managers who I will always remember. They have guided me correctly through my first job and I will forever be grateful for them. Overall, this job takes a ton of patience."
bad,My review is that it's not a bad job if you have good managers. I mean as long as your doing your job then your golden. It was rough on days were we were short staffed. It felt like you would be under so much pressure until the rush was over.
bad,I didn't like it. It was no good. I was bad. Bd work condinitions. No harm no foul as they say. HUH Tthery dont' say that? . well it wasnt good I tell ya. Very bad. don't no bad
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be taking and filing orders as well as cleaning. I learned that people can be really rude, though it is best to let it roll right off of you. Management was okay, though I always felt like I was milked for more hours. The hardest part of the job would have to be working super quickly and dealing with rude customers that come in."
bad,"Good fist job, very highly demanding for closers and employess, All over great high school teenage job. Lots of cleaning and complaining. Will help you through alot of different futrue jobs"
bad,"Fast paced intense environment especially when it’s the weekends Fri and Sat nights the drive thru really a get hit so bad at times , and the management made it no better."
bad,"The management is all over the place. inconsistent and rude. They failed to train me correctly so I was left to figure things out for myself, which had consequences."
bad,Everything is chaotic and a mess and non us are treated fairly we are so low staff that we're having to work long and hard hours with no benefit I would not recommend working here
bad,"At this establishment, I had been working cashier as soon as i started off and drive thru as well. I had also began cooking and making food as I had worked more and more. I had worked at multiple establishments for Wendy's and I had worked every job for each of them such as, cashier, drive thru, cook, and fries. At rare times, I had worked all of these jobs while being short staffed with multiple customers giving orders."
bad,Very busy which it will be it is a restruant. But very poor management and disrespectful co workers. Co-workers are always very rude to customers and very slow which dont satisfy them.
bad,"Working for the company was very stressful. there weren't enough employees. Being that this is a high pace establishment, I fell it is very important to make sure your fully staffed."
bad,I just started to work at wendys i like it so far the pay is ok the mangers are ok there its a fast paste job i am a cashier at wendys i work moring shift
bad,"Good environment for transitioning to a better job, will teach you how to count monitarily, value your customer, clean you work area, interact with others, prioritize, organize, work as a group and work independently."
bad,"While this may not go for all Wendy's, the one in Hilliard, Florida has the most abhorrent management I've seen. The supervisors and the other employees have a constant attitude."
bad,"- part time position, the pay its horrible this is back in Puerto Rico."
bad,I was appreciated alotfor my work ethic because I care about getting the job well done. Working at Wendy's was just a temporary job for me at the time.
bad,"A typical day would consist of the managers yelling for absolutely no reason. Even when the staff members are performing their jobs, the managers would still get mad for any little thing they could find."
bad,Working at wendys it was never serious they was never prepared for the day employees would come in playing and joking around with customers waiting on food their service was low because of how they would treat their customers.
bad,The way that I was treated on the day I was fired. they never gave me a warning or suspend me for unsatisfied work. When I arrived at work I clocked into and I got fired.
bad,after getting work experience I suggest getting a better job. they will teach the basics of the work environment. they will also teach how to have a fast paced work ethic.
bad,"When arriving to wendys youll learn that it is fairly simple to accomplish any task there. However, as the days progress youll understand why they are always hiring new people. The work environment is stressful. The management is horrible. Literally had a manager yell at me at the register in front of other customers because she didnt want to handle the register after my shift was over. It was humiliating and it probably angered the customers to see how they treat their staff. It seemed like the work you did was never good enough for them. I definitely do not recommend this place."
bad,"Managers only think of their bonuses and not about their workers, they play favorites and mostly hire people who are related to them or the staff in the main office, they'll keep them even if they suck at their job just because they are related to the staff, they will have the other crew pick up after their mess."
bad,I wouldn't work at Wendy's again.It was a new experince for me since it was my first job but it wasnt what i expected to my work Ethic and what im really good at.
bad,I loved it there but the manager to wasnt doing a very good job with her employers but over all i loved the work and the customers and some of the other crew was very nice
bad,It wasn’t too bad of a work place. Management is biased. Treat you bad if you aren’t a fast learner. Always stay busy. Nice first job but not a place to stay.
bad,I didnt like the hours the way they would talk to the customers. I was always told they customers is always right but not there the managers get mad about customers
bad,"The wendys I used to work at was located close to 170st So you can imaging the amount of crazy people that used to go there. I got attacked, insulted and disrespected in general by certain customers. You have to be patient to work there. Some managers were a pain in the backyard, but others were nice to work with. What made me stay for so long was the fact that I had nice coworkers who made the chaos be more bearable. I still talk to those people nowadays. Would recommend this job for college students in URGENT need of money.  If money is not an issue for you, and you just want to work to grow as a person. This is not the job for you."
bad,Wendys is a fast pace job where you should have tough skin and a great since of humor to get through most of your days dealing with the rude customers
bad,I wouldnt work at wendys again because the management was very poor and the workers didnt know the definition of team work it was every worker for themselves
bad,was a good starter job for someone still in school. great for part time but can not live off the pay. no benefits were given what so ever. will never work there again
bad,Did not like working for Wendy's at all it was the worst job of ever had I hate working for fast food I did it for years and I just don't see my self ever going back
bad,Very easy work laid back environment just have to be willing to do the work management works around schedule they give hours if you ask but the hourly pay is just not what I’m looking for I need something that can help me afford house and car payments
bad,This was my first job so I was very excited and hopeful. Management was rarely friendly and made the employees work overtime without pay almost always. Complaints were made by customers as they could not enjoy their meal over the sound of management yelling at employees. This specific wendy's never had enough staff members working. The job was never fun.
bad,"When I worked at Wendy's it was a very good company to work for the big guys cared about us little ones. Very good team work we never really had issues with that. I learned a lot while I was there, including how to work with people you don't like, up to how to talk to customers ."
bad,"Management wasn't nice, they got stressed out when they had to train someone. Write ups were given out for small mistakes. Very stressful and fast paced."
bad,If you are seeking a job with steady hours or decent pay this is not for you. This is a good job for someone starting in the work field but not long term.
bad,Like to cook cashier clean  make it to work on time like to work in be on time I like make friends at work comeing in doing my work when leaving make sure it’s in order
bad,I don’t really have to much to say about this job I like Wendy’s itself I like the customers and the company also but the managing is the problem for me.
bad,"Nothing to say about this place. Needed to work, it provided income when most needed, however, there is no place to make a living, and no room to advance."
bad,"Usually understaffed and management doesn’t make sure customer service is of quality standards all of the time. Non-stop working during the shift. The company doesn’t allow anymore then a 40% discount on food, only once when you are working."
bad,"The company I worked for was very unorganized, not very well out together. Couldn’t keep employees. Upper management was poor it made it hard for everyone to do there job as requested."
bad,the morning starts off very slow but around lunch it would pick up . there were slow days and fast days . management when I was there was not as bad .
bad,The pay was nice but the hours were terrible i was working 4 days a week getting 45 to 50 hours it was terrible then when i asked my manager if i could cut my hours down so i coukd finish school i was told if i cut my hours i might as weel just quit
bad,it was stressful and tiring. people were not all doing their jobs and they hired a lot of students who didn't take work serious. which wasn't fair for people who did their job.
bad,"The food is good, but working there is not. The managers are rude, they pick favorites, not everybody gets paid the same, not everybody is trained the same so when I needed my shift covered I had to ask the 3 people who knew how to do what I was going to be assigned to do, and if those people couldn’t cover my shift I had to come in, despite if it was an emergency or not."
bad,My co-workers were very mean and the manager tried to get me to quit. I got very few hours and got paid $7 an hour. They treat you like animals. I would not work there ever again.
bad,"I didn't really like it but it was a job. Temporary. Small pay, short shifts. Good people. Multiple jobs. A lot to do. A lot of people. Not every day s the same."
bad,This job was a typical fast food job. I enjoyed being able to make a little cash after school in my teen years. The hardest part of the job was washing the smell out of my clothes after a long day of work.
bad,"Wendys is a great first job, but get out quick! I was pick on everyday and wasn't giving any hours even when I asked! A lot of favoritism and racism. I would not go back to that job"
bad,Management and environment was horrible. Any time a cook would mess an order up the managers would blame the register or baggers. Often cussed at us. Would not work their again unless dennis is replaced .
bad,"They always took your hours away due to what people would say about you. He said she said. They cut your hours and then say your not working fast enough they don't train you, you just sit at a computer and listen to a bunch of videos and then they expect you know what your doing."
bad,"Working there was great up until it came to management. The general manager was always unprofessional and constantly belittled employees, including myself. Most of more coworkers agreed that their least favourite part of their job was how they were treated."
bad,"I wouldn't have quit if i could have gotten enough hours to survive. It was a fairly good work place, the building is really clean. I trust eating there."
bad,"I work here, but they don't give me the hours i was promised at my interview. I was told i would have help, but I receive little to no help. Always swamped with customers."
bad,"Every location may be different, take it with a grain of salt. My location was busy with some managers who were all about helping the team, and some managers (Plus the GM) who tended to DISAPPEAR when rushes were happening."
bad,it was very stressful being a manager. definitely would not recommend anyone to go there and be a manager. being a crew member isn't bad. work 40 hours and be done for the week.
bad,It was boring because I only got to do one job the whole time I was working there but it was getting me enough money to take care of myself while I still was in school. A good place for teenagers.
bad,"Even if you absolutely adore your job, there are going to be days when you've just had it. It's just the nature of working. For those unbearable days, use this handy infographic as a quick."
bad,They dont give raises at all. U get 30 mins for break somedays u gotta remind who ever in charge too. The company is good u just have to find the rite store
bad,"My coworkers are very condescending and rude twards me, my managerment can be lazy and forgetful. Our store is cramped and doesnt have airconditioning."
bad,"A typical day at wendy's was long and stressful.  The pay was decent but the workload and management was not so understanding for high school students.  "
bad,"Typical day at work includes fast paced work environment, management is poor, hardest part is the amount of customers coming in at large quantities but the best part are the co-workers."
bad,fast food is tough to work in. this industry is hot and tiring. not enough compensation to do the work that you do in this industry. fast paced and challenging
bad,it's not the company that made me feel this way about my answers i just didn't enjoy working there as an individual i wouldn't tell no one not to apply i just wouldn't
bad,"Long hours, unsupportive management, and constant stress. Would not recommend, unless you really need a lot of hours, which they will definitely give you, often way more than you request."
bad,Wendy's is a company to have experience and grow that can help you for the futher jobs the only thing you maybe don't like is the schedules since you have to work until 2 am or  3am on weekends. Is very busy and you can NOT take break
bad,"Stress as a manger"
bad,Was a part time summer job that was filled with a lot of unnecessary drama and stress when the job itself was not stressful it was created by the workers themselves
bad,The reason why I don't like working here because of the staff and management . the hardest part of this job is when u are understaffed and u have to take orders make food and bag orders with no help.
bad,They do not like to give woman the same opportunity's that they do for men. They do however offer flexible shifts to everyone that needs it. The hardest part of the job is trying to be promoted.
bad,Wendys can be a great company if they paid more and had better health insurance and benefits. Dealing with call outs due to the fact that long hours are worked and no breaks are giving because of lack of help. Wendys is not a typical fast food restaurant and it can be technical because quality is what the company stands behind. They really should do more for the employees like they use to.
bad,this has many faults from costumers to scheduling and etc. but its work even if it doesn't pay enough to live contently. but at least i have a job which all i grateful for.
bad,"Wendy's is a poor company. You are not compensated for work injury or overtime, and corporate is slow with responding to absolutely anything. It's good for desperate pocket cash."
bad,"The Owner of is very degrading. Calling people ""stupid"" ""shouldn't be here"" ""Why are you here"" "
bad,"always having to pick up the extra slack and no one likes to help out."
bad,"Highly multi tasking, over worked, understaffed, fair, no general manager, over worked, friendly customers, busy lunch times, benefits, upper management, overtime,"
bad,the general manager is so unorganized. she is not qualified to do her job. the pay is terrible. people are getting paid better in better areas such as Atlanta. its not a good working environment at all.
bad,"I hated it the manager were terrible , the manager took serval smoke breaks a day . The scheduling was unorganized & Manager never clock out , all they do is ride the clock"
bad,"I would not say every Wendy's is terrible, but the one I worked at was seriously the most toxic work environment. Go for it though, the experience is definitely worth it."
bad,It was very very hot and very greasy and dirty. The employees are very rude . It was my first day and they were all very rude . I caught on really fast though
bad,I was hired at Wendy's to be a manager trainee. When I arrived for the first day I was assigned as a grill chef. The pay wasn't nearly what I was promised.
bad,"My personal opinion Wendys is a starter job, It can be very fast paced and busy, but its an excellent starter job to get teenagers used to the everyday work life."
bad,"I worked over 17 years and after they raised the mandatory pay of minimum wage, I have been making minimum wage ever since! I didn't get enough hours that I had scheduled but if they wanted  me to work bc someone had called off, I was always there."
bad,"This company liked to hire friends and family and that made it hard for those who were trying to be promoted.  Stressful, long hours, rarely any breaks, low pay"
bad,"Managers: Rude, no manners, talk down to employees, find it appropriate to grab employees wrists and pull them when they want to talk or show them something"
bad,"I would go to work at Wendy's and we were supposed to start with a team meeting and then we would be assigned a job for the day. I learned how to cover when people don't show up. I learned how to work in stressful situations. The management here wasn't the best in my opinion. The hardest part of my job was when the management would mess my scheduling up and schedule me on days I wasn't able to work.My favorite part of the job was getting to work with people, and getting to meet new people everyday."
bad,the work was stressfull and the assistant management could be very poor to down right mean at some times. the store manager was good and did her job well but out to much trust in her underlings.
bad,There wasn't room for work life balance that is why I left. I wanted to start college and they were unwilling to accommodate me two nights a week. I worked nights to help them for two months after I handed in my resignation and got no appreciation at all. The Owners were selfish and didn't follow through on promises.
bad,"Wendys was my first job and it made me learn alot, I got experienced in fast food and that help me get my other jobs. When i go to the store now the place looked improved on."
bad,The typical day at Wendy's was stressful. It's a very fast paced job and it gets even faster during the lunch hour. Management was horrible and showed favoritism. The hardest part was working with the rude people who worked there and the most enjoyable was being able to see interact with the public.
bad,"I like it in the beginning , but it became more difficult manger and leaders wasn't going by book. "
bad,You get to meet various people but the amount of stress that you get from working there isn’t worth the amount of pay that I receive. Been working here for 2 years and still making $8.75 per hour
bad,Overworked management poor workers with poor wort ethic sometimes I wonder how some people that work here even get along in daily life because they are just not very smart
bad,i would not refer anyone to work here. it should have better management. it should have better training. the pay should be higher than what is is today.
bad,I worked here to able to support my own studies during that time. The work load is a bit tiring and I would not really recommend if you are a student at the same time because of the work load.
bad,"It is quite the adventure meeting new customers. But the downside is the management. They do not give proper breaks, employees will go full time hours without a single break! The hours have been cut and the manager is over hiring!!!!"
bad,I worked my hardest there for over a year. Just about everyone that was there longer than me had left. I learned every position and eventually left because the starting wage somewhere else was way more than what I was making there. The store manager wasn't properly running the store and none of the employees including managers were treated well.
bad,I don't really have much to say but pay was very low compared to other businesses and the management was a little off not very good fairness as employers work there per long but overall it was a very decent learning experience but I would work there again if there was a different crew. The hardest part of the job was just dealing with different personalities and that was very hard for me but i actually over came that and i'm proud of myself and when we have a big lunch time rush on Saturday's are the worst
bad,It has been so long ago I am sure many things have changed since I worked there. I Was a salary Manager so some of the questions that were asked did not apply to me
bad,"Working for this particular Wendy's made me question the fact if it was really worth working for this company. I am sure that the owners are great and only running business like is should. However the management of this store was highly unprofessional. I could not work in an unsafe, unethical, and chaotic work environment."
bad,"It suck =, i hated it there, the people where horrible both the people and the employs were crude and gross. the work environment  was chaotic at best."
bad,i only recomend wendys and jons like it for high school students or for someone looking for a temporary work place it is not a career driven feild in my opinion.
bad,Mainly cashier .some days a cook or dishwasher fast learner good pace.greeting customers making sure that they are satisfied with fresh hot foods.enjoyng the communication
bad,Wendy's is an okay place to work. With weekly pay and raises. It's fast paced. Managers are pretty decent. They 100% work around your schedule. And you start off at 8.25 an hr.
bad,Other employees are not very dependable. Managers are not very friendly. Workers do not work together as a team to meet goals. Would not recommend because pay was low.
bad,A typical day at work would be busy and then it would start to slow down. I learned communication skills while working here.  Not the best to work at.
bad,When I first started at wendys it was a great place to work but they take advantage of you when they know you will work over for them. They had me closing on school nights and they do not close till 3 am
bad,"My typical day at work was fast pace and just doing my job, while having fun with my co-workers. The managers were not good at all. They let everyone mess around and get away with a lot of things. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with everything when we had rushes, because everyone is rushing you to get them there food and you cant do anything about it."
bad,A typical day at work is calm but also stressful. There is many disrespectful managers that over power you because nobody will say anything about it. your constantly pushed around if you do not do your work to their liking.
bad,Wendy’s was a ok job at the time made good food gave me good hours it just wasn’t enough pay but at the time it was a job management was cool and supervisor was cool
bad,it is an ok place to work but if you have a family to care for dont work here. it is mainly for school kids that need a first job or for a second job.
bad,"i did not like working for this company it. the people there was very unprofessional, and did not work fairly. i would not recommend working for this company"
bad,it was a blessing to work for the company but their was so many bad things happening within the company. the manager (drama). This job didnt/dont appreciate hard workers
bad,it was fun to work for them at the time. all of the team members were very nice except for one of the managers at that time she was very mean to everyone
bad,"A typical day is dragging through a long day of hard work. I learned nothing, and was underpaid. Was terrible and typically had mental break downs. Managers harass staff relentlessly. The hardest part of the job is looking in the mirror and telling yourself you work for such a trash company. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving. I am 600% happier now that I'm gone."
bad,Count money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change. Greet customers entering establishments.Maintain clean and orderly checkout areas.
bad,Work day consisted of cleaning and working the first window of drive thru. Also I prepared certains foods such as salads and chilis and such and dealing with the register.
bad,I have worked at 2 different wendys locations. Both in different states. They both under pay and expect to much. this is my experience. If you need a quick job for a limited time this is a place to work.
bad,"Its not fun at all, it can be very stressful most of the times and is not really a job I like. I just want to find a new job already and move on with my life."
bad,"small area, lots of people running around and it is a clean enviornment to work in, meet lots of people and get along with the managers well. nice place to refer someone to"
bad,Ok it’s ok working there a lot of work but not enough pay no vacation time due to low staff they do have pto time (personal time off) but that’s just 2 days
bad,"Its your basic fast food part time job. Only minimum wage, some managers are awesome, some are terrible. Fast paced, be prepared to get yelled at by an angry customer for something you have no control over."
bad,It was very stressful t times and made me just want to walk out because people would always call of and i would have to work three different postilions
bad,"Ok cool I'm just got back home from the hospital I'm a great person I'm very outgoing hard worker good person to work with good personality"
bad,staff was too short and the pay wasn't very well. the work enviornment would be too cramped and you'd be required to operate the grill/fry station/ and front register all by yourself at times due to lack of staff.
bad,yea this place was basically worked work I mean you couldn't even look up without having to look you were doing something it was insane idk the managers now but when I was there they were pretty intense guys
bad,"In my opinion, when working at Wendy's I felt more like a boss instead of a crew member due to the lack of management skills by the manager and assistant managers. Whilst I'm training 3 new employees, the manager is usually sitting back in the office, even when we required help during busy times. I believe that managers should be younger mainly because older managers are typically cranky about every little thing and are usually not in the mood to work at all and are very tired."
bad,Wendy's had good customer service skills and they always were on top of making orders and getting people taking care of..  The employees were nice and helpful in every way.
bad,This place is very business. The benefits are good for an entry level position. The hardest part of this job is constantly multitasking to lead a team as well as prep food and accomodating for employees who are absent.
bad,"Low hours, promise of advancement that never happens, and bad customers. Its exactly what you would expect from a fast food franchise. Just all around bad."
bad,Was a really great place until we received a new general manger and we also got a new not so well company. Coworkers and mangers were loving and welcoming true long term  friendships are built while working there
bad,Good place to work in great co workers .nice respectable managers.  The food is nice clean environment. Its get pack some time they be understaffed. .
bad,"I like the food at Wendy's. I wanted to work up to a Management position, but it wasn't in the cards for me. I worked the cash resister and to orders and made sure the dinning room was clean and everything was stocked up. I also made sure the restrooms were clean and stocked. Made sure the till would balance."
bad,"Great company to work for if you are in the need of cash desperately. Fast paced , and very unpredictable, very few benefits,and no raises. Poor management as well ."
bad,The management for this place went down hill after a manager left. Was really hard on the new recruits and was harder on employees that they disliked.
bad,"The GM has a real bad attitude in thinks she can talk to you any type of way "
bad,"what can i say? its a job in fast food. greasy, disgusting,barely edible. not a place u wanna be. the people are great thow just like anywhere........."
bad,"i like the freshness in the quality of food. but i think the company could do better at choosing more efficiant managers. i like to do everything by the book, not pretend to or try to. do or donot. thats my personal opinion though."
bad,"Was promised a management position. The GM didn't work with me upon offering me that position. she just put it off, because she made it seem like I was not cut for the job. Some of the managers there, will drive their employees away."
bad,"i liked the job when i first started but as soon as people started to quit the whole store started to change , the managers shlwed their true colors and took their anger out on us ."
bad,Working with Wendy's was strange confusing frustrating at times..cook clean unload trucks etc..customers was great employees worked hard ..not enough benefits at times
bad,"A job is not a job. When choosing to find work, makes sure you find a job that you will love and cherish. Picking anything will get you no where. Know your worth and make good money."
bad,"I don't like it because they don't give you the hours that you need they only give you a few hours , and I would like to work at least 30 hours per week, and they only giving me 15"
bad,Employees was there only about the money they didn't care about what kind of food did they was given to the customer. Or how was they serving the customers. Long as the money was there they was good
bad,Good place to work for a part time job need to make the work place bigger It need better teacher the food was good I would work there again I made some good friends
bad,"The managers were ok, some were horrible. I wouldn't recommend any Wendy's unless you're a teenager or young adult or you like dealing with the public. Work conditions are ok."
bad,I am a hard worker. I pride myself in getting the job done so with that being said I definitely gets the job done. I'm always on time. I am a ppl person. I come to work with a positive attitude at all times. Most important thing is that I'm very respectful.
bad,I mean if you've ever worked at any fast food restaurant its not any different they are all the same every single one of them. You work your butt of for barely any pay.
bad,Took orders sometime prepare the orders. Had to deal with slacking employees. Like the customers we had a lot of older folks come in.  Always was stocked up keep a clean dining area.
bad,"Wendy's like any fast food I think make a great first job  or temporary position definitely not a job worth making a career out of. The pay is ok if you just need some spending money or extra cash, at least working as a crew member."
bad,They are not understanding and flexible with college student hours. they will give to graveyard shifts to high school and college students. managers do not help close either.
bad,I Liked The Job Until I Noticed How Shady The Managers Are They Have No Respect For Other Employees Because They Feel Like They're Higher Management They Can Talk To Us Any Kind Of Way .
bad,"All though my co-workers were very friendly and helped me out when I needed it. I decided to leave because one of the managers was pretty much bullying me. I was still learning how to go fast and run the fryer. The manager, who was a lot bigger then me and I am small girl, would bump me out of the way so she could do my job. There was hot stuff all around me and it made me nervous when she did that. I wish she would have asked me to move over so she could do it or something nicer then the way she did it. I also have autism."
bad,The store was very unorganized and unprofessional. The management was not very knowledgeable or helpful. I do not think I was paid fairly or treated fairly for the work I was doing.
bad,"Management does not care for your schedule if you are in school. Management is very cheap, provides used uniforms.  Not a place for long term development."
bad,"Basically, when i was working at wendys when i had to work we didnt get anything done because someone was always arguing for nothing while the manager is in the office on the phone."
bad,working here was stressful. Management and day to day opperations was not consistent. management was undetermined and unprofessional. seemed like they didnt know what they was doing
bad,"The company was a great place to work, the typical work day was consistent in preparation, but the flow was always subject to change, which always kept you alert. the hardest part of the the job was staying on top of the political climate that involved senior management. The most enjoyable part of the job was training  and customer interactions."
bad,"Very low return for the effort a committed employee offers. Hours are available, not due to sales based need but unwillingness of employees to put forth effort. Many accounts and stories of employees having their hours stolen."
bad,"Every time I walked in, the most stressful part was dealing with the managers. They were very rude and usually took advantage of teenagers that need money."
bad,"The owners kept paying me and my coworkers wrongly. The managers pick their favorite employees and treat them better than the rest. They let them sit in the back while the dining room isn't full so the customers dont see half of them being lazy while the unfavoured half does all the work.They let them go on breaks before the lesser liked employees. The managers dont give long enough breaks. Its hard to work a 9 hour shift with a half hour break. They take a few dollars off of every check to save for some big Christmas party that most of them dont even attend. i didnt even work there long enough to attend the Christmas party, i feel like they owe me for all the times they miscounted my pay."
bad,Repetition kills the job and the 9 to 10 hour shifts do not help either and I know it sounds like whining but there are only a few closers and the way they treat them is awful.
bad,"Not a very professional organization to work. A lot of politics went on. Wrong people in positions. i learned what not to do when I work for another company. The training was a joke!!!! You had to be responsible for your own training, with no type of feedback."
bad,"I mean it's a fast food job, it sucks but most of my managers were cool enough and the hours they gave were flexible enough but it's definitely not a place you want to work in forever."
bad,being yelled for doing work. I learned to not get in peoples way. management was not well. work place crazy. everything was hard. the most enjoyable was leaving.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is, everyday at eleven o'clock you have to break down the front grill and clean it. You also had to mop and sweep the floors."
bad,I did not stay long at this wendy's mainly because of the way management treated their staff. A few of them would call their workers racial slurs and would make other racist jokes about them when they weren't around.
bad,"Very inconsiderate when it comes to making the schedule especially for students  attending school, you request important days off weeks maybe even months Notice and they still put u on to work those days you requested off and then expect for you to look for someone who can cover your shift in order for you to get that day off i just think its unprofessional , your Employees have lives to live to , we have important thins for us to handle as well as yall.The days Management request off they always get for employees its an different ball game."
bad,A typical day at work would be cleaning the dining room and then during rush hour doing front sandwiches alone. At the end of my shift i would have to close the area and often stay past the time im supposed to clock out and would not get paid for it.
bad,Wendys was the worst job ive ever had. The store had really bad plumbing problems and it was not safe to work in the environment. I would have to clean by myself and nobody was helping
bad,"Working at Wendy's was stressful. The employees have to do so much that more than expected while getting paid low wage. It's all about favoritism and choosing. People don't show up or call out and we usually get slammed in the long run. We always ran out of supplies we needed like dish soap, food, cups, lids, and ect. One night we had a broken busted sink and we called our General Manager and he said just wait in the morning to call the people. The sinks weren't draining and it was just flooding back there."
bad,"knowing the menu by heart, dealing with customers all day can be hard. depending on you as a person period. getting free food was great! staying behind if employees doesn't show up can be annoying especially if you have something else to do."
bad,Management was poor. Not many people cared about their job and there weren't many consequences for peoples' bad choices. Hardest part of the job was angry customers.
bad,"Fast food has to b the most stressful place to work. There's poor management, the customers  are beyond the rudest people to deal with. No one wants to work as a team to reach our common goal."
bad,During my two year run at Wendy's I've had three different general managers in just my first year. I've viewed many unprofessional actions from not only crew members but from the managers themselves. These careless actions lead to miserable days at work. I was also under paid for my entire 2 year experience with a wage of $8.38/hr that was later raise to $8.48/hr.
bad,During my time at Wendy's the GM at this location had shown to be not professional. She did things such as promise pay raises to keep employees and then tell other managers that she was not going to give those or told more than what she would give. Most of the other managers were good and helpful. The GM here would cause more stress and frustration than anyone else. This is just one example of things that this General Manager has done.
bad,I only chose to work at Wendy's because I wanted to get a temporary job for the time being while I figured out what I wanted to do for my major career goals.
bad,"The employees at Wendy's could use some encouragement not only by other members, but from Management as well. I liked having regular customers with whom you enjoy. The food is ok and the environment is a little lacking. Overall, This restaurant needs serious intervention."
bad,"Not much to do and the job is only fun if you have fun coworkers."
bad,"Another fast food restaurant, just like any other. You need good personal skills to handle various types of customers and need to be able to prepare and handle food safely."
bad,"I would not recommend to anyone at all. their timing is horrible, they were disrespectful. Also, dishonest to customers whenever anyone came to speak."
bad,This place is for high schoolers and maybe even college students to work at. Not a life long career for you all. Stop settling if your over 30 and still work here. You can achieve way more.
bad,"The manager wasn't really responsible with the thing that happen with the employee,When I first got there,My second day working there they left me doing things alone,some of them I didn't knew exactly what I was doing."
bad,"I would come in and start working when I clocked in , me and my manager never really clicked so we didn't have a good work relationship I guess you would say so it would be just weird negative vibes but the hardest part of the job is going thru a rush and putting up with everybody's frustration but when we are slow we have time to talk, joke, and laugh about whatever."
bad,"its fast food what do you expect. the job was horrible, after actually working here i now understand why they hate their jobs and have more respect for them."
bad,The employees are ride and disrespectful to customers and fellow workers. Management doesn't reprimand the employees who are creating problems which causes the good employees to find new jobs
bad,"Overworked with very little pay, half of the staff is related somehow so there is favoritism and lack of respect amongst one another. Large communication barriers between half the staff, short cuts being made"
bad,"As a employee at Wendy's  you have to come to work prepared to work because once it gets busy you will not have a break until after lunch rush, Over all I liked Wendy's and the employees that was working there Wendy's has good fries and their vanilla frosty is Awsome."
bad,Every franchise is different I worked for a great one and a not so great one. If you need a job it ok but don't expect to have much of a life. As a GM you are overworked and underpaid. Went to another company as a GM and making way more
bad,"This company say that they support your personal goals whether or not Wendy's is apart of them, and refuse to work around any employees school schedule or availability."
bad,"I learned a lot from the GM at the Wendy's I worked at, he was very influential. The problem was not the GM, but the employees who work there. The GM trains the Assistant Managers very well, but the communication often ends there, or is relayed to the crew in an inappropriate or explosive manner. I myself was an assistant manager and was absolutely responsible for things like that happening, the stress from the job often weighs on you and results in things like that. Fast food is stressful in general, but Wendy's is so competitive it often ends in a high turnover rate."
bad,"The Boss not very nice, you would him something, he would look at you as if you was dum.he never would give you more money,  and if something bad had, he would not see how anyone was doing."
bad,"The workers are fairly nice and cool people, but the managers are rude, disrespectful to workers and customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is making friends with coworkers and seeing friendly faces."
bad,"Work culture there is toxic, very busy so constantly doing something, which wouldnt be too bad if there was enough compensation to deal with everything. Mangerial staff is okay. Hours can be frustrating."
bad,Good first job. Not too busy easy to learn and stress free. The managers were always easy to get along with and always got my schedule right because I was a high school student at the time so my schedule was very important.
bad,I need a job I have my first child on the way an I just won't to be able to take care of her an be the father I won'ted an I will really be dedicated to work any day any circumstances.
bad,Wendy's was a good place to work if you are a first time worker but my manager was a little rough. Angry for every and any little mistake a beginner team member could make.
bad,"My experience with this company was difficult.  The expectations were never clear, and often not communicated.  I discovered workers' time cards were being tampered with, and resigned when there was no attempt to stop the falsification of time records."
bad,I loved working with the customers and employees but it was stressful as far as being prepped for customer orders. I would recommend  this job ad a student opportunity
bad,"Unsanitary, bad management, bad work hours, unreliable employees, managers didn't care what happened at work, there was no room to progressed in the fields and when it was promised nothing ever happened."
bad,"The lack of the skill of higher management to get employees properly trained and to stay on top of things really brought down not only the morale of the staff, but also made working there stressful."
bad,"I honestly don't like working at Wendy's on sunset . Some of the people that works there is disrespectful . I personally think I would like working retail better , if not retail then I would like to find another job"
bad,Not very flexible. Not much work/life balance. Management did not support its employees. Slow to give raises. Did poor job of recognizing effort and quality work.
bad,"typical fast food chain experience"
bad,Could have used better managers. They also needed friendlier staff. Could be alot more professional when handling customers.  Managers hiring family members  and showing favoritism is not acceptable.
bad,"On a typical day i either worked at the front (cashier) or at the first drive-thru window.My first day they didn't teach me anything ,I just had to catch on. The management was horrible , there were too many people in charge or that wanted to be in charge.There were cliques within the workplace.The job was not hard,it was just really unorganized.The most enjoyable part was going home at the end of my shift."
bad,Workers would sit still and ask me to do something while I was busy although they could do it. Also it seemed like we always had to work harder when the store owners came there although the store should be always cleaned
bad,The crew was hard working. The management wasconsiderate to the needs of the employees. The hours were OK and if you needed to switch shifts you could
bad,its fastfood so it sucks now if this is going to be your first job like mine then go for it the only good thing tht came put of this job was the experience wen I applied for another job
bad,"It use to be a good company until it got bought out. Then new owners really don't care abuot their employees. They really suck. No vacation, 401k, benefits, nothing. Great job for high school kids, not grown ups."
bad,It was very unclean where I worked and the corporation between the employees was poor. It was a stressful place to work and the people weren't very friendly regarding my other employees.
bad,Good fast pace enviorment learned good customer service  and management skills. Most enjoyable part of job was the people that worked their where very helpful and friendly
bad,one of the worst job companies that I ever stepped foot in there lack of appreciation od dedication and hard work goes unnoticed and they also have poor management and training
bad,If you have an open schedule then you will get tossed around from shift to shift.Good luck making plans.If you have an availability good luck getting hours.
bad,Very unprofessional. Managers use drugs and gossip. Employees are rude. Maybe good for teenager but don't make a career from it. Find something better or only use Wendy's as a part time employer.
bad,"I returned to Wendy's because I had enjoyed many success's with them prior."
bad,"Definitely one of the worst locations i think you could find, they treat their store like its non existent. Worked here for over a year and a half scraping food off of grills and lugging trash out everynight after scrubbing the floors and vacuuming. Draining tons of deep fryer grease and refilling it typically being burnt on a daily basis. Always put my best foot forward for the company and i never got anything back after a year i was given a 15 cent raise thats it. I loved the managers i had for the most part the place was like family to me except a select few people and my gm in general was very distant. I'd recommend this job for anyone who wants to work their way into a high paced job because it gets crazy sometimes and you gotta do two positions it can turn you into a speed freak if you get it down. At the same time id say that its other then a free meal after work if you're lucky. Would recommend to try to find a new job ASAP if you have to be here at all it will only stunt your job growth."
bad,Not a very understanding company. Needs more communication and understanding. Maybe if u work for a different district. But other than that i wouldn't go back.
bad,"This job could really increase their pay, they only start out with min wage for people and this is not good. The managers are the only ones that make decent pay."
bad,Horrible hours. And customer service is hard to provide with so many rude people as customers. Minimum wage so horrible pay. No raises or benefits. However theres room for advancement
bad,The management team is very unprofessional and uneducated. This leads to poor decisions on hiring and being in control of your team. Team culture and moral were very poor.
bad,Its only good if you are a manager that will do what ever the district manager wants.  Usually the district manager is thrown into their job from general manager with no idea on what they are doing
bad,I've worked at Wendy's for 3 and a half years the job is a job. It doesn't meet my skill level I'm seeking other job employment for a better job that pays fair the nobis stressful at times but over all I think there some spac for major improvement
bad,not a fan; although they were much better than most at schedule adherence; work environment stressful; lots of drama and backstabbing; not a fun place to work for minimum wage
bad,"Its a busy company make great money.But need more workers ,paid need to go up more for the works that need to be done but its a good job for a starter"
bad,"This job was a little unprofessional, and the managers did not seem to care much about their employees. Other than that information I enjoyed working here."
bad,"they will hire anyone, like most entry level jobs. this includes the management. I liked some of the people but was a gamble of who would be respectful and would would not. this was a few years ago, hopefully this is changed."
bad,The job is overall easy. Assigned to one particular area for your shift. management was very good. Also they work with your schedule as needed. The only downfall with this job is not getting over 30 hours a week.
bad,If you leave for another job they lie about why you left on the papers. and say that you said things that you did not. I worked there for 7 months and they treated me like badly. I was one of the hardest working person there
bad,I cook and prep and sometimes I would do the dishes but it was not required. I would sweep the diner room and mop. I took orders and made burgers but mostly I work the grilled and fryer
bad,"Wendy's in Parsippany, on Route 46, is not a great place to work. They don't value employees, and treat the younger ones very unfairly. They also don't take action when an employee feels uncomfortable at work."
bad,It's an ok environment to work in. Can get stressful at times. But is very controllable if you know how to work under pressure. Staff and employee are very friendly
bad,Working there was very stressful and cut throat. We went through many managers and employees due to the fact that the company was very immature and unprofessional.
bad,"If youre a teen and looking to make money this job is a great summer job for you! Other than that, its minimum wage and not very life sustaining for an adult"
bad,A typical day at work included a lot more physical labor than you'd expect at a fast food job. No job security and almost always short handed. The job itself would be much better if the team had enough support to get things done.
bad,"I really wouldn't recommend anyone working there, The assistant manager will always talk down to you and degrade everything you do. The only good thing about working there was the employees."
bad,"free food, but i don't like working in hot environments especially if I'm gonna have to be in side so its not my favorite place plus its a food service and again not my first choice"
bad,A typical day at work was fast paced and busy.hardest part of the job was the cleaning at night.Most enjoyable part was being able to help the customers. Learned how to work a cash register.
bad,Wendys has an excellent staff n group of workers. Working as a team to get fast food orders prepared correctly makes the day go by fast and smooth. I also got employee of the month for my punctual time at work n dedication
bad,started as a kid.. enough money for a 16 year old. But i wouldnt work there as a adult. As a kid though staff is cool.. got to eat whenever i wanted lol.
bad,"overall a stressful atmosphere, employees were able to get along, however it was a playful environment rather than focused, work and getting the job completed."
bad,Not the best work environment. Not enough opportunity for growth and not the most stable job. Pay is minimum. A place to make some money and look out for new opportunities.
bad,I had a couple of situations were the managers were more laid back towards certain workers. I enjoyed working there just everyone else wasnt on the same page and you would have to do some ones elses job
bad,Worked there as a teen. It had the feel that things could get better in every aspect but I didn't stick around long enough to find out. Great job for high school students.
bad,It's just like any other fast food place. It gets hectic and is always a mess. Not a dirty mess just people not knowing what to do or how to do it. But it's a job and puts money in your pocket.
bad,The customers are great. Very fast pace environment. Management team was very linnet people. Work environment could of been better. Once you learn every position the job because very easy.
bad,Everybody is always in a GREAT mood and service is fast. Great management. Needs to be a little cleaner. Needs to close earlier. Good beffifits. Flexible schedule.
bad,It was always noise throughout the entire day. Management was very unprofessional and showed favoritism to workers who was there longer than I was and I thought that wasn't fair.
bad,I just needed a job to save money because i was pregnant. I was not treated fairly because i was pregnant. when they let me go try didn't even tell me they just stop putting me on the schedule. none of the same people including managers work there any more.
bad,"Your fast food restaurant experience is entirely based on the kinds of people that work at that particular restaurant. Everyone at ours was really nice, however the job is still the same. Its hard work and dealing with rude customers."
bad,This is a nice first job for people who are looking for a place to work around your school schedule. Always great experience with customer service and working under pressure.
bad,The hardest part of the job is making sure we keep the ling moving even when we have large orders. We have nice loyal customers that come very often.I learned how to move faster and get the job done quicker.
bad,"I used to work as a order taker in the  drive tru,I learned to communicate to  the people,management is good,the hardest part of the job is multi tasking and  I enjoyed the job because mostly of the employees and managers are nice."
bad,fast food place my first job ever its was not the better place to work just because it's fast food there nothing good about it.just not good at all did not like it
bad,"Management is awful, underpaying their employees(after multiple employees went on paycor and found out themselves), awful employee attendance, slow paced."
bad,I would have to ask people for help and get a reply within an hour or so. I tried and tried to keep up with the people but they didn't try with me. I didn't work there very long due to this.
bad,This is an unhealthy work place. The people i work with are mouthy to the managers and i just don't participate in acting like a fool at work. My day consists of taking orders and handling food. I love my customers and thats what keeps me coming back. I am a people person and i am often encouraged by others there telling me that i have a positive attitude. I do my best to up lift the other employees but the management is acting as an authority. There's a lot of uncivilized actions going on behind the counter.
bad,A great experience as for as staying busy and not getting bored.  Good place to meet good people. Co workers we're good at helping me learn when I first started there.  The management  needs more work.
bad,"Cashier/Crew Member	"
bad,nice place to work for an quick income if you have never had a job before Wendy's will get you prepared for a real job one day it will teach you how to build you customer service skills
bad,"At days it can be very stressful just because its a fast food restaurant, but my co workers make it fun there and easier to work. i been working there just to save up for a car."
bad,"The management could be better. When it comes to advancing in the company, a lot of lies are told just to keep you around. You get cut early from work to ""save labor"", so you won't get to work all hours scheduled, and end up with a small check. The general ,anger is rude and childish."
bad,"General cashier duties"
bad,"Did not enjoy working here, the customers and staff were horrible. (Take note that your experience will vary based location.)"
bad,No clear direction...promise work life balance but dont do anything to help. Goals unrealistic. Labor allowance ridiculous forcing management to overwork
bad,"Took orders, served customers, made change, restocked and cleaned."
bad,"When i worked at wendys i was opening every morning,   i also did prep work ,count the money for the shift ,i was a cashier  and i also cleaned the whole store even the offside"
bad,"Well, it's wendy's...nothing more I can say. I am pretty sure the manager slept with employees, there was favoritism. Not where I'd want to be after 17 years old"
bad,"Wendy's biggest draw on customers is their never frozen beef, but one of the biggest turn offs for employees is the terrible management, poor pay, even poorer hours, and sloppy training."
bad,Not a good company to work for. They promote people that  are not ready to be promoted. The GM has faves and does not treat everyone the same
bad,I worked hard and didn't get to do much i Learned a lot from a lot of people there it was a very fast paced place to work. I wish that I never worked there ever and this stuff needs to go away so I can stop
bad,great day with great people good vibes great for a first job would recommend for highschool kids and for people that want their first job to be fun this is it !
bad,"A typical day I would be at the front register , taking orders, making orders and helping customers. I learned how to handle angry and frustrated customers in a calm manner, how not to panic when a rush comes through the store. The management was almost never clear with instructions or  announcements in general not very co-operative with co-workers.The workplace culture was mostly upbeat and friendly but there would be arguments sometimes. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with the management and the angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to play around with your co-workers."
bad,"I think Wendy's needs to hire more managers that give flexible hours and schedules. As a teenager, I need to get my schedule ahead of time to determine my weekend plans for example. If i have a big project coming up, i would have to call wendys to make sure im not working and if i am, they would not let me call out. I would also work more than the state law says a minor should. This is why i put my two weeks in and had a mutual agreement with my manager that i should not work there anymore."
bad,This job was way to demanding for $ 7.25 a hour. Was very high paced and there was a lot of people working in the kitchen at 1 time wich made it uncomforted;e
bad,"Wendy's overall is a great job to start off with coming out of high school. It is also a good career job if you choose to be in the fast food field, good pay over the time you've worked there."
bad,"Normal fast food restaurant. Customers make the job pretty unbearable, but if you have the right co-workers, they make the job worth it. Had to stand for 5-10 hours."
bad,"The management had a lot of drama and were judgmental. Hours were cut after the minimum wage was raised, very slow service at times. Overall, not a good work environment."
bad,"They are helpful, kind , sweet "
bad,This was the first fast food place I worked and I did not enjoy it. It was not managed well and there was a lot of unnescaey drama that didn't need to be in the work place.
bad,Wendy's managers could learn to use positive reinforcement instead of finding every little mistake made and being grouchy about it. They also shouldn't involve employees personal lives in a work environment.
bad,this is not a good company to work for the manager have personal relationship[ with each other and that bring personal conflict to the job the manager only like to hire friends
bad,"all of the managers are rude , the managers blame everything on the crew members so they dont get in trouble with the big boss. i would recommend to not ever work here"
bad,"This might sound crazy, but I actually enjoyed my time for the most part with Wendy's. I liked the fast pace, the constant communication between crew and managers, and the happy customers. Unfortunately, I had to resign due to a disagreement between my District Manager and myself in regards to my wage when measured against my proficiency as a Assistant Store Manager and the amount of hours I was working on a regular basis."
bad,Wendy's was my first job and I am grateful for the experience. I learned how to treat customers and how to provide good service. The hardest part of the job was odor the food would leave on my clothes.
bad,"The owner is only interested in what you can do for him. He does not value his employees, He thinks that everyone is recyclable."
bad,"Fun place to work if you get along with your other co-workers. Management was sloppy because they didn't know how to schedule people accordingly to what they requested off. The hardest part was handling the drive-thru window. Your job when on drive-thru was to make drink, take orders, and coordinate the orders yourself for the most part,definitely difficult for inexperienced workers that haven't ever done a fast paced job."
bad,"Terrible management, low pay, insulting staff. its like you give your all and in return ,you get 5%.the hardest part to please management. they don't care about customer or staff. its all about money."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone trying to get a career at Panini's unless they are really in dire need for a job. It is not a career and I would only recommend part time because it's easy to want to leave.
bad,"Getting bossed around, learn one thing and barley anything else, co-workers put you down, being alone in the lobby or back is the best."
bad,a job is a job I keep doing the same reviews for nothing I need the application. it doesn't matter what job it is I need the application notthis run around
bad,When I first got the job it was a fast working place. Then it got slower and i was starting to be given less hours and wasn't such a great work team so I put in a two weeks noticed and got a job at colony brands.
bad,"long days and hard work, bad management, good for part time work for extra money, always all over the place and never have things worked out"
bad,This job allowed us sales associates to have fun with our customers. Mainly the kids that came in the store to play with all the toys. It kept us busy and also keep us up on the newest toy that came out.
bad,"Thank goodness they got a new manager because they were cruel to workers and would always have two people working while the rest were outside taking a ""smoke break"""
bad,hard working dont like much ffast foods . ddiidnt have a good experience in wendys . managers were rude . disrespectful . dont pay good . dont aprercciate your work
bad,"Everything about wendys was good; almost everyone was pretty cool, we all got along very well, we were all pretty good friends with each other"
bad,I liked who I worked with but they had so many employees that I only got to work one day a work for 3 hrs. Then when I needed time off to do things for school on that one day it became a problem.
bad,"Cashier, drive-thru, sandwiches. Fast going service. Coworkers and managers aren't so professional.Hardest part of the job was working drive thru because you need to be a good listener and try not to give the customer a wrong order. Enjoyable part was half off the food."
bad,Not a very great place to work as far as management goes. Very enjoyable workers and customers. No form of flexibility at the time and very poor judgment on the treatment of customers not a very great area but the management should focus more on the buisness and not the location
bad,"a typical work day was easy, except orders were always made wrong and stock on certain foods were always low. Management would not help when needed and sometimes couldnt be found. the  most enjoyable part of the job was being able to correct problems and satisfy the costumers. Management often switched our schedules at time of shift."
bad,Lots of work cashing people out and preparing food lots of standing gets very busy workers were okay the food is goo though
bad,"the job wasnt that bad just didnt like it when new management came into play. they had some favorites and didnt seem to care to get ""rush ready"" once we had finished lunch."
bad,I was working here during Highschool good job while your a kid. Not for the older people have of my co workers at the time were adults. I didn't stay for long because I didn't enjoy it
bad,"When i first started at Wendy's i enjoyed it a lot. Then, the work got more and more frustrating and i wasnt advancing at all. My manager was very unfair in some cases and that made working for her difficult. I never once recieved a raise.. I didnt like that."
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job was when we got rushes from busses and I got to see how good my skill were and got to challenge myself.
bad,Wendy's was a great company but don't pay their employees enough. I was young didn't have any responsibilities that's why I work for the company and also help me with my experience.
bad,Some people are content staying a long time at this job.  Patience is a virtue but in my particular case I just don't have the time for them to remember the good I've done for the company and show genuine appreciation
bad,"The general manager there likes to talk down the employees and other management. I find it very insulting, I have tried to talk to them but I get overlooked about they talk to everyone. Which causes them to have a high turnover rate.."
bad,"I worked there as a cook for a short period of time. It was not very rewarding except that I met great people. I would like to point out, that the GM was kind enough to allow me to learn enough before my departure."
bad,"The Wendy's for which I work eagerly provides their workers with many hours. They allow you to pick which shifts you would prefer to not do. I've recognized my skills in fast food through this company. However, the manager and district manager are extremely strict and don't allow you to miss work regardless of the reason. They threaten to take away hours if you don't comply to all their standards, many of which are extremely unnecessary (such as wearing only black socks or dress pants)."
bad,A typical day at work would be coming in and begin cleaning. I learned from Wendy's higher ups to always have a clean work place and be punctual at all times. Management wasn't the best but it did show me what good managers do and what poor managers do. My co-workers were the best part about working there. They were always friendly and constantly joking but still able to work hard and make sure the job gets done correctly. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with rude customers but now it helped me with my people skills and learning to deal with unruly people.
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's consisted of me taking the drive thru orders, collecting the payments, making the food, and keeping my station clean. I learned the value of co workers, and how important they are to your work day. The management was in between good and bad. One manager was excellent and everyone enjoyed working with him, but the other manager was not that friendly. She ended up getting attitudes with her employees, causing a lot of problems for the co workers. It was not all that bad though. The hardest part of my job was probably not letting the anger from my manger get to me. It could be hard to get through my shift when there was constantly a manager yelling at the employees. It was stressful and made it hard to concentrate. The most enjoyable part of my job was probably the friendships I made, and getting to work with all the diverse people. I got to know a lot about different backgrounds, ethnicity, and religions."
bad,clock in then go straight to work. Talk with management when you have issues. 10 minute breaks between shifts. able to talk with co-workers while not busy.
bad,"A lot of unnecessary drama."
bad,Very hard working as a crew member this was my first job ever but it was very awesome to work behind a fast food counter because i always wanted to know how it will feel to work behind a fast food restaurant.
bad,Not enough pay to short of shift. Unfair scheduling and hours. Their was a lot of favoritism. It was a go work experience.
bad,"- Take food orders in large quantities following the menu plan, process and prepare food orders with delivery of excellent customer service"
bad,"come in start your shift your your position and go home . making sandwiches  and cordnating orders ,keeping enough product cooked to run the store"
bad,working there wasn't all fun but i made the best of it by helping the hungry and sometimes angry customers. lol the management the wasn't doing there job right schedule was all over the place because they was hiring people left to right knowing that there was to many people on the schedule
bad,Working at Wendy's was a memorable experience. I learned  much about responsibility and hard work. I made friendships and grew as a person as a result. I plan on expanding my horizons and continue to learn from my job.
bad,"It was nerve wrecking being the youngest manager working there, but i learned alot from everyone and it was hard at time but it was a good place to work, if only they gave raises better and on time and didnt push their employees to become a manager so fast."
bad,"This was my first job and my worst, I liked it for certain managers but others seem to take advantage and also had a terrible attitude, it was hard to work for people that acted like they hated Wendys and hated their workers"
bad,"Good place to work, the schedule is very versatile, the job is also a little physically demanding. The weather conditions take their toll on you."
bad,"You would go into Wendy's and wash your hands imminently. Then go to your station( drive thru, sandwich maker, ex.) You would occasionally do prep work for the salads and making sure the sandwich makers always had supplies."
bad,A typical workday consisted of taking orders and preparing food to be delivered to customers. I learned to be patient with customers and management. My co workers were somewhat friendly most seemed judgmental when small mistakes were made. The hardest part was keeping my interest throughout the day. Most enjoyable would be twords the end of my shift.
bad,little hours little pay no benefits  hard work unreasonable expectations to accomplish non general tasks co workers were very unfriendly
bad,Been there for about 5 years as crewmember and only had 1 raise. They will call you sometimes on your day off for extra help. Very high turnover rate among employees and management.
bad,it was ok place to work at the mangement wasnt that good everyone kinda played but got back to work but it was an ok place to work.
bad,"worked as a cashier so my job was take care for the customer."
bad,"Working in fast food is such a cliché only because the poor management makes it that way. The blatant disregard for students or those who wish to do better for themselves. Refusing to allow proper breaks to those who are over the age limit. At the location I worked, the employees weren't even allowed to have a small cup of soda without consequence. The employees work harder than what the general public acknowledges."
bad,Working at the Wendy's in South Carolina was awesome the people were a lot friendlier and made the experience fun! I enjoyed the team of people and having them around.
bad,"was mostly very quiet days"
bad,"Its ok to work there just need better managing skills, My co workers was nice we all got along as team members Ive learned how to multi taks and get things done in a timely manner"
bad,I worked for wendy for two years. This was my first job. This company never gives raises. They also don`t know who to give details about there benefits.
bad,"•	Gained customer service, cashier, and food preparation experience. Worked well as a team member to complete restaurant tasks."
bad,Enjoyed working here for the most part. Was good for first job training. However managers cut hours back to one shift a week. Tons and tons of bias amongst the work place.
bad,Job was very insecure and management was not willing to work with schedules considering i am a college student.I feel that we were overworked because i used to go home every night with a sore body.
bad,"You are constantly moving and staying busy. You meet great people, however it can get tiring when running with a skeleton crew"
bad,"I would not make a career out of this job. But, it taught me how to be a good employee and the importance of good customer service."
bad,While working at Wendy's I encountered a number of different attitudes and personalities that I strived to understand and look past. But it taught me a better work ethic.
bad,i would go to work at 9 am till 2pm and try to engage with as many customers as i could while standing. i would take a 30minute break just to rest my legs then go back to work. i had to have a phone that had a camera and internet which was not fair as i was looking for the job beacuse i needed money to buy those needs. payment would come after the monthend on the 15-17th of the new month and this was also not a good thing. the hardest part of the job was that you had tohave the phone and airtime so you could send back feedback. what i enjoyed about the job was that i worked only 5hours in a day.
bad,Wendy's was ok but the customers was not to nice that why I left the managers was not to nice but I just stayed there until I found something new
bad,"This job requires a lot of work for such a small pay. The hours are long the work is hard. This location never has people working at night so 2 people are doing the work of 6 people with the same amount of pay. No holiday pay, work long hours on holidays, no free food as compensation for the work done, compensation does not equal the work expected to be done by one person. The management lets people get away with everything, so others end up doing too much work while selected few pull slack. Management has been caught changing peoples hours. Not a lot of growth unless you go corporate."
bad,Run cash register. Make orders accurately. clean dishes and bathrooms and dining room. Work the drive-thru. Treat customer with respect.
bad,"It was not so good of  a job to me. The people was rude to me. They didn't wanted to offer any hours. The pay was okay, but could be better. They didn't really work with you, the managers and the whole overall experience wasn't joyful at all."
bad,Came to work and made the best of it.  I learned that wendy's was a place to work and nothing more. m y co workers were there making money jus like me . The hardest part of the job was communication with foreign workers . the most enjoyable part was getting paid
bad,I loved this job the eviroment and the team members are awesome. It is a fun and challenging job at times. you get free soda and food and discounts. You have opportunity to grow and move up in the company also.
bad,"It fast-paced environment, greet guest and service there food coordinately, but it okay. manage always seem stress and upset. You get alot of hours"
bad,"First of all location was the best thing for me,  I stayed on time for my shift. It's a good start for beginners, I really didn’t have any problems with the manager or any of the crew members.  I like to be responsible and organized, but I am eager to learn new experiences and have a steady Job where I can depend on as well they would depend on me, and grow alone in experiences with the company, and that is the opportunity I am looking for."
bad,"I was working at Wendy's to get enough money to pay for gas so that i can go to school, and pay for my phone. i did not feel that i was being treated right and it was getting in my way of pursuing my dream."
bad,"Worked very hard at a fast past, always aimed to provide the best customer service, I love doing my job. A typical day at work would be for me to provide help were it was needed. Was on sandwiches most of the time. I was the fastest sandwich maker. I Learned the customers were the company in it self.  Management was a No GO. Managers could've showed more management skills. Co workers barely showed appreciation to the job, calling off, late, est. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep everyone together so we can service of customers with respect , quality food, fast service, with a smile at a timely matter. The Most enjoyable part of my job was having a family outside of the family in my house whole."
bad,A typical day at wendy's consisted of coming in and having to deal with the managers that worked there. Didn't really learn anything there but how to keep my mouth shut. Management was bad i don't think they knew how to run a store on their own shift. My co workers where great team players helped me with a bunch of different problems. The hardest part of my job was learning how to to everything and close the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was my employee's and how we interacted.
bad,"I was the employer of the month for the year of 2007;I was the best waitress they ever had in order to get the job done. I  know what to do without asking any question about what to do or not to do. Well I have learn how to fix sandwiches and know what to put on the sandwiches. We have to make sure that everything is on the line instead of walking back and forth getting something for the line. It is very important that you make sure that everything that you need is on the line before you start fixing sandwiches. It's good to work with your co-workers because you need somebody to talk to. You don't have to tell them your business. Because they will take your business the wrong way. The hardest part of the job is that keeping water off the floor. If we don't keep water off the floor people will start slipping down and  start hurting themselves. You don't want that. { true}. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I like to do is clean the kitchen, washing dishes and taking messages."
bad,Good company under payes micromanagement long hours can be stressful. Poor social vs work life balance. Overall good brand but disagree with management.
bad,it would be fine if i didn't have the worst bosses in the world that actually cuss me out in front of coworkers! word word word word word
bad,The reality of it is...the title says it all. This job is just something to have if you have no major debts or dependents. You can work for some years before you see advancements.  I just so happened to be lucky.
bad,"This is a fairly simple job.  As a general associate, I cleaned the back room and work floor, watered the various flowers, and occasionally worked the registers.  I worked here for maybe two months before they ceased giving me hours.  They had little to no respect for their younger, female employees and hardly listened to advance requests put in for the next week's hours.  To return to my first statement, they employed me at their location on Route 73 for two months and, after I called weekly for my schedule, told me to stop calling.  They insisted I instead wait for them to call me.  I was never called and quit."
bad,"It started off well, until the co-workers and mangers started to become very unbearable to deal with. Lies, rumors, and people business was being thrown around. No one cared if they hurt someone's feelings. It was just a stressful environment."
bad,"I'm glad I received the experience from working at Wendys, but it was not a job for me. The two supervisors were opposite people and would tell employees different things."
bad,"I would come to work a few days a week, 7:30 p.m.- 4 a.m."
bad,"This wasn`t a good work environment at all. I was called down, talked down and called names while working here. Constantly yelled at in front of customers, everything was so disorganized and the kitchen/back room was a disgusting . Cleanliness was out of the question. Never will I work in a Wendy`s restaurant ever again."
bad,"I didnt like working here, this experience wasnt like enjoyable, it was not a job id recommend for someone whom cant deal with tons of people. or any one with an axiety disorder"
bad,"one of the worst companies to work for, the management is one of the rudest the co-workers are the same and disrespectful"
bad,this job provided poor work gave us less hours they even give us our checks really late we never was on time to start work we always get out of work late
bad,"It depends on what mood the manager is in. Some of the managers make it unbearable to be there. To much cleaning that will not be seen by customers, being to specific on certain things that need to be cleaned."
bad,"Not really a good job, the money never match the work you had to put in. Lack of team work, managers unavailable, as well as unsupportive."
bad,The worst place that I have ever had to put up with just to keep a roof over my head. Nasty people and buildings with low standards. The prime example of a franchise that is tight waded for their deep pockets sake and not the business sake.
bad,"I did my part by cooking on the grill and dishwasher, other employees around me did not do there part and people would never wash there hands while handling food."
bad,Managing people and overseeing food safety procedures along providing customer service. Learned how to deal with problems on the fly. Co-workers many times are unreliable. Hardest part of job is finding good people to surround yourself with. Most enjoyable is satisfying customer.
bad,"Was good in the beginning but during late fall and winter they cut my hours drastically, not a good job to depend on to pay bills and student loans."
bad,I worked at Wendy's hamburgers right before I went to Dollar general. Wendy;s was a great place to work but wasn't making enough money.
bad,"I worked here previously and the managers were very inconsiderate about everything. I had severe morning sickness while working there, and they were extremely rude and would make me cry almost every day before I finally quit. Both managers and crew members would use their phones on shift when they should have been doing other duties if no customers were in the store. Managers would make crew members do their duties, and then sit on their phones texting. Honestly it was the worst job I've ever had."
bad,This was just a beginner job that i first started out with. Did not enjoy going to work very much if at all. The work was not fun but the people were great.
bad,WhenI started I had decent hours now i dont get more then a day my knowledge base is great but managers hold grudges and dont treat u fairly
bad,"If you've never had a job this is good for you. Managers don't care until things start going wrong, then they lose it. Upper management could care less about your children and any situation that would cause you to put your personal life first. You are expendable, but its fast food, its a jumping off point."
bad,builds your customer service skills its a good starter job nice for someone in high school
bad,"Owners are never seen, and problems with equipment take months to fix. Standards are not enforced across all locations, no accountability for the GM's they just do as they please."
bad,this job was definitely the worst job i ever had. the managers where rude and all the staff smoke marijuana and wasnt ran right at all. very nasty inside. i got so tired of all the cons to the job i walked out one day and never came back whatever you do dont work at wendys.
bad,"At this job,it was ok.On a typical day i prepared food and drinks for customers,I also took customer's orders.I leaned how to work with food in a fast pace environment.The hardest part was when i was working a station by myself on a busy day.i enjoyed learning new things."
bad,"A lot of the time the way your shift went depended on how the rest of the crew felt that day. The morning crew and night crew didn't help each other during transition periods. I liked working on the cash registers and changing my accent with every customer, and helping people get what they wanted and keeping them happy. The hardest part about the job was staying out of the drama, the co-workers were mostly younger and loved to talk about all their problems while on the clock, and that makes it hard not to get involved. I cared about my coworkers but sometimes i just wanted to do my job and not have to here about some ones boyfriend cheating on them or how this person likes this person, and it is just unprofessional! The managers would all get involved in the drama also. It was like a small family but sometimes it would get in the way of the job."
bad,"My daily duties consisted of prepping the food in the morning, and working the cash register, cashing customers out. I learned about the struggles customer service can come with. The management was not very impressive, the store could have been ran better with more team work. The co-workers were nice but I felt as if none of them cared about their job, and were just there to get paid. The hardest part of my job was pretty much being on my own with no management help, but the most enjoyable part was the hours I had scheduled."
bad,it was a lot of hard work with little benefits and no job advancement and if yes you will not get paid more then 10 and hour this job isn't a fun job unless you are assigned anything above GM. but by being in this environment i have developed my leadership shills and learned more how to manage. Wendy work culture is very independent you do everything and get paid 8.00 that's just reality.
bad,It was a decent job in the fast food industry. It was a learning experience of how wendys food was prepared.
bad,I would tell anyone just graduating high school and looking a part time to apply.
bad,"My day at work was stressing cause I had no one training me , I had to learn my self , all I learned was  cashing and I loved it . Management and co-workers was rude to me and harassed me and made me feel uncomfortable  but I need the job for my child . That was the hardest part. Keeping a smile . What I enjoyed the most was nothing ..."
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be, setting up the lobby for the customers. Prepping the food we were making for that day (lettuce, tomatoes, tea, etc). Then I would be working the front counter and take customers orders. At the end of the day I would clean up and call it a day."
bad,i need a job that requires me to be moving around on my feet staying busy
bad,"I would come in and find out what position I was in then I would begin to clean up from the person before me. then I would do the usual taking care of orders and customers."
bad,Very busy and fast paced job that I didnt get to stay long due to the lack of hours
bad,"Very fast and always busy. I was always doing something. I worked the register, cleaned, moped, cooked on the grill, washed dishes and salad prep."
bad,I really dont have an opinion about working here. Not much else to say.
bad,My nights started at around 8 and during that time I would be cleaning and help out by making the food.
bad,It is a job really that is all you can say about. If you are older then be ready for high school all over again.
bad,Typical Fast food job. Once was stolen from .Good workers but bad management.
bad,Food preparation in the drive thru areas. Getting the customer's orders right and out the window in a timely fashion. Management was sub par. Most co-workers were more concerned about being on their phones or goofing off. But I did enjoy the fact that there was always something to do. Times seemed to pass very fast.
bad,There was no help from the upper management. The benefits that were allowed were unattainable with the store that I ran.
bad,"The manager didnt really seem to care about the employees very much. However all of the employees seemed to work together well, but my training and management could have used some improvement."
bad,"The crew are really undervalued and treated as a pool for potential managers. Lots of pressure on management team to retain people, but without any benefits, vacation or service rewards, there's little reason for them to stay on once trained"
bad,"I learned a lot, worked for a while, was treated unfairly but I stayed because it was a steady income."
bad,"this company is also a great stepping stone. Not a place to build a career but, it will help you get where ever you are trying to go."
bad,"at wendys i have learn most of my customer service skills by this being my first job in life. I love coming to this job and seeing that staff, the day went by fast and we had great customers."
bad,understanding the the operation of a fast food restaurant. great experience great management
bad,Was okay didn't prefer to work here however it was a job which meant I had an income.
bad,This job had a lot of ups and downs. A good motivation to finish degree.
bad,"Too many friends working together"
bad,"I was hired sometime in 2007, that being said,"
bad,Not the best because it was fast food. It is a okay job for your first job.
bad,"I am the assistant manager for Wendy's I have been working in custmer since 16 and it is something I enjoy doing."
bad,Bad Job!!! Worst Job. Treated people like dirt. Bad pay and bad benefits.
bad,I feel like the management is a little off and the pay to work ratio is poor.
bad,"This job provided everything you would expect for your first job. Little pay, Easily replaceable. Management does not give much respect and take advantage, overworked for the amount of money you are being paid, etc..."
bad,"Supervisors fudge numbers"
bad,"A typical day at work is coming in with a good attitude doing my checklists and getting ready to run my shift."
bad,"This store was not managed well. The GM prefered to have illegal aliens working two shifts everyday, than to provide other employees with options of working more than 20 hours a week. The new GM is working hard to changed that in this store, but I simply could not stay. I moved too far for the pay. Plus, I was steadily working for a management postion for a year. The old GM kept telling me next we'll get you started, then next, the the next. Finally I got the ok to take a safety management class on my own time, the were to pay me $150 when I completed the test. Not only did they not make me management the didnt pay me for my time. I was looking to moving up in the company and make a career for myself."
bad,"• The franchisees hold all of the power"
bad,"This was my first job. I was still in high school while I was working here, just worked part-time to get some extra cash while I was still in school."
bad,"management dont care, they push and push and push. not a good place to work at all"
bad,it was at a fast pace everyday of helping customers on their needs
bad,I quit working their due to personal issues with a manager who lied on me to keep her job
bad,"learned an finished all of wendys WE-LEARN in two weeks"
bad,"I worked there for almost a year and the store manager cheated me out of money. I love being able to meet new people and insure customer satisfaction, but every one that started working there got a raise within 3 weeks and I was still being paid minimum wage . I worked hard and asked for a raise but nope didn't get one. I worked every position possible and was never appreciated. My manager always told me I was her best worker but never actually showed it."
bad,Part time job while I finished High School. Taught me responsibility and good wok ethic.
bad,The work was fast paced.  i learned that sometimes i would have to work harder to compensate for the other employees that did not work as fast as i did. The management was adequate. My co-workers  were good people. The hardest part of the job was that it would get hectic when the store was short staffed. The best part was the fact that it was a challenge an i like a good challenge.
bad,"This was my first job ever, there was mostly high school kids there and everyone was very nice even though we all knew we had terrible jobs to do. This job is not for someone who doesn't like to get dirty. It was hot, fast-paced, and intensive work. Some of the job tasks were ridiculous, and only made things worse when customers started coming. Sometimes I felt like I wouldn't be able to make it through the day because it was just too busy, but we made it happen. It didn't feel good knowing that I would probably never move up in this job, so I got another one."
bad,grill and food prep after lunch hours slow down they have me clean tables down and pick up outside. management good on keeping everyone balanced.
bad,"good place to work, friendly coworkers. restock incoming shipment."
bad,"wendys was a fun place to work but a lot of younger people work there so it was more arguments than the normal work area, they have nice people though management was very unprofessional they are very young which may be why but i was being harassed it was taken very lightly so it was either deal with it or quit so I chose to find a new job."
bad,I would go in to work at 4 pm and get off at 2:30 am. I learned how to move at fast pace at work. The hardest part of the day was rush hour moments because co-workers wasn't doing their jobs and I had to do their jobs for them. The most enjoyable part of the day was when the front lobby had closed because we got time as a team to slow things down and people came together as a team.
bad,"Everything was very typical, and easy to perform, the employees were verey young, but it still provided the dedication needed to suceed in the job field"
bad,"it's a long day, management is fair.  I learned how to grill and show up on time.  The most enjoyabel part of the job wasn in the morning  when I got to make breakfast, its easy"
bad,A typical day was not easy. You had to pull most of your co-workers weight on your shift. Other co-workers did not want to work as a team. And management did not manage at all really.
bad,"At the Wendy's in Rochester i didn't like how management would argue on how employees were doing wrongful things, but then turned around and did the same thing."
bad,Working as a team is very crucial in developing and executing assignments to maintain a crew at it's highest level of readiness.
bad,"Provided excellent customer service skills, making and preparing the orders."
bad,"Stressful work environment physically and mentally. Great starting job, but nothing beyond that."
bad,"preparing meals and beverages"
bad,It was very unorganized and sometimes I felt that I did not matter. I never felt secure in my job.
bad,I absolutely hated working for Wendys Honestly. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers even if they were rude and nasty I rather deal with them than the staff Management was horrible!!!!
bad,"Tasks were simple, positions were easy to handle once you get the hang of it and the atmosphere was fast paced. The downside is that you must know your worker rights: reviews were not made within 6 month periods for lots of employees, promised raises were not granted and advancement was not granted for the most deserved workers."
bad,"cook food, and stock before shift ended for the next day or cook."
bad,Great job for people to gain experience in a restaurant.  I've learned a lot from the managers and that lead me to become a sous chef.
bad,"cleaning"
bad,"I spent one month over the last summer working for a wendy's location owned by Valenti management. It was not a very pleasant experience for me personally. Training was both inadequate and inconsistent, with protocol changing from staff member to staff member. Management was not very observant. As a location for my first job, I learned very little."
bad,"•	Take and Prepare orders"
bad,"I started at Wendy's the last weekend in April and have been working there constantly since then."
bad,This company is alright to work for. The people are ok. They get the answers you need fast.
bad,Working for wendy's is a little tough Im a shift supervisor and I do way to much for 9 dollars an hours working with the co-workers is a little hard only because they was doing the blame game like night shift verses day shift
bad,was a great job with alot of new things to learn learned alot of manage skills doing this job 
bad,"work as a cashier in the drive thru. Used to work a double person job, knew all the work including making sandwiches, register, almost everything, and training the new crews, trained almost about 10-15 new employees."
bad,"best thing learned with crew members how to make burger, frosty"
bad,hardly no hours. only about two days a week. training was not very explainable.
bad,"Working in a fast food restaurant, anything can happen. A fast pased environment can deffinately teach you how to memorize orders and prices quickly. This job experience is all around great as a first job."
bad,It was very hot My manager didnt really like to work with me on my hours he would cut them sometimes other then that I enjoyed my experience there.
bad,"Hours were harsh, the management was horrible, the customers weren't too bad. Some were more difficult than others."
bad,a typical day at work i would write reports locate lost children
bad,"The hours were atrocious. You could be deathly ill and they still wanted you to come in and handle food. The overall exp. could be summed up as a ""high school like atmosphere"" Good Entry level position but not worth the compensation"
bad,"A typical day is going in to help customers. I help all my employees. I can do just about all the job positions when needed to. My managers are very demanding and rude. This has helped me to learn to keep a cool attitude and just do my job. The hardest part of my job is dealing with my managers. They are very rude and seem to enjoy belittling everyone. They have singled me out as someone to be ridiculed, but I don't let it get me down."
bad,I really don't have anything good or bad to say about this job. it was a decent job also.
bad,This wendys on Adams avenue is not worth working at there no hours available i would only advice ppl in school to work here.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of customer service, food preparation and general house-keeping. Not a bad job to have if you need a steady flow of income. As far as skills go, the most notable ones you gain would have to be cashiering, communication, and the little things you pick up in the kitchen regarding contamination, preparation, and procedures. The hardest part of a job would be the co-workers and managers that party together. Favoritism runs rampant but as long as you're there to work, clucking from the chicken coop will hardly bother you. The most enjoyable part of the job, hands down, is the customers. You get a few sour apples here and there but sometimes you find a good story or personality along the way."
bad,tiring and fast paced at getting the orders out quickly .
bad,The old Wendy's International was way better to work for than the current Wendy's Company. The old Wendy's International actually cared about their employees. The new Wendy's company does not treat people well. This is not the family oriented company that Dave Thomas had established.
bad,"Wendy's has some VERY friendly employers, minus the management team.Management wore their feelings and hardships on their shoulders. If they were having a bad day, they acted rude towards every employee. If they were having a great day,then everyone else has a great day."
bad,My day at work consisted of me preparing line and get things ready for when store opens. I Learned how to set up line and set up frosty machines. The management wasn't very helpful in my case. The co-workers I met were nice and easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job was getting everything done within the scheduled time. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the new people.
bad,its a good job if your in school or want something part time but not for a career
bad,some days its dead so there not much to do but other days it busy so you stay busy
bad,Routine fast food restaurant with management and cooks in coherence with customers ordering there food. Co workers were not too many and shifts were very long.
bad,Everything you imagine fast food to be and more...
bad,You served customers daily and you also had too have a bubbly personality too work there
bad,my job was to take orders from customers and also keep the dinning room clean.
bad,The best part of you're day at wendy's is to be able to make every guest happy with their visit.
bad,"Its a good place to have a first job but not something to keep as a career, unless that's what you want."
bad,"Getting to work on time, then clocking in and getting my headset in order. I learned the cash register pretty fast. Management was a little difficult to work with, but i managed for seven months and that was the hardest part to deal with. The most enjoyable was making customers happy at all times."
bad,I really have no comment except that they needed better mnagement skilss and more pay.
bad,i was making sandwiches and wraps and when not busy cleaning the dining area. didnt talk to the co-workers alot mainly stayed to myself.
bad,Typical day at work would be long boring and hot. The manager was mean and rude and didnt respect others
bad,did performances required of me. people were fun. Management was fair. I learn how to clean baseboards the correct way.
bad,Its hard working fast food.. Smelling like fried food all day long. working with people wasn't bad.
bad,"I worked for Wendys(Pisces Foods) for almost a decade since I was 16. I moved up fast and at first being young I thought it was awesome and overall it was at first. As I got older and learned new things I moved from a hourly manager to a salary. But as I got older I started to realize that this company was somewhat cut throat, working in salary you really only got paid for forty and I was at times working fifty plus a week. They want to pay you for less than you are performing. I went back to Wendys last year thinking it might be good going for another shot, but this time it was really bad off, lazy management, upper management not knowing really whats going on in there stores but wondering why they were down in sales. It wouldn't matter if you worked for this company for one or twenty years they will tell you one thing one week and the next sit you down and fire you. They said my reason ended up personal, personal is really child like and I'm thankful that I got out of that atmosphere, two faced, politics and if your not kissing...then your job no matter how well you perform is in jeapordy."
bad,they expect you to do everything perfect for a low income. I go into work at 6pm and have to start to pre close aleady because we have to leave everything spotless by 1:40am. if we're not done at 1:40am then they clock us out and tell us we still have to stay and finish our job.
bad,It was an okay environment . did not really get along with people. managers always had attitude in their tone
bad,Even though this was only a summer job and pay was way below average it thought me a great deal about time management.
bad,Did not like working there. Everybody is rude and I did feel like i got paid enough.
bad,".Transactions made in the restaurant (in-house), Transactions made for the kitchen and service area, .Accounting daily collections. Recording account transactions and calculation of daily, weekly and monthly collections. Managing the cashier's desk - Receipts, credit card bills, invoices (in certain restaurants), basic amenities (in smaller restaurants) like straws, serviettes and plastic food: Preparing foods for customer."
bad,I started out as the front lobby person it was hard at first but the I got the hang of it they eventually moved me to drive through and that’s where I got really confused as things got hard then I quit
bad,Make less than minimum wage and work just as much and as fast paste as others getting pair higher wages. Managers are lazy and dramatic. Job can become problematic since people bring their outside problems inside.
bad,"My total work experience is that of a crew member to a shift manager in training,  The biggest and most important downside of working here at all, is the pay.  Nobody gets paid enough, including management.  With that, you are expected to crank out beautiful food with a smile all day long with little breaks or downtime.  Once you start working, they will try to have you work as much as you can because they are so desperate for good workers to stay.  The workers that do work mostly get along because they're so stressed out that the blame can only be pointed at the awful pay, and ridiculous incompetence of the management."
bad,"Working for Wendy's or any fast food establishment is good for anyone trying to get into the work field. It teaches cooperation, work ethic, efficient yet speedy work, and other essential skills. I'd recommend it for people who want to climb that specific corporate ladder or for those starting out in their work life."
bad,"a summer job. a basic means to aquire an income.This is not a career path but an excellent way to aquire some financial stability. There is quite a bit of versatility, but you have to be able to managge stress very well."
bad,"This company is very friendly and welcome for a period of time, however there is no stability or respect. Very rude and unorganized slow working paces which caused unhappy customers"
bad,"When I would arrive to work, the people working before me had little to no control over the flow of customers. Typically, I would arrive at 4:00 PM and leave at 11:00 PM-- even having specified I would only be able to work limited hours due to schooling and whatnot. The most difficult part was moving traffic flow in and out of the establishment while also performing upkeep and customer interaction. I did not enjoy my job."
bad,Felt lost most of the time due to no managerial supervision. Everyone was confused most of the time on their job location and was constantently moved postions and sreamed at in front of customers.
bad,I love my job it's just the people I work with and the pay. The manager plays favoritism and very young minded the workers are weird. The pay is trash. And not worth the hassle
bad,The managers have favourites and the co workers do what they want and when I do it I get in trouble. Managers are rude and unprofessional. They all speak in their own language.
bad,"Working for Wendy's wasn't the best for me, they were not flexible with my hours. Wendy's was always understaffed and make it very hard for night shift to function. Wendy's will cut our hours! I was not pleased to work for Wendy's."
bad,This company was not the best when it comes to making sure the workers were in a comfortable environment. Most times the managers would behave in an unmotivated and unprofessional manner which resulted in the the employees having little interest in doing their job.
bad,"Don't get paid enough to deal with customers, 90% of the time people are high off there mind. Every 6 mouths they think a 50 cent raise is a lot of money,"
bad,"I am a special needs employee that suffers from joint pain and anxiety. At the interview, I was assured that this would not be a problem and accommodations would be made. (I.e. shifts no longer than 6 hours, switch tasks when symptomatic) This was a lie. When I was actually on the job, my symptoms and requests were wholly ignored or otherwise regarded as intentional bad behavior. Is it really too much to ask that I switch from manning the register to cleaning tables for a while? One of the franchise level supervisors witnessed me having a panic attack on the job and was appalled, yet no change came of her remarks. (When confronted, management denied all knowledge of my condition despite being explicitly informed multiple times.)"
bad,"The pay was pretty typical, $8/hr. I wasn't expecting much and the management was okay. My only complaint is the conditions of the building. It was always hot, there wasn't a high standard of cleanliness, and majority of the time it wasn't busy and they would ask if you wanted to go home or they would cut my hours. The only good thing I can think of is the 50% discount and the regular customers that would come in. It taught me how to manage myself and work fast, I left for college after 2 months."
bad,You have to be able to keep your area clean and keep up with orders when in the drive-thru. Learn each area because that helps to keep your time below two minutes.
bad,This job wasn’t too bad as a start off job but as I stayed the job got worse and the way all of the employees were treated got worse. We always got told to shortcut around our jobs even if it was unsafe or unhealthy and treated young workers bad because they knew we would either stay because we had no where else to go or another group of teenagers would apply within a week or so.
bad,"I worked at this store (Huron & Adelaide) for a few years and became a full time crew member. "
bad,"The management is short employees. They don't approve of shift changes. They will ask for you to work all hours and give you no choice. For anyone just looking for a temp position, it is great. That's about it"
bad,Wendys was a good begginer job. Starting out there as just a crew member there was plenty of oppertunity to grow within the establishment. Perfect job for high school students or parents looking to work around childrens schedules.
bad,There are miserable 40 year olds that work there that are so depressed with how they life turned out that they will try to make your life miserable as well
bad,"Although I enjoyed my time and experience at Wendy's as a teenager, the job does not pay enough to afford to live on your own and does not offer any benefits."
bad,There really was no typical day everyday was different. I really didnt learn anything because all they did was make us watch videos and just put you to worl with no help. the workplace culture was very bad. They yelled all the time if you did something wrong even if you were just starting.
bad,"Worked over 50 hours a week and refused to make me fuii time. Didn't feel like I belong there. Customers were rude. Some of the policies made no sense. Figured you ""lived to work"" not ""work to live"". Way too many sacrifices for a job that wouldn't put any vested interest in you. If you're in management you're figured to work without breaks. Burn out is a thing there. Turnover was too much! Couldn't create a community meaning training new employees was constant and when employees were finally there for a while they were driven out of fired. If that is what you wanna deal with that's ok but there's better jobs out there that pay more and requires the same amount of experience."
bad,"The management, when I worked there, was a total mess. The machines were in less than ideal condition, everything was quite ancient. The staff was typically nice, the customers were too."
bad,"The job itself is fairly easy to understand and get a hold of. Really your experience at the Wendys really depends on the location you end up working at. I've worked at wendys for 3 years and have met some really cool people and had some really fun times, but the atrocious excuse for ""management"" is definitely an issue that seems to plague many different stores. Being there for any extended amount of time doesn't get you anything aside from a little paid time off, and there really is no incentive to go above and beyond in this job anymore. Busting your a** and running around every single day for a fast food restaurant is a little bitter, especially when the 60 year old man who stand at a grill and doesn't move for 40 hours a week and just flips burgers is making the same amount as you."
bad,The hours was good . There was a manager that was very unprofessional; sometimes manage wouldn’t really care. They were all about the customer first and even when they were wrong they still was right
bad,i experienced a lot at this Wendy and i also learned a lot but the scheduling would be messed up and all over the place including the store. everything would be crazy.
bad,"Working at wendy's was stressful, quickly paced, busy, always doing something, short breaks, not the most exciting place to work, you would take orders, stock sauces, stock salad dressings, drop nuggets and fries in the fryer, cut bacon for burgers"
bad,"The only benefits from working at Wendy's  is the work experience. I gain more experience in customer service. I had many opportunities to improve in different areas, such as cleaning and organizing."
bad,"Wendy's is a terrible place to work at in Sudbury, managers are terrible with their employees and don't know how to treat them. Do not recommend working there"
bad,"It can be a lot of work for very little pay. They took employee vacations away after a year of service, and that's just wrong. There is a lot of honest really hard working people that are dedicated to the job, that are completely being ripped off by corporate America."
bad,It all depends where you work. It also depends on the hours and your position. They want you to make sure everything is done on time even when it's busy.
bad,"I can't speak for all Wendy's since they are run by different franchises but Wenco Ashland/Wooster is not recommended. They are very cheap and pay poorly. When equipment breaks they don't get it fix promptly or all at. We had a broken sandwich station for months and that was a large concern since food we served would sit on it and get to room temperature when it should be kept below 41 degrees. It took them literally over 6 months to get someone out to fix it. Surprisingly no one got sick from it. Crew and management that had been there for a considerable amount of time were not offered raises or any bonuses and they put people in charge who have no business being in charge and if the store is shortstaffed you are expected to work an unethical amount of hours to make up for the lack of employees. Definitely would avoid. They act nice at first and welcome you and call you part of the ""family"" but really they don't care about your well being and will get rid of you faster than you joined the company."
bad,"Working at Wendy’s i learn more about how to make food . But management isn’t well at all. Nobody knows how to do their job , nobody cares enough . Also people come and go everyday which isn’t normal."
bad,"Ive been at the Niles, MI location for about 3 months now and I already hate it. Management has been on my case for so many little things, that I'm not even sure why I was hired. I got yelled at for doing anything except the dining room. Was promised more hours, more register time, and some delegation so that not everything fell on me. To no avail. I work 3 hours at a tim, which works great for school, not for summer"
bad,Job is not bad. The managment is not fair and stresses you out more then the job does. As long as you have tough skin shoud have no problem there at all.
bad,"Many of my co-workers were very lazy and sat in the break room for most of their shifts, which made me stress because the customers got angry at me for it."
bad,Couldn't get hours..worked with children that wanted to play!!! They needed a more mature staff to get things dun!!! U had to go outside to get stock..cups.napkins.ect!!!
bad,This was a good opportunity as a first job while in high school however the management was very unprofessional. The job was very drama oriented and the management was always feeding into the drama which made it difficult to work at times. The unprofessional behavior is what lead me to seeking a new job. I was taken advantage of a lot by management but I was a minor so I didn’t realize it until I eventually left.
bad,Like most fast food restaurants Wendy's is fast-paced and very demanding with little respect for employees.  I recommend this job only as a temporary job for those who need a little extra money around the bills.
bad,"Unfair and hostile work environment. It felt like slamming my head into a brick wall to get anything done or figured out"
bad,Job is hard at times. But sometimes it's worth it. Would be nice if they offered better benefits. Would be nice if they actually cared about their employees.
bad,Paycheck is a paycheck in college. Not much in terms of career advancement or compensation for the hard work. Job is simple but can get stressful during peak periods.
bad,awful place to work at. Worked there for 4 years learned everything there and still got no type of raise. stayed at 10.10 the whole time i've been working.
bad,"The whole store is falling apart, in need of a new staff and more managers. 'very fast paced and the pay is horrible. The entire store just needs a revamp and better pay"
bad,Wouldnt recommend this job to noone managers are very rude and disrespectful they work you like its only you on the shift they arent well kept on cleanliness
bad,"Well the Wendy I work at the Manger was poor everybody talk behind  others back I don’t recommend this place for anybody in less if you get a new manger staff. They showed a lot of favoritism even tho it was fake because they’ll talk about you when You leave . An a place of work we are there to work not to gossip . There all they wanted to do was be in everybody else Business.  Have to go up an beyond doing work because the job would rather hire high school kids that don’t want to work or just come in stand around , don’t do as ask , or got short term memory or something"
bad,"A typical day for me would be doing one of the opening shifts from 730-4pm"
bad,Poor management and  communication skills as to getting schedule. Received payment within 4 months later but woking there was fun without the problems.
bad,a typical work day for me requires multi-tasking doing multiple job titles. some of my managers where ok others where very picky but I had to leave because I was changed to night shift without notice; although I tried to make it work it just went against my daily life.
bad,As manager view must check all employees' department to ensure proper procedures and no half work. Needs to improve communication to get things done. This company is still working on staffing and not just staffing but finding the correct ones to hold the business.
bad,Wendy's expects a lot from crew members for low pay. Crew members are not subject raises nor holiday pay. Even shift managers pay is very low which is unacceptable.
bad,"I worked here for two years and the managers were great but the environment was very stressful. Many of the coworkers were rude, people were over worked and the pay is minimum wage so you could definitely find a job that is less stressful for more money. Many customers would cuss you out over a frosty or mustard... it wasn't the nicest environment to be in. "
bad,"I discovered I need to shorten my hours due to anxiety and stress, while remaining at a constant due to bills that I needed to pay. They cut my down to a few hours a week, very far below the minimum hours I needed."
bad,"This particular Taco Bell was not one that was very organized. The management was one who probably one who should have been reported. ( when it was not only rude to the accociates but the customers too) you know it was needing some help.. the place also needed to read up on why to wear gloves when preparing food with your hands. They did not wear gloves and wear handling lettuce ,  tomatoes, bund etc. with there bare hands. It has made me think twice about eating out at all .. I always think... who’s hands were in my food"
bad,"Most of the people worker there were high school students and most didn't have a real work ethic and the others, who were adults, mostly did what they wanted. Several times people never showed up, didn't call or anything which left everyone else to stretch themselves thin trying to cover for those who never showed for their shift. Few people were willing to perform to their best ability or help others. They were there to get money and that was it."
bad,"I don’t think there was any advancement for me at Wendy’s. The district manger was understanding about me taking time off which was very rare but I didn’t get to work many hours when I was available. I didn’t learn any new positions there, I did the same job every day."
bad,I hated working long busy shifts without breaks or food. Getting paid every two weeks wasn't fun either. And it was always a lot of drama and non work stuff going on.
bad,"The overall job wasn't bad but the management sucked, particularly the store manager because she has a bad attitude. The job was easy and fast-paced but 6 month reviews/evaluations were never done so whatever wage you started at is the wage you seemed to be stuck with."
bad,This all depends on the city county and state but the of the locations i would say yes.With proper documemtation that allow you to work in the U.S. This question is best suit for corporate.
bad,"There is a huge disconnect between the culture they think they have and the culture reality.  Not a whole lot is being done to fix it.  they keep talking about how they want to, but simply arent"
bad,It's a job. It has dysfunctions like any other place. Simply put if you are looking for a stepping stone..Have at it. Highly stress full and lots of playing favorites.
bad,"not a hard job, but i wouldn't work there again unless i got paid more than what i was (7.25 hourly). despite that the workers and managers were okay and the food was good and well peeped."
bad,Ive worked at 2 different Wendy and they are all the same super poor management no discipline no origination. its acceptable to be late and call out all the time. there are very low standards and they pay sucks.
bad,"Fast Pace all day long, focus on customers and the business"
bad,"Wendy's is a job for individuals still in a high school setting. It only pays its employees enough to make their car and insurance payments each month plus a little extra left over. The notion that anyone could, or should, survive on this wage is absurd. "
bad,"In the beginning, it may seem like they have things put together, but in reality, they don't. The ship they run is highly chaotic, when someone isn't calling out last minute they're not showing up for their shift, and don't get me started on their poor ordering habits. Unless you are keen on running around like a chicken with its head cut off and essentially working alone depending on what your role is, I highly recommend you don't apply here. On that note, odds are most fast food businesses are like this so, keep that in mind when you apply."
bad,"The management is extremely unprofessional, employees are treated with such disrespect. The employees are not trained right, so then we get yelled at for not doing stuff right. Constantly getting yelled at for other people wrong doings by management."
bad,"The ones that work, and do their jobs get left with all the work to do, with no praise, everyone else is late to work and on their cellphones texting instead of realizing there is an order that needs to be attended to.. and you don't get benefits unless your a manager, nor do they give holiday pay, or bonuses.."
bad,"A typical day at work, for me would have included, arrival, getting harassed by the manager about my uniform, sometimes getting sent home to shave was part of the whole thing. Arrive again, start making sandwiches, taking orders from not only the dining room, but also the drive-thru, fastest paced job I've ever had and if you dont make the sandwiches right the customer is mad and if the customer is mad then your manager is mad. Not the best position for someone just starting out in fast food. Work place culture is laughable. One African American male, who was probably the nicest person on the staff. I learned that working in fast food is just as bad for you as eating the food. Hardest part of the job was dealing with a middle management floozy who over exercised her power as manager. Most enjoyable part of the job was walking out on said manager."
bad,"After working here for so long, i am realizing i am not getting the pay i deserve for everything i do. Had 2 raises taken away because minimum went up. I noticed i work really hard everyday and find things to do, and keep getting overwhelmed with my workload while certain employees get to go on breaks and get away with doing far less work than me for the same pay. I hate this place and want out."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the drive through and interacting with customers. The management at Wendy's was not the best, but I did maintain some bonds with fellow co workers."
bad,"It's stressful, tiring, and unexciting. The one positive thing I can say about this job is that it certainly gave me plenty of experience with the worst kind of work environment. I feel like most other part-time jobs that I might get could only be better than this place."
bad,I worked for Wendy's for about five months and the entire time i only worked a full thirty hour week twice in my career here. When i was hired I was promised full time 40+ hours a week.
bad,"Could be a wonderful place to work at if the people in it actually wanted to be there and wanted to work there and show up in time."
bad,"work for the company to long with no help for advancement from the company itself, just your typical come to work do your job and make us money and maybe we will try to care about our employees."
bad,I learned how to communicate with others well. I learned about team work and how important it is with a fast pace job to make the customers happy. You have to have the food ready and fresh in order to keep people coming back.
bad,"Wendy's should offer employees a higher hourly wage due to the heavy and consistent business on a daily basis. The reason for that is employees deal and serve other people all day. Meet humble costumers and rude ones as well, so to compensate work an extra dollar or two will reflect in their commitment."
bad,You can make really good money if all you do is work. Raises do not come very often and when they do it isn't even worth getting. You literally bust your butt for nothing. Not worth the headache and stress. Especially if you are raising a family.
bad,Wendy's is an ok place to work if you have no other option but I suggest searching for a different position. It's very repetitive because you do the same thing everyday. Also management could be better.
bad,"The job it self was fine, normal things that you would think take place in a fast food restaurant. However, the management was quite rude most the time."
bad,"If you just really need a job fast, this is it, they'll hire anybody. Management are jerks with zero regard for employees. They'll schedule you however they feel even outside of your availability then pretend YOU'RE the one that's in the wrong."
bad,Have to be a multitasker. The duties are not that hard to accomplish. I learned a lot when it comes to customer service and the workplace culture is well managed.
bad,Management here wasn't the best. They don't communicate with each other or do the jobs they were supposed to. For the most part they were pretty good working with your schedule.
bad,Usually only 2-3 people working at a time during rush hour. Managers don't care if you're not doing your job properly. Frozen food gets dropped on the floor and then picked back up to be cooked regardless.
bad,"I liked working there but with any fast food business, it can be slow and pick up all of a sudden or the opposite. The coworkers were good to work with but the store manager was not very good at giving schedules or working as a team. I understand she has to be more tough because of her position but she wasn't doing what she needed half the time and wasn't a very good boss."
bad,i love working at Wendy's at first; then some of the managers started to be very rude and hard to work with. the managers came to work with bad attitudes almost everyday. they never called me by my name. They just didn't care enough to learn it.
bad,extremely hard work for little or no compensation. expectations too high for the environment and hours. management love to embarrass you. food is good and the quality is ensured.
bad,You will not feel so much welcomed. They will not give you a lot of hours. At least they did not give me enough. That was my reason for leaving. But some of the employees and managers were nice. Others were really rude to me and yelled at me for making mistakes and I had just started.
bad,Atypical work day at Wendy's was non-stop cooking and cleaning I learned how to make burgers better and that's about it one of the managers there was always bitter and very old and didn't really like it when everyone was happy and talking around her hardest part of the job had to be cleaning the fryer those things get messy the most enjoyable part was the Wendy's discount.
bad,"There's a diagram that hangs in Wendy's that describes how many workers should be available for differ work flows. The least amount is five at it slowest for closing, and I've closed on many occasions with me and one or two other people."
bad,u could end up learning everything many oppurtniies to work up in the company and so many advancements u could learn grill and fries and but the customers were hard to deal with
bad,I want to leave this job because there is no future for me here on a longtime basics it won't help me lead the life I want to support my family and myself at the same time
bad,Working here your expected to life for Wendy’s. Family and personal life is all suppose to be worked around Wendy’s. The ritch owners took away paid bereavement for employees
bad,"Very stressful especially on drive thru, barely have people to help, is non-stop and customers are relentless, needy and annoying. management is mostly cool but they work you nonstop and past your hour but dont pay you for them. Scheduling is good, crew is nice, place is clean."
bad,"I worked a lot of hours with little pay and no help."
bad,Someone is going to get sick from this location.. It is only a matter of time. The employees responsible for food preparation and cooking DO NOT follow proper protocol. It is a disgrace to the field of food service.
bad,"Most enjoyable moments are making items, and running drive-thru. Hard to move up in the store; no matter how much dedication you provide or dependent you are. Management never listens to your availability although they insist you provide."
bad,My days at Wendy was very challenging and unrewarding I worked too hard and did not received comparing salary. Manager was very irresponsible to the plight of employee ware fare. Too much work done with little or no lunch.
bad,"my review for wendy's cooperation is that i was station at the front register,taking orders,food preparation,bagging orders, tasks at the front register was the restrooms at the end of the night and front lobby.i made warm sandwiches,making new food,using the fry station.i liked the grill i liked the work."
bad,"Repetitive and Unfulfilling work. Management emphasized speed and quality customer service for the sake of the customer despite there being little to no benefit in pay raises or other compensations. Expectation in work environment to teach yourself different jobs that arose as needed to save management the effort of actually training you. Decent upward mobility for fast, very hard working, and self driven workers. Work environment was at worst tense in confrontations between management and employees and at best relaxed and somewhat aloof on more relaxed days."
bad,The last several years at Wendy's the team at the headquarters continues to be concerned on they next to be asked to leave with the business model moving towards Franchise locations owned.
bad,Unfortunately while working at Wendy's I dealt with a lot of very rude customers & a lot of unnecessary drama between coworkers. A few coworkers caused hostile environments & made working there very difficult.
bad,Very busy very fast pased job. Knew what i was doing liked the people i worked with just didnt like the way theu did certain things. Def pay was low. Should of been way higher.
bad,The cooperate culture is concerned about the bottom line. the staff is on a revolving door. you are constantly training new hires who do not last. It get old quick.
bad,The only thang about working for Wendy is I get all my hours I want. I love working as a night crew. I taught my self pretty much while I been there since 2016. Wendy is an easy job to do. The thang about it is there pay.They don't pay people what they deserve to pay. The GM is great over there.
bad,"Had 3 different managers while working there.  The first two were good, but the last one was in the wrong position for his attitude toward other employees."
bad,The managers are rude. I wasn’t scheduled for work for nearly two months. My pay got deducted due to the company not having anough money. The only good thing about this job was that the coworkers were nice.
bad,Worked here for 7 years. The co workers are cool but that's about it. It is a paycheck and a stressful job. Fast food managers are always on the highest horses and they can't seem to get down....even with help..
bad,Working for fast food can be difficult because your meeting  new people with different attitudes everyday & sometimes your coworkers aren’t the friendliest but overall I enjoy the fast pace environment
bad,Wendy's was fast-paced and unorganized place to work. The pay was the worst because it was minimum wage. The managers were rude and the workers didn't work together.
bad,This.place was horrible do not work here very people management and not good to customers. Worked for a few.month and had to find a new job . they just allowed people to do whatever they wanted with no  consequences
bad,Wendy's crew members and management can be really laid back at times but it's a really fast paced job during the rush hours. The pay is minimum wage and they over hire so you might barely get any hours.
bad,Good place to work. Fast paced needs improvement.  Pay decent. Training good. Will work around schedules. No time off but will allow flexible schedules
bad,Upper management doesn’t care about you and gives no time off for family emergencies if you’re a manager cause they “had no one” to cover you but I enjoyed meeting lots of new people
bad,"working at wends can be fun, it has great discounts , but one thing to keep in mind that on busy day this job can go from a stress level of 0 to 100 in a split second"
bad,"Wendys wasn't a particularly good place in which to work, especially if you are no longer in high school, because of the was certain people in the managerial staff were toward other crew members and the inconsistent hours"
bad,"This job was my last resort job, I never wanted to work in a fast food restaurant, I just needed to because no where else would hire me. I wasnt going to college"
bad,I had a problem that couldnt get resolved without me being transfered i already drove 45 min away an they wanted me to go farther i have 2 small children i didnt want to work farther away
bad,"Most employees are fresh out of high school, they don't know the value of gaining work experience. It's not an easy job, it's fast paced and takes a lot of customer service skills."
bad,"As title states, the pay is low. Only 5 cents above minimum, and it was expected to go up $.10 a year. (That's less than the average cost of living increase). Only benefit is half off your food while working, otherwise it's non-existent. To be expected in fast food, environment is hot as the sun and the oil is disgusting. Had to clean it daily with a glove that was leaking and even after complaining about it, was told to deal with it. (300+ degree HOT OIL, and you just deal with it?). Hours are few and the pay was garbage, so don't expect to pay any rent, even as low as $700 a month."
bad,"I wouldn't go back working for wendys bt,I wouldnt say I dislike it either. Wendys not a bad job,I guess it was the environment or the people that I was working with."
bad,"This was an okay job for me. I worked throughout high school so they pay, hours, and scheduling wasn't really an issue at the time. They switched managers very often."
bad,It wasn't a good place to work because managers were disrespectful. Other employees were stealing.They didn't want to work with me with my schedule because i had moved and couldn't work certain days. i asked to get transferred nothing was done. Just awful. But that doesn't mean that's all Wendy's the mogadore rd one.
bad,this is not a good place to work but it does have god food. I'm not sure if it was just because the location I worked at but I wouldn't recommend that location to any one
bad,Wendys is a very good company if you are high energy and good for customer interaction. The hours are long for management . But it's fun with the right people .
bad,"Working here was definitely not fun for me. If you're great at multitasking in a fast paced environment then this is the job for you. I feel like i didn't get the sufficient training i needed. The managers were not very friendly or understanding and honestly made it harder working there. I don't feel like they listen to the feedback from their employees and they don't really take your preferred schedule into consideration. I had many coworkers who were also attending school at the time and found it very difficult to do both and still live their lives. As with any job, you will encounter very unhappy and unfriendly customers, however i did find there to be more of them while working here."
bad,"very busy stressful"
bad,good to work if looking for a job for the first time. Lots of pressure and loads of work. coworkers are helpful. fast paced environment to work. Expect you to work anytime they call you even if you are busy with something important.
bad,"At Wendy's, the people working there are nice. The job is overloaded with many tasks where the manager usually sits back and doesn't do much. The hardest is multi tasking since front cashier covers both drive thru and front cash while restocking and cleaning dining room. The most enjoyable part is talking with the customers and just having regular day to day conversations with people enjoying the food."
bad,Management was bad and hypocritical when it came to how things should've been done and ran. Food was good and you have a big discount but its not enough for me to recommend going to work here.
bad,"Working for wendys company for 9 years my job duties were a drive thru operator, front cashier operator, sandwhich maker and i also presented orders.The company offered only health care insurance associated with company,flexible work hours, if worked over 9 hours a half hour break and paid vacations after a year."
bad,"I would arrive to work at 4pm or 5 pm depending on when I was scheduled and I would have to work all the way till 2 or 3 am to close down shifts. I would see so many hazards and try to fix them and make them right but if there was another manager they would look down on me for fixing the safety hazards. it was very hard and stressful. Management was ok but two managers thought they were all that while the GM tried to instruct our employees the other managers would override his decisions. The hardest part was trying to get respect from the two other managers. The best part, again was the customers that came in. Some of the employees actually became my good friends after I had left the establishment."
bad,"Typically try to get your to learn all non-management positions. But you only get a raise once a year and it will be up to a 10 cents difference and decrease over time. Overly dramatic employees, with the occasional disrespectful customer."
bad,alot changed seems like corperate doesnt care just work and shut up they stress out the managers who take it out on the crew. no one is ever happy at my location or any of the ones around me only good thing is the family i have found there but that has to do with the people the job still sucks i normally take time with reviews you know check spelling well thats how much this job has me not caring now this is the review they get!!!!! half trash just like them
bad,Wendys was a good job for my first job when I was in high school. However I needed a little more out of it and that could not be provided.  There was also a lot of drama constantly.
bad,"Working there was awful. It's not very hygienic to have sick workers handling food. On the few occasions where I called in because I had the flu, I was denied a sick day. I was forced to come in to work. This is unsanitary in the food industry and disgusted me. Not to mention, the management was highly unprofessional, bullying myself and others on a regular basis."
bad,This was my first job in college and it was good until I wanted more money. Fast food places in general don't pay as much as retail or other areas. The hardest part of this job was having to close and having to wake up early for morning classes the next day.
bad,"It's a fast food place. What more can someone really say? I worked there only because it fit my hours I needed for daycare, so it was great they worked with me on that. Pay was horrible. Considering I could go across the street literally and get hired on at McDonalds for nearly 2$ more!!!"
bad,I have learned alot as a manager at Wendy's it's very fast paced and you have to be ready for any and every costumer I have learned to deal with costumer and my co workers with respect because respecting your staff will lead to you having a more successful day every shift you work.
bad,"This wouldn't be so bad if the management made up for the staff but they are worse and in ways that they will talk behind your back and try to get you in trouble over nothing, this is coming from a current manager here, the worst part is that the owner had no clue what he's doing he's the most immature out of anyone there, now this is only the location in mount pearl"
bad,an great place to learn and grow and learn and become the BEST restaurant manager one can become!!!! The company truly cares about TRAINING TRAINING TRAINING TRAINING TRAINING!
bad,I don't recommend working there. My last few months working there was a complete disaster. Nobody took the job seriously but me. I worked so hard for nothing. But I learned so much. And I'm highly trained on customer service
bad,hated working here. the pay sucks no benefits and the managers don't know how to manage! you work long hours and get treated like badly and no one helps you out.
bad,"Wendys was very fast paced, working there has taught me how to work under pressure and how efficiently work in a fast paced environment. Management was okay, was hard to get heard. But it is good place to as a first job."
bad,"The way that the Wendy's worked is that all the managers where best buds with each other, so they would all be friends and friendly with one another, but to anyone else they would react negatively to them and give them a hard time for nothing that they did. Pay was good at the time, and the lunch was the best, but people felt dead on the inside and overall was a very draining job as i was stuck doing the same thing over and over again when i was suppose to rotate around with different workers."
bad,had an overall positive experience working arlt Wendy's. My coworkers and supervisor's were friendly and the work was easy. Unfortunately I saw many of my coworkers and supervisors treated badly by management which caused me to  volunteraly end my employment.
bad,"It's easy, but can be stressful if you let the customers who come angry get to you. Time management is important, as shifts are small as possible, no matter what happens during a shift."
bad,"Good experience. Had a lot of change overs with management team though. Very quick paced, but also unorganized and chaotic. Great people to work with though."
bad,"When I first started working, I got many hours, then all of a sudden, my hours were getting severely cut out of no where, and I was only working for an hour and 50 minutes, and I found that to be a waste of time because I had to drive all the way across town. Management wasn't all that great, I got accused of stealing, because I was a new employee, which I didn't much appreciate, I was found innocent. I didn't really enjoy this job."
bad,This used to be a fun place to work until you have the General Manager that is dating another Manager and the District Manager is the GM mother. Nobody is fair and the managers have a lot of issues and will take it out on the employees. Especially when they are mad at each other. I enjoyed some of my coworkers and we've always made our day exciting no matter what went on in the store. Hired too many people and now everyone is only getting 25 hours but if you are not a favorite then you will not get 40 hours.
bad,I like it justvsome of the managers there do not do their job correct. I needed a job but it is not for me I have a manager that disrespects me I have told the gym but he did nothing so I just stay tony self
bad,I never was even taught how to clock out for a break and my co-workers were rude and toxic. I didn't really learn anything and the fast food environment is definitely not for me.
bad,my experience here so far has been decent. i have learned patients and how to be better with multitasking. we seen to lose crew members and managers more often than they get hired. most of the workers allow  non work related things hinder them from keeping the production steady and smooth. The hardest part about this job is not having the proper help and having to be in more places than one person can handle. The most enjoyable is the managers who work with the crew and have a great sense of humor.
bad,"Pay not enough, managers a little unorganized, employees are lazy, otherwise a very fast paced place to work and it keeps u buddy all day. Not a dull moment"
bad,The management was terrible. understaffed all the time. The leading supervisor didn't know/do anything. The only benefit was the co-workers.
bad,Working at  Wendy's was a very productive job. It really depended on the flow of customers coming in. the summer days were very crazy at times because customers would order a lot of crazy items on the menu at once through the drive thru and would have us all backed up.
bad,I experienced s*xual harassment at the hands of a shift leader and the GM suspended me from work and HR did nothing but offer me another job at a different store. I was 16 and the man was well in his 40s.
bad,Working at wendys was not bad but certainly not enjoyable. A lot of people seemed to enjoy it but it just was not for me. Most co-workers were friendly but there were always people that were very hard to work with.
bad,typically at work it is very slow until lunch which is around 11 o'clock am. when the lunch rush does come it is hard to get extra needed help from managers. The managers have their on and off days in which the employees have to work around. It is very diverse. The hardest part is trying to do many task at once with little to no help and the most enjoyable part is the people I work with.
bad,A typical day at work at times be fast paced and unorganized. Loud disrespectful talking all through the shift. The hours are bad and never stay the same.
bad,"I got enough hours but like all fast food stores the pay was terrible. It also wasn't a safe place. For example; my co worker got jumped while 2 supervisors ran the drive thru. Not one supervisor was over looking the restaurant during the events that occurred. Management didn't listen to employees when providing information about hostile co workers up until the events occurred. Nobody helped, nobody called the police, nobody did anything to help my coworker as she lied on the floor after being jumped by 3 women double her size."
bad,"It is fastfood. Full of highschool kids/highschool drama. The store owner and store manager are brothers which makes for a very uncomfortable work environment at times. However, it is a very secure job. I worked there for 8 years and out of all them years only wver seen 1 person get fired."
bad,The store manager there was rude and was prejudice. He was bad to work with and the staff was very limited so you felt like you were doing two or three job on one pay. You don't get s break unless asked for and taken on your own. When the place is busy the staff become irritated and it makes it hard to work and keep a positive attitude.
bad,Job lacked team work . Employees rarely took their work seriously. Managers were not enforcing rules equally to everyone . When working here it felt like I was working with no help .
bad,wasn't a good job for me but the people was great and customers where great lots of friendly faces clean restrooms nice dress code
bad,"A typical day at Wendys includes preparation of food, customer service that is timed, a lot of cleaning, etc.."
bad,i got nothing out of this but a face full of acne and disappointment. i love wendys company but i will no longer want to work there anymore. its a good job as a teen growing up living with mom but not good for an adult with children
bad,"The work environment is extremely fast-paced, to be expected working for fast food. My particular store was managed by people who had EXTREME bias towards some workers and against others. Employees were allowed to take drugs on the property and no one even cared. If you have any kind of mental condition hindering your ability to handle stress (like I do) DO NOT look into a fast food job."
bad,The management talked trash about employees behind their back to other employees. Not very sanitized work environment. Found mold in the cooler where refrigerated foods were kept.
bad,"Didn't really like it ,not a good place to work mangers don't care what u do ,the coworkers are also rude ,and don't care what they say Basic what I'm trying to say is they have no class ."
bad,"A typical day was very stressful , I learned that not every job is going to be the right fit for me. My co workers were very supportive whenever work was stressful and the most enjoyable part was as always the customers and the people I was able to make a difference for."
bad,"Worked with many different people, the work gave you a challenge but wasn't to challenging. I learned to necessary thing that was needed to learn to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and interacting with the customers. They management was very unorganized and unprofessional. I am very willing to learn, good at math, organized, and friendly."
bad,"I started at nights, but asked to be moved to days because too many teenagers at night were lazy wouldn't do as they were told and always on their cell phones. We had a list a manager made for what to prep, cut up, get out of freezer, stock areas for grill, making sandwiches, french fries, nuggets, cleaning dining room. Some co-workers were easy to get along while others liked to start trouble with their gossiping. Some managers worked while others stayed in the office."
bad,my day was always what I make it. I learned a title don't make you a leader but your action do. My management only care about themselves. At first my co-workers didn't like me but once they get to know me they couldn't get enough of me. The hardest part of work was working with managers who was always complain about they job. The most enjoyable part of work was serving my customer and lifting the spirit of my crew on my shift.
bad,"It has been a while since I worked at Wendy's, however, I do remember that the work load was definitely worth more than the pay. I was in high school at the time that I worked here, so the hours were really taking a toll on me as being a closer, we would not get to leave until about 2am. The management was pretty awful when I worked there, and I can remember that one manager in particular said things that often made the staff upset or uncomfortable. Something that I really enjoyed about my job, though, was being the best at it. I was typically the sandwich maker for the shift, and I can remember one of the managers telling me that I was the fastest sandwich maker that they had. This made me happy because I know that I made quality sandwiches too. I am a perfectionist at times, so I would never send out a sandwich that I didn't think looked amazing."
bad,TERRIBLE. The wendy's I worked for was a mess and managers never put up the schedule and when they did it was for ONE day. It was disappointing everyday. The customers were way nicer than the crew. I put up with it for a year and finally had enough. Between the manager flirting with all the male co workers to them not even having proper procedures down it was a mess.
bad,"It would have been a great experience but the timing wasn't right. Unfortunately, shortly after I got the job, we found out my dad was dying of cancer and he was only going to live for 3 more weeks. When my dad passed away, I couldn't function at all as it was also the first death I ever had to deal with and watching my father wither away to nothing really got to me."
bad,"Was very unclean, was usually doing the work of 3 or 4 people as most of the crew would disappear before the end of the shift. Limited assistance during shift, Manager was usually unavailable and shift leads were very  busy with finding people to cover for no-shows"
bad,"The work was ok, shifts ran from 4 to 8 on weekdays and 6 hour to 8 hour shifts on the weekends. I learned how to deal with bad customers and micro organization. Management was horrible, and would change shifts multiple times daily, to the point a schedule was unnecessary because it would change so often you had unpredictable schedule.Co-workers were incredibly nice and were helpful especially for my first job. The hardest part of the job was predicting if i had a shift or not from the constant shifting. I really enjoyed getting to help people out and glad the smile i had on my face made them happy."
bad,It was ok at the start and then with every new promotion and hire it just started to go down hill. Its just really not worth it.
bad,"If you are new to the world of work, then this job is for you. But after they teach you how to use a cash register, then that's really all there is to it."
bad,"Fast pace, sweaty because the kitchen didn't have an air condition! It was good to get some work experience. Although it was nice to have ''laid back'' managers, I'd have to admit they weren't responsible when it came to scheduling, and so many times when I'd clock in they tell me they're overstaffed. I drive fifteen minutes to work and back so I had to quit my job. One manager was very rude to me, I was just sixteen at the time. A couple times the customers took notice and would end up yelling at him for being so disrespectful. I did the professional thing and told them ""he's just having a tough day""."
bad,"In the beginning it was great place to work. When it was sold it turn into something different. There no team there, everyone out for one."
bad,The resturant Wendys is a fast pace job.  Then every now and then it is the lunch hour rush and sometimes the rush around dinner.  You have to move a little faster and every now and then you have to remake the orders because of the mistake that was made.
bad,"meh, this place is bad....and i hated it. it sucked. they do not understand people make mistakes. that's all meh the managers suck"
bad,"I work for wendys for awhile, I started out at the bottom and made my way to an assistant manager training to become a co manager. after working with them for almost 5 years, they decided to start changing there management ways, and took favor to family hires. in a work place everyone should be treated fairly, be able to advance fairly, and be able to train they way the company wants without being told they are too good and they are related to higher management that they don't have to do that. I am very disappointed in the fact that as a company with set rules and guidelines that they would totally disreguard them that easily."
bad,"A work day at Wendy's was a funny one and sometimes a serious depending who worked that day or if corporate came by for the day. Best part of working at Wendy's was being in the back, so i wasn't as distracted as everyone in the front. Hardest part throughout the day was keeping the service time and dishes down at the same time. My general manager had a poor attitude and was unprofessional towards others including customers."
bad,As always it is a very challenging day for management and staff. It has been a tiring yet enjoyable to work with each other. It's an everyday learning for all of us considering all those hard times we're going through form our day by day assignments. Manangement and staff work together to achieve our daily goal.
bad,I really felt like I was treated unfairly at Wendy's. The manager never had time to talk an it was plenty favoritism going around. The workplace had a lot of drama.
bad,"I cleaned, took orders and prepared food, i learned patience. The management was good except for my boss. The co-workers always worked together because that's how a fast food joint runs. The hardest part of my job was trying to mad customers happy. I enjoyed the fast pace."
bad,The co-workers worked hard. The motivation they give others were negative. Reduces company morale and production. the food is amazing.
bad,"At Wendy's I worked at the cash register and I cleaned tables. The restaurant was always short staffed and it was a very stressful environment. I always completed the tasks of many different coworkers. Additionally, I had to learn to manage the cash register by myself because the trainer was always also taking over other peoples' tasks."
bad,"My co workers are what made this experience enjoyable. I had an understanding of each station. I was responsible for preparing, bagging, and serving food to the customers. The hardest part of this job was that the managers were not really hands-on. Therefore, employees had to cover several stations due to the fact that there was a need for employees. From the job, I have learned how to multi-task in a timely manner. I have also learned how to take difficult situations and redirect them in a positive light."
bad,"good place to start and learn about yourself but must be alright with the hours. usually are asked to stay for atleast one night close which is until 1 am. If you are going to school do not get this job because you will be dead tired. "
bad,After Clocking in my manager would have me mop the whole dining room and bathrooms. After that we would count my register to assure it was properly at $150.00. I learned how to take other peoples feelings into consideration and try to understand different situations. The management was not the best. At times They were difficult to work with and not sympathetic towards certain situations. The co-workers were amazing and very fun to be around. The hardest part of my job was working overnight with difficult customers. Overall I would say the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the satisfaction I provided to a customer and having them smile.
bad,"I enjoyed working for Wendy's as my first job. It was a fun workplace with decent co-workers. The support from managers was lacking. Working at this establishment was very hard for new employees. When I was first hired, I received no training by a manager whatsoever. I quickly learned how to use the cash register by myself, along with the deep fryers, grill, and sandwich station, and ice cream machine. Daily duties: take orders, collect money and give change, clean lobby and workstation, count waste, clean all machines including grills, fryers and ovens. I learned that teamwork is very important. The hardest part about this job was the lack of support from our team. The managers ignored their responsibility to oversee their employees."
bad,On a typical work day there are at least a dozen rules broken each day. by both managers and crew. I've learned working as a team is a good thing but it only works if everyone works together because if at least 1 person doesn't the everything can fall apart.Wendy's has a problem with managers not respecting their crew. The equipment breaks and it takes a while to get it replaced. The hardest part of the job would be working with people that refuse to listen and wont work together. However the friends you can make there are one of the things I like the most. I have made a lot of friends and we all work well together and even if we joke around we make sure our job is done before doing so.
bad,I Learned what come on Different Sandwiches and Food That they serve . Typical Day at work is ok Till the manager Comes around flirting with every female getting fresh and things to that nature. The hardest part of the job is Nothing really Everything Was Taught and it seems easy because im a fast learner.I enjoy the encouragement there and thats it. My co workers were mainly people around my age range or from school.
bad,Fast food is a rough industry but good experience and lots learned. Managers range from push overs to dictators and the employees were generally nice and approachable. Stressful when customers are not pleased but as is in every job. Good first job to realize there are better options out there and to get the tough one out of the way.
bad,could be enjoyable when u have the right people and managerment. the people could be fun. the job part of it was easy. working together made everything go well .
bad,"At Wendys, you will be told to either be on grill, fries, or register. "
bad,"enjoyed working there,but was a hard job to move up in management.i enjoyed working with customers and it was real hard to keep our drive time down."
bad,Wendy's is a great first job. get out fast though because you will be working hard for nothing. The pay is what you suspect of a fast-food job but the expectations are surprisingly high for the minimum reward.
bad,"When I would get to work, I would go in with a positive attitude and do my job the best that I could. Although not all of the employee's had this work ethic, this made me adjust to dealing with bad attitudes and complicated people. When Wendy's got busy, that was one of the hardest parts of the job. I had to keep a calm attitude and serve the customers right. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we were not busy and the employees and I could work and get to know each other. Overall we were all a working family, not everyone got along but that is part of everyday life."
bad,"Wendy's is a very selfish company. They do not care about their employees like they should. They just want what they can get then they're are done with you.The job is very unorganized, unprofessional, and stressful, but overall it was a very interesting and entertaining experience."
bad,"It's a paycheck and that's great, deal with a crazy schedule but it's great to be able to empathize with the hard work and persistence in fast food."
bad,"A typical day at work was managing all cash, credit, and debit transaction. I learned how to use a cash register. Management and the co-worker was all active. There was no hardest part everything was easy. The most enjoyable part of the job was working."
bad,cooking at a timimg rate cleaning up the store when it close dranging  cookers preparing meals for the customers moping floors unloading truck team work being quiet to get ahead
bad,Was ok to work for but no benefits and they didn't give a lot of raises and managers didn't communicate with other and wasn't  a great team work place
bad,"My typical day at wendy`s started by checking with my manager on position asking if the tasks that are needed to be done within closing time are done and if not what has to be done.Sometimes I would be brought up with the news that someone isn`t showing up to work and that we`re short staffed for the day. Although this trouble us that much it does affect the amount of work to be done, such as a worker doing two shift in one day. This affects our employees by tiring them out on a daily basis. Some of these employees not only work full time, but they also have another job aside of Wendy`s. This was the hardest part of working,knowing what was being done to my fellow co-workers."
bad,"-Every day is typical to me because of the happy environment."
bad,"This is my first job and I appreciate the fact that they gave me the opportunity to work for them. I am a cashier, but we multi-task from running the drive-thru, to keeping the dinning room clean.I have learned how to handle difficult customers and how to have a sense of urgency when it's extremely busy."
bad,I worked at wendys for about three years. There were many people that did not speak English which is fine because I spoke Spanish but it was frustrating for the customers. The managers were nice but always looked very stressed out because people were no shows and the pay is low so it is understandable. Working at the drive thru was rough because the cars coming in almost seemed endless and my voice was always tired by the end of the week even though I tried to preserve it. The people that worked there were very nice but not all competent in their job areas. I learned various positions at Wendy and taught them to my coworkers that were training for them. The best part of the job was the food discount and talking to the various coworkers. The worst part of the job is the noise the headset makes when a car pull up through the drive thru box for the 10000th time and when you have to work a two person shift because someone did not show up and you are shorthanded which was often.I learned a lot from Wendys and because better at dealing with people but that job was way too hard for the pay that it provided. The General manager(I had 2 different GMs) doesn't really do anything at Wendys hardly works or is even there. The District Manager(General Manager's boss) was really cool and seems to have high ethical standards that was impressive.
bad,I didn't really get along with the manager I many had to work with which wasn't the store's general manager. She just yelled at everyone to get the work done and didn't even put forth the effort to make it a fun workplace. I also didn't really enjoy working in a fast food environment. I like jobs where I get to go out or socialize constantly with other people.
bad,"You do your daily cleaning tasks, assist customers, take out accurate product orders, make shakes, and enjoy new incoming products."
bad,I worked 3 hours a week and I hated it. I spent one hour cooking and the other two cleaning.
bad,"it was a great job to have after high school. as far as moving up in the company it doesnt really happen. The pay and raises arent enough to live off. A typical day at work would consist of customer service, cash handling, and multi tasking under fast pace. The hardest part of the job was learning to work under fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was to interact with customers i really enjoy giving the best customer service."
bad,"When I left this place, the management was fighting, screaming, and crying. They would involve the crew members and it made a normal workday a nightmare. The skilled crew members started leaving as a result of the poor management and new people were hired in. The morale suffered and I had to leave. There was no room for advancement or the ability to make a decent wage and things were very hostile. I know that since I quit, all of the managers and crew that I used to work with have now left. Hopefully it has become a more enjoyable place to work."
bad,Fast paced but ran by managers that were not the nicest. Didn't receive the hours that I needed either. But the employee discount was fun!
bad,From day one I was on my own and only received an hour of training. The management team never really saw eye to eye and that was not a good thing. The job gets very tedious and you don't really feel like you are accomplishing anything. One up side is that it is an incredibly social work environment and there was never a dull moment with my coworkers.
bad,i like this job because it was close to my home and my co-workers was fun
bad,"The hours are long and busy constantly without a break unless you request one. The schedule is not a set schedule you work when and where needed. The coworkers are nice and is the most enjoyable part of the job but the hardest part of the job is keeping your energy high to keep up with the customer count. I have learned how to be a very hard worker from this job and how to balance my school, home and work life."
bad,"My favorite part of the work day is the customers. Seeing the lovely customers who come in to see me are great. However, there is a homeless man who comes in almost everyday and makes it very uncomfortable for me. He has gotten in my personal space to ask me personal questions about myself and tells me things about himself I personally would rather not like to know. The management is O.K. Not too shabby. We lost a lot of great managers who all transferred and went their separate ways, although, the newest manager that has been hired is the reason why most of the employees are considering quitting. The hours on our schedules don't compensate for the amount of gas it takes for us to commute. Due to the new hired employees of course."
bad,"Unload truck, put up stock products, set up work stations, clean and maintain store inside and out."
bad,"It was a part time job I had while I was a Senior in high school. It was alright pay with a couple of cool managers. I worked from 5pm to 11pm and basically all I did was cook the fries, nuggets, and bread. I was a cashier in the lobby and window. My favorite part of the job was getting the employee discount."
bad,"The typical Wendy's crew member position requires you to lift up to 40 pounds on a daily basis, have and/or learn customer service and satisfaction techniques and also have you learn life lessons that will help you with management throughout your career. But, the management at Wendy's is very difficult to deal with, as they don't sometimes acknowledge your requests off, even though you have given them two weeks notice. They also do not dish out many hours to many employees, even though some employees need the hours and money to pay for their children or family. Wendy's also is not a very clean place to work. There are sanitation guidelines that they are supposed to follow, but most of the times they do not follow these guidelines. Gloves are used after cross-contamination between meat and chicken, gloves are occasionally not changed when customers have allergies to the buns used for the sandwiches, and hands are not washed after the trash is taken out because it ""takes too much time."" All in all, the Wendy's environment is just stable enough for someone to get their foot in the door as a worker and get some work experience, but I would advise to not make a career out of it or stay there for more than a year."
bad,Kept the food preparation and dining areas clean at all times.
bad,"This job just requires a person to complete basic fast food duties. This place is somewhat chaotic at times, and the store is in a bad neighborhood."
bad,"Just not enough hours to maintain my obligations, general manager is efficient she's ok, some managers are a bit perfectionist"
bad,McGraw Hill required standing all day. This job taught me how to properly operate machines and how istep test are graded. The coworkers were friendly but i stayed to myself most of the time so that I could complete my tasks. The hardest part was standing for the whole shift. I enjoyed this job because there was alot of movement involved and that made the time go by pretty fast.
bad,"I'm not the type to leave a bad review of anything, as with the old adage of ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything"". But during my employment with Wendy's, I have always been driven to do my best. I hit the ground running my first day there, as I wanted to prove myself, and prove that there was no mistake made in hiring me in directly as an Assistant Manager."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of being really busy, dealing with customers as well as co workers. I've learned that order, structure, and responsible goes a long way. My management team was okay, I only had 2 out of 5 managers that honestly love there job and go over and beyond. My co workers were extremely friendly, we all have been getting along since day one. The hardest part of this job is honestly nothing. The most enjoyable part of this job is being around people who want the same thing you want as in customer satifaction"
bad,"not alot of hours,get paid every two weeks,very hard to move up,negative feeling everyday you work there. Not alot of breaks."
bad,"not a good place to work. low pay, high stress, high work load."
bad,well wendys was ok I liked it cause you could eat all day but when you don't get some one food right they get about angery as I don't know what. so when I go to work and I take peoples oder I make sure I read it back to them. that way I have no problem.
bad,It was a good job for skills I gain. I learned multi-tasking and communication and learned how to manage people. Hardest put was dealing with bad management.
bad,"If you're not qualified for busy restaurant positions that pay chump change, staty away from working at wendy's. It's very hectic, and you have to always be on your feet. You should be smart for this job. Once you get used to the flow of things, however, working here could turn out to be very enjoyable. good luck on your job search."
bad,Come in and clock in and get to work I have learnd how to run differnt work station you dont really see the manament that much co workers are kind and nice the hardest part it trying to keep up when you are new when i can go home
bad,"It was not enjoyable type of job: low salary, no benefits, and very hard work."
bad,"a typical day of work consisted of me working with my co-workers in the drive-thru to satisfy the customers needs, by taking their order, making the food and bagging it out to them. I learned that you can make someone's day by just being nice, you don't know who you will come across on a daily basis, and I learned that from dealing with so many customers everyday at work. Management changed around pretty frequently, as did my co-workers, a lot of them come and go so I'm used to always meeting new people and adapting to new environments. The hardest part of the job is dealing with others drama at work, or having to pick up for others slack."
bad,To be able to work at wendys you would definitately need to be able to mult-task. Without being able to muti-task you wont be able to get your daily tasks done at a reasonable time. Wendys is also a team player job. Being a team player job everyone has to work together other wise it will be a disaster in progress. The most enjoyable part of the job is everyones company as we work together.
bad,"•Took orders over an intercom system."
bad,A typical day at Wendy's consist of sandwhich making and cashier operations. I didnt really learn anything. My co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of my job were the long hours. The enjoyable part were my co-workers.
bad,"Flexible schedule, you never know who your will work wit, managers are okay, often seem angry."
bad,i did not like working there but i needed a job and stayed there for 5 years the only thing i like from working at wendys was half price food that was grate
bad,Talking to the customers and other employees was the best part of the job. It was an easy job to learn and do but the managers and the pay made the job not worth it. All 4 managers i started with were easy going but towards the end of me working there all 4 managers quit or transferred and 4 new managers came in all at once and had to learn all at once. 
bad,"I honestly did not enjoy working at Wendy's, but I will not trash talk it. Plain and simple it just was not my cup of tea."
bad,"Strted with hours, then went to new managment after a year of my employment. Once new managment got settled, i got less hours. once it got to 1 day a week. i quit. "
bad,Typical days were frustrated with complaints from co-workers and management. 
bad,The hardest part of the job was when i had to prepare the sandwiches.
bad,I learned alot when I work there and my co-workers they was nice and I got along with all of them. I enjoy the customers when they came in cause I always knew want and how to make them happy. The hardest part of the job was getting all the sandwich made right.
bad,"Run schedules , P&L ,Manage teams. Operate daily task run shifts"
bad,"They pay you and treat you the same way. They was yell at me, and other crew members, and treating us poorly."
bad,Could've been a much better experience. Work place full of gossip and horseplay.
bad,"Was usually interesting sometimes fun could keep the high energy level till opening time then managers would really get highly stressed then the rest of the day was stressful for everyone,I did learn quite a bit about food prep.The management caused a lot of stress to everyone because it seem to me they brought there troubles to work or if they had problems with one person they got aggravated with all. I enjoyed for the most part all of the co-workers everyone was pleasant.The hardest part of job was drive thru to keep up time.The most enjoyable part was opening up the store getting ready for the day because stress level was down with Managment."
bad,"management sucked. from my experience they do not care about the employees, as long as you meet their needs they're happy."
bad,It was a fine first job.
bad,It was a very fast passed job and in that job I learned how to manage my time to be able to complete al tasks in the environment of a pressure job.
bad,Not as many customers but overall was a great experience. All my coworkers were very informational and helpful. The managers could have worked with my school schedule a little better though.
bad,"I took customers orders in either drive-thru or the front counter or I made sandwiches. I learned how to multi task. The managers was great, but the owner was terrible and not very nice. My co-workers were great. The hardest part was dealing with angry customers. I would let my manager handle that. The most enjoyable part of this job the people I worked with."
bad,Overall this is an okay start to job experinece. It is good with promoting people. As an individual you have to be able to have a positive attitude to keep your day going well and remember the customer is the main priority and so is the fast paceness of the job. Quality is an obvious key.
bad,"I don't remember very much, except for the fact that management picked favorites. And when management didn't like someone, they got rid of them by cutting off their shifts completely"
bad,"it was very busy all the time,i learned how to deal with different people, i had very good management who worked with my needs in school, there was nothing hard about this job,but my co-workers were cool, and the most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people."
bad,"Overall, this was a good experience working here because I learned some new things about customer intimacy. But I didn't think it was fair how they worked me. I think they overworked me and wasn't paying me right. So I left there because of that, and because I started working full time at Lockheed Martin."
bad,"Worked 50+ hours a week. Typical day included: filling out inventory sheet, filling out a flow chart, managing crew members etc."
bad,"Compensation could have been better, other employees were good, some were bad, and what I enjoyed most was helping people everyday."
bad,"A typical day consisted of a morning lunch rush, a solid 3 hours of drive through action. I learned to deal with upset customers seeing as there was always a wait for the morning customers. The Management was very warm and friendly, understanding and flexible, probably the best part of the job. Other Co-workers were always working as a team which you don't always see in fast food, a good environment. The hardest part was the morning rush, the easiest part was the morning rush."
bad,Wendys is a great place to work. It brings on challenges that helps prepare for life cultures and values.
bad,Didn't like working here. Always got called in on off days! Got overtime but it was taken out in taxes so it was like working for nothing.
bad,"The amount of work expected is not worth the pay once so ever. I open my pay check on Fridays and want to cry, not even breaking 250 dollars for 35 hours of working"
bad,I was out of a job for quite a bit and I lucked out and got a job there. But after a while it gets boring and I just want to do something else now
bad,"This work place was like a drama show , it was so much drama in a fast food place like I’ve never seen before . It was like you was in a soap opera . The managers really didn’t car what you did or anything"
bad,"It is a fast paced environment, working together as a team is always expected but not always achieved. It's a good starter job for someone in school. Management has put more thought into those who show effort, advance in the company. The hardest part would often be being short staffed, the fast pace and sometimes customers. The easy part is when everyone works together to make the work load easier."
bad,I wish I didn't stay as long as I did. The amount of work did not match up with the wage amount. Started minimum wage and was given little amounts of raises. It wasn't worth it and managers treated their employees like trash.
bad,I'm hoping this company has changed over the past couple years because I had a terrible experience with the management. I was given useless tasks throughout my time there and the manager refused to even train me to work on drive thru or food for months. I left everyday feeling as if I accomplished absolutely nothing.
bad,"Greet customers, make food, bag food, fulfill orders correctly, Jeep clean work space, run cash register, correctly provide accurate change, complete daily tasks on time"
bad,Management in this company was  stuck and roll situation with low pay and no benefits or security. I worked alone without support or information from other management
bad,didn't work there long enough to get a feel for the job. Was just there a few months and those were alright  but when i needed them to support me they fired me so  that ended my employment at Wendy's.
bad,"I generally found it very unfulfilling to feed people food that was giving them diabetes. I did it to pay off my car. I am sure that If the culture felt less corporate, and industrial then It would be nice."
bad,"The workers would stand in the kitchen and talk poorly about the customers while everyone in the dining area was able to hear every word said; for management, I would be scheduled to work, show up and then be informed that they either took me off of the schedule for the day a few days before or would cancel my shift and not inform me. Their way of firing you is by taking your name off of the schedule and not telling you that you are fired and lastly if you say anything about quoting to a coworker and management finds out they will let you go without even talking to you about it first of giving a warning."
bad,I am a very hard working person reliable an consistent an always give 100% in every job! Poor management an lack of training will put a lot of stress on the few that do their job! On top of that I don’t work for free! My hours were not correct on not one but 2 checks an weren’t corrected!
bad,"If you want to be over worked and under payed then work for wendy's, long hours but the check doesn't seem to measure up to the amount of work you do."
bad,"The low pay gives almost little to no incentive to work, management is a whole can of worms, and the work is definitely not worth the pay given. I've seen many people come and go because of the same constant positions they're given to work which definitely is repetitive and ""fun""."
bad,Not a good experience at all working there because I also had school on the other hand so I didn't have time to work for them. plus I did not have a good fit schedule for them.
bad,"This job is fast paced and can cause stress, your work days change weekly so it hard to tell when you'll be working, and depending on the day the manager can make it harder as well"
bad,"Wendy’s is a good job for a “first job”. However, should it be a long term career? I don’t think so. I feel like it is a great job where you can make some money to put it your pocket while in high school or college. You may not always get the hours you want or the hours you feel you deserve. You also may not receive the pay you feel like you deserve. However, for a student the pay is decent."
bad,"In the beginning it’s cool but as you get to know the company and the type of lazy managers they hire, you realize it’s just pure trash of a job. Just about everyone there talk about everyone else’s business and it’s worse than high school. Would have not wasted 3 years with that company knowing now how cheap corporate is. Corporate only looks after themselves and not even it’s employees."
bad,"I had a manager who did not like me since day one and she makes everyday miserable. She threatens my job everyday, telling me I am not a good employee when everyone else in the business disagrees. I am very good at my job, everyone agrees delightfully and she does not."
bad,"You cant survive off what they pay.  They think 8 or 8.50/ hour is good enough, but the cost of living is so high anymore.  Fast food isnt just for kids anymore"
bad,"I had three managers which were all so awful. "
bad,"Management really does suck and they make me want to leave and never come back with every shift. They rarely, if ever, listened to when I was able to work, even though I have told them multiple times from the beginning and even put it down in writing. This isn't just a problem with my location, either. A friend of mine used to work at a different location near me and the management was the same as mine and I don't think his pay ever really increased (if it did it was very little).They don't tell you anything like how to do your job or where anything is, they leave if up to my co-workers to teach me and then get irritated with me when I mess something up. The only thing I like about my job is my co-workers."
bad,"When I worked at the restaurant, the manager at the time focused on keeping people who were good at what they did on certain areas."
bad,Unprofessional . Unsanitary. Barely any ac . Not worth working those many hours for low pay . No paid holidays. Barely can take off days . Lazy workers
bad,I enjoyed my time working there. It was good experience. Co-workers were very nice and friendly. The management was poor however. They gave me little to no hours per week. They have also hired many unqualified workers to take on the role of the ones who have quit. Many days we were understaffed and I struggled to do the job of 3 people.
bad,The expectations are unrealistically demanding at the wage the A/C didn’t work at my location making it uncomfortable to work here. Many shifts and jobs couldn’t be done due to lack of staff and equipment.
bad,This company is amazing the people outside of the i.t department are caring and open. The management in the i.t department is carless and number driven. They single individuals out and cause conflict between teams would not recommend working in the i.t department of this company EVER!!!
bad,"It was a decent job with the right manager, but a nightmare if the wrong manager was having home problems. Stick to yourself unless you want more unwanted rumors about your hime life."
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's goes from drama oriented to slaying away in positions you aren't even trained for. After two weeks your considered to be able to automatically know how to advance towards an untrained position. However, while your still given credit for the hours you work, sometimes you may be told there are too may people working the shift are supposed to be on, and literally only work ONE day the entire week. The real reason behind this is that the managers there that assist the establishment dont respect their workers, while there are some who refuse to accommodate for rude workers who should be fired for not doing what they're supposed to be doing. The real and only good part about working at Wendy's is that you basically are taking a vacation that lacks you of pay and doesnt allow its workers to gain experience."
bad,"I was paid less than minimum wage and when i tried to talk to management about it they kept putting it off. Called corporate, but it was basically nothing they could do (they claimed). Other employees were making what was promised, however. Employees only get discounts off the value menu unless you are a manager. They kept firing people only to bring them back a couple weeks later. The job itself wasn’t bad. I wasn’t trained on everything, but I didn’t mind because i preferred to do the only things i was trained for anyway. I quit on my fifth month because they refused to pay me what they advertised and figured they would just give me more hours instead, being inconsiderate of the fact that i was a full time student. They forget they’re a job and not a career.l"
bad,"Although a job is a job, you have to draw the line somewhere. My line is drawn when I feel disrespected, lied to or unappreciated. And here, I was lied to, I wasn't treated wrong as an individual, but after promising me a higher position, higher pay, and workers, that is what I expect. Even after hiring, there was lack of labor during my shift, and this continued for weeks. Having only 2-3 workers who are mostly management, is not good, and the job becomes stressful."
bad,"I genuinely loved my coworkers, and I loved the extremely fast pace of the job. Time went by so fast and I made some lifelong friends. "
bad,Work was very hot behind the cashier and during lunch hour customers would become upset at me because their food would take so long. I could not even get free food.
bad,I’ve worked for Wendy’s 9 years I have relocated for them which I wish I was only supposed too be there 8 weeks. That’s 8 weeks has turned into a year and a half with ignored requests and actions
bad,"This restaurant is managed by people who don't care about your health, scheduling conflicts, or personal life. The pay isn't good enough to endure the lack of professionalism and human decency you would expect of upper management."
bad,"directed employees for the morning shift and lunch rush,"
bad,The workers are loud at points the GM seems to put down her employees. Overall the food is always good and most of the people always have a smile on their faces.
bad,I had to travel many distances to get to stores that were very much understaffed.  Also language barriers were at times difficult as well.  Management at corporate level was very harsh on people half of the time but at other times they were tolerable.
bad,"On busy days there is good business, but when there are slow days because of weather or short staffing the store is usually closed down pretty early so it cuts night shifts hours. It's not a bad place to work if you're not trying to make friends and everyone gets their job done, but its a place that no one follows rules and makes food cost go sky high."
bad,"I experienced abuse from some managers, great times and work with others. Hard work but easy to learn how to do each position, which allows for shift flexibility (trading between workers)."
bad,"People that have been there for a long time has to run around like a chit with there head cut off , while management and the not so strong employees sit in the office or twiddle their thumbs , stressful, yet fun"
bad,As a worker with a disability i find it EXCEEDINGLY inappropriate for a manager to make fun of someone because of their disability. This is why places lose people.
bad,"High school job since I was 16, started at 7.25 then became a manager and only made 9.05. Not enough pay for the responsibility that I had. Also other managers stealing from company and hiring people from everyone’s family’s so there was always drama between someone’s family."
bad,terrible  aweful the worst place I ever worked. this job made me realize there better things in life than fast food. I recommend nobody has this as an career
bad,"you get to deal with different people everyday,i've learned to become more patient with people. the management differs on certain levels going from your store manager to the upper levels of management in the company."
bad,"This was my second job, around sophomore year of high school. The management here was absolutely terrible, Very rude and demanding too much of the employees."
bad,"Typical day: "
bad,The managers wanted you to put in more time than they are willing to. Store stayed opened to 2 am but only got business until 12am. We basically just stood around waiting to leave. The management team worked against each and the crew. Some managers kept problems going between the employees
bad,"My personal work experience has been up and down very stressful and time consuming, my work schedule is not balanced or steady. constant call ins from co workers and quits"
bad,"The food is good, but the employees are unreliable, and unprofessiona and leave after a few months. Issues with lack of leadership save for one or two managers, and sometimes labor intensive work to anyone they choose for not much pay."
bad,Very stressful workday that requires a lot of its employees. Management is very disorganized and never in sync along with different shifts never being able to work with one another. People can help make the job more bearable.
bad,this specific location needed employers . each position fell on me and my coworkers which made us have to do extra work. we would only get a break which seemed like twice a week and never had a release on time i would always get off and hour or two after my normal time
bad,"This is a good first time job for people. It can get stressful with time but, Making friends with co workers is fun. I personally would not recommend a long time commitment with this job because of the low pay."
bad,wears you out... lots of rude customers... the general manager at my store in Merrick was really great but all the other managers were not and one of them was the reason why I'm leaving
bad,"I have worked at Wendy's for a year, without a raise, no benefits, and being hired under part time instead of full time, so they don't have to pay for employee benefits. I have worked hard for this company with no recognition and the loss of breaks. We are so short staffed, no one ever gets 30 minute breaks that are required by law. I can not live on $7.90 an hour. It is so stressful working there because we don't have enough crew members. This is a great job for a teen in high school who does not need to be concerned with bills, but for adults, it is a down hill, dead end job."
bad,The Overall Company Is A Good Company To Work For It’s Just Some Of The Private Investor Companies Thats A Little Disorganized. They Hire To Much Family In One Work Area Such As My General Manager Had Her Daughter Working There An It Was Always A Problem With That. Not Self Included
bad,It was good until they was lack on my hours and off dates.the customers was disrespectful and the workers wasn't no help i just ain't lime it but i hope yall hire me i really need it.THANK YOU
bad,This is a fast pace kind of job it also require standing for hours deals with customer service and food prep also deals with cleaning and stocking but most of all dealing with math and money.
bad,"Although the stressful times I had working at Wendy's, Wendy's really taught me a lot as well. I find myself more comfortable when it comes to working as a team and being able to communicate with people and just be social."
bad,Poor management and they have their favorites. Evening shift doesn't like to make sure they stock or clean right.  Just down right not a good place to work
bad,"Work is usually busy. Sometimes it's not fair in the morning because managers make you do pretty much everything during opening hours. Such as breaking down morning trucks, washing and cleaning dishes, and stocking. And then they wonder why you're taking so long when you're basically doing 80% of the work."
bad,The management is pretty bad. My manager would tell me to come in at a certain time and not even be there. He would have employees training for a month with no pay. And he was never there.
bad,"Not very well organised, constantly understaffed, constantly forced to stay up to an hour after my shifts ended. This Wendy's does not value the individual, and expects its workers to do the labor of 3 or more workers at once."
bad,"Typical day: Same as any other fast food restaurant."
bad,This job was descent for only needing a high school education or GED but it takes time and a lot of devotion to build up what it takes to become something more.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend working there to anyone, My hours went from 26 and up to less that 15 hours a week. The management is off and on, most of the time they were okay, same as the co workers"
bad,"The jobs you're required to do are fast paced and meant for multiple people. You can't expect one person to do the job of 2 or more people in half the time. Some days just working there made me leave in tears that are totally unnecessary. The management could only do so much because they are just as stressed and have very little leniency to work with. The workplace was made bearable by working with decent coworkers and managers. Just pray you aren't on Drive-Thru because that it the most tasking station both physically and mentally. They emphasize care to the customer as they should in a business, but Wendy's really needs to take a moment and emphasize care to the employees, which I should remind everyone: that without the employees, Wendy's wouldn't be in business."
bad,Wendys is a great place to start for a first job. i dont recommend staying long term because they tend to take advatage of you. They dont really listen to what you have to say. They love to do only what benefits them.
bad,You always had room for advancement. The money was okay. The days were long and very stressful. You didn't have much support from the district manager. Always short staffed. Always under pressure that your store would be shut down even if working under conditions that weren't correct.
bad,"I enjoy cooking very much so its great to let loose my creative edge and multi tasking skills to take on the load."
bad,"A typical day at work was stressful, always low on coworkers and bad management. I learned many things throughout working at Wendy's. The hardest part of the job is closing drive thru."
bad,"Working at Wendy's was very fast-paced and had bad poor management. With the manger knowing I worked another job, they would not work around my other schedule. My schedule was very inconsistent."
bad,a tipical day involved me going to work. working and getting payed. i learned i hate fast food. management was a mess.  but employees were kind of cool.
bad,The managers were so rude majority of the time for no reason. It took a lot of patience to deal with them. The co-workers were gifted at giving you a headache as well.
bad,Its really fast paced and the upper management can be really nasty. The place is natrually busy. The raises are a joke. The hours are tiring. 3 to 1am then back at 9am.
bad,So as far as the company is concerned it need lots of work. I worked at e different stores and i would only recommend that you work at one of them the other two need serious work. The work its self is not hard at all it if fairly simple. It makes a good first job for anyone.
bad,"While working at Wendy SMB Cayman Island, I thought it `would be ok. But due to the fact that they protected their own nation is a down fall. I was taught that customer came first and it was not so for  them."
bad,It is your basic fast paced cut throat fast food job. You work a lot of hours for minimal pay. You don't have time for your family and it is hard to get a day off.
bad,I️ worked at Wendy’s for over a year and it was nice at first but I️ think that’s because I️ had a cooperative people person manager later we got a horrible manager she got the job done but did not care about her employees.
bad,"At first Wendy’s was a cool job but everything went left, no raises, terrible staff, & just not what you would want to do for the rest of your life honestly"
bad,the manager and the two co managers were very rude and i did not get paid properly. had a couple issues at this location in rockefeller center.i ended up participating in the food strike they had that year that was televised. i believe they are now closed down
bad,"Crew worked as team, fast paced but fun to be apart of was rotating shift but worked four tens. Picked up and maintained all stations so that was nice"
bad,Wendy's is not a recommendation of mine for employement. I was harrased verbally by co-workers AND management. Fast paced environment and terrible training.
bad,I think they could have better managers who care about their employees more and all of them not just favorites... I feel lik eyou are rushed and not tought properly
bad,"A typical work day included stocking ingredients, preparing food, cooking food, taking orders, filling orders, cleaning back area, cleaning dining area, cleaning restrooms, and doing lots of dishes."
bad,Wendys is a good workplace just not a satisfying job for me . I just want a better paying job that does not deal with fastfood which is better paying and will give me enough hours
bad,Wendy's was an overall good work experience but sometimes was very unprofessional. A typical work day was very fast paced  and could sometimes be stressful if everyone didn't do there job. I how to stay calm and get my job done even if others weren't.
bad,"This Job was the worst experience of my life , every day it was some bs .it was always mess and bitterness the management sucked they did not know how to talk to people with out yelling at them"
bad,It is a very fast pace job. You don't get paid that much to deal with a lot of problems. They also do not let you get overtime. Good people to work with though.
bad,"The management never really found ways to keep all of those regularly involved with the company satisfied. This may have been due in part to the fact that management was constantly changing over the time that I worked there, but was still somewhat concerning. It would seem paramount that everyone be comfortable and ready to work."
bad,"my hours are close to none, only working 2-4 hrs one day a week and barely getting any calls to go in or getting schedule semi last minute. The manager always changes the schedule last minute or has few or too many people working at a time and some of the staff are pushy and kick you out of the way to get noticed by higher up people..."
bad,"Fast paced environment. Very busy in the summer and hot to place to work in a lot of time. People are usually friendly and nice to work with"
bad,What you have to do in fast food is not worth the bad wages they pay wether you part time or full. Managers either tend to ride a high horse or be completely irresponsible. Coworkers tend to either be quite chill or creepy as all get out.
bad,"I pride myself on customer service, so I can say that I enjoyed working at Wendy's. However management was the worst, yelled and degraded a lot and was inconsistent with guidance."
bad,Very fast paced a lot of cranky customers even when you do the job right cranky managers and Speedy shifts they were very stressful but was convenient at the time
bad,The job wouldn't be so hard if they didn't lack so many positions. The job you do it seems like it's meant for at least two people. As far as the raises the harder you work and show off skills the faster is it for you to get a raise. It's almost like a win loose situation.
bad,My wendys experience at the time was very stressful and the pay wasnt really good.The store was really under staffed and for some reason my old mamnagement knew nothing about getting health insurance or w2's Imhad to find them on my own.
bad,"Wendys hasn't been pushing me to my full potential and I would like to go somewhere that does, but it is a great first job! You learn more everyday and enhance your communication skills for the real world."
bad,"It's fast food, nothing glamorous... you can make your own schedule which is nice. And you're expected to clean up after yourself & others. Management is generally poor."
bad,The job was fun at times but more often than not it was super stressful due to poor management and employees that don't do the job that they are paid to do
bad,"Fun place to work. Marianne ran a tight ship, but made sure we felt like family. The hardest part of the job was working short staffed. I loved working wih all the employees and the customers were great."
bad,Working at Wendy's would've been a lot better if the employees weren't constantly fired and rehired. And it would've been a more tolerable working environment if I got more than two or three days a week.
bad,This is a fast food company and the turn-over rate is really high. Depending on which location you land will determine how you are treated as all individuals are different. I enjoyed working where I was at.
bad,"boring, never clean, management kept changing. was never consistent. way too much drama. worked with some interesting people. hated how dirty it was not many pros."
bad,"a typical day at Wendy""s was very difficult I was schedule at many different times.  I learn how to juggle many different tasks and work with all kinds of people. management changed daily hard to know who was in charge. workplace culture different because I enjoy working and I had a lot of unhappy people around me, but made the best of it. the hardest part of the job was not enough hours. the best part of the job was seeing returning and new customers."
bad,Go in willing to learn all procedures. Ask questions. Hands on and interacting will help a lot. Its not a hard job but can be overwhelming at time. We have 5 star employees that will help you get through.
bad,There was no weekly schedules and had to call store every morning to find out if you worked. Work environment wasn't bad and made friends. Work was hard and always fast-paced.
bad,"Lost a lot of great leaders, now the current ones are not effective leaders. Current management lack knowledge of motivating different personality types."
bad,"Wendy's was good when it came to gaining work experience. The management wasn't the best, but i did learn a lot from my supervisors. The job can be stressful and overwhelming for someone who isn't use to the environment."
bad,"wendys is DISGUSTING the workers dont wash their hands, they scratch their hair and play with the gloves on . They're very slow drive thru is always wrapped and the front workers never know what their doing theirs always sometime of confusion and the managers are no help because they're rude just like the works"
bad,they have terrible managers. they are careless and could do better but they chose to rehire the same people that did not want to work there to begin with. they are lazy.
bad,Customers were wonderful. Crew always helps when needed. Management is a little out of control. No one talks about what is going on so your always left in the dark.
bad,I didn't particularly enjoy my time at Wendy's . Poor management and low wages make it way worse than it needs to be. There were not enough people woring on any shift and I was expected to cover the work of three or four people.
bad,"It is a nice starting point for people who are looking for the first job."
bad,"The management was irresponsible and hired too many people, and thus many people are getting few work hours, i myself am getting less than 12 hrs a week (8-12 every 2 weeks) and i have told management many times that i am available any time. As well if the management claims not to have irresponsibly hired too many people then that means they are choosing not to train workers like myself who are out and keeping them on low salary"
bad,I honestly dont think Wendy should have as must drama as i experienced. It was fun at times but then again it wasn't. i dont really recommend people to work at the one i've worked at.
bad,"This is one of those jobs you take because you need the money.  In both times I worked at Wendy's, there were perhaps three or four people who were good at the job, while everyone else simply did not care and did not try.  And guess who has to pick up the slack?  You do!  When customers get all riled up because you can't, in fact, perform miracles on demand, guess who takes the blame?  You do!  When literally anything goes wrong, guess who gets held responsible?  You guessed it: you do."
bad,"I am a hard worker and did tasks that were not even mine. I enjoyed working with some of the co workers and managers, however the General Manager was/is providing favoritism to certain employees and rude to others."
bad,"They started me at $7.75/hr with no prior fast food experience which was nice, however, the regional manager was awful.  I had to work at the store she worked at and she ruined it essentially.  The job would not have been that miserable without her there so I suppose this is an unfortunate review.  Ah well, that is what it was for me."
bad,"•	Trained employees on the front counter position, specializing in closing"
bad,A typical day at work will be how you let it be for you. Every job has if pros and cons and some are different from others but yet again it's all in how you let it be
bad,They have bad management. Unfair they aren't equal favoritism is shown so much. Not the best place to want to work at. The managers are unprofessional.
bad,"Typical day consisted of usually coming in with many customers as i was closer and came in during rush hour put on my hat and apron and got putting meat patties on the grill and made sure the sandwich maker had enough chicken to last for a while"
bad,only did it to stay out of trouble but I cant lie I built some good relationships with some good people there and we got some things done well and I enjoyed it
bad,"I worked hard to move up in the company but was surpassed by people who were less qualified for the job. I enjoyed what I did, but wasn't given a chance to advance."
bad,well managed great people. customers not so nice all the time. good starter job to get you feet in the door and some work experience. always hiring...
bad,"Gm was awful with scheduling and processing orders. Could not lead a crew of workers accordingly and had favoritism. Workers will follow suit with the GM, so if they were laid back it was hard to get necessary work done on schedule. Lacked authority."
bad,"A typical day at work would be me wiping down the counters every time there was free time. I would also constantly be filling up the ice in the freezer in the front, and I'd also be restocking all the sauces for the salads and burgers and things.The hardest part of the job is when you have so many customers come in at once and you start feeling all the pressure."
bad,"My experience was bad, it was my first job , I was 17 but the way things were set up at that store wasn't always right. Everywhere is different though."
bad,"Hours go by quickly due to being busy, I don't really feel cared about im left standing all 7 hours without bathroom break or food break so it's stressful ll but I have to pay my bills so I must  deal with it like it or not.."
bad,I liked to work at bakers but the only thing I didn't like was the management and how they treated there night crew. they didn't do anything for the men on nights that needs to be fixed but the job itself was a good job wish I still had it
bad,Wendys overall is a great place to work. I wish that the pay for managers was a bit higher like most fast food places. They require more nowadays for managers to do and I have no issue with more work but the pay doesn't match up.
bad,During my time there we had a bunch of shake ups within the management as well as in the crew members. This was a good way to introduce me to the work force while I was in High School.
bad,I enjoyed working...I learned different thngs allthe time...I enjoy working with different people...I try to do my best at whatever I do...One of the things I really didnt like about tis job was they dont really open the vwindow to grow in the company..Such as moving up to diffedrent positions
bad,It was a great place to work on most days but there were many issues with employees and management which made it a stressful work environment.
bad,"Environment was close quarters"
bad,"Wendy's was not the best experience for me because the manager did not respect me as much as she respected my other coworkers. Being the younger worker I was singled out so I could not really connect with the coworkers, and as soon as I started taking classes in the summer, they did not want to work with my schedule, which is understandable, but it did not seem like they cared."
bad,"You'll have rude coworkers to deal with and little to no benefits offered, if you go to school in the morning try to get off around 11 because they don't close until 1, and you aren't out until 2 am, which can make balancing life and work together a bit harder."
bad,"Aside from Wendy's being my favorite fast food place to eat in. I also loved working there as a cashier. A typical day at work is serving our guest ensuring complete satisfaction. Making sure those burgers and fries were good and tasty. Wendy's being my first job  taught me how to connect with society learning different ways to reach customers, multi-task, and use problem solving skills which I hold on to this day. The most enjoyable part of my day was pleasing consumers."
bad,"Typical day involves getting to work and dealing with customers, usually have surprisingly bad attitudes, coworkers with bad attitudes, management telling people to not suggest money saving options because the store needs the money, none of the prep work is done and left for the closing team to complete and leaving everyone working sore and irritable. This mixed with low pay and no benefits leads to a high turn over rate and everyone becoming bitter about it. The coworkers in a one on one basis were pretty cool but at work nobody was happy. The management doesn't seem to grasp the concept of leaving a minimum wage job for one that enables people to have a place to live. The only enjoyable part of the job was turning off the lights so we can start cleaning and go home and the fact that Wendy's as a whole actually cares about people. Wendy's is one of the few fast food places I have worked that would rather you throw nasty looking food or food that passed the timer, away rather than holding it longer to be served to save a buck, and I can respect that."
bad,"A typical day at work is very good. Assisting and associating with customers and handling their needs. My management is a very good team. They work together to keep the store running and make sure they're employees are the best to their abilities. the hardest part of the job is being short of an employee, but we know how to make it work and run the store like always. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing what you love and for me that is interacting with people."
bad,I enjoy working for Popeyes not only for the food but the short hours. I had a home life and my whole day was not being at work.
bad,A typical day at Wendy's was stressful and tiresome. I was a cook but seem like I did every job. I waited on the managers hand and foot. The co-workers were cool and also felt the same as I did.
bad,"i have been working at wendys for almost a year now.  I have not received a raise or any benefits because of it.  I have never been late and they often call me in.  I hardly ever get a day off.  when I am given time off it is because I have worked too many hours the previous week.  I am constantly being told if my hours dont come down I will be working in another store which allows 40 hours workers (almost an hour drive away).  I am very dissatisfied with this company."
bad,"First couple of days were going kind of smooth. Had a trainer to help and show me around the place. After knowing the ins and outs out of this restaurant, manager left me to do things alone when its not possible. Had too many responsibilities that I couldn't keep up with time. Not worth working at Wendys if that's how they treat you."
bad,"I think the management needs to get all on the same page and treat there employers better. I learned alot at wendys but I will never work there again, I got along with all of my co workers they were very friendly. there was nothing that i found hard about the job ."
bad,fast-paced business. we can get free food on our breaks.  as a crew member if you're getting 40 hours a week you're still not getting any benefits as full-time employees would
bad,"the franchise i worked for was family based employment, no benefits and minimal chance of ever becoming full time. unless you were hospital sick, a doctors excuse was needed even if you could not afford to go to one. I was not happy to be more in debt with hospitals to keep a minimum wage job."
bad,I take orders from customers for food i either call their name or take their food to them. Then i clean off tables and make sure the dining area is sanitary.
bad,it was'nt  a bad job to be at i enjoy doing the activities i enjoy the people i work and make the most of my day when i was there i try really like the environment
bad,I used to work for Wendy's 2 months ago and I loved it their because of the co-workers all got along and because I got to meet new people everyday but I quite because I was their for almost 3 years and I was only making 8.75 an hour where people that was their for a few months was making 9.00 an hour and I thought was unfair and I would work a lot of extra hours and had and still wouldn't get the raise I wanted and the general manger was showing favorites to who every who was not doing their job so I had to quite.....
bad,"A typical day at work is setting the store up for business and taking care of customers. I also managed employees and managers. The most enjoyable part of working here is that everyday is a different day. You never know what type of day you are going to have. I started out as a crew member and six months into first working there, I was promoted to shift supervisor and then restaurant manager and onto a General manager. I enjoy taking care of customers and making them happy. I enjoy learning and also training."
bad,"I Didn't like my experience there, we had too many robberies . The General manager only did openings and no closings. I wasn't trained properly ."
bad,"I learned a lot about the food industry and meet many different types of people who were very interesting. The management wasn't exactly the best. They need to work on that, and be more clear about regulations."
bad,".I would go to my area and take orders and hand them out or cook and make orders.I learned how to be a fast worker and how to operate a register,managers are nice and helpful,the hardest part is when we are busy and shorthanded ,the best part is meeting new people and getting a discount."
bad,Bad management people where not good to be around even the customers that came in were not very nice in hated that job but I did keep it for a long time because I needed the job.
bad,"Work in a fast pace environment, must be able to interact with customers, and make orders. Unload truck and organize the back room and keep the dinning area clean"
bad,Work started off to be very fun.  Learning how to make different ice creams and foods was exciting.  I enjoyed the costumers and employees all at once.  Eventually it got to a point where I felt that I was working so hard for very little pay.
bad,"I loved Getting free meals. "
bad,"Although the pay was good, work environment was unsanitary and the staff were not too decent. Hours were extremely flexible"
bad,"I started working here after I got back from a trip down south. Working at first really wasn't all that bad, fast food is never fun, but we learn to live with it. Anyway, after about a week or two it started getting really hard. We were almost always extremely busy and understaffed. Busy wasn't an issue for me, it was the constantly under staffing us that was."
bad,The Job was a decent experience for my initial job but i am now looking for something more advanced that will enhance my skills.
bad,Working fast food is a lot more difficult than most people realize.  There are many duties that are included.  I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers.  Did not care for management other than the General Manager and one manager.  I enjoyed working with the public.
bad,"A fast-paced environment working with six other managers.  Have developed positive relationships with both coworkers and loyal customers.  Daily goals are to be met, so daily you are working under pressure, which I have found to work well for me."
bad,Its an OK job great hours great pay fun environment fast pace meet new people clean place to work the rush was awesome challenging
bad,"This was my first job of out high school. This position helped me understand the job culture of the food industry as well as introducing me to dealing with the public. I operated the grill, register, as well as restaurant floor. I cleaned and maintained an acceptable work environment. The most enjoyable part of my job was the learning experience to allow me to move on to other and more profitable positions"
bad,"Decent hours, rude staff. Manager was the only really nice employee. Overall it was definitely a learning experience in the fast food field."
bad,"a typical day at work is opening the store then working with customers and managing food and health and safety precautions, the closing and cleaning"
bad,"This was not a healthy environment I was working in at the time. The management was toxic and looked after their own. You were not adequately compensated for your time. Sometimes, workers would be asked to work off the clock and the hours would be altered to avoid overtime. Mind you, this was two or so years ago. Hopefully it has gotten better."
bad,It aint a bad place to start when  you need the money but its not a job that will get you as far if you were doing a better paying job because you dont get enough hours to live off of when you have a family to take care of.
bad,"a typical day at work would include, co workers standing around talking and not doing their job including managers. Wendys is short on people so even the slowest days would be busy . i work in a place where they have favoritism and disloyalty up their ally. the managers don't do their job and most of them steal"
bad,"This job had many flaws. There was always conflict going on around the work place. While I made sure never to be involved, there was constant miscommunication and anger floating around the store. People being trained were criticized very hard when just beginning.  Customers were waiting almost 25 minutes for food sometimes. Stress was always high for managers. Managers had all different types of ways to make things run, so people were always confused and/or doing something wrong. I have learned that not getting involved with any of my co-workers beyond a work relationship is the most effective way to get work done. Monthly meetings were held for all staff to go over new products and current issues. This was very helpful and effective. The best part of this job was working with customers and making people smile."
bad,"Great place to work your way through high school, they work around schedules and extra curricular activities."
bad,"A typical day at work is always busy"
bad,Disliked it but it was job can't complain management was horrible where i was at...but that don't speak for all
bad,I would open the store and get it ready for the day. I think you work way to hard and you are really under payed.
bad,"Things may have changed however when I was there it was hard to push through raises for deserving employees.  There was no work life balance as a manager...95 hours per week while going to school is no fun.  That being said they definitely promoted from within, which was nice."
bad,pay is bad but good for a first job or par time if going to school.
bad,Fast Paced job. Co-workers were good at team work. the hardest part of the job was keeping all customers happy during our busiest of hours.
bad,"My experience working at Wendy's was financially satisfying for the time being but the management was very unorganized and I found the work schedule calendar inconvenient. I was not notified when need to work, if I miss work or was late, my excuse would be because I didn't know. if I did not work the day before the new schedule was posted i would have to call or make an appearance to be able to see if i am working the upcoming in coming week. At times the telephone was not functioning as well."
bad,I learned how to operate a business from open to close on a daily basis.
bad,working with others on the work priority's an having fun with all my co workers while getting the job done.
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's will be coming into work scanning your finger to clocking in, and getting ready for your shift and position. Depending where you are placed and the position you are taking over for the day, there will be different procedures that will be have to be taken."
bad,Wendys is a good place to work if you have the right manager to run the store. they are usually fast passed and fun to work at. there aren't many benefits that come with it
bad,"making sure cook station was cleaned and all temperatures were set correct for cooking. I learned how to properly take care of food."
bad,"The Management is horrible! Including the owner of the company. Major retaliation from management even when no one was doing anything wrong. Manager's steal money and get promoted, but yet good workers get no promotion. Some co-workers are incredible others are horrible. When a problem is presented to the managers they take no action. I did learn to better manage my time working drive-thru, and I learned a little more cooking."
bad,"very hard and fast work, always something to do, learned to work as a team and most management were very fair and fun to work with. Great co workers. Not always enough time to get everything done that needed to get done and the best part was time to go home."
bad,"A typical workday included either taking orders at the drive thru window or cooking on the grill.  Management was fine, both store and upper management. My co-workers did what they were told, which kept the store running smoothly.  The hardest part of the job was cleaning up at the end of the night and the most enjoyable was the breaks with co-workers."
bad,"A typical days work was being on the cash register , making food and preparing the food. I learned to how to grill and fry chicken along with alot of other foods. the hardest part of the day was dealing with angry customers . the most enjoyable part of the day was when it was a slow moment and we had time to stock back up."
bad,"A typical day at work was pretty hectic. I worked morning and lunch, and during lunch it was packed. The line would be out the door and cars were wrapped around the building. I was great under pressure but the managers would lose it. They would get in extremely bad moods and yell for no reason. I learned that just a smile and a how is your day going can make that customers rest of the day great just by letting them know you care and I love that feeling when I can make someone's day. Most of my co-workers were great but a few there were trouble but you get that a lot of places that you work. I've also learned that your cannot please everyone and not everyone will agree on how you do things but all you can do is try your best. The hardest part of the job was lunch rush because is would be non-stop for three and a half hours. Lastly the most enjoyable part of the day was when my regulars would come in just to see and talk to me, it made me feel like I was doing exactly what I was supposed to be doing."
bad,I switch to alot of different postitions on a daily basis. I have learned to solve problems quickly and efficiently on the spot. The managers keep everyone in line and keep customers happy. Work together as a team and help new employees. Working on sandwiches during lunch or dinner. Reasoning is because it is 5 or more sandwiches per order non stop for over 4 hours at a time. Seeing repeat customers and learning new things.
bad,"This is a good job only if you want to make a few dollars. This job is not meant for a career, the hours are long, very understaffed, and the pay is terrible. The people there are friendly and nice and teaches you good customer service. "
bad,"A typical day at Wendy`s was about 3-6 hours a day for me. I learned how to work with money, such as make change. Also I learned how to work with customers and keep the restaurant clean. Management was friendly as well as my co workers. I always had something to talk about with co workers on slow days. I would have liked to work more hours is my only management complaint. The hardest part of the job was taking orders. I feel like I was not trained as well as others and having had no prior experience, I was often lost on what to do. The most enjoyable part was I got along with the customers and my co workers and it was nice seeing a smile on the customers face and know they are happy with the service I provided.  "
bad,Overall it's a good company to work for depending on your location
bad,"I enjoyed working here you got to meet diffrent people,also help me with being able to work at fast pace."
bad,I worked only twice a week by my choice. they were flexible with hours. however managment had a thing for just getting rid of people by putting them on a teperary leave. I loved working with the people for the most part. 
bad,"A typical day at work would be getting to work at 5 and dealing with the dinner rush between 5 and 8 PM. Around 8 I would go on break, when I returned I had to stock my position, sweep and mop the bathrooms and lobby, and count down my register at the end of the day. I matured quite a bit working at Wendy's, I learned that the customer is always right and to always listen to your boss regardless if you agree or not. My co workers were primarily Hispanic, but it was a great experience to work with other cultures and hear different languages. The hardest part of the job was to always have a good drive-through timer, (under 140 seconds). The most enjoyable part of my job was the slower parts of the day when you got to clean and talk to my co-workers."
bad,Starting up every morning with a team gives me motivation to keep going. I learned how to react to life situations in respect of others feelings. Working with a good team gets the job done. The hardest part of the job is when we have alot of call outs and the staff we have would have to put the effort in still to keep the store up and running. What i enjoyed about the job is learning new people.
bad,"Not enough hours,place to move around nor ,a management with a ability to set proper bound without think what other would do nor say.Nice and kind co workers.Learning how to prepare sandwhiches to many different ingredients. Listening to the the customers on the drive through."
bad,Wendys was my first job. It was pretty much Okay.
bad,Learned to open and close the store on a daily basis. Did par levels for the week. Beginning and ending inventory and learned how to do a budget. Food and beverage cost.
bad,"A typical day at work here involves getting to work at 7am, then running around doing things like: making chili, pulling and marking frozen products from the freezer, maintaining inventory, cleaning fryers, taking out the garbage, sweeping the parking lot, and sweeping and mopping the restaurant. Then making and serving food to customers later on."
bad,"A typical day at work is coming in and getting to know what you have to do and you do it. I learned to use communication skills and listening skills. The Managment was great, great people. I loved working with my co workers, their such a fun group. The hardest part was on some busy days, you weren't able to get stuff done so on your own time you would have to finish it."
bad,"i love to make money,i love to make other people happy.I always wanted to go back to collage but i don't know what i want to do with my life right now."
bad,A place that i worked at when i was in school that was easy to do and flexible with my hours
bad,typical day was ok learn about stocking and fast pace management okay fun co-worker
bad,"If you are at a store where there's proper teamwork, then it's a fine place to work, so experiences vary from location to location."
bad,"Managers have play favortisim and If the  emcee doesn't fit into that group, the manager and assisted manager would give the worst jobs to them or repeatedly be on their backs about eveything they do wrong. Could.use more compassion with employees instead of making them cry and feel worthless."
bad,I am currently employed here and most days I'm there I am beyond frustrated. The current location cannot keep a GM in the store longer than a few months which is annoying. Some managers come full of drama and love talking behind everyone's back and are just rude and disrespectful. This place does not appreciate their employees at all. The job its self isnt difficult at all.
bad,I had some bad times working at Wendy's but overall it was an okay job. It's a great first job to have. There were mainly older people working there. Overall nice workplace.
bad,"my working experience was okay. Some employees are little frustrating to work with, or managers didn’t listen to some our request. i still enjoyed it."
bad,Good for a first job. Quick place to learn. Management needs some adjustment. Staff is friendly. Drama filled however everyone wants to know everyone’s business all the time. Management can’t be rude and only care about clocking in and out and not giving help to staff. Night shift is horrible understaffed and doesn’t get help
bad,For a teenager as a start job it would be okay. If your trying to build yourself or provide for your family strongly do not recommend. Each location is different though.
bad,I had a good time in the beginning then once I was there for A while things change they stop working as hard as me in got bad when I had to leave do to the fact I was having a child
bad,Usually it all depends of the supervisor that is on shift but it was nice. The night shift was extremely helpful. We were like family. It was a great night shift environment and if anyone needed help it was provided.
bad,Speed and accuracy must keep fast pace and get orders out on time be mindful of others orders get it right the 1st time help others. Suggest New foods for the customers to try and hope they enjoy be friendly even when customers may not
bad,"Bottom line, it’s fast food, not a 5 star Gordon Ramsay restaurant where we are saving peoples lives.  Instead of making it a fun environment where people could have enjoyed their job, the upper management (district managers and above) made the workplace horribly negative and pushed ridiculous goals onto the crew.  They promote people way too fast and instead of properly training them into the position they just let them crash and burn and then micro-manage the crew &  managers. They take their jobs WAYYYYYY to seriously and don’t care about the employees lives outside of the job. If you are single, have no friends or family and zero hobbies then this job is for you. Worst part of it all is that all they preach to you is how they are a “family”...absolute lies!!!"
bad,This was a fast paced environment job. I believe I strongly disliked the shortage of hours I got and even when asking for more it didnt happen. Overall it's a pretty clean place
bad,I don't knw much about the job anymore but I think everything is still the same and they need to work on good communication skills with there employee
bad,I’m 18 I have a kid on the way and Wendy’s ain’t gonna pay just my bills but I also want a car and I wanna be able to Give him the life I never had...
bad,"The money was good, customer service, fast paced, kind and friendly, but the place wasn't always at a T like it should've been. Management was great other than the head boss. She wasn't very relying or honest about things and some co workers were doing a poor job. The hardest part was night shift, everything had to be done even if the place closed at 12 EVERYTHING had to be done. But it was good though, the business could've been better."
bad,"I worked the grill, cashier, fries, sandwich prep, stalked, and dealt with customers. I what I learned from it though was I picked up real good fast pace skills and learned how to greet customers. The management was ok somewhat good I just should've got a raise for being there for 4 years but the hardest thing would probably be the busy Sunday's those were the worst but we had fun a little with the few coworkers I had there"
bad,"When I was hired to work at Wendy's I was still considered to be a minor, because I was only 17 years old at the time. At the end of my interview, the general manager offered me a job, but said that because I was still a minor they were only going to pay me $7.86 per hour. At the time, the minimum wage was in the process of being raised to $9.25. When I turned 18, they did raise my pay to $9.25. I only worked at the front counter of the restaurant for the first month or two that I worked there. I picked up using the register very quickly. The first time that I was working until close, I was very overwhelmed with all of the cleaning duties and other things I was needed to do before my shift was over. It was expected that I had already been told and taught what to do, even though I hadn't. The first time I worked the drive thru window, I was very stressed out. After doing it for a few times it became my favorite thing to do because it made my shift seem like it went by much faster. No one else usually liked to do drive thru so I began to do that almost every time I worked. People called in all the time, or just didn't show up. I witnessed at least 5 employees walk out in the middle of their shift and quit without any notice. There were a couple instances in which it was only me and one manager running the entire restaurant. There were several occasions that I stayed at the restaurant until 2:00am, even though my shift was supposed to be over at 11:30pm, because we were so short staffed and behind on doing the things that needed to be done before we could close the restaurant for"
bad,"Would not recommend "
bad,The management is terrible. The company general manager chooses favorites. He makes up his own policy and expects the team to just comply and he’s biased.
bad,The one I worked at was a bunch of kids in management and the manager yelled at everyone anything me got stressed. It was the reason that I quit. Would not recommend working here
bad,Really they don't like giving 40 hours a week. And you have to fight just to get 40 hours. They don't care about making you work 13 hours and you not eating at all
bad,"* greeting customer "
bad,"Management was great! Customers  were hard to satisfy, multitask in varies places, cross trained in all areas. Most days it was packed and always had business."
bad,"It really depends on your GM, The general manager makes and breaks the restaurant. I have had great ones and ones that did not uphold the values of the company."
bad,Not to many employees was working and it was hard for the workers that was there to pass out orders . Lack of team work and leadership. Always worried about who was dating who in the store
bad,"during my lunch break i was told to return to work before i clocked in i was texting my mother that was returning to work, but the manager wanted to take my phone away for the rest of my shift and i refused because she had no right to take my personal phone. management there is unprofessional and disrespectful."
bad,Very in orginazes they had to many people acting like they were the boss and not enough crew ever always short handed. Very stressful on a wait basicly
bad,"Working here was a challenge. Managers were never on the same page about ANYTHING! When I started, I was told they don't train & I will eventually 'get the hang of it'. Most things were too high or too heavy for short people. In the beginning, every day I went in I got in trouble by a manager for doing something - I didn't get trained for -wrong. They would then tell me the 'right way' or the 'way they do it' because 'everyone who works there does everything their own way' but once a new manager was scheduled & show how the last manager showed me. They'd say not to do it that way but THEIR way. There was ALWAYS something the last scheduled manager didn't make me do. So there was ALWAYS something extra to do before I clocked out. This was a very stressful place because once I felt like I was about to master my work or felt like I was going someone. There was always something EXTRA I needed to do with no reasoning why I didn't do it before."
bad,"My training was not explained very well at all when I started. The person who trained me showed me the bare minimum even when I explained this was my first job and had to keep asking questions. A couple of managers treated me poorly when I needed help, got very impatient and they were were unprofessional."
bad,"for some reason it was always a high stress environment"
bad,"For a fast food restaurant, it was how it an be expected. It was very high paced, stressful, and management honestly wasn't the best. I was not at all impressed by the job and wouldn't recommend it to any friends but those looking for part time and are possibly young"
bad,Wrndys was a fast paced and crazy environment. Due to the fact that its a fast food restaurant people are always in a rush and want things in a hurry . sometimes there are rude people who just dont care and will disrespect you for no reason. I dont recommend wendys for a first job.
bad,"decent work environment with great employees, difficulty working with management but overall good experience with good working pay, would recommend to a friend"
bad,The people at Wendy's were amazing to work with however a recent change in management made the work experience worse and we often did not even have our schedules until the same week we were suppose to work. Overall I learned great customer service skills and food trade skills however the management made the last couple of months unpleasant.
bad,had one manager i liked. was yelled at daily and treated poorly for little things. was worked til midnight at least (im 17) and had little to no coworkers to help close.
bad,i worked there with people that also worked there. We had the same shifts and i saw them and spent anywhere form 4 to 8 hours togther then i went home.
bad,"Wendy’s was ok I believe it was just that particular Wendy’s that was unorganized , unsanitary and unprofessional I honestly wouldn’t work at Wendy’s again but if I had no choice I would go to another location"
bad,"not the best work environment. Good for a first job, Great management, but a stressful environment to work in. Low pay with only small raises every six months"
bad,"i'd never work there again. It was the worst. No one cared about the well being of their employees, it was more of a sweat shop than a work place. Never again."
bad,"You work overtime, in a fast paced environment. You have 8 hour days, it's hot, and you have to keep up with customer's orders. The pay isn't enough.."
bad,Wendy's is a great job for teens that need money during the school year. There are times where if you are under 18 they dont treat you with the same respect as workers 18+. Working night shift was nice before closing all the workers would help each other finish their cleaning duties so everyone could leave at a decent time.
bad,something would always be wrong there that would hide from the members of the job. People at the job where just getting away with stuff that they shouldnt have.
bad,"I really didn’t like they atmosphere in that work place . They don’t like working together. To them it’s about who works better or who getting more hours . Which is really ridiculous to me . We all go there to work not to see who getting more hours , or who’s getting paid more"
bad,"It was a okay job to have to make money to support my family, I did  not feel there was any job advancement or good pay to have there. The people were great to work with."
bad,"Although the management was poor, the crew members were great, everything I learned was from the crew members, I caught on easily and got right along with the team. Our rule was work first laughs later."
bad,"Very fast paced establishment, with some managers who were the best Ive ever had, while some managers were literally the worst. I would've stayed If there would've been career advancements."
bad,I didn’t even know how to cook but I figured it out fast and don’t be shy that’s the worst.  The discount was good and the job is just like you would expect.
bad,"things were awful at the old company but now its even worse with the new one, we put up with more and are underpaid and unappreciated by the company. the only reason the wendys is workable at all is because the managers are amazing and understanding,"
bad,"working at the grill station was nerve wracking and i could not handle it. I was moved to cashier so i could take orders and greet customers. the people were fun to chat with, the employees were helpful and the discounts were nice."
bad,"Wendys was a highschool job, as you may know it is a fast food job. It was very difficult at times, but no matter what I made it work. I always kept my customers sastifed. No matter how bad my day was going, I always kept a smile on my face."
bad,Very busy and interesting place to work. I have learn alot about food safety. Enjoy my co-workers and customers and serving customers. the hardest part of my job i would have to say is  trying to my everyone happy. the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing people happy with the services they have receive
bad,A normal day is fast paced and busy. I have to ensure that the crew is within all safety regulations and food safety. Follow all FDA regulations. Overall provide a great customer service
bad,i did not enjoy working there . its was a on going nonstop job . i stayed on my feet majority of the day & only got one short break a day. i didnt have a good experience .
bad,The problem was they hired too many your people and then did not have enough hours to spread to their staff. I would also take the bus and get all the way there and they would send me home because they have too many workers. I think I had 7-14 hours a week.
bad,"This was my first job in high school, it taught me a lot about customer service and was a great starter job. Pay and benefits just do not work as you get older. Although Wendy's is a great company to work for."
bad,I enjoyed working for Wendy's and with my coworkers and i loved the costumers it was a fast and busy working environment as well. I worked cashier but helped with any other positions that needed it.
bad,"Extremely bad mangers, did not like how employees were treated including myself. hard, sweaty, smelly, work with not much compensation or positive influence by managers"
bad,"The management team is so messed up. They all complain that nobody does there job and then proceeds to NOT do their own jobs. They gossip like mad, to the point where they cant keep crew members. They start calling underage staff obscene names on FACEBOOK. They smoke weed on the clock and sit in their cars for 20-30 minutes at a time leaving the inside crew struggling. The general manager does not communicate with his co managers and does not properly discipline them when he needs to."
bad,They have all these different rules about stuff and when they change them we don't know excatly when the change them. They will just let just about anybody become  GM
bad,Very stressful work atmosphere.. Almost impossible requirements about time at drive thru.. lack of teamwork.. lack of communication between managers and crew
bad,I used it to gain experience so branch out into other business was a grueling 8 years of my life. Once I made it to General manager I was able to leave and that was the best decision of my life. Get out while you can...
bad,Horrible managers to work with. I'm not sure if they're more vile to the teens or the adults. These managers cuss at you and downgrade you in anyway they can.
bad,"There really are no typical days at Wendy's.  The pace is very very fast and you really have to know how to multitask.  I will be honest and say that I believe there are/were unrealistic expectations of the company.  They pay the crew people pretty lousy (min. wage) and expect blood in return.  People in fast food definitely deserve $15 an hour if they are doing a good job.  "
bad,I have worked in front end i have work drive through i have done lobby i have bathroom basically most of the restourant duties. Was a fast pace job always kept busy but employees and managment wasn't so good
bad,I don't recommend this place to be a good workplace if you want a fun environment. Everyone took everything too seriously and I was always yelled at for nothing bad.
bad,When I first started @ Wendys we had an awesome crew that worked together and great managers as well. Once management changed hands the restaurant didnt run as smoothly. Started getting customer complaints about speed of service as well as wrong orders being given out
bad,at wendys you had no way of life back when I worked.it was stressful and the hardest part couldn't give raises worth anything and I knew my crew members were struggling with minimum wage
bad,"There was only a lunch available as a break and depending on your position, you might not be able to take the lunch because the work would be too hectic. I do not know how the corporate stores are organized because I was at a franchise's store."
bad,"If you plan on having a good job. I would not recommended no,one work here . 7.35 is not a way to live exspecially if you have young kids . And I recommend you sign up for fmla if you have sick kids"
bad,Working at Wendy’s was fine but I would of change snider recommending people to work there because it’s isnt a great job to be exact just that certain things you don’t have to do and some you have to do. Depends on the position you’re in and the specific criteria that comes with it.
bad,not really a great place to work I felt as if this place was very toxic people who works here will get an satisfying paycheck but have to deal with the crazy people to make it
bad,Wendy's is a fast paced business and mostly everything you do is timed and stressful I think they should pay more then what they pay they have no benefits.
bad,"Typical day: cashier/food prep"
bad,management did not adapt when working with an employee with 2 jobs very solo minded management. pay was not very good at all even for managers. and no benefits or paid time off
bad,The crew members don't even get scheduled 40 hours and you need 40+ hours to get benefits. You get scheduled between 32-38 hours a week. Your pay checks are about 500 dollars every two weeks. That is not enough to pay any bills.
bad,"The crew members were very nice and helpful, however, the management used very bad language, if he was mad would not talk and made you feel uncomfortable like you did something wrong."
bad,Dont like wendys anymore its a terrible workplace and has no benefits worth working there and it's unfair that you get in trouble even for following the rules
bad,Working at WENDY'S was a good opportunity for me to continue working. It wasn't absolutely terrible but i would perfer not to work at fast food if i dont have to. All my co-workers were really friendly and laid back.
bad,"A very fast pace work environment. I have learned many things in being a restaurant manager. Payroll, hiring of employees, food cost variance, and how to control labor. The most enjoyable part of the job is training future management and crew."
bad,I started out as a crew member. I learned every position in the store in a short amount time. I was promoted to shift manager soon after. My management was great ad showing me how to work the computer and i started training manager above me. A great learning experience.
bad,Not a lot to worry about as long as you did your job. Others would do there's and that made it easy on everyone who worked and ate there. Just don't let people con you into doing there job.
bad,Everything was okay other than the fact that the managers had a nasty attitude.  They really don't allow the crew memebers to get that many hours and they hire wayyyy too many people at once.
bad,Very busy. Fast paced. Some Employees was sooo nice and some were rude. Discount on food and flexible hours. Loved working there with some supervisors.
bad,Expect to do the work of three people because of being understaffed and having call outs. Hard to get fired. Low pay grade. People are interesting. Ok job to start
bad,"upper management sucks, and don't mind throwing anyone under the bus.  most gm's are two faced and work the crew to death instead of leading them, they boss them around.  they try to get you to work all the week with the incentive of comp time, god forbid you want to take one of your days off."
bad,Its more fun and this is my first time to work as service crew the first time i applied in wendys i have no idea how to operate the production because i dont have any working experience thank god that wendys have training and i was able to learned to become as service crew.
bad,"Its not so much the job that is not pleasant as it is the customers you meet along the way. No matter what a customer says/yells at you for, whether it may be your fault or not, they are always right. You run into some difficult people along the way in fast food."
bad,It was my first job start working there right after high school . It really wasn't for me the pay sucked and I hated being put on that big grill making greasy burgers . I wouldn't advice anyone else to work there unless you just need a job . Also management was horrible
bad,"It is a fast paces job that requires you to be standing on your whole entire shift, just a 30 minutes break, but the workers are friendly and polite. Customers are also nice."
bad,Wendy's was a fun work place. It was a good experience to build and improve working with my hands and build relastionships with people. It also helped me improve my customer service.
bad,Coworkers are good to work with but management is inconsiderate and has favorites. if you ask for more hours they say no but call you on your off days to come in.
bad,The crew and member could be need to be more nicer and be helpful and benefit the customers like they should be treated with respect and happy better fun
bad,"Does not treat some employees with respect, does not treat some employees with kindness. Not good enough training, too much pressure on employees, and needs better leadership."
bad,"Wendy's In Morehead City Ain't The Best Place To Work For . The Building Is About To Tear Down, I Was The Cook, Cashier, & The Drive Thru Person. The Mangers Are Disrespectful , General Manager Do Whatever She Wants To Do, & Working As Hard As We Can But The Employees Don't Appreciate It. It's A Okay Job For Me."
bad,I wouldnt recommended a cow to go work at this place its the WORST place ever the staff barely help you unless its somebody the actually hang around  with which is clearly not fair
bad,Wendy's Restaurant is a great place to work for. The other employees are helpful. If you needed help with something they are there to assist you with what ever you need
bad,"Running shifts "
bad,loved the job got terminated due to manager error i would work here again if i could could also be a good career for the right person
bad,My job was to Greet customer and take the ordes and cash them out and fix their drinks and cordinate their food and mop and scrub the floors. Also my job was to help as a team and cordinate and help other teammembers in their
bad,I enjoyed working here for the experience with food as well as the public however the staffing and management was stressful and usually uncomfortable.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Serving the customers was the most fun thing to do at this job. Management was horrible. Although the job was easy, the management left a lot to be desired."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. Wendy's is the most difficult of the fast food chains in terms of how much work has to be done. However, the pay does not reflect the work. There are no pay benifits for working night shifts. Yearly raises up to 5 cent. Co-workers are good people. Hardest part of the job would be closing the place. If one team member slacks on his/her job, it is felt by the entire team. The best part of the job is always knowing you'll have those hours."
bad,In the morning I would clean the dining room and parking lot. Taking out the garbage was difficult because they did not have supporting equipment. Management was not the best in terms of respectful communication. The hardest part of the job was being a minority and trying to carry tonnes of garbage with my hands. I did not enjoy it other than getting to talk to customers.
bad,"The management has much opportunity to observe the workers, sometimes too much. It's a very small place with a lot of people working. The customers were great, but management was very strict."
bad,"I disliked working at Wendy's. It's the worst job I had. Management was rude, coworkers were rude, stressful environment and nobody knew how to confront correctly. Horrible place."
bad,"I liked that I multitasked , my most enjoyable time was my custoers and giving them the attention  and hot fresh food they asked for. The hardest part of the job was getting back and fourth with 7 or 10 other team members on the floor moving fast in a very small space."
bad,"Working at Wendy's was good for a while. The management wasn't great and but the 50% discount for food was nice. Co-workers were pretty friendly, just depends on who you work with."
bad,Wendys taught me how to talk to strangers. Put myself out there and speak up. i used to be very shy but they brought me out of  my shell. but the only way i could go back to work at wendys if we had all the same co-workers and managers that were there when i started.
bad,"Made sure register was counted and balance was correct for beginning of the day. Stock up on condiments and napkins. "
bad,"A typical day at work would be stressful. The General Manager seemed grumpy almost all the time and was really rude. The rest of the managers were more positive and friendly. Most of my co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was working split shifts all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was closing down the restaurant with one of my managers , it was always a good time."
bad,Great working environment but not the greatest pay! The crew members do ALOT of work but seem not to get the appropriate pay with the work that is done
bad,"Good people, terrible pay. It's a decently good work environment, it's just discouraging to want to comment a lot of time to a place when your making 7.25/hr."
bad,it was a job that was tiring I did dishes rang out customers rang in customers took orders moped helpd with other crew members
bad,"When I was a shift supervisor, I generated an excel program that improved the previous program by keeping better track of the inventory and finances."
bad,Well they all make me do nothing but the grills and collect money on a cold winter days. It got really annoying and really fast because there wasn't any change of work environment. Everyone treated badly because i was the youngest of them all and they think i wasn't up for the job.
bad,The pay was not worth the work that had to be applied daily. The hours would fluctuate every week. I did not like the job. I worked with a bunch of clowns.
bad,"My workplace is generally a lot of fun, we don't really have a lot of always serious employees. That said, the day can fly by amazingly fast with lots of laughs and jokes which make the job fun and not too stressful, but there are cons. Just like any other job, the customers can be extremely rude and by this point, my sorry is just like another meaningless hello said just to move the conversation along. For a starting position in the workforce, I will say that it was amazing and educational. Unfortunately this job offers no future and there is not much you can do on a minimum wage."
bad,"A typical day at work would be me punching in, a couple of small greetings check the daily cleaning chart to see what needed to be done, wash my hands, and go to work. I learned different tasks within the restaurant and a better understanding of time management. My co- workers didn't have the best attitude or professionalism but I got along with them for the most part because of my high-tolerance. Hardest part of the job was not being treated fairly and dealing with attitudes. Most enjoyable was seeing money in my bank account."
bad,"If you enjoy working on your feet for eight hours a week with no break, then this is the job for you. Other than the constant standing, it was a good job to keep through high school and kept enough money in my pocket to shop. I didn't like the fact that they started you at minimum wage and it takes for ever to be promoted to a higher position."
bad,"Best part about it were my coworkers since I was in high school and there were other high schoolers."
bad,"at the location i worked at, some of  the managers were very rude and disrespectful to their employees and most importantly their costumers. they would talk about extremely bad about the handicap and the elderly.. i had to leave the company because i couldnt take the disrespect. never the less, i absolutely LOVED the costumers they were mostly older citizens and they were beyond amazing."
bad,".make sure that work area is clean and neat and make sure to count money "
bad,It wasn't the best job that I've had but it wasn't the worst either. It helped me work on my customer service skills.
bad,"There were moments where there would be nothing going on, then suddenly your using all the product and it is got to be constant. It is hot and there is not much space for walking when people are working. I was bumped many times. So much food was wasted and you are constantly at risk of being burned. I never was given a break for any of my shifts and the managers always put me on the early afternoon shift."
bad,"A day at work was fun but we also had rushes thats when theres alot of people coming in from drive thru and inside. I learned how to communicate better with others, prep food and work a cash register. Managment was good but could of been better. The co-workers were all nice and friendly and willing to help if needed it. The hardest part was when its rush hour and you have to stock up on your area and have no time to do it while working to get the rush hour done."
bad,"learnt food preparation and customer service!"
bad,"* Fast paced"
bad,This was my first job so I had a good time working there. I learned a lot about cooking and how to treat customers fair.
bad,"Typical day: 3-7 hours"
bad,had alot of fun there good co workers. worked as best of my ability.
bad,"Job started honestly enough. Minimum wage part time. When you make it 6 months you are supposed to receive a raise. General Manager never did the paperwork to give employees raises. Becoming a manager is also easy enough. Don't expect to be given any real managerial responsibility unless you are on the short list of friends. You will be stuck with the majority of the work with no recognition but every small task that isn't done, your fault or not, comes down on you. You cannot terminate or even reprimand employees even if they verbally assault you or abuse a customer. District Manager won't acknowledge issues or address them, just sweep them under the rug. Taking it above his head will get you nowhere because the president of the company will just refer the issue back to the District Manager to ignore again. The company has ignored sexual harassment claims and on the job injury claims because upper management doesn't act accordingly when lower managers advise them of something. Company was also aware of a general manager stealing money and did nothing about it."
bad,"Working the cashier at the beginning of the day during breakfast, moving to cleanup in between breakfast and lunch, then back to cashier made for an easy day in fast food."
bad,"A place to work at for a second job or for high schoolers, not a job to pay bills."
bad,It was an ok job. I wished for more working hours. At the time that I was working there the team was pretty good to work to work with.
bad,Nice time to meet new people.between co workers and customers.
bad,"Wendy's is a crazy, sometimes fun place to work for. It is a place best suited for the younger people. There is always drama, and scandals going on all the time. They offer NO pay raises as I have worked there for almost twelve years and have not gotten one in the past eight years!"
bad,I liked working at wendy's besides the pay. I thought the employees worked very hard for a little of nothing.I loved interacting with the customers.
bad,some of the people in the restaurant didnt know any maners and some would be mean to other people
bad,"Mangers yelling at there employees all the time. Employees standing around talking about sports,or music instead of trying to stay busy and keep the store clean and the line stocked. Always running out of product or waiting on it to come up. Seamed like the store was always down people. Enjoyable part of my day was my days off. Hardest part of my days putting up with a manager thats always on a power trip."
bad,I worked as a cashier so I took orders and cash my whole shift.
bad,"My typical day would start at 10am, i would watch both registers (front and drive thru) until the rest of the crew would get there at 11:30. Then i would mainly work the drive thru window, greeting customers, collecting money and getting their orders together. I have learned how to to be more patient with people, be more of a team player"
bad,"The hardest part of the job was finding the right shoes that made me comfortable. I learned pretty quick, i learned in a day. I learned how to make smooties, shakes, parfaits, etc. I loved working with people, it was the best part of the job. The managers were pretty mean and didn't really care about you being sick or not. Typical day at work was being really busy"
bad,A typical day at work consisted of me cooking the fries and chicken nuggets and when i had time to spare i swept and cleaned my station. I learned how to work the fryer. Management was okay not the best. Co-workers were rude and treated me as something you could force to do anything like their job while they stood around and went for smoke breaks. The hardest part was big orders and impatient customers. The most enjoyable part was getting off.
bad,"Typical day was hectic, management and staff were poorly trained. Lots of arguing and personal business."
bad,"When I first started working at Wendy's when I was 16, it was a great place to work. I was very fortunate. But then my GM moved up to become district manager and new managers came in and took over. They weren't as great. I worked there for nearly a year and they wouldn't have their employers where they are supposed to go. They called me in one day to fill in and had me working the drive thru window. It's normally supposed to be a 2-3 person job depending on if someone is at the back window taking money. I had to take money, make drinks & get the order ready while taking orders over the speaker and the manager on duty was sitting in the office not helping and kept yelling at everyone over the headphones and I got fed up with him and quit, which was wrong. But he told the general manager that I didn't quit and so when I tried to apply at a different wendys a couple of years later, I was put on the no hire list because they said I had 5 no calls, no shows after I had quit."
bad,wendys is a food food resturant that i have grown to like over the 5yrs i been their
bad,"Not a good job plain and simple I had a lot of bad experiences here because of nepotism and un fair practices."
bad,Ok  job to work at if u got patients if not fast food not for you. Pay wasn't to good but hey if u need to pay ur bills a job is a job... Period... Wendy
bad,"The managers can be very hostile,  I just think they don't appreciate their employees as much as they should,  the managers doesn't set an example for offers, they are unfair and can be very disrespectful"
bad,"Good and bad experiences , I would not recommend it. Too many lazy minors and workers in general that does not want to work. They rather the money to come to them, customers have filed so many complaints on my co-workers."
bad,"Wendys was a spur of the moment decision for me, as i just wanted a little more extra money for the time being. I had worked with a friend at the time, so it was not terrible, but overall not an amazing place for someone to really be theirself."
bad,"I liked working at Wendy’s for my first job, but I want to make more money and I want to try something different. Overall Wendy’s was a good place to start"
bad,"A typical day is just standing there, taking the order, sending it out, and cleaning. I have gained more skill to the skills I have had before working there which is beneficial and I have obtained new skills."
bad,it wendys. you are working in fast food. you gotta be organized and ready for when the flood gates open because it is a wild ride. its a luck of the draw if your coworkers are cool or not the hardest part is honestly dealing with customers but the most enjoyable part is serving the nicer folks instead.
bad,"Working for Wendy's was a nice mix up from other fast food restaurants.There is a special emphasis on quality, food safety and cleanliness that in my opinion, is unmatched by any of its competitors. That being said, it is not typically as busy as some of its competitors, so less people will be working on average. The expectation is set high, almost unreasonably so for one person to accomplish for that designated position."
bad,The management from different from different from different from scratch to work with people the streets 2 to peel from experience as well as many times at work with all haste.Times at work space to work on for keeps.Receive to work at work with 33 from 2
bad,Management was very bad and treated there employees badly and made the work environment very stressful. The only reason I stayed was because the people working there was fun to be around and made work bareable
bad,"fast pace going job i caught on pretty quickly and loved working with customers and making sure they are satisfied with there order and food, i was transfered between wendys due to poor management and later decided to move on from wendy’s bc management at other locations were very disorganized as well"
bad,It would have been a nice place to work at but if you not from that town they treat like dog.Days was hard people  talking about you] they.I learn how to be a manger.The hard part about the job was not talking ti each other.I enjoy my work when I' serving guest
bad,just a low of work for low pay mangenment was good just every who was on the crew or team where children and immature and did not work stressfull very .
bad,"The typical day at work was always a hit or miss. Yes, lunch rush and dinner rush was busy but depending on the depended on how busy it was.The weekdays was busier during lunch but still had a fair amount for the dinner rush. Friday's where slow expect when Campbell County High School had a game. Saturday's where consistent and Sundays got busy after 12, around the time church normally let out. the General manager that I had was great. He was respectful, cared about you and generally wanted to know how you where and was very approachable if you had any issues. He was promoted and I quit before the new General Manager started working there. The atmosphere when I worked there was always lively and fun to work in. Now, the reason I keep saying when I used to work there is because many of the peopl that I have worked with has quit and they have a new General Manager which can affect how enjoyable a work place is."
bad,"It was one of my first job so I learned a lot and wanted a better opportunity but, it was a good starting job and I really was thankful I was able to work"
bad,"everyone gets along and helps others when necessary, relaxed atmosphere, flexible schedule when needed. Hardest part, was not being told when we are out of something when told the customer we had it"
bad,Wendys is definitely fun to work at but it also opened my eyes to some of the nasty things that goes on in it also. Theres not much else to say about it.
bad,I only did this job for experience. So I could get a better job in the future but since I got injured at work one of my managers is not taking it very kindly I am used in their jokes and called me broken and slow. So whenever she is slow she just say just call me ( my name ).
bad,"It is a very fast paced environment. It is very stressful most of the time. There is a lot to learn, but it can be picked up quickly. The managers are not easy to get along with"
bad,was a great job to have work with some great people at night all the hours u want the pay was great had some good co-work every one in there was like family talk joke play around but we always got our work done on time
bad,The managers I worked with were very rude if you weren't into the clique of people who were popular around the store. I even had a drink thrown at me in the store.
bad,"It's just okay.  It really depends on who the manager is on a given day.  The customers are usually ok, but you get the occasional strange person who is difficult to deal with."
bad,I've only been there for a month and I feel like fast food just isn't my thing so it's nothing against Wendy's it's just the way I am and the way I work I'm not the best at working fast when I learn something new and I am still learning.
bad,Honestly it's not horrible but it's really not great when you have busy days and are in High School or Uni. they ask you to work a lot and a lot of the time seem disappointed when you can't do a favor for them even if the reason you can't cover the shift is for a medical emergency. They don't seem to care at all
bad,It was a very stressful job. The hardest park of that job was the late night shifts. And people calling off. The management was absolutely horrible. The most enjoyable part was when we were slow.
bad,Wendy's gave people the opportunity not just the work but to provide a stepping stone for the next level. There is nothing really hard about the job everything would pretty much easy and everyone got along at the worksite
bad,"I was in my Senior year of high school trying to focus on graduating, and I was working until 11pm some nights during the week. And I worked every weekend until close which is at 2am, for 2 months straight not giving me time outside of work and school. I went to management multiple times to see if I could close every other weekend rather than every weekend or at least just one of the days work an earlier shift, and no matter how many times I asked and pleaded with them, it was to no avail. So I let the job go so that I could continue to focus on graduation. I did learn from the job responsibility and money and time management. The hardest part of my job was trying to work as a team in a place that didn't have a core for teamwork."
bad,"I only worked there for 3 months but everyday I worked it was very fast paced. The hardest part of the job was getting used to rush hour.  I learned to calm people down in order to get what is needed done, done."
bad,"If you enjoy working in a fast pace environment, this would be the place for you. Busy lunch rush hours which are the busiest time of the day for fast-food businesses. Stocking and re-stocking shelves and cleaning as efficiently as possible."
bad,"It was very repetitive and the co-workers could have attitude problems at times . The job was easy I didn't have a hard time working there, I just didn't like the environment and the way I was treated. Also sports season was approaching and that was my main focus at the time being."
bad,"Although my management was amazing and did the best they could, we were ALWAYS short staffed, and always doing more than our job entailed. For the low pay i was receiving it was not nearly worth all the work you had to do. I opened and prepped everything along with covering other areas of the food joint if someone called off. The drive through was an easy job but constantly would get rude people and rarely ever nice people so you have to have a tough skin ( so to speak) and be able to ignore and let go of alot. I would've stayed if the pay was better but it was far from enough for as demanding as the job was."
bad,"The hours were decent, but the pay was too low and staffing was a consistent issue. As a closer, it was my responsibility to clean the dining room and bathrooms at the end of the day. If we were busy, there was no way to complete the list of tasks in the given time limit of one hour post close. And I would frequently get in trouble for staying over time to complete the list of tasks"
bad,The environment is great. The People I work with are good people but some are pretty lazy and dont do their job so if anything I end up doing it for them. The job itself I’m not a fan of and it pays minimum wage.
bad,Good place to work for people looking for their first job. You get to learn multiple positions but the pay is not enough. The hours are flexible. Good place to get first experience for the job world.
bad,"The management at this establishment was not treating some of the employees fairly. Basically showing favoritism , but the dynamic between the employees were good. Everyone helped one another and was willing to help anyone who was making mistakes."
bad,"Workplace culture was uplifting. Management was usually in a good mood and understanding. Asides from that your either cooking, making sandwiches, or taking orders. Can become over whelming mentally sometimes, but nothing that could kill you."
bad,"I would only recommend Wendys  or any fast food as a temporary job or for teenagers . Not much room for advancement, poor benefits and can be very stressful environment."
bad,"I liked my fellow co workers for the most part, but the management was completely garbage! Whenever someone asked me about my experiences there I always go back to the terrible management!"
bad,working in this place was an ok experience. but i was not getting the proper hours as i needed. sometimes i would be on the scedual but will get told my hours were cut.
bad,this company is set up in a way that the business could not endure more than a certain volume level.i would suggest they redo the floor plan and excution setup thru out the entire brand.
bad,"when i first started working there it was just find, but over the years my payment was still the same and they would not give me a raise.i worked at wendy's for about a good 3 years and not once did i get a raise, but they had me working doubles and covering other crew members shifts."
bad,It was stressful I work there for about a year and a half and never got a pay rise or nothing I was committed to. A lot of people quit but I still stool around but I just had enough of it
bad,"It's a good company to start in the fast food industry but after getting, experience it's not a company to stay for a long time.  Compare to other top-rated fast food company Wendy's pay and other benefits are not good."
bad,I was a shift manager I loved it..It was okay when I was by myself but as I started to get older and explore the world I realized I needed more out of a job so I left which was really hard I hate change in life but this was a good start out job unless your a general manager which would have been wonderful
bad,"There is a lack of management under certain managers. There is little to no compensation for being asked to work longer shifts. There isn't enough organization to allow a shift to run smoothly. Schedules leave many shifts understaffed."
bad,"Wendy's was a great opportunity to develop my people's skill and as well to understand how a business works. This job thought me how to multitask for example: taking a drive thru order while collecting another order and making drinks at the same time, keeping in mind that we have to achieve a timer less then 115 seconds for our day part 1 timer. which is also during rush time. I also learned how to handle a rush while working in a team in order to satisfy the customers need. The best part of the job was the flexible hours and schedule especially for a college student. The hardest part was meeting the high expectations of the employer in order to keep our high score in Montreal. A typical day at work would depend on what position your asked to do and depending on that you would start by making sure enough product is available for the rush."
bad,"On a typical day I would show up to work ,Clean what ever need to be clean stock anything that needed to be stocked and count my register to make sure I had my exact count of money"
bad,"The hours and pay are good for General Managers if they are put at a store that is running well and has a full, good staff. However, if the store is understaffed or has problems, expect to be called in at all hours, 7 days a week, and practically live at the store. I have seen a lot of turnover of even long-time GMs at local Wendy's since this franchise took over operations. It seems that the corporation does not back up the GMs and tends to side with customers over employees, even if the customers are violent or obviously pulling scams. There is not much job security, and several GMs that had been at Wendy's for 5-20+ years have left in the last 6 months."
bad,Great place for a teen to have a part time job. You do not have to be a pro burger flipper just have a sense of how to do it and have good custer service skills
bad,i firmly believe for the amount of work that you do at Wendys  and the amount of pay wasn't fair. it was mainly business. nobody seems to care about the crew member
bad,"Work was somewhat easy, the management was absolutely horrible, they cussed at workers, constantly complained, harassed various workers. Co-Workers were for the most part very outgoing."
bad,"come in clean, take orders, and serve guest"
bad,In Wyoming this is still very much a good old boy system that allows all walks of life to work at their establishments including predators. They only advance women if they are old.
bad,Demanding work for low pay and benefits that are not beneficial. Half price employee meals and no guaranteed full time unless you are management or supervisor
bad,"The training was not the best at the store that I worked for but after a awhile you get the hang of things. I started on the sandwich station for DI and eventually made the cut to make DT (drive thru) orders. It gets a little hectic when you are doing DI (dine in) and DT at the same time but just hang in there because it is great when you develop multitasking skills. Management was decent but I felt like the schedules could have been given out in a more efficient way, other then that my co workers were great and very helpful  and the customers were always friendly and found a way to make my day a little brighter."
bad,Good place to start out for a first job but if advancing in the company is your wish than this is not the place to find it. Felt rushed every time an order went out and felt pressured with a manager down your neck the whole time.
bad,Didn't care to work here for too long. It was just a source of income while I was in high school. The managers were okay and the workplace was okay. Only good thing I have to say is that the kitchen was clean and they had high standards of the food they served to guests.
bad,Everything from our head to our socks had to be how they wanted. They don't train you and no matter how fast you work you will still be called slow. They want you to do 3-4 different jobs at once. They want you to have the customers change in hand before they pull up (impossible) and hold their food out the window before They pull up (rude)for the sake of the drive thru timer. I only worked there 2 months. By far the most ridiculous job I've ever had.
bad,"The general manager never listens to anyone but the voice in her head and she does what she wants with you, and treats you like your already supposed to have learned everything. It's is ridiculous because it's literally takes months to resolve a problem. Other than that the people are awesome and loving they accept yucky for you no matter what, it's a big family."
bad,The people that I worked with was very welcoming.  Although the managers were not as welcoming. Most of the time I cleaned up after the customers and my Co workers.
bad,"IF you are looking for a first job, this is the company to go for. The pay isn't the highest. But they will teach you many traits that are important."
bad,Wendy's was my first job over the summer that I enjoyed working with a group people. My boss on the other hand constantly admonished me if she didn't i would still be working there.
bad,same thing everyday management pretty cool I get along with pretty much everyone not a problem the hardest part when were short handed an I have to do a two mans job the enjoyable part is receiving compliments from guests
bad,"My favorite part of this job was the fast pace environment and how my coworkers and I worked as a team to ensure great customer service. I enjoyed advertising and making customers happy. I did not enjoy the dirty greasy work environment. My coworkers were mostly around my age and went to school with me,so working with them made the job more fun. We worked together, and everyone got along."
bad,"I've Been working at wendys for almost 3 Years,and at a point of time i loved it, but since they have made a change in management of our store i feel like it's become very unwelcoming. almost every coworker of mine complain about the mangement including myself. i just feel many things within the magement can be change other than that it's a very cool enviorment the lunch and dinner rush can make you lose your mind but staying busy is the best part cause you can never get bored or become tired on the job."
bad,"at wendys I did truck orders, i trained employees and i helped out . everyone was great ! I learned how to be to respectful to a customer even when thy are wrong."
bad,"A typical day consisted of taking constant customer orders and sometimes correcting the order. I learned how to communicate with customers who were sometimes very upset to calm them down and de-escalate the situation. Management was good and always supportive. I had plenty of friends at my job that i still talk to now, we all helped each other out and made a team effort to reach our goals. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance my social life, work, sports, and school at the same time. The best part of my job was meeting new people on a day to day basis and interacting with people."
bad,"As an Assistant Manager I was responsible for running shifts, Cash handling, truck orders, and scheduling. I learned how run a good shift with a full staff or short handed. Management was ok, but the there were down falls. My co-workers didn't like to work together. However, the hard part of this job was to get everyone on the same page. This job had great benefits and the owner really cared about their people."
bad,"Wendy's is like your typical fast food restaurant. There is rushes and dead times. You stock, clean and do whatever jobs are needed to make the place run nicely. The crew members though, are horrible. I haven't worked there in over a year, but when I did, there was a handful of people that pushed me to quit. Their attitudes towards others and the job were annoying and hurtful. "
bad,"En este trabajo aprendi mucho sobre la atencion hacia el cliente, estar dia a dia con ellos, solucianando los problemas, sacando sus dudas y atendiendolos siempre con la mejor atencion, amabilidad y simpatia tanto como en nuevos clientes como los que ya se hicieron conocidos al concurrir siempre al local. A hacer ventas acercandome a cada uno de ellos promocionando algun nuevo producto u otro. Tambien hablar con ellos, verificar que este todo bien, tanto el pedido, como su experiencia en el lugar. Dias que me tocaba ser cajera, atenderlos y entregar lo que me pedian en horabuena y calidad, recibir el dinero y darles el vuelto. En todo mi tiempo laboral tuve muy buena relacion con todo el equipo gerencial y con mis compañeros, nunca tuvimos quejas y siempre nos llevamos muy bien. Lo que mas me gusto del trabajo es llevarme esta experiencia y a ver aprendido todo lo que aprendi."
bad,Very fast paced environment that at it's hardest you have to work 3 times harder because someone called out. Most enjoyable times is when there is enough people on the clock and everyone is working together.
bad,The first thing I do when I go into work and make sure my grill is usable. I've learned to improve my communications skills. I think that the work is a little harder with management. Great kind and nice co-workers. The hardest part of the job is closing the store. The most enjoyable thing about the job is that I'm getting a paycheck to provide for my family and I and that the workplace is wonderful.
bad,"As soon as you are clocked in you being working. You are responsible to make sure you have enough product in your stations, and to make sure they're organized and clean. You don't stop moving and orders need to be out the window under 100 seconds."
bad,i learned alot that i didnt know before i started work at wendys and the other employees was very helpful in helping me catch on to the tasks quickly. the hardest part about the job was learning to do the sandwiches but i caught on very soon. i enjoyed working with a great crowd of people when i worked there.
bad,wasnt crazy about fast food but wendy/s was run well and i really learned how to mange my time and resources and always balance your p&i stuff
bad,"Some coworkers were very unwelcoming, management would always give ringing compliments but only recieved 3-12 hours per week without any indication of why. Left due to scheduling conflicts."
bad,"Good place to get use of working long shifts, shift coverage and good amount of money in your pocket if your staying consistent hourly wise."
bad,"its a job for young adults"
bad,Management is unorganized at times. You always have to review over your schedule because it's usually not going to be right the first nor the second time. You hardly ever get recognized for being a good employee but will be quickly chastised for doing something not up standard.
bad,I was a crew and this was my duties grill maintenance and dishwasher.
bad,yeilding to customers choice and be busy all the time sometimes cant take a break  but u get customer service and working in all areas like cleaning sandwich station etc.
bad,"Health insurance and salary are great for management. As crew, impossible to earn a living wage. Managers are required to sacrifice personal/family time at the cost of job performance."
bad,"Management was quite okay. Co-workers got along good, we all worked good under pressure and busy hours."
bad,Wendy's is a fun place to work my only problem with them is the lack of hours per week.
bad,"Wendy's needs to stop being cheap and hire maintenance workers to clean the store when the store and drive thru closes not crew members cleaning like servants. Scrubbing floors and bathrooms toilets and garbage cans. How do you go from making fries and sandwiches and also have to clean toilets, scrubbing floors, etc.at the end of the night. I understand we clean the stations we work at whether its the grill, fries, or sandwich station that's right but the other things I mentioned earlier is too much extra work and not enough pay."
bad,"In this type of job no matter how hard you work you do not get any type of benefits or great."
bad,"The only thing I can say truly about this job, is that I made a little bit of money.  And, that is it.  I did not enjoy working in a fast food place.  I am an outside worker.  So, I would never do this again."
bad,"Very busy."
bad,I would enjoy working at Wendy's again.  The food was good the environment wasn't too bad.  
bad,"Ridiculously unorganized, always changing the schedules for everybody without asking if they were available to work that night/day."
bad,Hard Work
bad,I had high hopes here but there was a definite lack of upper management. Otherwise pay and advancement were very much an plus.
bad,"love my co workers and the team, learned a lot in management, the hard thing was able to go further in the Company, felt like it was waste of time ten years,still stuck as shift manager and not going any where further with them, and the pay was not that great,"
bad,I did this job as a strict high school job. my true calling was big machines and hard sweat but none the less not a bad kid job
bad,crew member workin with customer making sure orders were right.
bad,Unfortunately my Wendy’s story didn’t end so well. The only positive of working there was the DM and his will to go above and beyond to help his managers. They hire just about anyone and don’t bring people in and hold them to good values. Lots of going between the cracks. Problem with harassment and bugs. I recommend applying elsewhere
bad,It can be fun here but some people take it too serious and drain all the fun.
bad,"Very unprofessional, everybody is late all the time. Nobody puts forth the effort until it’s too late. Hard to carry the entire store when nobody cares! No one follows dress code or any of the rules to be quite frank."
bad,I love working at Wendys my crew don’t mine helping you on whatever you need help on and they manages are also great I just love them. I would Recommend anyone to Wendys
bad,It can be slow from time to time but for the most part you have to remain focused and stay ahead. Being slow or getting distracted can result in incorrectly filled orders and unsatisfied customers.
bad,they were somewhat unprofessional and also some of the workers it a good job for someone that don’t care about getting raises. They have people working there right off the street because they are very somewhat unprofessional
bad,"Good place to work if you are just starting out don’t recommend long term. Oddly stressful at times for no reason, you have to work as a team or things will not get done properly or efficiently."
bad,"Was an okay company to work for if you didn’t mind working lots of hours for little pay.  No overtime, and constant management changes.  Overall not a good company to work for"
bad,"We get no breaks only mangers do they also get free food even if there not working crew members get 1 meal wtf!!!but if they catch us eating we have to pay for it.Whenever it's slow they get to sit in the darn office and sit on their butts while crew are working and we have to ask to use restroom"
bad,"Wendys is a good place to work but very stressful. Everybody thinks there a boss, and they dont know waht be goin on hlaf the time. I wouldn’t recommend workin here"
bad,I love wendys. I would have stayed if it was better advancement in the job. I got a promotion but it was taken away from me due to lack of communication.
bad,"I quite frankly did not"
bad,customers are generally happy and most are reoccurring the wait is usually long depending on staff that day  cant get in and out during lunch break because of the wait
bad,This was my first job so it was an okay experience  I would not want to go back to fast food. But as a first time it was okay. I learned a lot by working in the field
bad,"It started off great, went downhill with messy management and low staff. I was expected to do too much by myself and I was constantly stressed. Customers are rude and it’s not worth it honestly, also if you can’t stand up for yourself you’ll find yourself being put to close various days and you’ll be ordered to do the work others are too lazy to do. Every time I asked for a raise I’d get ignored although i was one of the most hardworking employees there."
bad,not the best place to work at the pay is very low and they make you do a lot of work employees r rude and don't give enough hours would recommend working at other fast food restaurants
bad,"I feel as if some managers have not been well chosen for some distracts. I also feel as if shifts and requested days off aren’t taken serious in most cases, when need be."
bad,"Compared to other corporations the pay at Wendy’s was terrible.I was making around 9.25 hourly, working from 3pm-12am. The customers were always rude, and I felt a few managers were as well. I loved the environment the workers were friendly and a big help for newcomers!"
bad,"They start you well with training but then proceed you to do multiple jobs, and unnessecary work. The pay was minimum for a starting job. The coworkers would have profanity."
bad,It was nice to work at Wendy's but some of the managers didn't treat you like a employee. It was nice to deal with the customers they treated you fairly.
bad,It's not the best workplace cause everything was not going right due to the management and customers were always upset and angry about there orders there were some we could please.
bad,My hands always smelled like disgusting burgers and the amount of acne I had just got worse from all the grease. But the group of people there were always nice and overall very friendly and funny.
bad,the place is not very well organized. they are constantly running out of everything. I was always asked to stay longer then I was scheduled cause we were short staffed. some of the employees were great while others were just a pain.
bad,Wendy's was a great job to work at but sometimes you have to move on to something better . I'm looking for a job that everyone works together as a team and not messy
bad,"Wendy's is a hard working job at some days. The job was fun to the coworkers for fun to be around. The mangers some we're good some we're bad. Some of the mangers only care about themselves so if they don't like to do something than I won't get a break because they don't want to watch that position. The hard work is when a lot of people come in. We we're short of people one day and I had to do it all by myself. Wasn't to hard  I'm really good at my job,  and easily motivated. I got all those people out. The job is fun not saying it's bad. That's my review on Wendy's really appreciate you guys for hearing about it."
bad,"It's fast paced and instead of making things easier or having good processes, managers encourage you to cut corners. Also customers are terrible and have no manners."
bad,"The typical shift was showing up, signing in, and then being stressed out of your mind. Management was really poor, crew members wouldn't follow directions, and the pay was not worth the stress, hassle, and customer abuse."
bad,The job itself was not bad and we always kept a steady work pace. Our general manager was very dishonest and unhelpful. That persons actions do not reflect the company's reputation. Only their own.
bad,At Wendy's it was a fast pace job. The stressful days at Wendy's will not get to me. I enjoy satisfying customers on what they needed.I learned at this job is working as a team in very helpful.
bad,"Wendys was an ok job the management was very poor, there was not much communication as to who was to do what. I was also trained very poorly and if I did mess something up they would just have somebody else do it instead of teaching me how to."
bad,Good it was fast pace nice management it was good good people so many smiling faces customers always nice never had problems it was alright always doing something
bad,"There were no training exercises unless you were management, then it was like a chicken running around with its head cut off. I was in management training at a store I wasn't going to be working at, and the training manager at that store has no interpersonal skills. He needs to learn how to handle people and speak to the with respect."
bad,Wendy's is a fast pace job I use to be a team member on the fries and grill and making sure the floor clean and making sure everybody got Wat they need
bad,I had one manager that absolutely hated me. I didn't do anything for her to hate me either. It was very stressful which was why I left. I heard another manager walked out on the job a couple months later after I left.
bad,"Assist customers and prepare food. Worked order counters, registers, and drive-thru windows."
bad,"not the best place to work, sometimes it's fast-paced, other times not so much. I personally did not care for this job, it wasn't for me. I wasn't working so much and the minute they got slow, they sent me home.sometimes that would be two hours in, so it was really pointless"
bad,"besides the clients treating you bad, there was always gossiping between the employees. they told you to do things that you could not possibly do for a bad paycheck."
bad,"work around schedule, able to pick up full time, pay is not great for those who's main and only job would be this, it's only good for students. Management was OK.. some didn't work barely and talked and gossiped a lot about other employees, while other managers helped other staff and worked hard. Customers are the downfall of the job as well.. you get a lot of complaints for tiny mistakes. The location I was working at (now permanently closed ) was a target for drug users.. I always found needles left behind in the men's washroom, when cleaning it up management didn't provide proper cleaning tools and didn't dispose of it properly. SAFETY HAZARD. "
bad,The environment is for people who can flex well with multitasking. There are slow moments yet it's very fast faced and allot of team work. There is a system to the work team to have everything flow easy to keep the customers happy and satisfed
bad,"I'd had this job a month and two managers specifically seemed to expect me to perform as if I'd worked in fast food for years. Never mind that they seemed demeaning to their employees, one outright takes his frustration out on employees. Two of the managers are really good and do the best they can with what they have, but between poor scheduling, constantly running low on supplies and the poor temperament of the other two, it feels like it's a pull between two teams."
bad,The hardest part of working at Wendy's is dealing with other employees not wanting to work. Half the time you have to stay longer than expected because people will not show up to work when they are scheduled.
bad,I worked there about three months and I quit do to lack of pay and the coworkers were very rude. If you did something the right way and someone didn’t like it then you were known as the bad guy.
bad,this was my first job and it was good at the first then when the manager had changed it was bad then its kinda ok so very all the sore is doing ok at the moment
bad,not one of the best places to work but it paid the bills and they want you to work harder for less money and they also had very horrible management and customer service
bad,"I would only recommend working here as a first job for friends or relatives, in getting their feet wet in real-world customer service of working on the job."
bad,For The Young and young of Heart. It Can Be A Great Place To Work With The Right People. Small Work Area Cleanliness Is first. An Awesome Environment With The Right Spirited People.
bad,This job was one of the most hands-on jobs I've ever worked. It wasn't very clean during my time working there. There were times when managers would cut corners tp get their way
bad,I worked for this company many years.  Overall company changed when new franchise bought old one out. It use to be a fun and family oriented business.
bad,I am thankful for the experience that I have gained and the management skills I have gained. I learned how to open and close the store for business. How to effectively manage crew members and run a shift.
bad,Wendy’s was not a good place to work. I wouldn’t recommend working there. It was stressful the whole time and the management wasn’t the best. Maybe as a first job it’d be okay but not longer.
bad,"While of course it's expected of a fast food restaurant to have a fast pace, Wendy's expected a bit much from its closing time cashiers. You will develop good multi-tasking and you will develop customer service skills from working there, that much is true, but the pay you receive is simply not worth it for the workload. If you were supposed to close at 12 AM, you should expect to leave by 1:30 AM the earliest, because as cashier you are expected to clean your workstation, the lobby, and the bathroom without any aid whatsoever. If you left at exactly 12 AM, you might get a warning the next day for not leaving the place clean for the next cashier. "
bad,I loved my job with Wendy's. I enjoyed the crew members but my favorite part of the job was the customers. Making them happy was what I looked forward to every day.
bad,"This job made me hate fast food and I wonder how did I last so long sometimes. It feels terrible to go into work and immediately being rushed and everyone having an attitude on top of that does not help , very bad expierience for me."
bad,The pay is very unfair by all means . The mangers are great. Employees was the main problem. I been at my current location for a year now and I ready to move forward in life .
bad,"Fast food you have a lot of call offs, employees not refusing to give 2 weeks notice, short staff. Free food was cut from all employees you then had to pay 50%. Fast Food is up to the person, some people can handle the job, even work better under that pressure. Went back to school and got a job in the Medical Field. Great Food besides the work environment."
bad,A typical day consisted of call ins from workers and being short staffed. Management was not the greatest. Shifts were inconsistent due to call ins and people were not allowed to pick up extra shifts if it meant they would work overtime. There were no benefits and few raises and very little chances for advancement. My favorite part of the day was after close because I was able to get everything done that I was not able to get to during the day. The hardest part of the job was running drive thru during rush hour.
bad,I did not like working for there company because they had very poor management and people were just all over the place it wasn’t a specific job rite and also wasn’t a job I was looking to stay long term
bad,working at Wendy's was one of my first jobs. it taught me a lot about teamwork and hard work. I learned so very valuable things while working there. was definitely a stepping stone.
bad,It's alright alll together bad didnt injoy working their  this place suckes i hate it everyone was mean an nasty no one was happy their managment was bad no one cred always got into
bad,"A typical day included high levels of stress. Although the tasks at hand were easy, dealing with the people around stood to be the most difficult task of them all."
bad,"While wendy's may be your go to for fast food, it shouldn't be for work. this job is very difficult and doesn't pay nearly enough to make it worth working there."
bad,"Great staff, hard workers but unsanitary work environment. Very fast paced, hardly any downtime. I would recommend this job for someone in school that just need enough money to get by."
bad,the customers sometimes are  extremely rude and do not care about how fast passed you have to work. however they are flexible with your hours and days.
bad,I think this job is excellent for the high schoolers looking to get a few extra bucks for themselves. There really isn't any other demographic that should work there.
bad,"Job wasn't for me, it requires fast paced work as well as lots of communication and team work. good for people who can accomplish these things, but it can be very stressful. Management is really nice however."
bad,Customers are my first priority getting their orders out on time making sure restrooms are well cleaned thanking customers for coming...make sure food is fresh and hot.make sure parking area surrounding are cleaned trash us picked up
bad,I knwo im wroth more than 7.25 and im a good a reallt good worker i promise. They asl me to dl everything bc i know how to do a lot. Just like a manager i learned by watching and studying them as they showed me how to do it
bad,this is a store that wont notice when you pulling all the weight for more than a year and still wont give you a pay raise but they will give it to people that cant do there job and have just been there awhile
bad,Wendys  was a great place to work as a starting out job. But not for people who buckle under pressure or stress. Its a very fast pace and loud environment. You definitely have to learn quick and know what your doing. Always be respectful to your managers and costumers.
bad,stressful and the other employess would steal from your register and steal your personal belongings would not working there at all the staff besides some managers were very rude with customers and just not a good place to work
bad,"It's fast food, nothing to say. All stereotypes that can be assume are represented, but it is far from the worst job environment imaginable. Cheap food, cheap work."
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's includes taking orders from my costumers, and collecting the money. Also, giving the best costumer service so each one will come back again."
bad,"Get educated so you can get the heck out of this job. The managers could not even afford to fix their cars to get to work so I had to drive them, I an not kidding, wish I was. This job kicked me in the butt in order for me to get an education. Company is a 161.1 million dollar company but its not willing to be decent and treat people as human beings ~SAD"
bad,"Wendys is good for a teenager in high school, but not for an adult on their own. Low pay, plenty of hours, but still doesnt pay enough. Its been a few years, but when I worked their it was poorly managed."
bad,"Wendy's is not the best place to work. If you are looking for something to get by temporarily, or maybe for a first job to gain experience, then try it out.  If you are looking to work there for any significant amount of time, look elsewhere.  The management is not trained well, and the pay is low."
bad,Basically my manager was mean and horrible to all employees. She put people down and was not a nice person to work for. I would not recommend working here if you are in high school. I had to work until 11 most nights and had AP and Honor classes that i had homework for and a 30 minute break does not allow for school work. They did not try to work with me and frankly most of my managers were horrible. They blamed employees for problems they could not control.
bad,While at Wendy’s I learned how to maintain and produce enough product for the customer while also practicing my customer service skills by working front counter .
bad,"They are horrible at training and will not help rookies as they are suppose to, supervisor talk to crew members however they want to, and when observing they do things thats not suppose to be done."
bad,It was an extremely fast-paced and stressful job especially during the lunch rush. The manager at my location was verbally abusive and could not handle the stress of a rush. She did always get the job done though.
bad,It is basically like any other restaurants I have worked... Some days are busy some days are not. There where all kinds of different people there you work with.
bad,"Poor management. Stressful, more work placed on one person than is possible to accomplish. Only enjoyable part was leaving. But this is only one of many stores. I hope it's not like this everywhere."
bad,"Fast food is not the way to go if you are looking for a job, believe me all you will do is suffer, depending of course on who your boss is.  If that is what you want then go for it."
bad,"the typical day was different each day. some of the management were great and got a long with everyone, others were not that good. some of the workers are not always the best to work with."
bad,"This position was ""cookie cutter"" The stress I dealt with on a daily basis did not reflect my experienced background in the restaurant field. This would be a better position for a less qualified individual or a temporary position for a college student."
bad,I would not recommend this job to friend because  of how the managers were acting and how some of the employees were acting towards me. I felt disrespected by some of them so I don't want to go back or plan to go back to this location.
bad,I used to love working for Wendy's because I love helping customers. It was a really fast pasted job and could be fun at times. I just don't feel like it will be a good fit for anyone who likes to get paid. You dont get paid your over time.
bad,"Wendy's taught me a lot. They put me through a lot of management training that still helps me today, 7 years later. I learned the basics of food safety as well."
bad,They made all the students with no cars work the late shifts where you finish at 2am so there are no buses home meanwhile all the people with cars got all the day shifts the management had no consideration for anyone
bad,"busy fast paced job "
bad,Do not try to make a living off of the pay. This job is mainly for teenagers. Managers are disrespectful. Team members are disrespectful. Customers are disrespectful.
bad,Wendy's wasn't the experience I was looking for. It did give consistent hours but it lacked in the manager to worker connection. Sometimes doing more work and putting in more effort to get a job done here felt unappreciated and at sometsometimes was sent home early because I would have finished all the work that was required of me so I would end up getting less hours for more work.
bad,After a long hard day I feel a sense of achievement and happiness. I enjoyed shift leading and loved my coworkers. dealing with customers is very easy
bad,The manager abused his authority making me quit but before it was an ok job everyone worked together and the people was very friendly which was a plus
bad,"This is a great building block for getting your feet through the door of the working world. Very fast paced environment, demanding on the body, and lots of overtime to get the job done."
bad,they are not fair ... they cut your hours tremendously to where u cant take of anything when u do get your check its basically like your working for nothing
bad,It's fast food what more needs to be said about working at a place like this. I worked there right after high school until I started college. It was a
bad,Working there was not fun but the people there are so nice and they help you out. Anyways no raises and the pay sucks. Sometimes this job was stressful and a pain.
bad,careless about having an outside life. Store manager sat In office all day on phone constantly belittling her employees. company was good with raises and advancement. District managers cares more than store manager
bad,Poor Customer service. The pay was not fair. They did not treat their employees with any respect. Not a safe or clean environment for their staff or customers
bad,"Working at Wendy's in the airport is really cool. You meet thousands of people from ALL over. I seen my 8th grade science teacher at the airport, a few of celebs."
bad,No es muy buena porque se trabaja de lunes a lunes
bad,working at wendy's can sometimes be stressful but what job isn't? wendy's has helped me get better at being patient and handling any time of situation.
bad,"Lot of work, very fast paced and productive, alit of jobs to do staying busy, train you in many different areas, get many hours, and discount on some things"
bad,I didnt work at wendys for long but the month or so i was there was uncomfortable and i didnt feel like a crew member at all. Alot of drama when youre the new person .
bad,A ok job for a start in the work environment. The opportunities are ok but the pay can be better. I was expecting more when I was hired but it is a job that do train you for other opportunities in the work environment.
bad,"Quite possibly, the worst place to work at, during my time there, I learned what not to do if I were ever in the shoes of a manager at this establishment."
bad,"I disliked this workplace so much. I literally did everything for myself, never had any help and the people that work there are not helpful at all. I do not recommend this job for anyone."
bad,This Company that will not pay you. No employees and no good management. I wouldn't recommend this job to no one until they get better organized and willing to pay more to keep their employees.
bad,"They really don't care about their employees nor not much about customers either. Its a very fast pace work place but most of the employees there do not act in a ""fast way"""
bad,It was one of the first jobs I had it taught me a lot how to work fast lift more and how to treat people. I learned how to cook and organize also to multi task something that will be very useful in other career opportunities.
bad,"great managers. great area. I would recommend for friend to work there. the benefits are worth it as well, but most are food related. also, the managers are very welcoming."
bad,They hired me without experience which was nice to get my foot in the door. However some of the management was rude and I constantly had to pick up others' slack. The customers were almost always rude and they promised raises but they were never received.
bad,this was a tough job to want to work at. i was a talented worker in the kitchen but often times crew would mess up and require me to make more food and fix mess ups. this job was hard to work because the customers also treated me poorly while working here on several occasions and that was hard at times.
bad,"Working at Wendy's got me started on my customer service experience. I learned how to efficiently prepare and serve food, manage my time, and how to effectively clean a dining room after a full day of service."
bad,"The management was poor. Work space too small and cramped could barely move past co-workers without trouble. With the space being small it made it unbareably hot, constantly drinking small frosty cups of juice or water which wasn't thirst quenching at all."
bad,They where really really rude here I didnt stay the to long overall it was cool I just stayed to myself and did my work and go home I really dont have much to say
bad,It was a good place worked 3rd shift. Every weekend  was a cashier and a cook the business was just slow. The managers was rude they would change your schedule anytime they felt like it after they had already given it to you. Had to pretty much learn on your own.
bad,Worst job ever. The manager was a complete and ignorant rude person. Yelled at you for everything and anything. I couldn't wait to get outta that place when my shift was over.
bad,This would have to be the hardest position that I have ever held. There were many inconsistencies within the company. There was a feeling that every store was only working for themselves.
bad,"Another fast paced restaurant tht you have to be careful because if you don't know how to cook, you won't be there long.They like a motivated people who can follow the rules."
bad,Pretty Easy Job But Requires Fast Acting Hard Working People. Not Recommend To Persons Not Able To Handle Pressure. Customers May Get Rowdy Or Disrespectful But You'll Need To Be Able To Control The Situation As Best Possible. Must Be Hospitable And Patient With Co-Workers And Customers And Remember Service With A Smile.
bad,"it was better then most fast food place,but could use some improvements with the scheduling weekly and could use better managment too, but it was basic,"
bad,My boss did illegal things. He over worked his employees. Besides that it was a really good experience I had a lot of fun. I learned a lot of new things.
bad,"I was in charge of scheduling and training of employees. I would work with the staff on quality control and time goals.  I would work with other managers and team members to meet  monthly, weekly and daily goals."
bad,"don't care about employees, long hours, schedule conflicts, terrible people, no benefits, no paid time off, food sucks, no discount"
bad,"The people minus the managers are the worst group of human being ive ver encountered. The employees of pembroke wendys made it very unbearable to work with, They were rude and made sure that new people felt outcasted. Ive never worked in a more miserable place and im going to be telling everyone i know about the complete disregard for human compassion."
bad,fun people to work with. poor management. they could have a brick do the job that the employees were doing. Got along with everyone my brain was just starting to melt on the job.
bad,"Fast food isn't for me, so trying to be honest about it I cant really say, I hate being rushed to a dirty and unclean point and I can't stand fast food as a consumer so the environment was never really for me, however those there I worked with loved it and it was their cup of tea."
bad,"It's an okay job, nothing special, and very boring. you either just cook all day, wash dishes, and clean, or run a cash register/take orders. fairly easy and straight forward, but the staff is not always easy to get along with."
bad,"You have to work fast , be able to work with rude customers most of the time ... you would have to wash dishes and clean the dining area as well and restock products"
bad,"on time, learned how to use fry grill station. meeting new cultures everyday. knowing that you cant work two stations at once while already assigned at a station."
bad,"I worked on the grill. I cooked burgers, I cooked chicken, I made fries, and I grilled. I worked in the back with every body and i work multiple days of the week"
bad,"Getting customers orders. Making the frosty. I learned that it gets busy around 5:00 pm for dinner. I really didn't care to much for the manager, they only gave me one day of training. I didn't feel comfortable with being on register with one day. There really wasn't an enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"This was my first job so it went pretty much as expected. A lot of work for a little pay. Cleaning up was what it sounds like, not much glory to it."
bad,I was usually always on the front cash register. I learned to be more patient with customers and coworkers. The hardest part of the job was not being appreciated more when I worked really hard.
bad,"very fast paced and on your feet a lot trying not to burn the food, a lot of multitasking cooking various foods at the same time very busy environment, it wouldn't have been as bad if the coworkers weren't as mean"
bad,I know its fast food...but you do A LOT and they pay you dirt cheap. It ends up becoming not a job but a lesson on how to be humble. I feel this should be more of a job for kids still in high school and college kids just looking for a part time gig.
bad,Fast food. High energy. Good for open ability and Someone who works well in a stressful environment. Working with difficult costumers and co-workers alike.
bad,"this was my first job, it was a fun and fast paste learning experience for me and I enjoyed it a lot. I made food to customers orders and I took customers orders as well. everyday we had a new or a different task to complete."
bad,Wendy's was an alright place to work at but they could possibly fix things. Really wish that they could of paid more. Had good employees.
bad,"-Hot and lots of customers ."
bad,"I didn't really get the hang of you having to sell the product, wait until it got to the customers than you get paid. Makes no sense"
bad,"The general manager is good at her job, unfortunately her attitude towards employees lacks. (She threw a pen at a coworker of mine) Other than poor management it wasn't that bad of a place."
bad,"I count monies in 3 drawers for the day, I do the bank/mail runs, I cut lettuce, make salads, do inventory counting, do truck orders, make crew schedule, run shift, assist employees with customers, assist and train new employees, handle customer complaints and resolve any issues."
bad,"Within the 4 months i was there I learned serveral things such as,"
bad,"Take orders from customers, and cook food for the customers. Clean cooking equipment, as well as restaurant. Maintained inventory to satisfy the demand of customers."
bad,pretty good place to work I enjoyed the company and the people working with me also I learned a lot about how to treat customers
bad,I did not like working here the manager was always yelling and getting at everyone for doing things wrong when most things were done right.
bad,"I worked here for a few hundred years but somethin went awry. i felt something run down my leg.  It sunk into my boot *squish*. Its wendys pervert, it was a milkshake."
bad,Typical fast food restaurant. Fast paced with very little down time. Everyone had a designated work position that required different tasks.
bad,overall from working at wendy's i have learned how to work with all types of different people . i have also learned how to have better time management .
bad,"One opinion of a typical day at work would be clocking in for work, making sure you clock out for break and back in for break as well. Helping customers. What I learned about Wendy's Company is that you always have to have speed and work with a smile. My opinion about my co-workers would be they are very helpful when needed. We all work together to get the job done. Management my opinion about them is that they hardly do anything and use us as their slave when they don't want to do something around the work involvement. The hardest part of the job is doing what your manager tell you to do when they don't want to do it themselves. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home at the end of the shift."
bad,"This Wendy's location was not that busy, but that gives the employees time to work on our cleanliness procedures. It's very enjoyable to do things the correct way."
bad,"My typical day at work was to first find out who was not coming in, so I knew who I had to cover."
bad,"It was my first job, I started when I was 16 years old. I was working there for almost 3 years. While working there I learned how to operate fast food. the hardest part was pulling through for rush hours. My most enjoyable part was being and working with my co-workers."
bad,"The people who worked there were very nice, I made fries and sandwiches and everyone was very helpful to each other. It is a really fast paced environment and you have to learn things very quickly."
bad,"I worked for Wendys for 12 years. I started as a crew member and worked my way up to general manager. When the days were staffed and the days were busy, I loved going to work. But when the economy turned south and we were losing crew members like flies, working for Wendys was no longer fun, it was just bad, really bad. Even though I was the general manager and took responsibility for the store I was running, my hands were tied when it came to having incentives to keep good help. Wendys would only hire minimum wage, I couldn't hire above that, at best maybe 10 cents, no benefits, district management and owners only cared about numbers, they didn't care about the conditions of the stores, or what mattered most, keeping Dave's legacy alive. After months and years of being beating by our competition, Wendys bumped up starting pay 40 cents above minimum wage and after 1 month of no new hires after this change, they believed that the pay was not the problem. Wendys was always ahead of the game when I started as a crew member 12 years ago, now they're sinking quicker than an anchor. Unfortunately, I could go on and on about how things are at Wendys. Right now, you could be hired on at almost any Wendys and promoted to management within a month or so and you don't have to excel, just ask and you'll pretty much get it. 1 individual was a crew member, promoted to crew trainer, quit, rehired as a crew member, promoted to manager, quit, rehired as a crew member, and promoted to manager again. Again, just ask for a promotion and you'll get it. But to be fair about all of my experience at"
bad,The job was very unprofessional. I didn't like how the business was ran. No opportunity to make extra money for struggling families. Every race was treated different and with favoritism.
bad,A typical day was training new crew members. Making sure i did the tasks that were given to me and i followed procedure in every situation. Making sure that things got done in a quick but efficiant way.
bad,"It was layed back with good people, but, I was unsatisfied with the hours.  my manager was cool headed and easy to get along with. my coworkers were over all ok."
bad,It was a good first time job that taught me to multitask and take care of the customer. It is not a job that you make into a career however.
bad,"typical day at work would include. taking orders, money handling , communications , bilingual, i learnt how to work quickly, hardest part of the job was dealing with unsatisfied costumers but i enjoyed helping"
bad,"The only thing I like about my job is the customers. That is about it. They say I am very pleasant and friendly when I took their order. I always get compliments for my customer service skills. I feel very appreciated by my customers, which is why I will miss them the most when I do quit for another job. I feel so under appreciated my managers. I always feel ripped off because I mostly work closing shift, so I always stock/overstock the morning shift. I feel like I am over working myself because I'm the only closer to stock cups, toys, bags, dipping sauces, salad dressings, etc. No one else does that, but I know it is what we are suppose to do in the first place. Every shift before I leave, I even pack the ice bin to full capacity. I just want a little more appreciation for the good job I do every time I work. The shift before mine hardly stocks. In fact as soon as I walk through the door they are in a rush to get out. Them not stocking me puts me behind, and then I'm yelled at for getting overtime doing my job and the shifts before mine's job?"
bad,"Wasn't really what i would expect but it was okay, Accept management wasn't to say great or good just in the middle of okay. I believe they could have done better."
bad,A fast food company is never a slow workplace. We had to assist people by taking their orders and making their meals before a set time. It was very fast paced. The management was not very organized. I got along very well with the coworkers. The hardest part was closing the store at night and having to prep for the morning workers. The most enjoyable job was being able to eat for free on the clock.
bad,I did every job I was assigned.Such as grilling hamburgers taking orders and cleaning work area.Dealing with complaints.Making sandwiches.I enjoyed working for Wendy's.
bad,"Predjudice hiring however they care a lot about customer service, have impecable health standards, and great tasting ice cream!"
bad,Wendy's hours went by fast due to the high paced work. My coworkers were very easy to get along with and as well as some of my managers. I enjoyed serving smiles to our customers and getting compliments on my work.
bad,The particular location that i was at wasnt professional at all. I did not like working there.But i can not speak on behalf of every Wendys.
bad,did not enjoy working here at all it was terrible only pro was job experience with customers and food manager was completely unprofessional and ruined the fun environment despite us being number 1 in the region fun and talking was never allowed
bad,"Long hours with low pay, they take advantage of hard workers, use them how they can, and when they are looking to get promoted they just stall and very little rewards for the hard work put in."
bad,"This job is fast paced so a typical day at work is doing a lot of problem solving, dealing with customers complaints and just basically making sure that the shift runs smoothly. I enjoy most of the customers that I deal with, there are some that are difficult but that comes with the job. I have some amazing co-workers that help make the job fun."
bad,"A typical day at work was repetitive. I would come in each day and work the front cash registers, then i would work the drive through, and before my shift ended i would also do dishes."
bad,"Every fast paced environment a lot of teamwork required. I enjoy the attitude of the crew ideally who wants to work in the fast food industry there whole career but, these people make the best out of each day. Teaches a lot of humbleness and patience when dealing with people on a daily basis."
bad,Bad management all away around. Not the best place to work. I work my butt off from 8am-4pm Mon-Fri. I prepped the veggies and set up the line with the appropriate products. I practically do my job and the management job.
bad,Okay company to work for easy to get in. More of a job for students looking to earn extra money. Not somewhere to be as an career.
bad,it was a horrible experience. i went to work every day to get made fun of by management. i ran the cash register and was in charge of the customer complaints
bad,"Although fellow employees were easy to get along with and willing to help and teach you. The same cannot be said for the management as a whole. Accidents that lead to your injury are always blamed entirely on you. You are forced to work past your hours or through your break if you are busy."
bad,"The job was great but when it became to cost me more money to get to work. it was time for a change, Great Managers but neede job closer to home"
bad,Prepping store for the day. dealing with various attitudes from customers and crew members. I learned that if one crew member comes in with a negative attitude it will most likely affect the store productivity for the day and the crew members performance.
bad,Came in and worked non stop everyday and I loved that but a couple managers were very lazy and pay is very low and most of the customers and employers were rude.
bad,"I would like to say I liked it here ,but I can't say that , if one of the kids were asked to do the bathroom and they didn't want to do it I was usually the one to do it..."
bad,"I always felt like the work I put in went unappreciated. The management did not take me or my ideas seriously. Not only did I despise going to work, but the other managers did not take their job seriously."
bad,It was really fast paced and got really busy during lunch and dinner hours. As fast paced as it is you must still be patient to deal with other employees and customers.
bad,"Utilizing knowledge of positional skills, customer service and courtesy, health and safety regulations,"
bad,"Usually 4-6 days a week I would come in at 7:00 and I would open the store with a manger and 1 other co-worker and we always opened on time, which was 10:00 am. I loved working with my fast moving and motivated co-workers. We worked together to make sure our customers were always satisfied. The hardest part of the job was working with negative people on occasion but the most enjoyable part was getting food orders out fast and correct to our customers."
bad,wendys was my first job. Its a good place if you have no experience or cant find a job anywhere else.
bad,It was a hostile environment that I had to take myself out of.
bad,being in charge of the grill was a typical day for me. working there you learn how to work with other in a fast passed enviorment. the managment was not to bad. I think the co-workers were worse.
bad,"Once I started working at Wendy's it started out great. I have great co workers that always look out for others. I enjoy making each customer satisfied with their order. This company has taught me how to pace my self and keep pushing to get the job done. The hardest part about this company is , they really don't give the crew members hours."
bad,I enjoyed working here because the scenery and people around was always different. It allowed me to work on my customer service skills; especially in dealing with demanding patrons.
bad,"unloading truck, stocking freezer. loading grill and meat trays, baked potatoes and French fries. running dishwasher and back change. management was unfair and the franchise owners were snobs. the hardest part if the job were the rushes and keeping up with sandwich orders. the most enjoyable part was finding work at kingys pizza."
bad,"hated the job, but needed one to pay my bills. this one closed due to management being jerks,."
bad,"I did not like this job, but I stayed for as long as I could. Supervisors and co workers where very rude and disrespectful."
bad,"do everyone els job, what not to do as a manager, real poor, my co-workers where ok, the hardest part was doing management job, going home"
bad,I enjoyed working as a cashier. I didn't like how coworkers would tell me in a rude way how to do the job instead of explaining it.
bad,A typical day consisted of preparing food and distributing food to customers.
bad,"I was a front counter cashier. I took customer's orders, prepared their beverages, bag food, cook food, make burgers, wraps, and salads. Call the customer's order. Cleaning the lobby, and restrooms. Mopping the floors. Closing the lobby at night, counting down my register, making a drop, and restocking my area back up."
bad,working at Wendy's is fast paste. its a fast food restaurant. I have learned social skills and how to deal with impatient customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being rewarded for the good things you have improved in.
bad,"My typical day at work was to take customers orders, hand out customers orders and buss the dirty tables."
bad,It was an ok job but working there made me realize that fast food careers are not for me and is something I would not like to do anymore.
bad,very busy late night work cleaning making sure the customers are very please with there meal
bad,The manager at the time was terrible and rude. I don't think i would ever go back.
bad,"* Very busy"
bad,"Wanted better job oppurtunities, and a place i enjoy working at."
bad,"It's like any other fast food restaurant, it can get a little hectic and out of control."
bad,I liked the coworkers here didn't really like the management they were unorganized and treat you like a kid no hard part or easy part to the job if you work hard you just find everything easy
bad,"It has been a while since I worked there, but when I was there, you rarely got pay raises and the general manager played favorites with the teenage boys."
bad,It's really hard to get a raise at this job and even working there after six months...still no raise.
bad,This is a high end job that has to meet the demands of customers constantly as well as the employees. You have to learn to separate your work life from your personal life or you will be over consumed with the job and its demands.
bad,"Short handed all the time"
bad,"Typical shift spent on feet for more than 10 hours in some cases. Hours are highly flexible, but workload fluctuated dramatically depending on what time of day, what day of the week, and overall traffic. Be prepared for the high speed environment. Extensive multi-tasking a must."
bad,"I loved working at ShopRite, it was very easy. One thing however I didn't like was only working four hours a day, but this was because I was a minor and that was the law. All the people were very nice."
bad,Hardest part of my day day was dealing with the high school drama on a daily basis.
bad,I have nothing nice to say. not a good company to work for at all.
bad,They had very strict ways of doing things there was no slacking but i loved the fast beat. It would make my days go by faster. My manager was tough but had to be to some of them. The hardest part of the job was remembering my sandwiches in the first week.
bad,Learn to work multi-tasking and love greeting my customers
bad,the hardest part of the job was the work ...it would've been much easier if there were more worker's...I enjoyed the people at the job during my time working there I had no problems because I work well with the public...I really didn't get to know my co-worker's because it was only a few...working at fast food companies on a typical day was hard it was always something new day in and day out...
bad,Didn't work here long got a better job shortly after getting this one. Most duties were closing the dinning room and preparing food for customers.
bad,"Fast paced , great introduction into customer service, fast track to management if your willing to learn , hardest part of the job is closing lates nights and early openings"
bad,A very fast paced work environment.  The food is handled very well.  Guaranteed freshness. Spring Break was a difficult time of year. Co-workers were easy to work with.
bad,"A typical day at work included talking to the customers, taking their orders, and then preparing the food to their satisfaction. I learned how to operate a cash register, as well as preparing food and cleaning equipment. Management wasn't very good. They did not have consistent teaching methods so I was constantly being informed of the wrong way to go about doing something and then I was punished for it. It left me perpetually confused, and unsure as to whether I was doing anything right. As for the co-workers there was a mixture. Most were kind and friendly, though they lacked a diligence for work. There were others that were bitter, mean, and would like to boss people around. The hardest part of that job was to keep up with the fast pace of the fast food industry and also to shoulder the abuse I received from some of my co-workers and management. The most enjoyable part of that job was making people smile, and to hear people thank me for my patience and kindness."
bad,"greeting customers, handling money, friendly management, just not enough hours to support my family"
bad,"Barely had work hours, also schedule was not organized. Could have done better with that."
bad,I didn't like working there the people was very rude to you and accused you of stuff you never did.
bad,"No weekends having to work, really only positive. Compensation and benefits are sub par"
bad,"Working at Wendy's felt like a nightmare at times, I was usually getting called into work every other day because of some no call, no showing or calling out sick. I also typically never left my shifts on time. The management did what they could to make it better but it didn't help. The health insurance plan was terrible; I have a pre-existing health condition and they only helped with my medications for a few months because I had to pay out of pocket. And, for all the sacrifices I made there, I never got offered a promotion and I was only offered a $0.10 raise which is when I decided to leave and go else where. My co-workers are the only thing that helped me lasted through the year I worked there; I wouldn't have asked for a better group of people. The Wendy's I used to work at is now closed due to declining business in it's area."
bad,I work on the salad bar making it look good for customer to enjoy the food on the bar....
bad,"Indeed.com has helped me find a job listing. Wish i had better bosses that knew how to treat their employees. "
bad,Ok place to work its fast food. Benefits are good for managers. Turnover is high.
bad,"used to work in the one in north Bergen, I hated the manager, but however, learned a lot there as well"
bad,"cooking the burgers, restocking the fride, and greeting customers. i learned how to flip burgers for the first time.  The co-workers were great! The hardest part was during lunch time when we would get really busy."
bad,"Management seems to get mad at you for anything you do wrong. Managment never really told me I was a good worker. I am a very good and hard working person. You work hard, they never openly tell you good job for your hard work. You know they recognize it but they never let you know they value you. You know it, but they don't show it. Don't expect a raise. Asked for a simple 10 cent raise and was turned down for my hard work. The company seems to care a little bit too much about customers. You can get fired for following the rules. Seriously. For example, only one coupon is to be used on one order. If someone tries to use 2 coupons on the same order and you tell them no, you can get fired if they complain they you didn't let them use 2 coupons on the same order. If someone says you didn't give them back correct change, you have to give them back the missing amount. People will lie to get money this way. Probably worst thing is micromanagement. I will finish my review because I cannot describe how much they micromanage you."
bad,Most fast food jobs are okay. My job was pretty easy going and so were my co-workers. It was just very demanding.
bad,"On a typical day I operated the grill, cooked a lot of meat and potatoes. I learned that grill is the worst part of a fast food job. Management as good except for one intolerable shift manager. The co-workers were all nice and friendly. The hardest part was cooking a large amount of meat quickly. The most enjoyable part was my positive relationship with 80% of the management."
bad,The working environment at Wendys was very unstable. I was not satisfied with how the manager handle business.
bad,fast food & fun fast pace  very friendly envoirment preparing meals quickly taking orders as fast as 20 seconds and making sure you have a happy customer
bad,Wendy's is a nice place to work. The management could be a litlte better. depending on what manager is working determines how the day will play out . the hardest part of working there is the team work ethics aren't priority to crew members. the most enjoyable part of work would be when the service is time is low and all product is available.
bad,"handle cash and credit card transation, kept all areas of the restaurant clean, sweep, mop, cashier, prep food"
bad,"Tell us about:"
bad,"Long hours, not enough pay.  Managers typically don't care to work around your schedule. Customer service is a learning experience after dealing with rude people."
bad,"- excepted to work fast "
bad,"poor leadership by the management, one a new manager took over the store she eventually weaved out the old workers and eventually hired people of here ethnic background. it was sad, people had kids to support and she gave not one care"
bad,it was jus where I came to make money. co workers and managers were rude
bad,"A typical day consists of money management, prep for lunch, lunch service, prep for dinner and dinner service. I control the management team and delegate the tasks that need to be completed. The hardest part of the job was the company I worked for and the way they treated employees, the most enjoyable was being able to work along my own crew and managers towards goals."
bad,"A typical day at work was fast paced and always packed with people, which I liked. I was always busy. The management was okay, they were always stressed out and it sometimes rubbed off onto the other co-workers. I didn't let it bother me. I didn't have any hard jobs that I couldn't handle so everything was easy for me. I enjoyed helping out the customers."
bad,Taught me the essential skills and values of all customer service related jobs.
bad,"taking orders, dealing with money, handling customers in a respectful/professional manner while simultaneously servicing each customer in a timely fashion"
bad,I've almost been at Wendy's for a year now and I have learned quite a lot. I am able to do all the tasks I am asked to do bu that isn't because I was trained. They train you through an online course give you a quick go through and expect you to be able to do the job.
bad,"I ‘m not into bashing a company but being a manager at Wendy’s International was a learning experience both good and bad. I love the fact that a customer complaint was taken serially and Wendy’s as a whole had to learn from the complaint on how to value our customers, treat them with respect, and cater to their need. I liked that concept. The bad side, the store managers were very mean and disrespectful. I worked under a manager that drove me to depression. Nothing I did was never right in her eyes and I was a failure when it came to working with people and my job. THIS HAPPENED EVERYDAY."
bad,Prepared food for customers coming into the store to eat. Learned how to take care of customers and cook.
bad,fast paced un great-full job to please people whom r to lazy to take care of them self
bad,"A typical day is stessfull all day and everyday there. Ive gained customer service skills through the years, and earned a couple of cirtificates. Their management needs work. Hardest part of the job was keeping myself uplifted to stay at this company. Most enjoyable, ive met some nice people along the way."
bad,i liked it overall. good companhy to work for if you like mininum wage
bad,"Wendy's is a great place to start out working. At 16, it was perfect because it taught me a lot of necessary customer service skills one would need."
bad,"A typical day at Wendy's (In Daytime) i would either run the front register, run the drive thru, or make sandwiches, where either way i would come in stock my area up and get it ready for the lunch rush. After that rush i would clean up, re-stock up my area, help my team members when I am ahead of the game. Assist my team members and managers through slow periods after my work is caught up. Always just keeping busy, there's always work to be done. If I were working the morning or night shift I would not stop working because your limited on your amount of time to get all your work done. It always is better to be ahead of the game than behind it."
bad,"I would be at the resturaunt early in the morning to stock and prep all food for the day and make sure the resturaunt was clean and ready to open. I would start at the drive thru window until lunch rush was over then move to the counter. I typically worked 8hrs. a day, but would sometimes fill in for missing co-workers and work 12hrs. I enjoyed my job, but unfortunately had to leave due to family problems."
bad,I was in basic training so I had no typically day. Had a hard time cause I was going thru a divorce.
bad,"A very stressful environment to work with, but it gave me a lot of experience interacting with customers and taking orders and fulfilling customers needs,"
bad,make sandwiches for front dinning area and make sandwiches for drive thru also after making sandwiches help pack order in bag or either place on dinning area table.
bad,Job was okay. Had very busy days at times being it was at a truck stop. The co-workers were not the best an were rude.
bad,"Fast paced, enjoyable people to work with, management was supportive. The hardest part of the job was finding things to do when not busy."
bad,fast paced environment the preparing people their food very quickly but neatly!
bad,"minium wage job, glad to get out of the fast food industry. Customers very rude"
bad,I was in high school and liked it.
bad,"I would open up the store at 6:30AM M-F, do salad prep, clean store, take customers orders, we took test to make sure we are doing the right percedure for like making drinks make sandwiches or even how to wash dishes or make certain foods"
bad,Take customer orders and clean and stock lobby area.
bad,This job was a fun job to have. Management was difficult to work with and was somewhat unorthodox.
bad,it was a furniture store .the owner and 3 other stores . we would work at the other stores if that store needed more employees that day .
bad,"I worked in fast food, Not very clean environment to work in, The management was good but not the shift leads. they neeed better organization"
bad,"My short time working at Wendy's, I wasn't allowed to move up and the individuals I worked with were under the influence while on the job."
bad,Today it seems like almost everyone starts working at a fast food place for their first job and I think it's good because it's hard nasty work for low pay but it builds character
bad,The assistant manager thought she was the manager and very confrontational. Employees did as they pleased and no one cared.
bad,"Its a fast rate environment with a manager always behind you. All the time were a race among co-workers. The managers use to yell to the employees, the manager's supervisor never do his job. They expect that a employee that has no parking spot use his/her personal car to get at other Wendy's restaurant whatever that restaurant need. On top of that, they do not have lockers to have your things secure and you have to pay your food."
bad,It really be very busy on fridays.
bad,"It's fast food, it is what it is. I was a team member, working in fast food. It's gross, you come home smelling. But at the end of two weeks you get that pay check. That's what you're there for. You don't work in fast food to feel accomplished, or to move ahead. It's a job to put food on the table."
bad,It was a fast food position that was asked a lot from its crew. Paying very little and asking for a whole lot.
bad,cooked burgers and wasted dishes. Also cleaned dishes and work areas.
bad,I personly didnt have a good exserince with this company i think parshuly bec of my age at the time and some bec of the poeple i worked with the company over all is ok they are fare about duites and hours good with customers
bad,The managers consistently made life hard on employees with mental illness in severe and rare circumstances. The coworkers work together and worked to support everyone. The best part of the job was the cooking. Wendy’s isn’t lying when they say fresh beef. The recipes are easy to learn and you can become a pro fast.
bad,My tasks were a little challenging but got them done within the time they were supposed to be done.  Though there was a little difficulty with one manager specifically but I enjoyed learning and being able to give the best customer service to any and all customers they came through the line in the drive-through or through my line on front counter. I learned so much from the customers a little bit more than Manager‘s but nonetheless I learned a lot and loved every little bit of it.
bad,"The restaurant gets super busy on a daily. although there were good days, most of the time it was bad. we were understaffed in night shifts . the managers were unfair sometimes with the crew members."
bad,"I have nothing to say about this place other than it was a job. I went to work, in uniform, did my job and then came home. Most managers were very friendly and respectful but one or two of them were not as exemplary."
bad,"After clocking in, I would greet my co-workers and find out what position I was to work for that shift. I would then endure a barrage of customers that weren't always polite. In fact I would receive comments daily that would attack my gender identity. However the staff was very accepting and welcoming to me."
bad,We’re short people most of the time and it feels like i have to do everything myself. My coworkers are great but working at this particular Wendy’s is entirely too stressful for me
bad,My work hours have been cut every time someone new was hired and I quit twice because of that reason and I’m really getting aggravated with this job. Manager is cool but will cut your work hours in a heartbeat.
bad,A Typical day at work. very flexible and a great place to work. I love what i do and i learn alot from people that works there. I would encourage anyone to work there for a first time learning experience.
bad,not enough labor hours. poor management. lack of respect for managers and for crew members. no communication. stress and frustration among crew an management
bad,This Wendy’s was my first job I’ve been there seen high school I was sixteen in the 10th grade to be honest I hated this job for a long time I’ve been working there for three years I had so many problems with this job that I can’t remember. But this job stills mean a lot to me there where some good times and some bad times  some people I didn’t like and some people I loved it was my first job I do miss some of the people  working  there I don’t want to work very hard and struggle at the same time I just want to do better and find a better job. so those are my years in Wendy’s very soon I’m to go see some customer I miss to but that’s my experience with Wendy’s
bad,"As a wendy's associate, I didn't enjoy my time working here. but it was great experience for someone with flexibility i guess. if you like stress and quality i guess."
bad,"The first thing that I would like to point out is that the starting wage is $9, but I have heard from some employees that they only get paid $8.50. Working conditions during the recent remodel also make one question the treatment of employees and respect for customers. Employees were still working on the drive-thru, but there were drywall particles everywhere due to improper ventilation. Not only was the fry person continually coughing, but the fries and nuggets were unlikely to be safe to eat."
bad,Wasn't given many hours. One day worked until 3 in the morning (illegal at 16) with no break. Refused to move me from grill after a month when it stressed me out.
bad,"I had alot of goods days at work ,I learned how to get along with others better then I ever had ,the hardest part of job was the pace ,& the most part I enjoyed was laughing with my coworkers"
bad,A fast food job is hard and easy.I say hard is when you short of staff workers and all the weight fall's on you and your workers and you have to substitute others position beside your and multi tasking keeping up with the orders.but it's easy when everyone comes to work and do their part.
bad,"I was always on the same position of grill and never got to really do anything else aside from that. Never was trained on any other position."
bad,"Cutting up vegetables for the salad taking customers orders making food cleaning the restaurant Lobby and restrooms, the employees are very helpful everybody helps each other out"
bad,As a crew member we all worked together but the general manager had an attitude. The general manager's vibe was aggy. She would be upset at smalls thing you did wrong.
bad,I worked at Wendys for a year and it was my first job. Great learning experience. Managers were not what I was expecting. Got the best of both worlds with having the best boss as well as the worst boss.
bad,The workplace culture is well balanced. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people and meeting new customers. I took many different classes that taught me a lot about management.
bad,loved working there during high school always were busy because of the games for notre dame and students when they were in town. great first job for me.
bad,I was very young when I got the job but I personally didn't find it a fit for my life Not only was the wages low but also we didn't have as much benefits as I expected us to have and honestly wouldn't have benefits at all or  have paid vacation but I can say overall I'm definitely glad that they gave me the opportunity to work there so I can't down this company that bad cause through it all they still have fresh and nicely serve food and kept our guests happy
bad,Wendys is a good place to work decent hours good people there is room to move up and make a name for your sel if your willing to do it. and they have really good food
bad,Wendy was a good job for a beginner learning my way around   Las Vegas as a young women who was trying to live better and move out her mom house learning how to save money having a bank account trying to be that independent young lady.
bad,The day was always fun. I had a great time talking with the customers and that's one think that I learned. Customer service is a very important thing.
bad,I don't really see myself working here any more. All I really did was work on dishes. That's all. The only thing I enjoyed was hanging out with a few co-workers.
bad,"As far as fast food work places this is one of the better. Flexible hours, diverse work environment. Usually good management. It is very fast paced,and group effort based work."
bad,"Could do better at treating their employees better. Could do better helping out their employees when needed, help clean the wendy´s dinning room and the management could be a lot better than it is now."
bad,"When I worked there it was severely understaffed 90 percent of the time causing employees to have to do the jobs of 3 people. Extremely stressful. Lunch was often given within the first hour of arriving ""to get it over with"" so that you would have to work the other hours straight through."
bad,"my second day at the job one of the managers cursed at me, I really did not like the other employees was very disrespectful."
bad,"Low pay"
bad,The job taught me a lot about myself and how to better manage my employees. I learned how to open and close a store by myself and work under stressful conditions.
bad,"It as fun and productive , having to reach a goal everyday getting customer in and out within 120 seconds it was pretty cool."
bad,I liked it but the management wasn't how it was suppose to be so they was being really bad about treating there workers
bad,"Wendy  was  my  first  job  I  was new  to the  fast  food  environment  and  I   really  wanted to learn.  This is  the position  were  I  can say  that  I  exactly  learn  my  skills on  how  to performance  my  work  in  different  ways,  and how I  I  learn  to  be a  fast  learner."
bad,"A typical day at work would be, very busy, chaotic,stressful. The things i've learned so far at wendy's would be making sandwiches cashing out customers, cleaning etc. I feel my manager is very pushy, she gets very mad easy. My Co-workers are somewhat friendly. The hardest part of my job is making the sandwiches, i constantly have to ask what's on a sandwich and my coworkers get mad sometimes. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working the drive-thru."
bad,I was hired as mgmt. and quickly discovered its not a great company.
bad,You have to be fast on cooking that's hard on this job. what I like doing at this job is working up front with the management.
bad,"Taking orders and serve people making sure they are happy,"
bad,Met many great people. Great Co-workers. Fast paced work environment.
bad,"My typical day at work was ok you had some rude customers and some nice customers."
bad,I enjoyed working there because it was fast paced. It gave me a challenge with being so young. Customer service I do well in as well and have ever since. Learned how to work with 5 + employees in such a small area under a lot of stress at the time. I am great at working as a team with other employees and enjoyed learning about food processing and serving if there.
bad,This job has helped me learn more about customer service. It has given me a great opportunity to work with amazing people the staff is amazing the work place is great. I love working at this job it’s just they aren’t flexible with my hours and I have a 1 year old son.
bad,"Recommends"
bad,I didnt like working in the fast food industry.  This is why I sought employment in a different industry and I found it in an area I am interested in.
bad,"If you're looking for a fast paced, high stress situation, and minimum wage job, look no further than work for a fast food restaurant. The hours however will depend on the business of the company."
bad,long days in heat i learnt good customer skills management were good everybody respected peoples culture learning the system interacting with customers
bad,"So it was alright working there i got paid pretty good and stuff, but the management wasn't to great. Like if you did something wrong then they made you feel really bad about it."
bad,work and hours were ok the people were good just had to relocate
bad,A typical day at work was fun everybody laugh and smile and we also did our work. My co-workers was very fun and we all got along they were fun to be around. My managers was also nice and they make sure that we stay on our job and clean a lot also so that the place would be nice and clean for them to eat in. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the restrooms just so nasty. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and talking to them.
bad,I learned how to do cash and how to deal with customers  but as a work place  Wendy  sucks the mangers are rude work hour sucked   the mangers  favored  co workers when it was family wise of boyfriends/ girlfriends family they sat around an chatted that it.
bad,"long days, as manager very dependent on others to come in and work hard"
bad,"Wendy's was a mediocre place to work. Honestly I actually would probably would still be working here if the management was so terrible. The benefits were fairly decent, the advancement was incredibly fast, and the work and life balance was very good didn't over work anyone.  "
bad,"Wendy's is great employer for the single person. They are Family-Oriented, however that stand for the customers. At one point I had to play the role of a single parent of four children and found myself having to choice between the two. I am greatful for my time spend and the experience added. But, I have come to grips that it was not for me."
bad,while working at Wendys i learn to work on my communication as i work with customer and work with money for the first time .I also build personally work experience and skills as an employee with this company.
bad,My job was a great start for me but I’m looking to advance and gain some more experience and knowledge be more hands on. I have already worked at this company for almost a year so I am just looking for something a little more advanced.
bad,Working at Wendy’s was my first job to see how the work industry works and to get the feeling of my making my own money and learning responsibility and the manager made working there fun
bad,Typical day was all over the place. Didn't learn anything. management was pretty bad the one manager I liked she was awesome. workplace it was hectic most of the time couldn't finish something and a costumer would come. The hardest part was getting my therapy around work. The best part was the appreciation I got from costumers and managers.
bad,"Most days are fast and busy. The managers were mostly very demanding, but not helpful. The other employees were cool and pretty relaxed. They were probably the only good thing about the job. The hardest part was keeping up with orders and staying organized."
bad,"There is no teamwork are team playe also not a friendly environment no honsey are care are respect one other are things like that.                        "
bad,"A typical day at my job would be food thrown, customers complaining about their orders(And management, which are cool) desperately trying to cope with said customers, somewhat unfair favoritism. Oh yes and very disorganized, recently for the Final Four. I was scheduled but no one had the right information so I missed all my work days for there cause they either said ""I don't need you"" or ""Its too late"". I learned numerous things such as cash register work, cleaning and friendly customer service... Can't forget some speed since it IS fast food. My managers are personally amazing and they brighten my day. The hardest part of the job either when its too slow or too busy. It get old fast. The most enjoyable joking with customers and management."
bad,"i liked it a lot but realized they were doing something illegal."
bad,"I greet customers as they walk in the restaurant, and take their orders; as well as prepare them."
bad,understanding how to clock in knowing what to do and seeing how the working world works at a young age
bad,"Typical day: working in a tight space, squeezing past employees to complete orders"
bad,When I work for this company the managers were rude and inconsiderate. A few of the managers were racist. I've seen things such as them not properly taking care of the customers food.
bad,It was a fast pace environment. Come in do your work and get the work day over with. The customers were friendly our number one goal was to always satisfy the customers needs.
bad,Wendy’s was a good job to work with many perks. It was fun the managers were good people and they did all they can to make sure we had fun all at the same time while we worked.
bad,"My days there was awesome because I use to always get tip from the customers. One of the hardest part was wen you have to memorize the whole board and they show you once after that you have to do it yourself and wen you work the fry station you have to make sure they have frys and nuggets all the time sometimes they let you make salads, or pump the drinks or pass the food out the window to the customer"
bad,This was just a summer job I worked to make money for living that summer. My boss was a very kind man. I used to stay at the back side register taking money. I would also cook bacon and wash the dishes when there was downtown
bad,"Wendys was a fast food job , but i wasnt the one capabale of handling the grill. The people i work with was really fun. When it gets busy, it is really dififcult to deal with the grill itself"
bad,"I work for a franchise company, it was a very unstable environment. I enjoyed the customer and my crew but the company itself not worth working for."
bad,"If you're looking for an easy part time job Wendys is the place for you!"
bad,I thought that working at Wendy's was an eye-opening experience. I worked hard and was rewarded whenever I did well. At times the experience was not very good. There were times where I felt like I was being bullied. But all in all working at Wendy's was pretty good.
bad,it wasnt the best job for me but i did enjoy it....enjoyed meeting and greeting new people
bad,"JOB is to cook nuggets clean filters, dishes, money transaction and also working with other crew members job was good for team work building and consistency"
bad,It was ok one of the best places I have work that I wish I never loved but I would like to see me and proven to anything better I like the people around like to talk to people like to understand people fast food it was a great experience
bad,It is a nice place to work at. I have worked there for almost nine years.  I like working there just need something that pays me better and with better benefits as well. I am a hard worker and would come in at anytime that you need me to come in.
bad,A typical day at wendys for me was a busy day. i learned you should do one thing and its okay to start another as long as you remember to go back to it and finish that task. Management could be a little better but overall it's good.
bad,The environment is great but I feel the manager didn't pay me enough for the work I performed. The customers were rude and there was alot of drama between co-workers. The food was great and the discounts were great also.
bad,"It was a typical fast-paced environment. At the end of the night we had to count the money to make sure that it was the right amount, then we would do the typical cleaning routine at night. If we worked late we would all have to wait until everyone is done, so we left together that way no one ever could get hurt, and so everyone knew everyone else was safe."
bad,"A typical work day at Wendy's consists of team work , organization and finding new ways to understand the customers' needs."
bad,"Wendy's is a great stepping stone for a first job. Wendy's teaches you how to be puncual, organized and commited. If you take what you learn from working and keep add as you go. I assure you will be a fantastic worker."
bad,Its veruy laid back. You can be yourself and have fun.! I learned how you have to put other people first then yourself. The mangement is nice they care and understand.
bad,A typical day at work was good. I have learned  different things about people knowing the different between  having the will and skill to do the job. the most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know different people and making sure that my customers were happy. The hardest part of my job was not having a set schedule.
bad,"Wendy’s is a job you get when entering the workforce, great for when you are in highschool and making money to go out, not intended to make a career of unless Persuing management."
bad,clock-in wash hands go to sandwich station warms buns drop bun wrap to pre-pare sandwiches stock station when needed called orders out call for meat call to drop fries. occasionally help in the window. how to maintain a clean work station. Secret Santa during holidays.
good,It really was a huge bully that would always try to intimidate me. It was a drag nobody did there job correctly. I always had to pick up the dead weight at the end of the night. The managers yelled at you and made you feel like you were trash. If you go over there head nothing is done. I was barely trained and was expecting to know what to do.
good,It was okay.could have been way better with the resources they had. The boss was a little lazy when it came to matters that mattered but other than that it was a decent starter job.
good,"A very good place to work to get on your feet. Not a good place to work long term . Very understanding team,  and very supportive.  Also very good team work"
good,"job can be rewarding at times, high stress, culture is does not let you have a work/home life balance   training program is not successful due to poor follow up and time allowed to train"
good,If you were looking for a temporary job and was ok with working in a get no where  job then you had a job calling it wasn't for me but stuck it out until I found a new one
good,I worked the grill sometimes made sandwiches and sometimes did clean up when they needed me to clean up around the store for them. They didn’t put me on register and I didn't like that because I didn’t get a chance to see if I like the position or not.
good,"you go no where, you don't move up unless you are liked , they don't like for you to call off but they don't like you comimg in scik, so it'sbad on you no matter what you do"
good,The place is as good as it gets for fast food maybe. Definitely not the place you want to work for if you need to support a family.  I guess they were just following the owners instructions though.
good,Very fast paced. A lot of customer service skills needed. Hours for a high school student weren't that good. Someone is constantly watching you. Fast food is not the place for me.
good,From when I first started working there to when I quit I was treated like a newbie and like I didn't know how to do anything which made me feel really stressed out and stupid.
good,"I was younger when I worked for this company. I didn't like how there were no benefits available, no paid time off, nor was there any raises. The flexibility was not all that great."
good,Work too many long hours no benefits no time off not even free food. The managers weren't helpful they just sit in the back the whole time. Always rushed when we were already doing the best we could
good,This was my first work experience and I learned the different aspect of the job that was allowed through my management team. Even with me having a small learning ability the team still taught me different skills that would get me through the day. I've been with this company for 3 years and now im just looking for something different that I can advance with
good,"very rude managers & workers. becomes hostile if things don’t go smoothly & everyone has an attitude. the managers pick favorites and stick to it, and treat you terribly if you aren’t their favorite."
good,"I came in and cleaned whatever I was told to clean, then I occupied a station. Typically, I worked the grill, sandwich station or fries. The clientele were awful, and my managers typically had bad attitudes. But, the job allowed me to work regular hours and save money during school. It was definitely a temporary job."
good,"My experience was only for a short while, throughout it, it was fine but my several of my manager were rude and disrespectful towards other employees. My experience was trouble"
good,I worked at this place for three years almost only to have people start out at the same pay I worked up to.The crew was rude an this was a job for people who didn't care anymore an teenagers
good,harsh always a stressful day never a good day with my manger. she was always on me for small things and was not a good manger and the job never gave me benefits for my work
good,We were not allowed to get overtime. It would be difficult to go on a break at times because either short staffed or extremely busy. I really loved going to work on a daily basis.
good,I didn't have an interview they hired me on the spot and the managers were mean and rude. The hours were terrible for my school life. When it was time for me to leave my manager always made me feel bad for leaving them behind to do all the work even when I had done all my work.
good,A typical day at wendy's consisted of me working multiple positions dealing with rude co-workers and rude customers. Worked late hours and slept all morning so no type of outside life.
good,It is a stressful environment they hire young minded people who look forward to making an living at wendys and im looking forward to making an career for myself one day wendys cant do thus for me.
good,This is a job for when your trying to gain some experience.. The only thing I liked about this job is the people. but other than that this job kinda sucked
good,They do not take good care of their employees and they let a  lot of drama in the work place they allow people in relationships to work together which causes a lot of problems.
good,I don't like it they suck they stay busy they talk to you like animals they are not understanding make you work super hard for low pay  they take your kindness for weakness
good,"In my experience working for this company I learn very useful skills for working in any area, yet they trained pretty poorly in the beginning and the general and shift management are down right awful at their jobs ."
good,It was a very greasy enviorment. A lot of rude customers and more than anything slave work. You would have to clean everything by yourself and would get paid minimum wage.
good,"A typical day woring at Wendy's was really simple!! Greeting customers, taking orders, and making sure the customers were satisfied with there orders!"
good,I like about one of the managers and one of the employees. The rest were extremely rude and had horrible personalities. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Wendys es una empresa, con mucho orden, pero como todo trabajo tiene desventajas y ventajas pero mi experiencia en esta empresa fue muy buena"
good,When I did overtime they cut my hrs the managers are very unprofessional when talking to the employees  short on employees at night  and everybody on morning shift and labor be high
good,"Don't work here.  The the boss is rude and it smells funny in the back, the whole restaurant is just a pig stye and I hated being the one to clean everyone's mess up."
good,the hours are crazy the paid hours are low. $7.25 is not that great if your trying live off on your own. There's a lot of drama and it can very stressful working when everyone else doesn't know how to do your work.
good,They moved you from store to store at times didn't like to give you a raise..I worked​ for the company for about 4 years..That was my first manager position...So they taught me alot
good,"employees unpleasant, managers condescending, management misplaceme, need more diversity and remodeling location"
good,Owner hides behind walls to watch employees I didn't know much about labor board at the time.  It's full of kids that work there who really don't care about the job.  Old people that want to get you fired to get more hours or just use to kissing plenty ahs.  They write you up for uniform issues they don't provide it's almost like working at a place that's rigged for you to be fired in no time
good,"Great place to learn and grow, shift supervisors try there best to help and give you tips to improve. Training is solid if you don't mind doing it via computer, before getting hands on experience."
good,"Terrible. Very fast paced. Managers are rude and treat you like garbage. "
good,managers were rude. enjoyed some workers. very unorganized working drive thru. never had most food ready to  go out of the window. very dirty. never had anything put away correctly
good,working at wendys wasn't what I nearly expected but overall it was okay and id be happy to do it again. I enjoy learning new things and meeting new people.
good,"Management did not know what they were doing, ended up half the people I worked for were on drugs. They have a new owner now so I'm sure things have changed."
good,"Management was too uptight, they seemed not to care too much about the employees needs such as family emergencies and illness."
good,Started me on my journey to start making money for my family. Was fun working with customers and getting to meet new people and learn new skills.
good,"a typical day at wendys would be making sure each and every customer is happy and gets fresh food. if working up front, make sure the dinning area is clean and the trash."
good,"not very apprecitave of their employees or their personal lives. Not very generous with hours either, or work ethics. Lots of different management as for they seem to come and go."
good,Alot of opportunistic managers which will lead you to fall by the waste side unless you are sucking up to someone above you
good,My GM was not friendly or flexible. They had me at a store that was and hour and five minutes away.
good,I never had a real job. Although I was the top seller in a discount card fundraiser for the Minooka High School football team. I'm also taking A Culinary sanitation exam.
good,"It was back in 2004 i worked there, very low income to start off, and management was not that great."
good,what i learned from this job is how to multitask a typical ten hour work day
good,busy but uneventful there are alot of different personalities its very stressful at times i personally have felt unappreciated the two years ive been there
good,good people bad wages .it was ok for a while then it got fustrating
good,"clock in count ur drawer and be an expert in adding and subtracting, taking orders and promoting sells. The hardest part of my job was learning the grill and tempatures.i enjoyed when a customer gave me an outstanding customer service rating."
good,"Standing at the cashier waiting on people getting the customers drinks ready, and their tray. Stocking cups, lids, ice, trays and salads. Cleaned when I had time. Co- workers were horrible, management wasn't any better."
good,It`s very fast pace and you will deal with alot of customers.
good,"The team that I worked with was really great and I loved serving the people that came into the restuarant to eat. However, the management was very bias and not a pleasure to work with"
good,"The managers were rude, didn't care about anyone but themselves. If you worked there, you had no life. If you have a child, you should never work for Wendy's in Covington. You will never have time to see your child. Plus you'll deal with your MANAGERS talking about the other crew members behind their backs and making fun of them. It's a horrible work environment."
good,"Typical Day:being organized,polite,Fast paced,no benfits,no vacations,no raises.but love working with people."
good,did everything from cooking to cleaning to taking orders and serving customers
good,employers would have attitude with the customers. they would argue with other employers
good,It was my first job and I can keep a job for a while but I then was offered a better opportunity at Best Buy Warehouse and took the offer right off the back.
good,"I am no longer with Wendy"
good,"Wendy's is a good company to work for, if you can hear, have no health problems, or have family who has health issues. If any of the above happens, then they don't care. And will cut your hours, until one can't make bills."
good,"Need new main manager, current one has a bad case of power trips. Demands employees to stay later but can leave whenever she wants to. The other managers that are below her are beyond amazing and help with the employees that are having issues."
good,"Poor management, the customers, doing other peoples jobs. Managers were rude to the customers, managers threw food at customers. they had their own clicks."
good,I wouldn't work there again..upper management just didn't care for stores at all..when you close down stores something isn't right..pay was okay.. employees were good..
good,"Poor management, minimum wage, dirty work space. The work space is never clean. The management I experienced was complete garbage. On top of non-sustainable pay for an adult."
good,"When I first started working there, they were speaking to me about management position. Because of that I was determined to make it up at Wendy's so I began training for management. I have been there for almost a year and that position was given to someone less experienced than I. The employees are unappreciated."
good,"We had many people quit without notice, They would stop showing up or would quit an hour before their shift. I was forced to work over my hours many of times. They would switch the schedule without telling employees. I did not enjoy the job besides being able to earn money."
good,They don't work as a team the managers are ignorant and the work area was never clean and barely kept up with the workers are rude too and they was all flirty n stuff
good,The work enviroment was terrible and the managers treated the employees with immoral and unethical behavior. It was either they took away your hours or make you stay longer at work when you had things scheduled and planned. There was always shortage of employees which cause the remaining workers to do double the work and other tasks which at times was impossible.
good,"As a first job experience I would say it is somewhere to start, however, the rate of work for the lower than minimum wage page is outrageous. I would recommend this job to those who only see themselves never moving on or as a last resort."
good,"I've learned more on the paper work aspect of the company -- how to do the safe , how to run a shift on my own and taking care of my staff ---but salary wise i do not feel i get enough money for what i do"
good,It was a good work environment it just could of been way better benefits for employees also the scheldule setup it wasnt organized or professional at all
good,The hourly pay was horrible all employees are supposed to get a raise after six months none of us got it . The managers were lazy all they did was sit down and eat while us employees did the work I was pregnant lifting heavy boxes and over working myself.
good,"This is a great job for any first time workers. Such as high school student's or someone who is just out of high school trying to earn a little bit of money. The location where I worked had many issues. One of the managers did not like me from the second I was hired. I'm not sure why, but she took it out on me the entire time I was employed there. I was getting in trouble for things that I didn't do or had no control over, which was frustrating. I don't know how this manager got away with half the things she did, but don't work for the Wendy's off of Caldwell Boulevard in Nampa."
good,"My routine at Wendy's restaurant was not always consistent because of the shortage of staff; therefore I could be assigned different tasks every day. My experience working at Wendy's was not built up because I did not last long enough due to a number of reasons. Nevertheless, I always appreciated the job offered."
good,"My job at Wendy's was a good introduction to the workplace environment, although I preferred to work elsewhere due to management. Overall, decent work place"
good,"For the many years I have worked there, employee of the month has only been handed out once, which is not okay. Incentives are something to put in the world so society has something to strive for when working so hard. Recently, a new GM has come in and helped tremendously, but unfortunately he is leaving along with all of the hard working crew members who now are forced to look for a better and more stable work  environment. Wendy’s also doesn’t provide room to grow within the company, and they don’t provides students with scholarship programs."
good,"I turned in manager but he's best friend's with general manager. He's been turned in many times and normally gets a lecture and that's it got two days off once and that's it. There's never enough people working. I've had to do front counter, drive through, fries, coordinating, and take money by myself."
good,"I hated it it was my first job and I wouldn’t recommend working there to anyone unless nessasary , I highly disliked the work in that type of environment ."
good,"I worked at Wendy's while in high school.  It was highly stressful, dirty, and fast-paced.  They lack in career advancement and hourly employees do not feel valued by their leaders.  They also did not offer benefits when I worked there."
good,"it was alright if you like being busy, and had a only 5 minutes to eat. And like being in charge, but if something went wrong you better be prepared to answer."
good,I worked there for almost a year and never got a raise and barley moved anywhere in the store. I closed almost every night and I had school in the morning.
good,it is a fastfood resturant it fast pace and can be stressful at the time the managermaent was harsh and pushy the job had no security and fights broke out
good,The expectations that the manger have for you are ridiculous considering that you only make close to minimum wage. I worked for Wendy's for 2+ years almost 3 and the highest raise I've gotten was .15 and eventually it came out to be 2018 minimum wage.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy and giving them their orders quickly. Management was poor and workers were inconsistent.
good,Wendy's was interesting but a lot of work for little pay. the job had me float around to much if I would say so. also customers attitudes affected ones work to be honest
good,"The only thing I truly valued from this job was consistent hours and cross training in all positions. However, the worst people possible were hired who never worked.. probably why i had so many hours.."
good,"My overall review of the restauraunt was that management was not setup properly. Typical day at work started with me coming in and checking products immediately to make sure nothing was bad. I would be running all the drops, making sure all health standards are met. Not many people wanted to work, therefor most of it fell on me. I would get to the end of the night having to pretty much close the store myself because nobody was on schedule and I would have to pick up the slack."
good,"A typical Day at work is very Busy."
good,I truly disliked working for this company. Wendys never gave me a review in the years that I was a full-time employee. No communication in regards to the proper procedures. The food was always good. I will say that I will still eat there and that says alot.
good,A normal day was always hectic and stressful. The only good thing about that job was making some great friends. Other then that the managers were all over the place and didn't have a clue as to what they were doing. A few always seemed to have attitudes and give their employees an attitude and just down right rude.
good,I enjoyed working for the company unfortunately the location i was at offered little hours. You had to travel to other stores a lot in order to get your hours and your days off and itme to clock out was always changing.
good,"Was in a salary position to work 50 hours per week however there was never a week that I worked anywhere close to 50 hours. Most weeks I would work 65-75 hours and was never allowed to have ""personal"" time as I was expected to be on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week."
good,"Lots of multitasking, helps you with your sense of urgency. Love making customer orders quick so they leave satisfied. Hours were part time, it was managed okay. Hardest part of job was doing everything by myself , taking orders alone, etting drinks alone, bagging food and getting fries along, a one man army job. Very stressful. Most enjoyable part of job is helping customers with a polite manner, I have met a ton of nice people and it makes my day."
good,"poor management, lack of benefits, the pay is not livable not to mention bad health habits THEIR are way too many personal feelings  going through the business effecting other employees work preformance"
good,very fast paced environment that put a lot of stress on the workers. had to deal with a lot of people throughout the night. the hardest part of the job was not getting mad at people and what they say.
good,It was my first job and alright to start off with for awhile but the workers deffinitly made or broke the work place. If you were unfortunately with the wrong people then you were in for a bad night.
good,"What I really like about working there is that I like training other people on positions making sure they learn every position ,dealing with customers making them happy with a smile on my face all the time treating them right ,putting hold times on everything always paying attention on everything ,counting money and cleaning and restocking every position wherre I was working ..But what I really dislike is that they never gave me a raise and I'm putting a lot of effort on my work and showing them how hard I work ...That's why I'm looking for another job ..."
good,I would always come in and other employees would show up late an hour to 2 hours late. The management was terrible sometimes the manager would show up late.
good,Working for Wendys was worse than McDonalds. The gm has a drug problem and has been arrested for it. The crew is very unprofessional except for a few.
good,It was just an awful experience overall. The management was unsteady and they showed favoritism. Also the customer service was horrid. I will never be able to work at a Wendy's ever again because of that experience.
good,Very short staffed and not a very well organized work environment. Too much work to do for such small pay. Workers don't care about customers and customers are rude
good,There were horrible people I have worked with and such locker room talk shall not be tolerated. I have worked around some good people but was ridiculed and demeaned by my co-workers.
good,"My managers were stealing and very rude. They treated us with disrespect and clearly hated their jobs, we did too. Wendy's itself doesn't appear to be an awful company but our store was a poor location."
good,"Work was always slow, my co-workers were really fun, but my manger was not so fun, I always did my best at whatever he asked me to do, but if something went wrong that had nothing to do with me; he would blame me."
good,"Working in fast food was fun while it lasted. Now that I have received a Bachelors Degree, I am looking a a job that has better growth opportunites and something more challenging. Fast food is never meant for somebody to be there forever. So my career and my goal path is way behind what Wendy's can offer me."
good,They overloads you with stuff to clean in only 5 hours to do and there security is very poor can't provide there workers in a safe environment especially when being harassed.
good,"This was my first job in high school. Wendy's broke the law all the time and had me working 50 plus hours a week at times in high school at the age of 16. The management was sneaky and has since been fired, and I was promoted to assistant manager at 17 even though the labor laws said that it was illegal for me to work the schedule they had me working. I was put on probation for breaking code, even though the GM ended up being at fault, and when I eventually fought back and got my name cleared I decided to leave, It wasnt a rightly run environment and I regret the time I put into that store"
good,not paid minimum wage and hours got cut due to them hiring more people then jobs there to do. what i learned is to respect customers and help when help is needed.the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers you meet and friends you make.
good,"Busy all the time"
good,"That when Obama started the insurance our store hired 15 more people so we couldn't get it. Then because of that I no longer could support my family after 5 years of service.They also refused to give the 6 month reviews, so no raises. They did not care, they said get another job. They only cared about making  money."
good,"the above says it all. its fast food. people disrespect you. management? there is none. the co workers goof off. its easy, yet boring. enjoyable part? when you leave."
good,"It was extremely young and didn't know the skills I obtained.  I could have easily gotten a better job, but ill never regret the experience i gained."
good,"It was an ok place to work but I would not want to work there by choice not if I had another job I could be doing. The people were nice to work with but some of the duties the job demanded was not my cup of tea, I did like working the cash register and greeting the customers."
good,"I learned how to be serve customers in a orderly fashion. A typical day at work was cleaning, taking orders and serving customers. I enjoyed my co workers."
good,Everyday we had to keep up with the drive-thru time. We could not go over 2 minutes. We had to have the food out the window before the 2 minutes was up. This job was a very fast paced job. I learned that we were the cleanest and fastest store in that district. The co-workers were very team oriented and friendly. The hardest part was keeping the lobby cleaned and running front line. the most enjoyable part was meeting the customers and winning the awards for being the best store in the district!
good,Many days we were short handed. Call-ins and other problems were not handled appropriately. Too much chaos. No cooperation from other co-workers. The best part of the job was the customers everyday.
good,"Each time I arrive here, I instantly report to a manager to ask what are my duties for today, since my name is almost never on the deployment chart and managers tell me ""They don't know"". I am not really learning much because prior to this job, I have had another fast food job I have worked for years and yet despite how I shine when I catch on quickly, I am treated like an entry level person. I only enjoy the discount on the food ."
good,"Its a fast food restaurant. That is enough as is, there is nothing horrible about it. It just is lazy work, and id rather be doing something more fulfilling."
good,"Just freaking terrible. Management is shady, made me work off the clock and didn't pay me. DONT EVER WORK THERE"
good,"Good starting job for teens to get the experience but would not recommend staying for more than a year. There are dead times like after lunch rush and dinner. No raises at all what so ever. My general manager said he would send in the review but nothing happened. Started the job at $6.15, only received a raise due to the government raising the minimum wage. You get your bad and good customers but the good usually out weighs the bad customers."
good,i worked her e for a short time when i first started college as long as you have a decent manager they will work with your school schedule
good,the crew is the best to work with on them long days and its clean
good,"Co-workers are very friendly and nice, you may have some rude customers, the company is very disorganized, no benefits."
good,the one i worked at was awesome awesome co workers and awesome managers
good,"A typical day at work at Wendys consisted of preparing food, using customer service skills, working as a team, handling cash, maintaining a clean environment, etc"
good,"Working there for 7 years was difficult because there was a change in products almost every month or so."
good,"Unorganized location. Poor Management. Poor Teamwork Stressful environment"
good,I started when I was 16 I loved it but then it started too get really bad because I got sexual harassed by the restraint manager  
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the customer interaction and the worst part of my job is the new managment. The new boss doesnt care about us as people only what kind of numbers we run
good,it sucked to stressful for a minimum wage job how not to go off on a coworker
good,"Like all fast food restronts there is a lot of hard work, with a fast pastenviroment. I learnd that I don't like working in fast food. The management is difficalt to handle. my co-workers were a bunch of teenagers in adalt bodies."
good,Not exactly the type of food chain to work for. The hours are short. They begin everyone at minimum wage and rarely receive raises
good,It wa always busy duing happy hour. I got along with everyone. The hardest part of the job is memorizing the drinks. I enjoyed the customers over all.
good,Working with the public is a place for me.I like working with the public.
good,"It had its days, but the place was unorganized for time purposes. They cared more about getting customers out of the drive through. It was always filthy, and no one really cared about how clean their stations were."
good,Grillman maintenance man Sandwich maker cook clean take out trash washing dishes loading stocking changing grease cleaning the grill Work to room seven in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon the job get busy at 11 AM slows down at 2 PM
good,I took another position because I needed the money. Hard to find a good paying job so that you can survive but I am still trying and keeping my hopes up.
good,I love Wendy's food but management sucks we never had employee that wanted to work I love job pay was ok not to much money but restaurant was nice inside
good,I would come into work and immediate put on the sandwich making line. I also helped with front line and the drive thru. I was a closer so I did dishes and cleaned the frosty machine.
good,Working at wendy's was always a steady paste job. You deal with hungry customers and lines of people. Multitasking is always preformed and can be a bit stressful trying to maintain a happy customer. Hardest part of working at wendy's has to be when you get an order incorrect and a customer is upset it creates more of a problem and also line. Enjoyable moment is rotating stations everyday.
good,I really didn’t enjoy my time here.Wendys wasn’t a great choice for me.but they did give lots of hours.dont really work with your personal schedule.Hard working job
good,"Honestly, I did not like working at Wendy's. This was a high school part-time job and it gave me extra spending money. It was very stressful during rush hours and the pay was minimum wage."
good,Wendy si me encanto pero sus gerentes muy discriminatibos
good,"Wendys is a great job for teenagers trying to make money for school, however it is not a great one for someone growing up and starting a life. In all it isnt a bad job, just not the one to give that push."
good,Great place to work with the people that make us who we are but some of the managers for a little bit on the downside and will fire you if they're in the wrong
good,"A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that support one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument. A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. It was an okay experience I wouldnt recommend to anyone else but I guess if you wont to work there it's your choice"
good,I worked at Wendy’s almost 5 years and I don’t recommend anyone to work for them they have bad management they treat employees so unfair and it’s private owned so theirs no one to write a complaint too
good,"at Wendy's its hard to balance your home life and work life because the management doesn't take into consideration of your time and responsibilities. They aren't firm on rules and it makes it easy for employs to misbehave. They take people off the schedule, meaning you may come in and not work and get sent home. If someone is looking for a stable job this wouldn't be recommended because they are disorganized."
good,"Wendy's Job, it's a very hard and fast pace work. Lots of cleaning and decent workers (not all) and a few great managers but overall I'd give the store a rating of 4."
good,"In the beggining everything was pretty nice, learned a lot of how to treat costumers fast and efficiently, also do various things at the same time, but  before the 9 months of probation, they start to bother you more and try to find any excuse to fire you, when you have don nothing wrong and done everything perfectly."
good,"Good job, low pay and bad management. I learned everything that there was to do in the restaurant and and I always got the feeling of there was a better place for my skills."
good,"was not there long enuff to give a opinion typical day on the job there.i learn how they run ther system ,the job that I had to do as a crew member.the most best part on the job when I got on grill,fryer area stayed a mess ,some of the stuff people where not people friendly"
good,"Loved working with customers. It was just poorly managed and we became very short staffed! Fun work environment, fast paced amd always keeps you on your toes!"
good,Some of the assistant managers were rude and pushy. I hated every minute I spent at that job. They caused my stress level to max out. And I worked night shift so I barely had days off.
good,"Employees were great, store manager was awful. She refused raises when they should have been given, there were a lot of hard working employees that got denied raises for no reason I was one of them. That company lot a lot of great people due to the lack of pay, it took me 3 years to get a raise and my raise consisted of going from 7.25-9.25 as a shift manager never made anything more, got one bonus. The entire time I worked for the company. And it was $100.00, they didn’t care about their employees."
good,"During first few hours on the job, was told to watch cashier for 15 minutes during lunch time and then replace said cashier for the first time.  Was unhappy with this due to my lack of skill at the time."
good,It was a nice experience but i don't think i could fast food anymore a little bit stressful and not enough money nor benefits. it Gave  me great customer service skills
good,"Poor management,  poor attitudes, high paced, high stress, disorganized, poor hygienic practices including hand washing and food handling in multiple stores"
good,this is a good first job for highschoolers. that's all it's good for. The new manager doesn't know what he's doing. The employees gossip all the time. The work environment is more like a high school cafeteria than a restaurant.
good,"A Typical day at Wendy's would consist of running a position; sandwiches, grill, etc, or multiple positions until close of shift change. Then closing that station or multiple stations at the end of the night."
good,"Wendys is a good place to eat however on the other side of the counter its a different story as the general manager is harsh om managers which makes it harder on employees and makes the environment anger. On top of that they hire too many minors who don't care about the job and are placed as mid-shifters which are needed for prep however they never want to do their job, they want to come to work and hangout. this makes it hard on anyone who closes because now you have twice the work to do before you get out of there. anyone who works day or mid-shift get out om time but when you work night shift you can be there until four in the morning when you""re supposed to be done by at least fifteen til two am"
good,"i am not going to lie to you it sucks working at this job, unprofessional, rude and theres nothing I hate more than a mamager that doesnt know wat theyre doing"
good,"Typical fast food job. Exactly what you would expect working at wendys. Good student job because they are flexible with hours, working around class schedule."
good,idk why i am doing this but okay wendys is an okay place to work if you have no other option but if you can do better please do it for better of youself
good,Overall a good place to start for teenagers first job....but it could of been better in a few aspects . I want to work for this company for 4 years and in those four years there's definitely ups and downs and all around but a service purpose good people bad people the job
good,"Worked up under the regional manager, but store manager is who I problems will. Had no problem with any thing as a maintenance man doing with whatever mgrs ask, but I have a problems with mgrs disrespect me."
good,When I started I have told myself I be working at Wendy's for a life time regardless of the wage I will receive and I see and experience first hand how they treat staff. I tried quieting first time they promise me a race yet not match to the job I suppose to transfer i CONSIDERED it for their short of people second time I try to resign they ripe  the letter in front of me and trow in the garbage can and did not let me go out in the staff area
good,The job was a good one just didn't have no support team in management finding yourself spending more time at work than home. Never had a problem working 50 hours a week
good,"The only reason I still work here is because I love the night people. They are stress free, sweet, are there for you, are great to work with and are basically family to me. I cannot and let me emphasize that cannot stand working in the morning. My job could honestly be the most hostile work environment to ever exist. Since I started working here about a year ago I worked only mornings and the amount of pain and suffering I have been through because of certain individuals who are so rude and have no empathy is mind boggling. I have cried more than 5 times to a manager about things that have happened to me in the period of a year. Times have gotten a lot better these last couple of months but the hostile environment seems to live on forever. Whenever I try to tell a manager what I feel or think about a certain thing at work they reply “you’re not a manager so don’t worry about it.” I feel like this workplace has taken a huge toll on my mental and physical health. The only thing keeping me sane is those couple of co workers that have always been nice and great to me. Do changes need to be done in this work place? Yeah. Will they ever be done? Probably not. I hope to save myself from this place soon."
good,The managers is full of it and I will never work for the one I worked at ever again. I hated it very much and but. The managers taking out they anger out on the employees was very wrong on them period
good,Manager very rude low pay rates. They are so unorganized. The restraunt is so dirty. But the costumers are nice. Some of the employees are nice ok to work with.
good,i went to this job just to have a way to provide for my family until i found something better that would pay me more. At the time i had two small children that i had to take to a babysitter at 5 in the afternoon and wouldn't get off until 2:00 sometime 3:00 in the morning and having to wake my children up at that time to take them home is not safe! Not to mention that one was in school so he had to get up at 6:30 in the am.
good,"Wendy's is definitely not the place you want to work for as a crew member. You would need to get hired as a manager or better in order to see you check, and to get any kind of benefits."
good,"Fast food is very fast paced and Its great multitasking while working I'd personally just like to work more hours Its good energy , The Wendy's company."
good,Worked at wendys for over a year only got one raise and they expected way too much from me for such a small rate of pay. Managent was terrible always blaming dayshift for food loss when it was clearly happening on nightshift but nothing was ever said to them. Just dont work there its not worth it.
good,The hours you get are a lot if you want them you can have died hair tattoos and acrylic nails so that’s cool but the frosty machine is always broken and so is the AC it’s nice to work during the winter though I liked it
good,Was an okay place to work for. Didn't really enjoy my work experience while I was there but some of my fellow employees were okay to work with. I wouldn't go back to work there though.
good,It’s a good job but you don’t get paid enough for everything you go through . The customers are rude one of the managers shows favoritism. I don’t have time for that I don’t work everyday I need more hours I have kids to take care of .
good,"A typical day at work was a stressful mess, I would be thrown between dish-washing, food prep, and back window. Which on their own are fine, however not having the proper equipment nor training mixed with having an overwhelming amount of work to do caused me to get sick from being drenched with water and having to lean out the window getting exposed to the cold. The managers were indifferent to anything as long as no one was complaining and they were getting paid."
good,Wendys was my very first job. Wendys lacked proper management because the managers and the General manager were very messy for no apparent reason. The didn't respect their hard workers.
good,"In my experience with the Wendy's. Much of of the staff tend to be older and they all seem burnt out from the 6 day work weeks and the high demand for constantly being fast. Some managers have a short temper and snap very easily, one specificially that I can think of. The one thing that kept me going back for three years was the GM. Absolute gem of a GM and great guy. I wish they could have provided a better work experience for their workers. there was also a period of time where I expressed how much I wanted to be a full time sandwich maker, and I feel I did get pretty good. but even for someone that had been there for three years they couldn't do that for me. I was just there dishwasher and I would fill in for sandwiches when they didn't have anyone."
good,"While working at Wendy's I grew close with my small group of co-workers. However, the close-knit work environment was not justification for the stressful conditions in which we worked. There were many shifts where I did not receive a break and even more where I did nit come home before 3am. For the amount of work and time you are expected to put in, the pay is not enough. I was barely able to maintain. If you need a job in a pinch, then it's an easy pick, however I wouldn't recommend going through the process if you have a choice."
good,"the company over all was decent, although the management made me feel very uncomfortable, it triggered some post tramautic stress in my life and depression/anxiety. Voiced my concerns with my general manager and nothing was done about it."
good,I was treated horribly by the management team! You did so much for so little . I enjoyed my co workers and the crew managers . The general manager herself was the worst they come.
good,You have to be on your A game working for wendys you also have to have good customer service a great attitude be ready to work a peoples person and understanding
good,"didn't really like the job, not really good pay or service. wasn't something i really cared about, employees just did what they wanted to do and the management didn't really care."
good,I wasn't a fan of Wendy's but for a first job with other co-workers it was a good start. Working with the customers can be fun but the workers didn't take anything seriously.
good,"Your constantly always moving, cleaning always something to clean!! in every work place! Also making burgers taking people’s order, handing out mints (etc)."
good,"Once I get to work I would ask the manager where he would want me stationed for the day. I learned how to cook and clean on a grill, make drinks, chili, burgers, fries and all types of fast food. Management was poor, reason I say that is because of unequal pay. I referred a friend and upon hire they started them at $9.75 with no experience and i found that unfair. The culture was usual, just a fast food workplace. Hardest part of the job was when it got really busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out."
good,"The only real issue was the management, I worked there for six months and worked a lot of hours like almost 80 the first month I worked there then had perfect attendance and worked well with everyone and did a good job but their management is sloppy. I also only made 9.40 while new hires were being brought in at like 9.75."
good,"Its your typical fast food, its alittle bit slower paced than most so not to stressful, Anyway it was a good entry job to the work market and it gave me alittle bit of work experience."
good,"great employees, code of conduct and work ethics. I needed more hours and pay for what was required of me. I am extremely grateful for the educational experiences provided."
good,Its not somewhere I would work for the rest of my life. I would work there while waiting for another job or a part time job. Its not that bad its just not somewhere where people would like to be for a long period of time.
good,They can do better with the employees and management staff. Hiring people only because of who they know or trying to fire someone or making them quit needs to change. All the favoritism needs to stop
good,"it was ok being my first job experience"
good,"Constantly over worked for what the pay is without any acknowledgement of your efforts. As a assistant manager, they pay was only $10/hr @ 50+ hrs a week. This place is an absolute insult to those who put in a hard days work to try and support their families."
good,The typical day wasn't bad the only downsides where most the managers where difficult. I felt like I was picked on my the employs that had been there longer.
good,Out Of The 3 Years I Worked There I Learned Good Customer Service Skills And The True Value Of A Dollar. It Gave Me A Sense Of Independence And Responsibility. While Showing That Work Could Be Fun As Well!
good,"was a very nice got the opportunity for knew the fast food industry, I learned pretty much about the industry, and about all details that we can't see out"
good,This is a typical fast food job. High paced work environment for minimal pay. There is opportunity for small advancements but shift leader is about the top for a regular worker.
good,"It's a OK workplace, not fun, loved some of the customers though, they were nice, I rather work in a more exciting environment where everyone has a smile on their face, and excited to be at work, just more positivity and less negativity"
good,this location has too many hormones and too many attitudes that it tends to forget the reason why they have a job.....to make great quality food and to bring home a check
good,"Not a good work place, toxic environment and I wanted to look for a better opportunity. Management was poor and there was no balance in life and work with some people working there."
good,"Just as you would expect things to be. Not terrible, but not great. Things could have been a lot better to make the environment more welcoming to all."
good,This company does not have any good benefits no matter how long you work there. These companies are extremely high customer complaints and face paced almost ALL of the time. The management is a little more organized then most companies but again still room for improvement.
good,I worked here when I was in high school. It was a decent place to work as a teenager but Management was rude from the start and they were very unsanitary.
good,"I understand Wendy's is a fast food place but, the management was horrible. They only followed the correct procedures when the district manager came to visit. My manager talked trash behind my back to other coworkers. I'm 17 and I only called out twice the entire summer I worked there. Also for the first few weeks I never got a break or a lunch."
good,I would never say anyone should work at this Wendy's the pay was low the hours were fine but the managers were terrible. in all my time there I barely had any respect and most of my coworkers looked down on me.
good,"Managers are not good at handling problems.. Having younger worker's create immature work place. Fast paced, great good, poor choice of employees, far as hiring young employees"
good,"My typical work day was simple in the morning but hectic by lunch time, customers were very rude even though I was still training. But since they lacked employees they rushed me to start immediately which discouraged me to continue working for them. The hardest part of the job was lunch time, the better part of it was morning when it was slow paced and easier to handle."
good,"They leave you with 2 people or less to run the store at night."
good,"- typical day: long hard work with other crew members"
good,"Good to make quick money in high school, etc but not recommended for someone looking to save up a lot of money because you are never guaranteed proper hours."
good,Needs better pay needs better management .  Needs more people on schedule. Doesn't treat employees with respect . Closing staff is worst disrespectful to customers
good,"It isn't a bad place to start as your first job. It made me realize that fast food is not for me. I hated the environment, I disliked most of my co workers and managers."
good,Management has favoritism i enjoy working there only because of some co workers i grew a bond with but will not suggest working here very unorganized.
good,I really needed a job so I made it work for a while. When I first started the job they where not very friendly. They where not very professional when it came to customer service and handling issues within the work place.
good,"a typical workday at wendys would be employees calling out, being short staffed, not enough help in the kitchen. There are a lot of regulars though that come in and make your day. Its great when you can connect with the customers."
good,A perfect beginning for a first time worker. Fun and silly customer interactions. A great way to buil people skills. Great hands on customer service!!!
good,"It's over all a great place to work if you can move fast and get along  with others. This isn't a job you sit and do nothing all day, you're on your feet going until you're off and most of the time you will stay late because they don't have someone to cover your position."
good,It is a good starter job but overall the entire store is just a mess as a whole. Most of the management knows what they are doing but things get a little out of hand some times.
good,"Good training. Poor management, Can work good hours if you have open ava.  Stays open late so that's a plus. Restaurant could use some upgrades and extra security"
good,Wendys is a great place to work.  everyone is treated fairly and The management ensure that you have all the training tools you need to succeed. its just hard working 50+ hours a week and enjoy life
good,Management didn't respond well to employee concerns. Disorganized. Not flexible in scheduling and didn't post schedule in a timely fashion. I would not recommend.
good,"i come in to do my job, i prep food for the shift, I clean the grills I take orders from customers I make sandwiches i am a productive worker I come to work everyday,  I don't have a hard thing about my job because I know how to do everything."
good,I really enjoyed working at wendys. I got to know some great people there. I worked front counter and drive through and enjoyed it a lot. I just couldn't keep driving as far as I was from home for 8.15 when there are a lot closer jobs that offer more.
good,"Wendy's is just like any other fast food restaurant. They just need your labor and though i dont think this job is hard by any means, i do feel its a draining job when there is no advancement available."
good,Wendy's is an alright job for a first job for high school students. The atmosphere is very closed in and a little cluster phobic at times but is over all a decent job for high school students to get a job experience.
good,Decent enough job. Always got the hours you needed. Not always paid the best. Almost always short handed. Not always working with the most talented employees.
good,Wasn't a very good place to work. The hardest part of this job was the people(that I worked with). The management wasn't great. They didn't know how to run thing properly
good,"The years that I worked at the Wendy's I worked at I did not have a good experience.  Most days I was doing the work of management while the manager was not doing anything,  Also, if the other employees was not doing anything, I had to pick up their slack to. A lot of times they asked me to stay later if someone called out or was coming in late."
good,"Wendy's is full of  New rules, new management every six months. Not to mention bad management who did not know what they were doing most of the time.."
good,On a typical day you're doing about 3-5 different jobs. If you're not putting burgers on the grill you'll be making sandwiches or even exporting orders.
good,I learned the true meanings to putting the customer first before everything and also how to be a leader. The culture of the store was based on which manager covered the shift.
good,"This job was easy to learn, however they don't really do much to train their employees aside from sitting them in front of a computer to watch videos. The management was awful in regards to the fact that he belittled those under him and only promoted females."
good,"A very busy and face paced environment, This type of environment for me personally is what I need, organized chaos. A young and growing management team."
good,"After learning various positions in the work place, you left in a place where there is no hardly any chance to move on. Promotion is rare and there is no raise. Only time when there is a chance for promotion is if some gets fired or the company move another manager from another store."
good,"During my time at Wendy's I found that try were very flexible with my hours, they were good about giving me days off that I requested. But the management isn't very good at all."
good,"typical day at work was boring. i learned that people are really harsh and unwilling to teach you anything, the management was terrible, if they didn't like you, you got no hours."
good,the job was easy and hard work at the same time depends on the actual flow of customers but other than that it is a good place to start off with if your trying to save your money and prosper
good,"The management was unacceptable, and the respect from my superiors was unacceptable. My employers did not understand that I was still in school and that I could not do more than 40 hours."
good,"I Liked The Experience Working There, But They Can Improve By A lot. The Staffing Team Can Cooperate A lot Better As Well."
good,"be there teachers pet and brown nose you will go far.unorganized"
good,"hard to advance in the company, company is selfish and don't care about anything but Wendys and not what you have going on in your personal life"
good,great entry level job but they do not advance or have nay benefits for regular crew no matter how long you have been there.
good,"I was able to work as a high school student which helped me learn responsibilities and skills such as customer service, food, ensuring the customer's happiness."
good,"Depending on the time of day you start will depend on what you be working on. For example, if you open, You'll be taking out the trash from the previous day and making sure that the store is stocked with meat, chicken, and salads. If you come in during the middle of the day, you'll be responsible for keeping up with customer orders and keeping the lobby clean. If your closing, you'll be responsible for taking everything down and making sure that everything is ready for the opening crew for the next day."
good,The crew members you worked with was amazing and a couple of the managers was pretty good as well. They were all about numbers and punching a time clock.
good,i was a produce opener i would go in the moring as soon as we opened the doors so i could prep my portion of the work i would cut the lettous then make the salads then prep as needed then as lucnch started (we didnt have breakfast) we would unlock the front doors an i became a sandwich maker tell my shift was over
good,management was poor never took care of employee needs or requests or any employee issues. No ongoing job training or room for advancement. Always a problem coming into a shift at my requested time.
good,"pay was horrible, hours sucked, nobody took job serious, and management didn't even know how to take an order, too much horseplay in the work space,"
good,i worked as a cashier. i did dishes stock and food prep. the customers were great. they were very friendly and they loved that i always made them smile. wendys gave you no breaks so i was always doing something. i was never standing around
good,"Wendy's overall had good staff and a good work ethic, this kind of job just isn't for me I'd rather do harder work. The hardest part of the job was when the lunch rush happened but it also helped me learn how to work and keep calm in a fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was when customers would compliment me on my customer service."
good,"Nice place to work, wholesome environment, good team experience"
good,typical day consist of serving customers and making sure they are happy. you must take orders and complete them. managers are managers they come to run a business. the hardest part of the job is getting the job
good,Most of the managers at Wendy's are very selfsh and only care about themselves. They are not trained well enough to deal with everyday employment issues.
good,"It was a supportive management team, once the manager left the rest of the managers just turned and was looking out for themselves with a new store opening up. They made it very stressful and an unpleasant work place. The employees all worked well with each other just felt as though we were on our own. It was ok, but not somewhere I would work at again and not the store I would recommend to anyone to work out of."
good,Clock in start cooking untill after rush then clean untill close.  Learned how to adjust my life to working and be a reliable worker.  Management was poor.  Co workers were un- reliable. Hardest part was stress of job and lack of benefits.
good,"Never had enough help from co-workers, manager at the time spent too much time in the office, didn't give you more than 20 mins training if any before they put you on any position, your part-time hours felt like full time hours because you had to work late in the night and then come back again in the morning to be there all day."
good,"- Crew members Friendly and great to work with"
good,I liked working here in the beginning. It was very hard work as a closer. I was taking orders and doing dishes and scrubbing floors. I had to make sure everything was restocked and organized. The managers needed to distribute the jobs evenly. There were not enough people to get everything done on time. People liked to play around too much. The hardest part of the job was scrubbing the floors and large dishes and getting everything done on time.
good,I learned how to communicate with people on a better level. Management was okay. Made friends with most co-workers.
good,Working at this particular Wendy's was okay for my first job. The pay wasn't great for all the hard work that was dedicated.
good,The Wendy's company is what it is. It's fast food. It was a lot of fun working there and I got along with people really well. A really good first job.
good,I found this work place to be rather unprofessional. The managers were never on the same page about anything whether it was stocking products or scheduling or anything else. I also did not think the managers presented themselves in a professional manner or handle situations as a manager would. I did not feel safe while I was working there especially after one of the employees brought a gun to work and robbed our general manager.
good,everyday i had to prepare food and learn how to work the cash register.the manager was kind and a good teacher. my coworkers had more experience then me so they taught me as well. the hardest part of the job was learning to work the cash register. the most enjoyable part of the job was the independence.
good,"very slow business eventually went out of business, no benefits, no hours,"
good,When I would clock in i would go to see what position i was on then i would work that position all day. I learned how fast food places work. I didnt really like my managers they were not very help full in anyway. my coworkers were alright to work with but didnt really care much for them. hardest part of the job was keeping up on the burgers. the most enjoyable part of the job is there was not much time to relax.
good,I had a lot of fun relationships with my co-workers but when it comes down to business everyone is very irresponsible. Working there almost two years and all I got was a 10cent pay raise.
good,"A typical day at work involves me doing more than whats expected.  I experience a consistent work flow from start to finish.  I have learned the proper procedures for operation various stations.  The company promotes from within in.  Overall, I enjoy my co-workers but fill that they talk to much about other peoples business.  This take away from their ability to complete their job.  There is nothing really hard about my job.  They only thing is in this type of employment teamwork is important and it is not always visible.  The most enjoyable part of my job is customer satisfaction as a result of my service."
good,"To be a management here at the time I was here you had to be very flexible, your life had to be involved there. We had such a big turn over rate it seemed you were always there."
good,"early morning late evenings"
good,"The compny in itself it great but the employees and management are not what i expected. not very polite to customers some of the management mottos were to just get in and get out, intead of doing the job the correct way, Alot of unsatisfied customers "
good,"A typical day would be cleaning, collecting money, and serving customers with a smile. I've learned from this job that it takes more than one person to run a sufficient store. The management was  okay, the general manger knew what she was doing, but every other one had troubles staying on task and not helping out."
good,"its fun just, some people values not on target with wendy's values."
good,"Wendy's is not as easy as it may look job, you have to be smart about the way you go about things. The Wendy's i work at particularly is not as busy as most Wendy's but it's busy enough. The customers on average are easy to deal with. The hardest part if my job is working late nights, its so draining and all the cleaning is left to the night shift. My co workers and I all get alone and we all feel the same way about Wendy's. We work really hard for hardly any money. I've learned a lot about fast food from working for Wendy's and I know this is not the place for me at the least I've been working here for a year now and it's time that i branch off into something that will pay me better and benefit my future. "
good,"this was a learning experience in patience and humility, I was a cashier for four years in that time i learned when to listen and when to act."
good,This was a job i took to pay the bills. I had worked for the company before. This job had not advancement in it for me.
good,"The tpoical work day is long and stressful. I leatrned to never doubt what you can do. The management is okay but it could be better if it were better ran. The hardest part of the job is getting along with people, and the most enjoyable part is when its time to go home."
good,I learned how to interact with people face to face and serving them their orders. I learned how to balance work and school.
good,Working in this company shows and proves the ability you can do. It also show how much skills you have. Within five months of my employment i was voted employee of the month out of 30+ employees. I am rated the most top 5 best employee in the job area. Even though i make 7.25 hr it does not mean i can not help my bussiness.
good,The amount of work i have done didn't add up to the amount of money i should have been making . I've Learned how to be more of a team player and enjoy being in a restaurant
good,"Long shifts all year around, most of them at night and weekends."
good,this job has given me a bad experience with fastfood jobs and wish to never work at one again.
good,Typical days were ok. Ive learned how to deal with customers. Mangament did not take jobs serious. Co workers were ok.
good,i dont have that much to said only that i love working for wendys but i didnt like to stay there long just because there i lot i didnt like
good,A typical day at work was pretty easy with the random hassels of short staff or angry customers.
good,Wendy's is an okay place to work. The only thing that I didn't like about it was some of the managers don't treat their employees the way that they should be treated. As far as the work goes I like it a lot. This is the type of work that I enjoy doing next to working on the computer.
good,I learned that having excellent customer service skills is one of the main requirements for most jobs.working at Wendy's definitely helped gained most of my skills at helping a customer with any sort of issue they are dealing with.
good,"nice job, nice people, and delicious food. Typical day at work was extremely busy, non-stop customers."
good,"Wendy's is a team based environment that is dependent on every individual pitching in to complete the task at hand. The moment you clock in there is something for you to physically do, and there is not a moment to waste. “If you have time to lean, you have time to clean”, many of my managers philosophy. The job is entry level and you can simply learn as you go. Dealing with the public and the various personalities you work with daily really helps you learn correct customer service and how to yield to other’s needs. Working at Wendy’s is a great way to gain a multitude of customer service experience in a short period of time."
good,"My boss was flexable and nice, but the company really had no incentives for the crew. My coworkers were nice and had fun, but most of the time just worked and went home. When i go to work I want to know i'm coming into a place where people are happy to be there."
good,Does not honor schedule agreement. Will keep individual 3 or more hours after end of shift without any notice to them or their families. Held job over my head if I were to leave after completing agreed shift.
good,The store it's self is not in good working order. Things have been broken for years and have not been pushed tho be fixed.  The management in my opinion are to young and inexperienced in problem solving to really lead .
good,I don't think it a job to have and keep for any extended time of time. The management is not good and it's dirty and not ran like a fast food residence should be.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with as for the company there was to much drama and false promises. There wasn't any encouragement or compliments just alot of B's
good,"Deberían dar más horas por turno, y si está flojo esperar las 4 hr para enviar personal. No dar menos de 15hr semanal"
good,no matter which one you go to... same problems same situations.. they only care about having employees to take on shifts... does not matter who.. I have been to some places where it does not matter how u are... and some where you are expected to be perfect. and the managers  are totally on a power trip sometimes... it seems as the good managers were the ones over 4 years ago.. when Wendy's wasnt watching  you on camera so closely
good,The company can be accommodated to their good employees instead of the new hires. Treat your employees good and they treat you good.bPay your employees what they are worth.
good,The constant yelling in the kitchen can be overwhelming but it is nessacary to hear people over the constant timers. When its not super busy it can be a nice place to work.
good,The hours are terrible and I've worked there for almost 2 years and I get 2 days a week and have begged for more days and not giving and then also have not even been offered a raise or an incentive for have stayed loyally 2 years ....
good,The  main manger here was nice and understanding but some of the lower level managers were constantly rude and very judgmental. This is not a job for teens going through any type of depression or PTSD. This job will make it worse
good,I wouldn’t recommend to work at this Wendy’s because a lot goes on in there and the managers be gone around arguing and stuff and then some of the customers be trying fight the mangers
good,None of the managers could speak english. Made it diffacult to communicate. Felt like they were letting me go due to my lack of spaish skills .. wasent fired but droped to one day a week and then   was told they didnt need me anymore.. never was told a reason for letting me go.  Plus my check was short hours. By far the worst managnent ive ever exprinced.
good,A very fast paced environment. Work environment can sometimes be toxic and puts a lot of stress on an employee. Management had their good and bad days.
good,we really didn't have help from manage. She was real rude and we didn't have a lot night  closer. I didn't really like the job because they didn't work as a team.
good,i worked just about every position they had at wendys during my time there and overall the set up was inefficient. we were constantly understaffed because management didn't care about employee well-being so many people quit.
good,Often only 2 people working at night. Trying to do the job of 5. Day shift seemed like it was more organised. Often 8-10 people working. Some nights when there were local events letting out we would get slammed. Management was never prepared.
good,General manager and shift managers don't train the crew properly.there is no team work.crew talk to managers any kind of way. If you bring it to the managements attention it's like you in the wrong
good,"Working for Wendy's helped me to develop my multi-tasking skills.  To be a recognized employee you must work hard and dedicate a lot of time for their company, sometimes with little immediate reward. For me, my reward was becoming a stronger personal and employee mentally and physically."
good,"Wendy's was my first job, I went from working 20 hours to almost 40 due to shortage of stuff. The Wendy's I work at they started having minors close due to not having enough night shift people. Some days I didn't get brakes."
good,Management inconsistencies. A lot of rules were broken and boundaries overstepped between management and employees. Hours cut nearly in half in the winter. People who have been there less time w less experience would be promoted before someone who’s more comfortable with their position.
good,The managers at my location lack respect and do not take employee issues into account when making a decision. Customer care is not something they hold in high standards.
good,My biggest cons of the job are simple. The managers are over run the higher ups only want to push more people through instead of working on ways to make it all easier. Managers are grossly underpaid as well. No breaks for managers either no matter the shift length
good,"The manager and employees were always arguing and fighting. I did not feel safe working there. That particular location constantly failed inspections, so it had to be shut down for a while"
good,"It was ok to work for them."
good,"It's a good place to work if you need some extra income, but management is poor. Employee or late or never show up. They new help running and operating."
good,My experience at my Wendy's is great.  I started as crew and worked my way up and now run my own store.  I love having the ability to hire people of my choosing. We are all like a little work family.
good,the managers are disrespectful and don’t work at all. they make their employees do their jobs. the crew members all think they can do whatever they want.
good,"The job is something I like to do. However the hours were long I got called or texted on my days off being yelled at for some of the dumbest things. The GM was bringing stress from out of work in life to inside the work environment. The GM on multiple occasions would cuss at employees in front of customers and yelling remarks like ""Are you Fu**ing Stupid!"" Overall pay was liveable but not worth the mental and verbal abuse."
good,who lives off 9.25 per hour and you have to pay you lights gas and rent. no one person can survive off of those pay rates there terrible I don't understand it you put your all in a place for so little back.
good,"It’s a lot of drama when it comes to working at Wendy’s people pick and choose what position they are working, and the managers never says anything. But although it’s a good job for a high schooler"
good,"I applied to this job, and they responded fairly quickly after and I got the job within a few days. The job itself is not that difficult, but the staffing and management make the job much much harder and more stressful. At the branch I worked at, the management was very sexist towards women and rehired people who had already been fired because of their desperate need for employees. They would extend and change my hours without giving me any notice, and any personal information that corporate needed from me to process, took way too long. There is no urgency for crew members in areas such as pay or proper working conditions. Managers are the first to be treated with dignity and respect. There were times where I was doing the job of a manager because I was left to deal with the entire store by myself and with one other crew member. Overall, I would say that if you are willing to suffer for money to pay the bills, go for it. But I would not be too invested in the job itself long term."
good,"as a sandwich maker my job is to clean and stock my station, as a sandwich maker you have to be able to work at a fast pass, and be able to make orders correctly in a timely manner."
good,My Wendy's had owners who weren't the best and made work when they were there a high stress environment and would stop transactions with customers if you were doing something wrong. They only focused on labor percentages and the manager focused on small things.
good,"Rush threw training "
good,"This job was a mixed bag for me. On one hand, you had very friendly coworkers and managers, but you also had hectic work environments with only training in one skill. You must pay for your own lunch, but you do have a small employee discount. You are not allowed to share your discount with any family member. You can’t wear false nails or nail polish. You must buy specific shoes for the job. (Mine costed me a good $30). You must provide your own black work pants as well, but they provide you with a shirt, visor or cap, name tag, and apron. Training is paid."
good,"Dish duty, counting drawers. and taking customers orders. Most difficult part of the job would be the late hours. Management was flexible to my school hours."
good,"I worked as the drive through cashier. I would come in at 4 pm, 5-6 days a week. I would work until the store closed at 1 or 2 AM depending on the day. The days were long and hard but I prided myself on my hard work and attention to detail."
good,"The management wasn't very good, they offered no support more stress than anything. You need the patience to work there. The other workers don't offer much help when working. You basically do everything your self."
good,"Drama. Working at Wendy's filled my life with drama. This drama wasn't coming from the young teenagers working there, but it came from the adults working in management."
good,"I work at Wendy's in Gsllipolis. So far everyone I work is ok. Lots of really young employees to me, lol. The manager is a decent one too at least from me. Really busy most of time."
good,Working for this company was sometimes stressful because it was very quick pased and had to keep up with everything and it stayed busy at certain times.
good,"It is a good place to work if you don’t mind a poor safety environment, unknown schedule and management that doesn’t take school tests seriously even when time was requested off in the outlined requirements to obtain it."
good,"I didn't like working here this company is not a good company to work for. Short breaks, no health care, positive is discounts hours were hard and quick pace"
good,"It's good to where you need to make money to get back on your feet so you can advance, but the work would have to be the biggest thing to get used to if thinking about applying."
good,The Job Is Under Staffed And For The Amount Of Work You Doing The Pay Doesn't Add Up. I Wouldn't Wanna Reccomend This Job To Anyone Unless They Like The Long Hours And Stressful Work Atmosphere.
good,"This particular Wendy's I worked at was a bad place ..while being in school and working  my managers didn't care that I was a senior in high school that I am planning on futhering my education.as if I'm only good at working for the white man for the rest of life,drop out of school and become someone I'm not set out to be."
good,Working in the fast food environment is very stressful.  However it is a steady source of income.  If you show them that you want to work and that you are reliable they will probably keep you.
good,working in the Wendy’s business comes with many hardworking yet competitive people. Poor pay and poor food quality. Working at this company is sometimes very overwhelming
good,mean hiring manager but the pay was worth it. some people tried to help out but training was unorganized and i felt like no one wanted me there and i was just in the way of everyone.
good,Wendy's is a fast paced job.  I would take people orders at the drive-thru and take their money.  I didn't learn anything.  Management wasn't the best.
good,Most stressful work experience ever. Only got to see my daughter one day a week. Wouldn't do any hiring to help with running the store. Each shift would only ever have 3 people to run rush hours
good,"Typical day is positioning,having enough people on shift, greeting customers, fixing orders, cleaning lobby, restrooms, and work stations, lack of communication, managers didn't honor their word, judgemental work environment"
good,The whole store is terrible. They are unprofessional and don't know how to properly manage the place. And their biggest thing is favoritism if your not Mexican well good luck at getting any type of respect.
good,"Quick fast paced, but under paid. Flexible hours. Management was tolerable,  easy way to make quick cash. 50% off food discount for employees only. Great place for school fundraisers."
good,"slow some days but when busy managers hang in the office "
good,"Wendys is probably one of the better options if you're going to choose to work fast food. The way we make food isn't nasty, you learn to work quickly and as a team. Taught good money skills working as a cashier"
good,I'm nit making enough money I work hard alway on time nut can live to save or make enough to live I'm check to check it to hard on me as a grown women I have grown women bills wendys don't pay enough
good,Was my first job but my worst. I would work 10 hour shifts and come in at 7 and work till 5 and would be forced to take my break at 9 am and was not allowed to take another break after I come back so for 7 1/2 hours I was forced to stand at the grill and could sit down for 2 minutes.
good,It is a cool job for now but I think I need something better . I couldn’t even get a free lunch . If I work a full day and I still have to pay for a lunch I feel that is terrible .
good,Some of thenppl there were ok to work withbut its more on management. They don't do their job. Everyone plays and is disrespectful. There has been complaints made to corporate.
good,Working with the wendys company on a day to day basis is kind of stressful trying to make ends meet every month on bill. Times getting hard and i honestly feel like wendys employers get paid paid enough.
good,"This was a good first job for me, I just would not go back. It had its moments of the quick pace environment and everyone got alone pretty well. Sometimes everyone did not always get along."
good,"I would never work for any Wendy's company. There were no incentives, no benefits, the pay wasn't all that good either. There was to much consistency, would prefer to do a variety of things during a shift."
good,"I have had a lot of catcalls and many disrespectful comments from a few coworkers. The managers just listen to what happens and don’t say anything to stop them from saying or doing anything. Also, there is no respect among the workers, and it seems no one works as a team there. I did like to have the opportunity to serve customers, the good and the mean."
good,The coworks were nice but they had poor management. I liked working there I liked my job but they didn’t show me how to do my job and didn’t train me right
good,Over worked and under paid this company doesn’t care about the well being of their employees all that matters to them is that someone is there during store hours to make their money
good,"There is the hassle of parking at the airport which ca take a while, then going in through security, if your running late, these things make you even later, not very understanding of hours"
good,the people there are a blast to work with and have no problems making going to work fun. very easy to make friends inside the workplace that will remain your friend outside of it.
good,At wendys it was okay . I only worked there while I was in high school. That was like 4 years ago. I really enjoyed because I like te people I worked with and the management was great til they closed down.
good,I didn't love working fast food.  I had left a job I had been at for 3 years and thought I would just like something different.  I just didn't love cooking hamburgers.
good,My bosses wouldn't give me a raise wouldn't help me move up for a higher position and they would juggle me inbetween 3 managers to see if i could ever move up and I never got to be a crew trainer
good,This is the kind of job that every high school student looks for when trying to get their feet wet. This is not a career unless you become a store manager or a general manager.
good,"I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone.. you’re underpaid for everything you have to do. The staff is very immature. The managers don’t care about staff. There has been multiple issues with peoples belongings being tampered with, money being stolen."
good,"Toxic atmosphere. Bad scheduling. Underappreciated staff, especially at night. Extremely busy, from open to close. No rest for the weary. Advancement opportunities only to shift manager. But then, I worked at the busiest Wendy’s on the west coast."
good,"A typical day for me was clocking in finding where I was being placed. The only thing I learned to do was take orders in drive-thru. The management was okay, just had the catch them on good days. The atmosphere was awkward some days, some no one wanted to talk to another, and other days everyone wanted to scream. The nothing was really hard for, they didn't really have me do much. The enjoyable part was working with my cousins."
good,A typical day at work is fast pace and very busy for little pay and benefit. There is no pay difference for working evening shift. The work is very difficult.
good,"While working for Wendys Corporation was a blast, benefits where over the top. Wendys believes in family as well as helping there employees succeed. But once we were bought out by the franchise everything changed, all of the moral standards that Dave Thomas built the company upon was washed down the drain and ethical standards seemed to diminish as well. I would ask questions and their response would be very carefully word and incomplete."
good,"the shift could have ran a lot better,   health insurance should be added to this type of employer. the pay for this job should be higher because of so must one person has to do."
good,I like everyone there as a person but sometimes managers get really mean or co workers treat managers poorly. There are just too many problems to list.
good,Position and service was very unrewarding and the entire atmosphere was lacking a great deal of morale. Extremely high turnover. Employees have no regard for each other nor the establishment.
good,I loved the job. But it was hard to get along with others. It is a constant put down environment. You are never praised for anything you do correctly or over the top. You only get yelled at for things that are completely out of your control.
good,This is not the type of job for those who are enrolled in school because the employer did not work well with scheduling. The management was poorly demonstrated and the over all cleanliness of the establishment was horrendous.
good,"Unfortunately, not the type of job I wanted to spend a career in. Was unable to move forward, pay was lacking, and the job was not very HR friendly. Looks like it has changed though in the past 5 years."
good,you feel like a family working with people who are so open about multiple things in the storefront. working there was fun and excited on a daily basis
good,"Too much like a high school hangout between employees. No one wanted to work, unclean, rude managers and too much slacking off. No one was serious about their job, my worst job experience."
good,"Honest, hard working people were fired for things like being late for work because car broke down, while others that were favored would miss work without calling in advance."
good,Was nothing but a stressful environment and poor management. when i would call off i would get the second degree with why i am calling off. the management didnt know what they were doing.
good,wendys is a very fast paced work environment. they do not turn anyone down for a job unless that person has already worked there and they did not do their job correctly. in the same sense since they constantly hire new people they are constantly losing people too because they end up with too many people.
good,The only reason i liked working at wendys was that i had great co workers. My managers were sleeping together and they brought their relationship to work and made a terrible environment to work in because they would sit in the office together and do nothing and expect me to run the shift. Not okay.
good,I Loved working with the other employees. But New Management was hard to get along with. She has a lack of respect for others. I trained hard to become management and even passed my serve safe but was happy when it came to the end of my employment.
good,"A typical day at work was usually fast paced unless the weather was bad. I didn't learn much while working there but the management was horrible, When we were short staffed our general manager did not bother to come in and help us so most of us would often stay and help even after our shift was over. They did not like giving breaks all though I didn't mind because i usually would not need one, but when I did they'd tell me to "" wait"" or ""hold on"" and I'd never go on break. All of the managers sat in the office and ate while the crew would need help with something.They did not have any respect for their employees and the least bit for their customers.The hardest part about the job was having to do everything on your own because the managers never wanted to help so we'd do it on our own and if it wasn't done right they'd say so and not help us correct it. The most enjoyable times were when we'd get ready to open or close especially if everything was done right so we'd open on time or close on time."
good,"The particular store I worked, during the time I was there, was not run well at all. The ratings are based solely on the time spent there. I have returned to that store several times as a customer and the place seems to be doing a lot better. I am sure it has improved since I worked there but, I cannot be certain. I just remember the managers being unhelpful and unreasonable, the co-workers were had no respect for one another and often disregarded me as a human being. I tried to tell management once but, the manager at the time did nothing about it. I doubt I would ever try working for the company again and rarely ever recommend people getting a job with the company. Although, as I have said previously, the store has seemed to change quite a lot since I worked there so, maybe it got better."
good,"It isnt the best job, but it will get you by while you are looking for a temporary job. All of the positions that are available at Wendys are trained within time, and the store is quick paced, especially during a lunch rush."
good,"Horrible management, fast paced work, and some of the employees didn't help the others during rush moments. It was like having to work by yourself when everybody else was talking in the kitchen."
good,"Wendy’s demands excellent service from their crew members but the company does not treat their workers well enough. There is no way a crew member will be motivated enough to work hard to keep a drive through lane timer under 100 seconds average per car while making less than 8 dollars an hour and having to take orders, bag them, and take payment all at the same time."
good,"The management team has bounced around quite a bit, with numerous bad eggs in the mix. There is no such thing as teamwork, as most coworkers are fascinated in cliches and excluding those that are different from them. The lack of a flexible  schedule puts you at odds with important responsibilities outside of work. "
good,It is a hectic place to work at. People dont take their jobs seriously although management does and always looking for people to come in and want to work. Although it did not offer benefits and I worked to many hours is the reason I had to leave because of my family
good,Not all Wendy's are as bad as the one I'm at. Needs better manager. Crew does whatever they want. Manager engages in behavior she should not. No one is punished for bad behavior and customer service is last on the list for them.
good,Unless you are only trying to get fast money I wouldn't recommend work at Wendy's because it did not help me in any advancement in my future career. I can't speak for other stores but the one I worked at isn't a place you want to work.
good,I Didn't like this job. It didn't give me enough hrs. They always wanted you to come in at random times and cover for other people that decided not to show up. The only benefits you got was discounted food on break
good,"A typical Day at work is when everybody does there job , I learned that teamwork is the most important thing in this company because sometimes you have to multi task. The hardest part about this company is getting along with other coworkers who has lack of teamwork. The most Enjoyable part of the job is showing good customer services."
good,This company was good for me to get in the door of customer service. This job gave me my first experience of interacting with people and basic knowledge of customer service
good,"Bad behaviour and harassment by some of the supervisors has no consequences. They are let to go scot-free by the senior managers."
good,"Overall, I was extremely unsatisfied with this company. The management was super unprofessional, there was never any raises given, the hours were terrible, they didn't care that you were in school, and the place was just overall gross."
good,My Time spent at this particular job was fun while it lasted but I couldn't see myself there for to long but the experience was ok and decent.........
good,Least friendly group of people I've ever been around. the work is ridiculously stressful and there is not much to compensate for it. would not recommend working at this location.
good,I would not work for this company unless the general manager was fired! She was nkt understanding at all to the fact of my child being sick and i had to take time off to care for him. She refused me my break when i finally had enough i told her it was unfair and against the law and quit right then and their jn the middle of my shift.
good,"I'm always moving around doing work."
good,I was a shift leader for most of the time I worked there. It is very fast paced and customers and ridiculous about their fast food. I will never work in fast food after working here as long as I did.
good,Fun at times but when it came to business you had to be in the game or you would probably lose your job. Slow days were boring and busy days were wild and crazy.
good,"It was a learning experience. Constant training on basics of the job such as customer service, money exchange, and conflict resolution. During the work day, there's a goal to minimize the time it takes for a customer through drive-thru to order until they pay and receive their food."
good,"I love this company, and the people. However, management is very immature, besides our GM and the schedules are hectic, and I can't have much of a social life. I have worked 9 days in a row, especially if we're short staffed and everything seems to be unorganized. Our GM works his hardest, but the company is high turnover and the shift management isn't the best it could be."
good,A typical work day at Wendy's is stressful quick paced environment. I learned how to operate and maintain the grill and deep fryer. The management there wasn't so great. They were always using inappropriate language. The work place culture was pretty diverse. The hardest part of the job was working with co-workers that were using profanity and inappropriate behaviour.
good,"i cooked at wendys while i was visiting family, the job was okay but management and the staff wernt all that great. i worked full time while going to college as well. we got free lunches when we would go on break."
good,"I was injured on the on the job and didn't get worker's compensation. And no breaks, no communication between u and the managers, harsh when calling out."
good,"Couldn't seem to hire any good/solid employees. I worked many shifts with only three or four people- counting myself. Doesn't pay well, but it's a job. Would not go back but is definitely a solid stepping stone."
good,A typical day at wendys is fast pace always you learn everything there is to know about the job to get it done. The management could use a lot more help.
good,i loved and appreciated my job but the environment in which we worked was not the best.. There was no teamwork.. A typical day at work would go smoothly only if the general manager was working. The hardest part of the job is just to get the teamwork on point.
good,"Staff mainly consisted of older people. If youre a teenager, youre basically a joke to them and they run all over you. They do not care if youre in school, theyll work you to close! Overall an easy job, if you can get past the rudeness from other employees."
good,Lots of gossiping and caddyness. Not worth working at. Lots of 2 faced people nice to your face but willing to throw you under the bus. Worst experience I have had
good,I maintained an easy going work environment. All tasks have to be performed time and accurately to meet food safety standards. I furthered my interpersonal skills this being my first job.
good,"The only ones who could do the 40 hours and not more was the shift managers, no pay raise, dont work with schedule, the GM choose favorites."
good,What i learned from this place is that some things cant be done properly without a little more time and better tools and training! Safety is not a thing in a condensed fast food kitchen. Being fast paced does help but also increases the percent of injury or worse.
good,"it was a part time job"
good,"Fast food service, harder than it seems but a good start for a first job. I would recommend this job to anyone who is seeking a first time employment because this gives you experience"
good,"Terrible corporate structure. No breaks, too much freedom, high expectation for low wage, no appreciation or respect, lots of drama.  Would be a  decent job  with  better higher ups."
good,It's ok doesn't pay enough . I wish I could've got a raise since I did work there for seven months. The pace is very quick and will have u stressed if you are not organized.
good,"Good job, good food. The management was not all that great. It does not take much to flip a burger and throw out trash but management liked to treat their employees like children."
good,it was a very fast passed environment. Very nice employees to work with. i really enjoyed my job. i had to leave because i was going to university.  i loved it
good,They were unwilling to work with my availability when i had it turned in. They kept scheduling me on the weekends and that is the only time i got to see my son. Management is a joke. Drama filled work environment.
good,"when working the early shift they would make you take your lunch early then having to work your butt off and not letting you go home on time, not being recognized for the work and some of the managers would play favorites"
good,I was always stressed and running around doing other peoples jobs and staying late for people when they are late for work. I didn't enjoy that and I felt that I wasn't getting paid enough for everything I did for that company.
good,"I can not speak for all Wendy's branches. Although, I will share my work experience at the previous location I worked at. The management was poor - they failed to consider my requested days off and was willing to have workers come in even though they were sick. This could have been a big problem as it promoted the transmission of diseases from foods to people. Some of the employees were unfriendly which made coming to work dreadful.  The upside to this was their strict service. They made sure every employee delivered customer's orders accurate and fast. I was also able to perform various tasks at one time. For example, I can take drive-through orders while making part of their orders at the same time and talk among the sandwich makers. I can collect bills while taking another order or promoting combos."
good,Fast paced close quarters work place. The managment is questionable and the customer base is hostile. Low paying and not the best hours. Still not the worst job out there
good,"Ive been a supervisor for a little while now and it has its perks but I wont advise anyone to take such a position unless it's to enhance your cv. The closing hours are extremely long and we aren't getting paid for working pass 11pm. We don't get paid for doing over time, which happens a lot. They pay is really low for the amount of work that we do. It doesnt pass 14$. And poor recognition or appreciation  by our superiors."
good,I worked with a lot of immature managers and their was a lack of consistency of practice and how policies were applied.  Extra hours were provided to others that were the loudest.
good,This was my first ever job so I wasn't expecting much out of this establishment. For the most part my duties were very demanding and had a handful to juggle before actually opening for busness
good,"My review of this company is that the managers need to get better control over their staff. I liked the job and that I was able to work with family. What I couldn't stand was the fact that I was barely getting any hours, the crew was always calling in and leaving us short staffed and that the management did nothing about it. The pay isn't worth the drama with the customers or other employees."
good,"When it comes to food, Wendy's does have the better food in my opinion, however, they did discontinue my favorite sauce. Working in fast food teaches you how to multi task and pay attention to detail such as special orders, when someone asks for no lettus, you make sure you don't put lettus on the sandwich"
good,"Good place to work but need to provide more hours when requested, especially if employee is hired on a full time. Not worth spending gas to go in for less than 15 hours for the week."
good,I liked my management and my coworkers but the customers were very rude. You have to be able to multitask and work quick on your feet! You will get tired and you will smell bad but enjoy your first job. Please don't make it a career.
good,"Busiest location in London, always productive, made a lot of friends while working there, there wasn't a lot of room to move up since you had to move locations to do so. The management was sometimes disrepectful to employees."
good,I liked the people I worked with a laid back comfortable environment the hardest part of the job is scrubbing the walls and keeping the floors clean from the grease
good,You can always tell a certain manager's favorite because they'll be doing nothing along with that manager. But also when that manager wasn't working that day it would be fine. Everyone does their job efficiently.
good,my first time working in the fast food industry I learned a lot about procedure & the importance of consistency in food preparation
good,"A typical day here is very stressful. You don't get any breaks even if you're a high school student and worked over 5 hours. The management is very uprofessional. All the managers are like ""bestfriends"" so if one don't like you, all of them will not like you and the will give 3 days max on the schedule. The manager will not work with your schedule even if your in school."
good,a typical day at wendy's was awful. The management was very unprofessional. my coworkers had bad attitudes. the hardest part was scrubbing the floors at close and there was nothing enjoyable about working at Wendy's
good,"Wendys was a decent place to work, but the management had some issues and they didnt even give me my last check when I left to move to Florida"
good,"this store was a joke their they had no priors ive seen countless times were they made sandwiches without gloves their chillie i prepared in a disgusting way to a point you ask yourself is this legal.the management was overlooking so much, it ruined fast food for me."
good,"I was not a big fan of this work place, loud co workers, angry customers, unresonable pay, sent home early all the time supposedly because of ""Labor"""
good,"I learn patience,management is poor-  favoritism, co-worker's are lazy, don't like to clean or work,  hardest part of the job is doing my job and there job, enjoyable part is clocking out."
good,The manager at wendy's was rude and didn't know how to talk to the emplayees. They over worked us and always expected us to drop everything if they called us on our day off.
good,"At work I am typically on drive thru or sandwiches, and I enjoy sandwiches more as drive thru can get a little overwhelmed at times if I do not have much help from my co-workers. I learn multitasking and always trying to keep the customer happy with a smile on your face. The hardest part of the job is being expected to do so much extra work when I barely get paid minimum wage. The most enjoyable part of the job is having fun with my co-workers."
good,A typical day for me personally was 3 to 5 hrs while working a cash register. The management was poorly trained and everyone is unprofessional even with customers.
good,Always steady and always fresh food and friendly atmospher great place to work   laid back  ang great drive thr u time boss was awesome and always learning a hand
good,"The company seems to take your job history into account solely when hiring you but when it comes to actually working with you they seem to act like you are a complete idiot and know nothing. The training system is a mess, and the management team tries but makes some issues worse."
good,"It's a fun workplace but, there are no benefits offered.  I feel that this is not a job I can make a career out of.  I am ready to put my degree to use."
good,"How to serve  and satisfy custormer requirements"
good,"I myself have enjoyed working with these different type of company's. And also working with the customers and interact with as well, making them happy. As I work I push myself to get all the experience I need in life and maybe one I will have a business of my own."
good,"I dread going to work because the managers cause the employess to stress out. Lunch rush would go much smoother is managers weren't yelling at the employees during it, and in front of customers."
good,I liked my job there it helped me learned how to work in a fast pace environment. The only thing I didn't like was the co-workers that have been there for awhile and the crazy overtime they made me do when some called in. I would work from 9:30-5:30 but rarely get out on time. The co-workers that have been there for awhile were really hard on the new people that never worked before. They always expect us to know how to do everything on our know so it was hard to learn.
good,"Very fast paced work place, requiring lots of customer service regardless of your position.  Not an easy place to work   Must be available for all days and hours & quick call ins, no benefits or real chance for advancement."
good,"Work long hours and sometimes they'll forget to give you a break."
good,"Immediately upon being hired, I worked an average of 22 hours/week for 18 weeks. Then came the winter slow-down so my hours became less each week to 17 hrs/wk, to 14/hr/wk, to 4hrs./wk with no prior explanation as to what was coming. I continued to work, even on days when I was called in. During this 'slow time' the franchise continued to hire which meant they needed to train the new hires meaning there was less work for people such as myself who had shown eagerness and dependability and a great attitude. When there was no end in sight, and after a two - week period in which I was not scheduled at all, I inquired if the situation would be changing at all when it became 'busier' only to be told the GM did not think I was cut out for fast food. There'd been no communication from top down as to the on-going situation. There were no offers of working in a different department, nothing. There was an attitude shift by the managers towards me in that they were indifferent, not encouraging as they'd been in the past, etc. The writing was on the wall for me. I, first time ever, quit."
good,"Management was rude and unfriendly all the time, the most enjoyable part was going on break or going home. There was nothing enjoyable otherwise"
good,management fraternized with employees. Favorite employee were given the hours and didn't have to work. Very unprofessional workplace.
good,It was a really easy beginners job to work for and still go to high school during the week.  I would probably never work fast food again since I am looking to get our of the restaurant business.
good,"always now your feet "
good,I really enjoyed going to work on a daily basis although i didn't like the fact that they had three people working front desk everything else was fine. On a typical work day I would go in before it was time for patients
good,"Poor, communcication, inapproprate  as far as the balance of personal life and the balnce of work life. Very rude to customers. And constant fraternizing."
good,"I usually work mostly at dining room register and fry cooking and bagging, as well as dishes for closing shifts."
good,Nice Decent workplace where work was first customers were friendly coworkers helped each other out it was a nice job but the work hours were insufficient.
good,"great learning experience for someone not familiar with the service industry. fast paced, never an idle moment. high standards had to be met at all times with very little in the way of staff"
good,"I typically walk into work say hi to all my fellow employees take many customers orders, and by the end of a hard worked day I count up all the money we have made and put it into a deposit bag and go home. I could say what really goes on in the food industry but those are the negatives and those aren't as important until you experience it for yourself."
good,"Typical day at work; managers sit in the office on their phone until it got busy, then yelled at crew for not being efficient."
good,"Well it started early in the morning i cleaned the outside of the Wendy's once done with that i would stock the food and right after get on grill to serve some beef patties to our sandwich makers."
good,"There was not a typical day there at work."
good,The job requires employees to work as a team. Depending on the co-workers in that specific shift is how enjoyable and simple work will be in that particular day. The most difficult part of the job is keeping up with the costumers' orders but depending on the management is how hard or easy it will be.
good,Wendys is a fast food job which means your pay will not increase to much more then when you first start. The job is very fast paced so you as a worker much learn to be decisive with your decisions while pleasing the customer. I have enjoyed the year spent working for Wendys but even more so I am ready to expand my skills to another job.
good,"clock-in"
good,"My co workers are very polite but managers are very disrespectful talk to others co workers very rude . Always yelling and not talking with ""Respect"""
good,"I was a cashier, order taker, drive thru runner. I was also trained on the grill and sandwiches. I would take customers orders and cash them out. I provided great customer service and was a quick learner. I also was training for shift manager."
good,I really liked the people I worked with. A typical day at work was me working the front end as cashier. I learned how important it was to listen to the customer.
good,don't make enough money for all the work you do. management is terrible and depend on the employees to do most of the work.  the stores are nasty and not clean
good,"This job is okay if you are in high school , but other than that it WAY to much work for 7.25. Being the busiest store in new orleans , the managers dont care at all about personal problems and dont care about you as a person with only intentions to run the store and nothing else. Patients is highly recommended when having to deal with 1000 different personalities. This job is for a child not an adult .."
good,"Depending if would help open the store or walk in mid shift, I either helped set up for the day or took over for someone else. I learned great customer service skills and money handling. I had a great relationships with my many co-workers. The hardest of the job was not knowing the schedule from one week to the next. The most enjoyable part of the job would be have the fun relationships with my co-workers."
good,the food is good but the job itself is terrible there is no raises ever given really no chance to move up in the company and benefits from working here
good,"A typical day will be busy mostly summer time and winter time will be slow or somewhat steady."
good,"It would start at sanitizing my hands ready for work. Making sure that everything in my station was restocked and organized ready for the day's rush. I take people's order with great customer service and bag their order insuring that their order was correct. "
good,Typical day of work was to assist with food preparation the management staff was ok at directing people to complete daily tasks and cleanup but stuff still ended up piling on the closing staff
good,"Most employees call off sick and it results in doing double or triple the work than usual. I learned a lot throughout my year there, I would like to show off my true potential in a job where it can be appreciated."
good,Everyone cared how you felt but they didnt give full training. No one was on task. Didn't give much thought to trainees. A typical day at work I would be exhausted but everyone would be on there phones.
good,"Its an okay job if u like serving people. You get to meet new people, but most of them are very friendly but some can really rub you the wrong way"
good,Working at Wendy's wasn't the best job but it was suitable for the time. Customers would get very angry at times which could make the job a lot harder doing the lunch hours. I learned that even in the worst times you have to maintain good customer service at all times.
good,"drive thru's/ front registers "
good,"i worked with good co workers"
good,"ok place long hours not enough money , management Is good they will help work with your hours -some of them"
good,"Not enough hours wanted close to full time but, when asked it was not available."
good,The management was so rude and i left there numerous times crying
good,For the most part it was a nice place.I think that management should have made sure positions were covered. At three o'clock everybody leaves. Which meant it gets busier.
good,"Order taking, food prep, cooking food, your typical day at Wendys. Great for first job seekers."
good,Making people satisfied with their orders. Having lots of managers its hard sometimes..
good,"Complete tasks in a timely manor "
good,"Wendy's is a terrible company to work for. Working for them for five years was enough, Management was lazy, unethical and had zero concern for shady activities within this store, Overall horrible place to be employed long-term."
good,"Very diverse company"
good,A typical work day is stressful and uncomfortable. There is a lot of corruption going on in this company at least in the northern Michigan region. The hardest part of this job was the consent negativity. Everyone was always upset and demanding unreasonable things. The upper management and owners were often rude and deceitful. The most enjoyable part of this job was the flexible schedule.
good,While employed at this establishment I worked closely with customers. I was responsible for a till along with preparing the customer’s order.
good,"I like the job as long as I am using the income for working through college. However, I have coworkers who are not attending school and are barely scraping by on the meager wages provided. Although I know there is little room for increased benefits and/or wages, I also know that the ability for advancement is slim within the franchise at which I am currently employed."
good,"A typical day at work for me will be to process customer sales transactions and all types of payment by operating cash register and all applicable equipment, and ensure that all customers were happy with their purchase. I learned more about handling money in a fast pace environment. The management at the Madison and Harlem location was very unprofessional, and at least two managers would verbally harass me on a day to day basis. Some of the co-workers were also unprofessional, while others were not. The hardest part of the job would come about when people who were suppose to relive me did not come in time, and the lack of communication. The best part of the job was the interaction with the customers."
good,"A typical day would be telling people where they would be that day. I'd do prep work with employees, get the store ready to open or to close, do deposits and handle complaints. The manager of my store was not very good. The hardest part was being the youngest manager there and customers trying to take advantage of that. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with."
good,"A nice place to work, with good employees. Everyone works well with each other. I wish I received more hours."
good,i really didn't find working at wends fun alway somebody down my back when i already knew how to do the assignment but i did have some nice emplyess
good,Typical day of work includes general cleaning and lifting. Waiting for customers to arrive. Not much that i have learned that I already didnt know. The co-workers are fun to be around. I actually have met some nice people. No hard parts of my job. I love that i can eat half off.
good,"Work environment was good, management skills really wasn't up to where they needed to be. Also not enough hours provided."
good,"The 's were rude, one of the manager's refused to give me my last paycheck, their hour interfered with my finals, causing my grades to drop, and for the distance I drove there, my paychecks were for gas."
good,Co workers were lazy and complained a lot about how hot it was or gossiped. I felt like I was the only one working most of the time. Co workers were stealing chicken nuggets and fries constantly. I seemed to do fine working on 3 grilling stations and the deep frier. Did not get many hours except rush hour (about 12 hours a week). Floors were disgusting until I took extra time after shift to clean the place. Co workers were getting a lot of complaints about loud and offensive banter and nothing was being done.
good,It doesn't take a genius to do the work but it is a lot of wear and tear on your body for very little pay.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that the time goes by very fast when I'm busy and some of the conversations I over hear from my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is how sore my body feels from head to toe when I'm done.
good,"A typical day at work, openers come in and prepare all of the salads, drop a little bit of nuggets (spicy/regular) prepare bacon, prepare two chili's for morning and mid-shift/night-shift, bring all the condiments to the sandwich stations, make sure there is coffee ready before the customers area able to come in. Closers come in and take all the salads to the back on a cart, take the nuggets, and chicken to the walk-in, wash dishes, scrub the floors, take the trash and place it by the door as neatly as possible, clean underneath the sandwich stations, sweep and mop in the walk-in, clean the area of the sandwich stations, reset up the sandwich stations for the morning crew."
good,"Over the years I worked at Wendy's, I learned a lot in customer service, team leadership and overall how to keep going after a day gets rough. "
good,"Often understaffed, always low on supplies, employees are not reviewed on performance as often as they are supposed to be. Co-workers are friendly though often not trained properly. The workplace has taught me effieciency, multi-tasking, order of importance and planning ahead."
good,"Typical day includes cleaning the perimeters, stocking buns for the day, chopping vegetables, connecting and installing frosty machine before store opens. Grilling ""never frozen"" meat for sandwiches and deep frying chicken products and french fries for meal orders. Preparing orders for the customer to receive and delivering perfect product with a perfect smile regardless of your disposition that day. I learned grilling, sandwich-making, delivery in store and drive-thru. Management of shift supervisors was poor. Co-workers new the meaning of teamwork and understood the customer is the most important. Hardest part of job is making chili. Most enjoyable part is satisfaction of clearing a big lunchtime rush and just spending time doing a line-sweep."
good,"taking customers orders, how to handle money and to socialize with customers. management could have been better the managers were very rude, co-workers were very rude as well there were only a view that were easy to work with. The hardest part is when your job is packed and you have to take order after order and the customers start to get impatient. The most enjoyable was the break because you had time to relax for a couple minutes."
good,"I typical day at Wendy's was often very stressful. However, I did learn how to be cordial in a professional setting. The management was terrible, they were very hypocritical, never followed any of the rules and were very disrespectful at times. The co-workers were just as bad, they always brought unnecessary drama to work that did not help productivity. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the flow of things there, and the most enjoyable was when I got off. "
good,"Show up take orders wash hands make food hand out orders, finally dies down a bit clean, stop deal with customers, back to cleaning, stop deal with customers, back to cleaning. "
good,"The job itself is not that too bad, I love my job because I enjoyed preparing food. I have learned good team working and work in high pressure like making an order as short as 5 seconds for  a sandwich. The management is very poor, no incentives at all. For 3 yrs. I dont have increase a single cent. My co-workers are mostly young people like students but I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job is when the managers gives you more pressure in making the order too fast which is sometimes below our power. But I enjoyed preparing orders."
good,nice for a first job. Poor management. you learn basic skills of working in a fast food restaurant.
good,hard work fast pace enviroment with friendly management.hard to get promoted.
good,Insufficient working hours
good,It's a decent job but you don't get promoted as you think you should.
good,Your typical day at work was like any other fast food company to work for.
good,"A typical day at work was sandwich-making, grill hamburgers, cleaning washrooms, washing windows, taking out the garbage."
good,"Any fast-food resturaunt is a challenging environment, with minimum pay and difficulty moving forward."
good,I worked there for a little over a year. It was alright except I didnt make enough money.
good,"on most days we are moderatly busy , this excludes the first two weeks of the month when we get super busy. A normal day at Wendy's for me in to clock in , stock whatever the person on the shift before me left unstocked , clean my station and take orders as they come. The hardest part of my job is just dealing with the amount of poeple that come through the drive thru and are rude. Fast Food is by far the hardest work out there I believe, between dealing with the stress of a busy day and the stress of un-happy customers. Working at Wendy's has taught me alot of patience , problem solving and thinking on my feet. Our managment actually has changed alot in the last month, but our GM has always stayed the same. Managers consideration depends from person to person. Some managers will help out and work along side us and others just stand , watch and dictate."
good,In my opinion the franchise i work for is not one i would recommend if you are trying to advance in a company. It can be a fun place to work if you have a more relaxed management crew.
good,"The hardest part of my job is having to work with teenagers. My co-workers and I get along, but there is a high turn over rate, so alot of employees don't stay working there to long! I work for a management team that is unprofessional. What I have learned from this job is that you have to work hard no matter who your co-workers are or whom your management team is. Always do your best."
good,Hard working. Co-workers were very nice and friendly. Management was rude and hard to work with-minus a couple of them. Hardest part was extreme rush (large crowds all at once). The most enjoyable was getting a break.
good,"A typical day at work was like a sea-saw; one minute everything is up, then the next minute everything is down. I learned how to work at a fast, but accurate pace. Management was good as long as the manager wasn't in the same age group as the crew members. Some co-workers were lazy and just lounged around doing nothing for their paycheck. The hardest part about the job was working with people that didn't support the restuarant by doing their part. The most enjoyable part of the job was me meeting new people."
good,I like the people. The hardest part is working with people who don't like to work. Some of the management is fun to work for. Having respect for co-workers is a plus.
good,"you learn really good work ethic though. crazy nights on proceed nights, management for the most part sucked."
good,I normally worked cash register taking orders and completing transactions. I learned new things almost every day preparing or learning new food recipes. The coworkers were fun and outgoing and it was a team effort. I loved the consistent customers that came in to keep me busy.
good,"Overall the company is ok, management communication is mild pertaining to work duties and scheduling. As far as respectfullness sometimes it is very poor communications from managers to employees is very much unprofessional. The work in general fun fast and challenging."
good,There was much playing herethat yes makes work fun but not good for bussines. My boss played around more then everyone there. They cut my hours thats why i did to get another job
good,The job was by far the easiest job I have every had. It’s really hard to mess up there. The managers were nice and flexible with the hours. There were a lot of people working there so it was always someone wanting to get your hours .
good,Spent the year working as a field service technician for the Wendy’s  NYC metropolitan area.  The work is difficult because of the area. You spend a lot of time driving between sites because NYC traffic.
good,It's a good job too. You can see get a bunch of hours. Just have to get the right crew of people. For example- hostel environments. Like going to high school.
good,"I worked at Wendy's in 2 different locations. Multiple times. The main reason I would quit, is the atitude that most the managers had towards the actual employees. There were some really great managers that helped and guided you. But other ones were downright rude. They discriminate and you cant do anything right at first. Especially when there's relatives."
good,"One big issue I had is my paycheck was messed up often, I have had not many people try to train me the right way and I am still not 100 percent comfortable with everything there after being there for over 3 months now"
good,"I was worked for shifts I legally should not had been doing according to my age. I had to close on weeknights, dig into urinals, and was treated with disrespect by others."
good,"I set off the alarm, no was there even thought people were already supposed to be there I got fired even though I used my owe people to get to code to shut it off because the cops could not get a hold any mangers or the big boss or even the alarm company I used a close friend who used to be a manger there shut it off and got fired for it"
good,This was a good starter job and a good job to get when needed. Otherwise i do feel this job does not have many chances to move up or make a career out of.
good,Need better training and work hours and not be so disrespectful to they workers and not just throw them out to the wolves like they just know what to do
good,Was easy to work and the environment was positive and conducive. Unfortunately it didn’t offer the flexibility or pay I was looking for and wasn’t something I wanted to do in the long run.
good,"yep. if your fresh out of school, and need a job, Wendy's is a pretty good employer. They hire from within, but not exclusively.  Say goodbye to free time however, as scheduling is crazy, and there is not much wiggle room on scheduling."
good,It’s a franchise and the owner only cares about the dollar. Not having proper equipment to do the jobs required was very annoying. There’s No employee appreciation no real growth no benefits unless you are a GM.
good,the team i worked for was friendly but they didn't pay enough to live. was forced to move out of provence to obtain a living wage. I wanted to advance in the company but no opportunitiesé
good,"Well the team work makes the work place great but the store is so unorganized, inconsiderate. You feel great by making the customer's happy or with a simple compliment or smile ."
good,"Fun fast paced job with lots of high stress levels. Poor management issues when communicating with fellow employees. Decent pay with good hours, bounce around from station to station when needed."
good,it’s a good first job it will teach you to strive for more in life . i just want to do excel and do better in my life  i know with a better job and more hour and pay i’ll be able to accomplish more in my life . i’m a hard worker and i learn fast so i want to find something new and better to do
good,"I believe that it was my specific Wendy's that was not a good work place to be in."
good,Great fast paced job. Must be able to multitask. Opportunity for small advancement. Very flexible with individual needs. Great for a second job and or first if needed and more hours were available.
good,"Taking customer orders, cleaning, and preparing food. This is a job for students in school.  the hours are not full time, the management is flexible with scheduling."
good,"Very fast paced, willing to multitask, learn how to keep mouth shut regrading rude customers. Customer base there is upper class. Open to always learn something new"
good,"I was paid 8.05 to man the cash register and occasionally work the fry station. Cashiers are expected to take orders, assembly of the the to-go/stationary orders, cleaning, re-stocking and preparation of fries/drinks/chili."
good,Staff is nice and friendly when serving customers. Manager is very loud and rude when talking to staff and customers sometimes. Overall store is clean
good,working there you have to be free a lot if your a high school student they don't really care they will schedule you when you have classes unless your good with the boss but other than that i do enjoy working there your coworkers understand and help.
good,I would work there again if I could.I like a fast paced job. The crew all help out and get the job done .it would be great if the pay was more but besides that its a good job
good,At Wendy's you can't get stressed easily especially when you have a lot of orders in drive through or people at the front. You have to stay calm and get the correct orders for the right people in a fast manner.
good,"Its a good job for a student, but if its stability and consistency you are looking for, Wendy's is not the ideal choice. I learned a lot about how fast food restaurants work and in general, we're all a family. Lots of good memories."
good,I will never ever work here again they dont want to believe u over a girl that has only been then for maybe 3 month and when I even there for over 3 years
good,"My district manager made this seem like a dream job! I was promised a work life balance, less stress and actual help from upper management. Instead, upper management made promises and failed to uphold their end. Lack of professionalism and had their favorites."
good,I learned a lot of my cleaning skills from here. Management was ok not at its peak. Really was tradition how we ran the company. The most hardest part was deck brushing the floor late at night. what I enjoyed the most was learnig how to make something new and then get to try it.
good,"It’s a decent job. At first everything may seems fast but once you start working and learning, it’s really easy. Patience is key always key. The management is very supportive & they help you understand everything."
good,"A typical day at work"
good,It is a good job to have for your first job. I don't particularly like it. It gets stressful after a while. Coworkers and customers can be a bit much to deal with.
good,Fast paste job. Very busy and many tasks to fo in one shift. My pay was amazing foe it to be fast food. And the crew and management was excellent. I enjoyed it.
good,i found better opportunities a slow paced low paying job i was fresh out of highschool needed a job as soon as possible but i ddnt let anything get in my way i worked my tail off for that job
good,"The head manager has no clue what closers have to deal with work wise, management wise or customer wise. The closers are treated like dirt and day shifts treated great. No benefits other then 15% off your meal when you are working."
good,"The only thing I did not care for as relates to working for this company was the poor management and lack of customer service. I believe in providing quality food, and service with a smile and this was not something the management and other employees valued"
good,"I worked to hard and long for a small amount of money, learned how to work a cash register, wasn’t nothing hard about the job, seemed like the manager didn’t care about her employees, didn’t give us enough breaks and barely wanted to give them to us"
good,I worked there for about a year and a half and didn't get a raise until I was a year in and was always on time and made it to work most the time unless it was an emergency and my raise was only .50 cent from what i was already making and i was one of the hardest workers there and management was bad so I eventually left.
good,not a god place to work over all. the people there are not good at team work and no one protects you from costumers that harass you. also the training is not vary hands on.
good,"I actually lovef working at Wendy's  your experience  depends on the location your assigned, management, and team members. However hr owes me for one day of work and has mot and refuses to pay me due to me not knowing the exact day i was transfer to new location. They will run camera back as far as they need to prove you stole but not to prove you earned a payment"
good,Very poor management. Very poor customer service provided by management. Decent work environment if there were different mangers. Favoritism runs high in the Tell City location by management.
good,"The job itself was alright, management wasn't the best, no notice whatsoever when laid off. Needed more communication throughout the management levels."
good,"I used to love the job, but i barely received any hours. My paycheck is so little in amount. I deal with people always having bad attitudes and rude manners. Zero respect. I only get about like 14 hours in a week. The manager acts as if shes still a teenager at the age of 43 or so."
good,Too fast paced for your average starting worker but decent for someone who needs a part time job for college or high school. Management is on hand but is usually busy most of the time and will most likely be unavailable when needed.
good,Wendy’s has a great concept of giving out fast and fresh food. The management at my store was very hostile and passive aggressive. There was no actual training on the job and many time the employees would not show up when they were scheduled. I would only recommend working here to someone who needed quick money or a job right away.
good,Wendy’s is a fast paced work environment and runs smoothly if you are focused on the goal and work as a team to complete the needed tasks. It can also be fun at times when you work with the right people.
good,"Helped me learn with consistency. I was treated fairly just things felt hectic more often than not but fast food, food business period; can be that way."
good,"Great job for teens or as a second job.pay won't be worth it for long term unless you're mgmt."
good,A lot of people quit because they are not treated well. The particular Wendy's I work at just isn't fit. I also didn't like working there because I did not like working somewhere hot.
good,When I first started at Wendy's I loved it. But when the store came under new management my hours were dropped to the bare minimum and I was forced to get a 2nd job. After I got my 2nd job the new store manager would not work with my other work schedule. Had me coming in way before I was even off at my other job then wanted me to work for s whole 2 weeks in a row without a day off. Talk about ridiculous! I'm still trying to recover from the physical strain it put on my body. And on top of that you could never get a manager to give you your employee meal so we would end up getting in trouble for eating. And God forbid you wanted a smoke break lol.
good,"management is very bad not cooperative at all. "
good,I love working at Wendy's they judge u bout your life  very fast paced my kind of work was very nice I didn't like that they will yell at you and it was ok
good,"District management often visits and tends to cause more issues then they solve, stock issues exist and constant work place drama takes place. most workers are not paid enough, treated fairly or trained properly. its not the job you hate its the management n lack of training, workers are enjoyable but for months there has been an unsolved management issue, If your one who cleans n works hard they will expect more from you then appreciate the work your doing. There is no recognition for those who work hard, there is no real training and your to blame if you dont get it."
good,i think that this company is great to work for if you are looking for your first job or just want to make a few extra bucks but nothing more there inst really to much room for advancement.
good,"This was a restaurant job I had in high school.  It is a high turn over of employees, due to the management at this company.  Not a place I would want to return to."
good,"On a typical day, you would prep food, handle orders, make food, clean. the hardest part of the job is definitely the customers, they are very impatient and rude."
good,"Not a bad place to work while at school or studying, I didn't enjoy working full-time there as it was repetitive and I felt like I needed more of a challenge. I did meet some great friends there too."
good,"If it wasn't for the management at the store I work at currently, it would be great. Plus at the store I work at I'm a closer and most of the night shift people are quiting because of the treatment we are getting."
good,They schedule you without asking you your availability and if you're willing to give away your entire weekend to do shifts that no one else would like. I worked in Scarborough Kennedy and Ellesmere location.
good,"not enough raises, understaffed, and often obligated to work multiple positions. you do get 50% off a meal under 10$ 1 time a day and shifts are always different which gets old"
good,"I learn how to make sandwiches, greet the customers, coordinate the food in drive -thru and take orders on the cash register!Management was awful after a period of time. My typical day at work was stressful knowing I had to keep the timer under 100.The hardest part of this job was dealing with some of the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with some of the customers and putting a smile on their face whenever we got their order right and when they got hot fresh food."
good,Wendys you were over worked and under paid. You had to work in hot weather with no air conditioning. There was no security at all. Super stressful especially when busy
good,it was fine i worked on the register i learned how to flip fries and i learned how to make sanwhiches. I worked after i got out of school and on days i didnt have to go to school
good,"Wendy's is your typical fast food restaurant job. Fast paced, always moving, non-stop. Never offered breaks to their employees and would get agitated if you asked. It's a solid part time employment, but long term is definitely a no go."
good,I had a hard time getting along with most of the staff because of chemistry clashes. Management did not allow flexible hours for any reason. Taught me how to work with people that clashed chemistry with myself.
good,"It's an overall good place very quiet, can always finish your food with no rush, although I am not a big fan of the food it's a great place, you can always watch TV I don't know if in all but mine for sure have a few flag screens up so us the customers can enjoy while having a meal."
good,Not enough wages to make a living. Overworked and not enough pay. No lunch break or any kind of break working seven hour shifts. Good enough for a college or high school student but not an adult.
good,"it was h.e.l.l, i was told to do many things and was patronized for not knowing how to do other activities. even though i was open to learning. some of the employees are great. However, a lot of them are not only rude to you, but to the customers as well."
good,"Poor management, rude customers, (depending on which store you work at) Cutting hours, competitive hours.. )  Less service. Everyone stands around NOT working."
good,"My first year there was pretty great, everyone got along great and it was actually a fun place to work at. However, I had to leave because the managers were unappreciative and wouldn’t really help when we would get busy. Too much negativity was there, work started getting harder and harder to go too. They maade no effort to improve the place so that the employees were happy. Another thing they don’t even give you a free meal while you’re working. Getting a raise was also another impossible task."
good,"A typical day working at Wendy's would consist of very fast paced working, keeping an eye on the timers and food,  positive attitudes and positive coworkers."
good,"i am not getting enough hours. 5 hours for a week is not enough for a n international student. There is no other problem, staff i nice and cool. Great environment."
good,Overall I really like this job interacting with the people. Making there food and also making sure my station is clean and sanitary. the customers are nice and so is the staff
good,Its alot to deal with no time for personal things like family kids. Every day they want you to come in or state late. It is a shame so many call out because people olare over worked
good,"It’s a good first job, I feel like now it’s time to look for better opportunities. I would like to be proud of what I earn and what I do for once, this is why I’m looking for a different job."
good,"Some of the managers don't seem to care. The work suffers when the upper management only cares about getting the orders out, not about how well things are working in the kitchen."
good,"It could be great if the company didn't stress that you focus on making them look good instead of doing your job. All about making the big wigs look good. It wasn't all bad though, It can be enjoyable if those around you make it enjoyable."
good,"Wendy’s is a great place to work, always laughing and having a great time with the co- workers. On busy days , management can get a little too pushy with the employees and too loud ."
good,"Managers didn’t care about their jobs or you. Every day was the same, and there were no chances for advancement. People would be late and nobody would say anything. Management didn’t enforce punishments for lazy employees."
good,“GM” has a very bad attitude she can be very rude most of the time and the Co-Manager has a very smart mouth that is not tolerable at all both of them are very rude People
good,the work wasn't the problem but the crew wasn't the best a lot of unnecessary gossip the management wasn't the greatest a lot of being late and letting some workers get away with a lot
good,I’ve been working there for 2 years now and I started out at a cashier and worked 5pm-10pm and those were play hours for school but now I’ve been moved to order takes in drive thru and the hours range from 3pm-1am and those hours hard to manage school and work and it got very stressful being up that late at night.
good,"It was a fast paced environment which is something that is par for the course in fast food, but the thing about it was that they didn't care if you were sick or injured yourself at work....you had to be there."
good,"The first month was fine but after that things went downhill, my boss was calling me during school, I had no time to do anything, the managers had no idea what they where doing and my schedule was slowly shrinking up to the point where I worked only 5 hours a week"
good,"Very stressful. Hungry all day waiting to get off to eat. Managers think they got all the sense. too many young people in one environment. low pay. its always hot in there. you cant eat unless your on break, but you will never get a break so the jokes on you."
good,I love my Wendy’s crew it was an amazing job always helped me out and looked out for me although I wasn’t making enough to live. A great job to have on the side while young
good,"A typical day at work would require lots of frustration , but I always managed to get through them without anyone knowing my frustration. I learned that no matter the situation at work inside a fast food or any work place customers are always right and situations should always be handled in a very respectable manner. The management started off good then I guess once everyone got comfortable , they begin to use foul language loud enough for customers to hear that were hiring very rude people , so to me that was the hardest part of the job trying to stay calm with the customers and my sometimes rude co-workers. But most of all I can say the good always out did the bad I had amazing days and night at wendys . I love and miss my crew ."
good,Managers aren't the best. Decent work environment. Coworkers get along good. Easy work. Decent pace. Corporate is willing to help with any issues and very helpful
good,"The Current Franchisee that I work for is stressful, with expectations without the investment.  They expect A level operations without the proper support from upper management.  I haven't seen my DM do a walk thru of my store and my DAO has nothing to say except negativity without coaching.  I feel like they expected me to do the impossible without the education that goes behind it."
good,Been with the company for about 4 years. There is no training. There is no support from higher management. Outdated computer systems. Outdated facilities. Doesn’t offer competitive pay so keeping a full crew is impossible. Definitely would not recommend for anyone to work for this branch of Wendy’s.
good,"In my experience, management is constantly being switched around and they all want different things done different ways, it was very inconsistent and stressful for crew memebers. Employees were favored even though they claim they’re not. Hours are very inconsistent one week you’ll be working 38 hours and then you’ll get dropped down to 23 hours the next week. Management never like to give out breaks for any of the employees and if they do give breaks they’re only to the people that smoke (which are mainly the managers)."
good,"The AC never works, you will work frustratingly busy shifts with seemingly no end in sight up until 2am, you stand all day for poor pay and 50% off meals but only while you're working/in uniform,"
good,Poor management. Poor training. No real direction. I love working with my team but not my managers. The crew’s poor training reflected more than it should.
good,I   work  hard . We are always  besy do to the location . Working  together  makes  it  easier . The  hardest part of  the  job  is when we don't  have  enough  people
good,The Wendy's location that I had worked at had overall poor service. Everything was unorganized. The people working there were mostly kids who had no idea what they were doing half of the time.
good,The manager wouldn’t have the patience to teach you the proper way to do things had to learn on my own or ask another worker. you would have to keep track of your hour to make sure you were paid the correct amount. If I didn’t work until closed they would send me home early. And if there was a rush they would take the other cashier off to do dishes.
good,When I started at the Wendy's they said a lot of thing that didn't happen for example they sell dreams that never come threw. Work you hard cut your hrs without consulting you. I mean is a okay job for high school students for part times but for a adult with children you will nevr make it.
good,Could be better with a better general manager .. help other succeed instead of feeling threatened that someone younger can take your spot .. also be fair if it’s 1 it has to be all not do more for just one ..
good,Difficult to please the manager no matter what you did. I sometimes got off after 1AM & had to be back to work by 6 AM the same day. Very stressful & tiring especially with 2 toddlers at home.
good,"I left wendy's because they were asking me to put in hours off the clock, after closing.  Last time knew that was illegal and frowned upon.  Even though the people I worked with were nice, I would not go back"
good,"The store manager was not trained or prepared for the position of store manager, the crew was treated properly, they need to get new people in to there stores. Working with the crew was always a good experience, can't say the same about the management team."
good,"Working at my Wendy's was a stressful environment. We had poor management, and being able to train another individual was difficult, because even on slow days, I cannot help others learn different tasks because the manager would not allow it. Seeing others favorite other individuals more was saddening, because they would be allowed more breaks or days off more than others, and it's just entirely unfair."
good,"I loved my job but the mangers were nasty, I asked for three months if they could change my schedule they never did, people were really lazy but I needed the money!"
good,I’ve been at Wendy’s for 4 years. It’s my first job when I turned 16 and still in high school. Over these years I’ve expiercecd both good and bad times. One thing that bothers me the most is how people treat on another including employees attitudes towards customers.
good,Hectic place but fun place to work n learn the company.the customers are great n the food is better...it has flexiblehours for anyone in school..the schedule is hectic but flexible
good,"Lots of arguing, not enough workers per shift. Great team when it comes to working together. Definitely do not get paid enough for work out in. Strict managers !!!"
good,"I started at Wendys just to have a job untill another came along but stayed for 3 years and became a manager, within that time I moved between stores and realized that the stores were ran by incompetent general managers and the district manager didn't like to help much, if it's only for the summer it's a great job."
good,"Wendys is not all as good because , night shift never has there people they need ,don't  want to pay over time, & cut hours when your make a simple mistake."
good,"Working at Wendys had its pros and cons, its a really great job to start off with to try and gain knowledge with, long term wise it is not worth working their."
good,The store I worked at was a mess and made me never want to eat there again.  Very unorganized and would lose valuable things. The co workers I had were very friendly and easy to work with.
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy’s but I found out really fast that working there was for individuals who were younger or still in school I didn’t care to be around individuals who didn’t take the job serious.
good,Wendy’s was an experience to the work force of the real world. The establishment was always productive no matter slow or busy. The customers were most likely to be satisfied 95% of the time. However the management is not so great. When scheduled to be off you’re probably called in or when scheduled to work you’re probably sent home because of to many members on the shift. That is poor management because it messes with people hours and their money.
good,A typical day at work is working at the drive-through and front cash register. Cleaning and washing dishes. I learned that during the rush hours one needs to stay on top of things. The management was nice. The hardest part of the job was understanding people ordering in the drive-through. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers happy and helping fulfill their needs.
good,"As an employee at Wendy's you will eventually run every area within the restaurant. You are either a sandwich maker who makes all the ordered sandwiches, or you run the fryers which make all the fries, nuggets, homestyle and spicy chicken, or you make sure there is enough beef patties to go around by running the grill, or you could be the one taking orders at the drive through, and lastly you could be running the register inside the fast food chain itself. No matter where you are you depend on your co-workers doing their assigned tasks so you can focus on doing your job."
good,"Managers did not allow me, a minor at the time of my employment there, take a break after being on drive through for hours, and would not allow me to switch stations even though I clearly expressed how stressed I was and how it wasn't fair that no one else had to stay on drive through for eight hours at a time."
good,"It was a good first job! I learned how to deal with rushes and how to multitask. It got really hard when I had a big line of people ordering and I had to get orders ready. I also did drive through sometimes, I liked that I only had to get drinks, that job was hectic but I learned so much. One thing I think they did was shorted me on paychecks, I would work 20 hours a week at least and every 2 weeks I only got paid 250 and at Papa Murphy s I was making almost double for the same amount of hours."
good,"Typical Day: You get to work early and look at the environment for the day (Is it busy? Relaxed? Dead?). This will dictate your day."
good,Working at wendys can be very fun but  lately has very much gone down hill. They do not pay good and they ask the most out of their workers. It used to be an amazing company to work for. In management you are on call almost all the time not much time for family.
good,"Its a very fast paced environment so you're always moving, never resting unless you're on break. Management was very unorganized and was not consistent with hours and days off."
good,"I won't go into it too much.  But lets just say that the hours fluctuate and the manager gives a lot of favoritism to certain crew members. the only benefit of working for this company, is food discounts."
good,I have had 3 raises since working there for two year and still only make under 8 dollars but people on their first raise already make more and it’s not because I don’t do a lot there I’m a hard worker and alas cover shifts and help to stay and I know every position
good,"Not the worst place to work. It is very boring when you get 40+ hours a week, but the upside is you can make a lot of money if you have the courage to waste all your time in the greasy kitchen."
good,I believe it was a good first job . I learned a lot of things and met new people.  The management was great they were all nice to me and taught me a lot of things
good,GREAT place to work at just get the right people . A lot of people get taken for granted that’s why you lose good hard working people. This job can really become something great
good,"Working at Wendy's is like working anywhere. It is a normal fast food experience. You go to work, you do your job, and you go home. The job is pretty simple."
good,Management treats their employees like they're less than them. But i did learn i work better in a fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers. You develop a bond with them because you're working together to improve your work environment
good,The job here was fine until the store was bought by a commercial owner. She refused to let us get over time and was trying to get the full time people to quit so she didn't have to pay. She refused to give annual raises and stated that we got raises when the minimum raise standard was raised. I worked there for 2 and a half years at minimum wage. The only raise was if you were promoted to management but that was still overworked and underpaid.
good,"they don't have benefits at least not when i worked there back in 2016."
good,"Great place to work if you're a college/highschool student. Flexible hours, pay is decent. Management at the time was pretty good. Not sure about now."
good,Everything starts out so great until boom they lie about giving you your raises. They even have managers who’re so unprofessional to the point many employees have decided to leave.
good,The hours are inconsistent making it hard to work around a schedule. The customers also do not know how to treat the employee's and think it is ok to disrespect them
good,Wendy's was a job I experienced in high school. At first they worked around my schedule then wanted me to work extra hours even though I had to study and do homework. Overall the employees were great but management could have been a bit better.
good,its ok just not my type of work place but I feel as though the management could be a lot better n crew trainers need to teach n show their trainees the right way to do things thoroughly the first time so they know exactly what's expected of them
good,I was unable to grow within the business and it wasn’t really for me to be able to rate it. The people there were good to me and it was easy job. I just wasn’t happy there.
good,"a typical day would be fast, non-stop working, stressful, and etc"
good,"Under my district manager it was unacceptable to be a single parent and have legal obligations, was told there was no room for me to grow, never acknowledged for good performances or sales. Negative criticism followed with negative communication. "
good,They don't want to promote with in..I worked for them for 10 years in 4 different stores and never got to be manager..I was good at my job.. M-f 7-5 never late always early
good,The worst part of the job has to be the lack of hours. The best would have to be the very few kind people. They would definitely be one of the few reasons that has kept me there.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. However the General Manager did not help the workers. That being said some manager were great. The is a good place to work if managers were hands on.
good,This job provided me with the opportunity to grow as a young adult & also allowed me to learn responsibilities with money handling. Taught me how to communicate with the general public.
good,"Overall the job wasn’t terrible. I started at 17 years old and got paid minors minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which I don’t think was fair since I did the same amount of work as the other crew members who made minimum wage. The GM was biased towards the employees based on who he personally liked or didn’t. It’s an okay first job for a young person looking to get some extra spending money, but not a living wage kind of job."
good,"Working for any fast food restaurant isn't rather favorable, although, it's tolerable. I believe everyone should have to work here once in their life for the pure humbling experience that comes with it. You get every kind of customer thrown at you, with hard work for minimum wage pay. Not to mention going home smelling like grease every day."
good,"It was a bad experience for the simple fact no one took a place to discipline employees. It was  a stressful work environment because I always had to pick up slack. On top of that, covering random hrs for no call no shows. Work late shifts and be requested back the next morning, leaving no time for rest. It was chaos long story short"
good,"The job itself was fun. I loved my coworkers and customers. The job is incredibly easy. The manager was unreasonable, to the point of not giving a schedule for the week and just telling us when to come in the next day! Also working highschool students past curfew. Don’t work here if you want to keep unnatural hair color/ piercings. Girls hair can’t even be shorter than her collar."
good,"It is a perfect job for someone coming out of high school or while still in high school,  very fun paced and energetic atmosphere,  pay was onto good minimum wage"
good,"I  think that everyone has different experiences working with fast food. If fast food is what you are looking for then this could be right for you. I did not think highly or some of the management and breaks or basic policies being overlooked. being bilingual (English, Spanish) helps a lot."
good,"I liked working there a t first, but I do not get any breaks unless I ask even then it pulling teeth  to get a break it makes it hard when you stand in a area for many hours a day and you see other co workers to for a smoke break. I like to stay busy, and they did syay busy there is always something to do there."
good,"So many things were not met to standards and anytime something huge came up like an inspection, we get worked like dogs because of all the laziness around the store during the day time. Some nights we'd stay two hours after close just to make sure the store was clean . Keep in mind without pay."
good,"Working here can be fun at days but it is stressful at times. You are required to do more work than you get paid at times because you have to handle several positions at one point. But overall, the work environment is fun to work in."
good,"Coworkers at fast food jobs have always given me a hard time, bullied me, or was extremely disrespectful. I didn't feel comfortable working in a group that was so hostile and had very bad attitudes."
good,"Wendy's isn't a bad place to work,the managers are decent and will usually  work with you on your schedule ,the pay is competitive in the field,the discount on your lunch is a plus."
good,"Great entry-level, part-time position for a student or someone looking to work a few days per week.  It is quick paced and there is very little time for training."
good,"loved the face paced environment and love meeting and talking to new customers everyday. manager was not pleasing and/or helpful or friendly. other that that, it was a good job"
good,"At the Wendy's I had worked at the management was very poor. I would be told to do one thing by one manager, just to be told not to listen to them by another one. Managers would verbally fight on the line. I personally got yelled at while helping customers at the window at least three times. I did learn patience between upset customers, multitasking because of others, and managers."
good,worked and didn't get a lunch break. There wasn't anything hard about it. management could improve on how they talk to the people under them..the most enjoyable part of working there is the coworkers and people who visit.
good,"I would work 10 to 12 hours a day.  I was in charge of opening the store, balancing all the money, making the schedule, doing our inventory and making sure the customers were well taken care of."
good,"I wouldn’t work here again but it was a decent experience, the manager wasn’t fit to be in that position at all but the overall experience was so-so. Pay was decent for being fast food, the discount on food was the best part. Hours could’ve been better. Better decision making should take place especially when it comes to who you’re hiring as a manager!"
good,"My manager at the time was a bit of a over looker of my job commitment and dedication, also i didnt get the hours i was looking for of a break in the required time."
good,There was just not room for advancement. Hours were up and down. Looking for a secure position. Looking for advancement opportunities. I would recommend the job to high school kids.
good,"This job was too fast-paced for me. Every time I'd make one little mistake, I would get yelled at over something that I didn't know or if I do something wrong. I didn't really like it as much and I felt as though I was treated a little differently than anybody else. I did like some of the managers, especially one of them who trained me with my job, but overall, it's too much for me. Fast food is too much for me. They say that fast food is one of the hardest jobs out there. They aren't wrong!"
good,"The management was terrible. Not professional at all. Managers didn't care, other co-workers took too many breaks. Wasn't clean as it should be. Didn't take care of customers how they should."
good,"not enough hours I only have short things to say about it. it was great getting free food sometimes and your always on the"
good,My review of Wendy's was overall an ok place to work. They pay u every two weeks. It was very fastpast and easy to learn quick was you can get used to it.
good,I did not like the job nor the pay. I was promised raises that I never got and my hours kept shifting up and down.  Management isn't the best and I would not work there again
good,descent place to work for a kid. not for an adult. poor management.atmosphere was ok. management team didnt really care for employees. weekly inspections.
good,"When I arrive at work, I`m usually greeted and a manner as if I was valued there. I close grill, so on top of the many thing I have to do I usually enjoy my shift"
good,"Wonderful food, nice work environment. Only  not enough work hours and the health insurance premiums are way too high.  The hourly rate should be increased."
good,Working at Wendy's has been stressful but they are flexable about my schedule which really helps out a lot. but with going to school full time and working full time it becomes too much expecially when the time comes for exams.
good,"A typical day was walking into a short staffed, over stressed store. I would get put on a position most of the time with no help and nothing stocked. I learned that upper management did not treat everyone fairly. The hardest part of the job was not having any help and getting yelled st for not going fast enough. The best part of the job was when I got to leave."
good,"This place is quick paced but easy to handle. The menu isn't very hard to learn and most of the people who come in, are regulars. Not much team work and lots of lazy employees. With better employees, the place could be a whole lot better. They're always willing to train you when there's no rush, that way you could take your time. Could be stressful at times but there's a few hard working employees that are willing to pick up the slack of others and help you when needed. The management aren't the best, but they're easy to work with."
good,Perfect job for s high school or college kid. Management  (all levels) is horrible and raises are scarce unless promoted or you can run drive thru very well or sleeping with manager. Free food is good.
good,"The managers are very rude dont want to give you any days off or change your schedule, no breaks we are always under staff and if you call out last minute you get wrote up"
good,I enjoyed the staff and working there. Then i was attacked by my boss because she had a bad day and didn't handle my mistakes well at all. I reported her then she was fired. Later i left for good after they asked me to stay because i didn't feel it was worth it.
good,It was an easy job but management was difficult to work with due to a manager having an interest in giving her underage daughter hours and making sure that she was above us.
good,"I didnt like working fast food. It was a nice job to have when you are in high school and new a few extra dollars to pay for your car, phone, etc. But it wasn't the place for me"
good,working at Wendy's was good in the beginning because I was being patient with the job even though it was things I didn't like I expected it to change over time but it didn't I had very little hours and the pay rate wasn't enough for the work effort I was putting in.
good,I feel we deserve a raise after so many day that we deserve paid vacations and time and a half on Holliday's. Sometimes I feel that everyone is not on the same page and it causes confusion and chaos.
good,Work is stressful and hard for what the expect out of the company. The standards are too high for a fast food restaurant which makes it stressful for both management and the employees making the hiring and quieting turnover very high. there is very little that enjoyable about the job no benefits and no free meal like most fast food places.
good,The managers are very rude and their food always half cooked. Some of the co-workers are always calling Off or show up late. There's also no rules being enforced there.
good,Considered me Full time but I never reached even 30 hours a week. The week i quit i only had 7 hours because i kept getting sick the week before hand. I fet like they were punishing me for not feeling well. I did however love the location i was trained at. They were friendly and acted if i was part if the team. But when I went back to my original location it was a whole different story.
good,"You don't know if your going to get a full 40 hours a week. The schedule is never the same and, they don't let you know that. There are teenagers always being hired and quitting. There's no encouragement towards promotions."
good,Have worked there for 3 years it great if u like working fast paced but would recommend it for a gigh school student or as a part time job for students. Just to start getting some experience and push your self in life.
good,It was a good day at Wendy's I was served like I wanted to. They make the best burgers in the world. The manager was right on doing her job. Thank you
good,"trabajar siempre con unba sonrisa , para hacer vienvenido a la gente"
good,The workplace culture has lessened over the past two years and does not seem very evident currently. Rules and traditions are no longer strictly enforced.
good,"Store and company was fine managers to young "
good,It's only a good place if u make it good it's stressful and the customer talk to u like u don't know what u doing so sometimes u have to keep ur cool always
good,The management was not going in the right direction.  To much of a stressful environment to try to focus on the objective. Certain procedures such as when employees are to take their breaks are not followed
good,"Wendy's would have been a great place to work for teenagers except, there was a lot of favorites and family members that worked in this location. I do not know how it is now, but they did right to get rid of the general manager. He was not someone worth getting close to because he had a tendency to be perverted towards pretty young ladies that worked there. On a good day, crew members were sociable with each other, but other than that it was not a fun place to work."
good,"While closing the store I had to clean, make food, clean the fryers with their oil boxes, stock, clean out the fry station, clean both sandwich stations, and I would help other people who behind on their work."
good,"I really recommend not to work for this company. I use to work for the one in Morehead City,N.C. The store is nasty people are not doing the right proceedure.they don't train there managers right.Manager talk to there employees​like trash store manager has attitude problem. I think the store needs new store manager and to be shut down.and that's only part of it"
good,This Wendy's was very unorganized. The managers were very lazy and did not want to do there jobs. We stopped receiving raises because we were owned by another company.
good,Good co works. Tough managers. Tough customers at times too. Good foods and clean environment to work in. But stressful and hard core quantity over quality.
good,I liked this job because it was fast moving and went by quickly for the most part. I was trained on every position and moved around a lot. This was hard but I liked the challenge.
good,It was a busy place and it always was slow. You really didnt have much help especially if you worked the front dining area. I love everything about the atmosphere and the customers it was just not enough money for all the hard work you do.
good,work was hard never knew what time you would get to leave each day. Worked 50 plus hours each week. No benefits other than 2 weeks vacation each year.
good,"This was fine for a first time job, but the work wasn't meaningful and there was no opportunity to move up or forward. I enjoyed the company of my coworkers but fast food employees in general are abused by the general public and are certainly not paid enough for what they go through."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is made up of a good hamburger and french fries on the side! I honestly believe that if you are counting calories and keeping your diet, this is the hamburger place you would want to visit. The work culture is really revolving around the story of Dave Thomas, who was adopted and ended up being successful at making a great hamburger that is safe to eat. Would you eat it ? "
good,This company specialized in showing you professionalism and great customer service skills. With flexible hours and schedules. With your determination and productive work ethic you will have no problem moving up within the company.
good,"good place to start your life, will let you hate yourself everyday working there, if you work from 7am all the way to 2am the second day they don't care."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wendy's, but me and my manager didn't get along because he wanted to talk while I wanted to work. I was trying to my money and go home. He wanted to socialized with every female and I didn't like that."
good,The mangers was not very professional. They played around a lot and mist of the time didn't do their job. Was not a very good work experience. Things may have changed because they hired new workers.
good,"-A typical work day for me involved going to work multiple times a day"
good,typical work day consists of maybe one or two people actually doing their job and managers don't say anything everyone pretty much does what they want to do
good,Giving me to many hours to work didn't get paid enough. Working Environment was not the greatest. But I would get free food and drinks and work with others
good,This place is very fun to work at. They train you very well. They care so much about their employees. They give ypu great fiscounts and help.
good,"In the first two years of working for Wendy's fast food chain was great."
good,As a previous co-worker at Wendy's it was a welcoming place. The co-workers are nice. One bad thing about it is the management is very unorganized as well as the employees showing up for their shift therefore putting people at the end of the day in jeopardy to keep everything together. Overall the employees vary between hard workers and one's who don't do their job as it should be done. I don't regret working there but I have to make a change for myself and get a better paying job that will benefit me and my family.
good,"I had an bad experience working here. Neither the management, staff, or customers were a blast to work around. The manager has favorites and the staff hardly followed directions. Worse job ever."
good,"Bad management,employees are very disrepectful. They talk to customers like they are there friends on the streets. The managers are very rude and do not take forth action when a problem comes there way."
good,I worked there for 2 and a half years. I learned everything in the matter of less than 2 month's. But the GM didn't care about anybody nor anything but making money and i was always wrong.
good,"When you start you usually start at back cash or up front. Most of my co-workers and managers were nice and friendly, but if you ask for days off or tell them you have a specific school schedule they do not always listen."
good,Wendy's was not a very good employer the work environment is terrible the only thing I enjoyed about working there was the people I encountered
good,"not the best place to work. management also isn't the best. not everyone works together to satisfy the customer. not every wendys is this way though, just the one i previously worked with."
good,"Honestly speaking, this is not a job that you will love for the first few months. The first few days are a brutal overload of information."
good,They don't pay you enough for the work you have to do in there if your a hard worker. Management was ok but this is way harder then Walmart and they started me off at 10.50
good,"Though I met wonderful people who worked alongside me, and customers, management was poor, but I've seen a change! The schedule wasn't usually as flexible as it should be fit for a student."
good,"Terrible Management, the experience can be described as being negative. The management was terrible, nobody cared about their jobs, and there was no culture."
good,"When I first started I was nervous, but I did feel comfortable after awhile because the people there made me feel wanted. However, there were times that I wanted to quit due to some of the managers being rude. My co-workers were very understating and they always helped when I needed it. After working this job, I now have better people/person skills and I am better at communicating when I need help."
good,Working here was ok when i did work m it kept me on my feet and i learned new things. Help me make my work ethics while at work it also made me stronger in customer service.
good,"Working in fast food is a fast pace, high stress job area. Often times, management will call on days off or before one is scheduled to have he or she come in to work. Many individuals call off or do not show up, creating more stress. Working here for a long time displays an employee's reliability and stamina."
good,They had no respect for work life balance and would continuously have me work a few hours and then send me home to come back for a few more.  I still have not received my last paycheck
good,"typical days at work is handling money, customer service, perfect smile and personality, and communications."
good,I loved my job at Wendy's and the customers. The only thing I didn't like was having a ride General manager. The typical work day was fine. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers.
good,"While working at Wendy's I learned how to work cash registers, prep the food, setting up the store, and how to manage my time and work. The typical day is it gets busy during lunch hours but it was easy most of the time. My co-workers were ideal to work with we all worked together and got along real well. The hardest part of the job was the unorganized behavior when the general mangers came in to the store. The managers would panic and create tension, aside from that though they were pleasant to work with most of the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was when my hard work was acknowledged, it made me feel good about my abilities."
good,A fast paced up beat work environment with a bunch of different attitudes some god some bad lots of favoritism shown but I just go to work and make the best of the day.
good,Could not stand it felt unappreciated low pay no raise or promotion after doing what asked to deserve one. There was no true team work put all the work on me and my friend no good came from this. Was fired for not getting a doctors note for having h1n1
good,"Typical day: Stocking, Clean dining room and bathroom, greeting and taking customers orders, and helping other co-workers. "
good,"Provided friendly, fast and quality customer service, while maintaining the store’s cleanliness."
good,A typical day is taking orders collecting payments and handing out orders. I leasrned how to work fast and how to deal with irritable/angry people. My co workers were helpful. Hardest part of the job is dealing with irritable/ angry people. The most enjoyable would be meeting and greeting customers.
good,"Good place for your first job, but little to no advancements. Can be stressful if you cant handle busy periods. Poor management but co-workers are alright."
good,I hated working here. It was stressful and management treated people terrible. They let the coworkers do all the work while they sat back and talked in the office. It was awful!
good,I can't speak for all Wendys. but where i worked was awful. The management was rude and did not care about their workers at all. They didn't believe in second chances after mistakes. Very cold environment.
good,"Management here sucked. I never wanted to go to work due to the ignorance there! I put up with it long enough. They had me working 6 days out of 7, without having me at at least 40 hours. On civic holidays they would have me come in for 3 hour shifts. One time they threw my work shoes out that I left in the crew room, where everyone else's shoes were stored."
good,"Working at Wendy's the last time around, management was changed and everything went down hill afterwards. The new manager wouldn't let me take days off for finals when I needed it, especially when I had school. They were very inflexible and when legal issues came up, upper management did nothing about it."
good,I worked at Wendy's when I was still in high school. I juggle both work and school and I loved every moment. I learned a lot of responsibilities from working and learned how important a little elbow grease was.
good,"store managers would feel they were entitled to a 9-5 job and would schedule accordingly, shift managers did more actual work making sure the store ran smoothly. staff would consistently cut corners at least in that respect they were consistent) after one month there I was already looking for a new job."
good,This was my first job. Some of the managers were horrible while some of them were great. High pressure during rush hour. It's a great job to have while you're going to school. My Wendy's in particular was very hectic during lunch time. You come out smelling like french fries and sweating. Don't stay here long if you can help it.
good,"Wendy's was a very busy Environment.  A typical work day would be me starting on the register for about 3-4hrs. I learned how to take on multiple task, and also a lot of patience. My co-workers and I got a long very well."
good,"Wendy's used to be a fun place to work. I had gotten two raises within the first 6 months I had worked there. But after my last raise, work began to have more bad days than good and I found it increasingly harder to motivate myself to go to work. As I started talking to my coworkers about it, I started to also noticed how I and a select few others were being treated differently than others by the same manager. Being yelled at and wrote up for the same things that other coworkers were allowed to do. I talked to my general manager about it and told him that I would give it a week for things to change and my two weeks were going in. Nothing changed and my two weeks went in."
good,"I've worked for this company for 10 years. In that time I've seen more faces than I can remember. Many friends have come and gone. Most days at work I keep the peace. Someone always needs help with something. There's always something to do, so you never get bored. My co-workers can range from people who don't have anything good in their life trying to get back on track; to people who need something to pay the bills. They're really good about working with your schedule so it's perfect for someone who's in school or needs to work around various schedules. There's shifts at all times of the day so it's very accommodating. The hardest part of this job is dealing with people who don't have the same skills as me. I'm able to    count change back in my head with ease. Speak without trouble, or sounding like I'm exasperated. Perform under pressure without 'losing it'. Whenever I face an obstacle I conquer it. I'm practical about my expectations; so those who don't have the same skills aren't made to feel less because of it. I teach others what I know so they can be more independent as well. The thing I enjoy most is I know I'm good at my job. Knowing my store runs better because I'm there; and I can handle anything that comes my way during the day.I'm proud to work at the store I'm in because it looks clean. We maintain everything really well and take care of our guests so they keep coming back. We have many regular customers; that says  good thing."
good,I greeted customers with a smile and took their orders. I also cooked and made sandwiches to order. Maintained a clean and safe work environment. I would close the store according to procedure.
good,"Management could change"
good,"Stressful at times "
good,"This is a great job for high school kids, however if you are looking to advance in your career this would not be the job for you."
good,I liked the job till the management changed. the coworkers at the location I worked at were I joy to be with just could not stand the work environment after the change in management.
good,"Working at wendys for 2 and a half months sounds very bad to say because of my short time there but during that time I ran into quite a few personal and family emergencies that required a lot of attention along with my school finals which I requested less hours for during that time but was guaranteed nothing. Multiple managers did not take initiative to help me with an issue I had been having with my pay and not receiving a pay stub and a few refused to speak to me about it. Leaving the job felt somewhat bad because I felt unreliable and not responsible but I also felt like they did not give me the time of day to entertain my questions, comments or concerns."
good,"The managers were the downfall of this branch. They had the worst attitudes toward the employees and didn't care if anything had happened to them. My father died and I had to fly out of town but they still wanted me to come into work. Although management was horrible, it was my first job and I had learned how to treat customers with respect whether or not im receiving it in return. I learned how to prepare Wendy's sandwiches, I learned how to clean the entire restaurant using different cleaning supplies and also took phone calls from customers. The hardest part but my favorite part of the day was the rush. when the restaurant fills with people... although its hard, i'm working instead of sitting and waiting and it makes my day more enjoyable."
good,"Working for this company is exactly what you make of it. It is what you would think of as unskilled labor. The goal of the company is to make money. This is an understandable goal. I was able to handle any and all positions within the restaurant. The management is good at working with what they have, for the most part. The turnover rate for a place like this is the hardest thing to deal with; both by employees and managers. Constantly training new employees harms morale and time. Both of these are extremely important issues in the world of unskilled labor."
good,Overall my experience was exceptional but could've been better do to the lack of service to customers and cleanliness of the store.
good,Start as a grill cook. later I would move to drive thru.. I used to drop meat and fries and at the end of my shift I would clean all areas.
good,i've worked here for a year and this company does not care about their employees at all. The management is horrible and they dont pay enough for all the hard work thats required.
good,"A typical day at work would be a routine. Clock in, ask manager the station I would work for that night, and then get to working! MY co-workers were very kind and respectful. They helped me a lot when I didn't know what to do, teamwork was their motto. I learned more and more about how to handle difficult customer situations. The management wasn't very good. They didn't work much and complained when a trainee would get something wrong. Overall everything, the most enjoyable part of my job, was seeing satisfaction in the customer's face, or even getting good comments on my type of service to them."
good,Hardest part of my job was closing it sucked alot of extra work. I liked the people i worked wiht besides they never worked as hard as i did.
good,"the crew are great, but the upper management needs to be retrained on how to talk to employees. They can be abusive at times."
good,"On the daily if you are a crew member your day will consist of either of the following. Working the drive-thru speaker, making sandwiches, working the registers or preparing food. I was often times working the front register and being held accountable of more than 3 dollars missing in the register. Often times I would work the speaker during peak customer rush times. I would transition from these positions along with making salads or preparing other food in the back kitchen, janitorial duties and product stocking. I would be assigned closing duties twice a week meaning I had to stay until 2:30 and stock all the items and maintain a clean work area all while taking orders until 2:00. I would have to clean all the frosty machines before leaving (2 in total) I learned how to multitask while working in a fast paced environment and to remain patient when dealing with problematic customers. The management was decent at first until I had to deal with a new general manager who was downright condescending wit her comments and direction. The assistant managers I had a good relationship with soon left along with the general manager and more unprofessional managers took their place. The co-workers were decent, a lot of young people working with high energy but a bit immature at times. other co-workers were older but helpful. The hardest thing to deal was the large amount of customers and we would often run out of atleast one product item daily and be subjected to customer backlash. I did enjoy that I would switch multiple positions in day to keep things a little interesting when it would"
good,"Being a minimum wage fast food establishment , simply is the reason I will not work for them again. The experience was alright, and while working for Wendy's I learned and gained experience. "
good,i had done allot of over time and training for this company and was not paid for it! management even tried to push for me to quit when they became aware of my pregnancy! just so company wouldn't have to pay for paternity leave!
good,Very welcoming and assisting to help insure a positive work enviroment and an organized work place. Management was very helping and willing to be flexible.
good,"The general manager treated me poorly. Only had me working 2-3 days a week at 3 hours a night, 5pm-8pm; due to back issues and not being able to stand for long periods. He was rude and treated me with disdain, looked down on me."
good,A typical day at work is very long and hard. I would get done most of the time on time. Then I ask to go. I think it was an terrible place to work.
good,"is  a nice place but some of the employee weren't good, I learned about fast food restaurants, the manager was a really nice person"
good,"My typical day at work would be taking orders for customers."
good,"well i didnt work that long, 4 hours at the most. the management was ok but not really. they wouldn't help that much, and they were rude. my co-workers were ok people, nice, helpful, trustworthy. the hardest part was learning not to get burned. the most enjoyable part was the slow paced work flow. what i learned was how to treat people nice, respectfully, and honest."
good,friendly customers and clean environment worked with cash and taking customers orders
good,this company was good to start with but over time they just don't use your skills enough to get anywhere with them.
good,"Typical day at work consists of me taking customer orders, preparing drinks, bagging, cashing out customers. There will be times when I have to prepare the food such as, cooking burgers, preparing sandwiches, drop fries/nuggets, etc. I've learned to multitask and maintain a clear head under pressure while providing positive customer service. Management is okay, but you can't expect too much from them since they have to be your boss first, and friend second. It's understandable. The co-workers are great, fun loving people who deserve more than they are receiving now. I guess the hardest part of the job is dealing with so called ""unsatisfied customers"" who use the ""customer is always right"" motto to manipulate the situation to managers/employees to receive a free meal and/or refund. The most enjoyable part of this job is to work with the incredible employees who posses great sense of humors and positive attitudes throughout the days."
good,"Something good to do while in school, I also met some great people there."
good,I would walk in punch in and start my day. it wasn't really a fun place to work because everyone talked bad about other people including the managers saying things as well. I think the most enjoyable part of my days at this job was taking orders at the front counter or preparing the sandwiches. I always just wanted to get into work get my job done and go home for the day.
good,Typical day at work is dealing with rude customer and rude management. What I learned from working for this company that in order for you to move up it the company its all about if the district manager likes you. The hardest part of the job is the managers talking to crew member any kind of way. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people and helping customer.
good,"This company under went new management, which resulted in a loss of hours."
good,"Very fast paced job, which I enjoy always having something to do, awesome people who you get to know that come in every day. The management was okay."
good,I learned how to be personable. This company gives great hours.
good,"Hardest part of the job was dealing with management"
good,i love my coworkers the hardest part was dealing with angry guest i learned that you have to push for what you want enjoyable part was th coworker
good,"We were typically very busy. "
good,"Well It was a pretty simple job, anybody with half a brain could do.The real skills challenge was dealing with the customers and making sure their orders were put together properly. The General Manager was the nicest boss anyone could have asked for and she did a fairly good job of running the place ,but on the other hand the other managers were the most rude unpleasant incompetent people Ive ever had the displeasure of working with.If you are working there don't expect to get a lot of hours."
good,Meeting new people everyday some nice some mean. I know every meal on the menu I know how to make every beverage on the menu. Crew/team good a little slow.The best part of working at wendys is 50% off all food.Worst things are the managers.
good,"I work majority in the afternoon where I have to closed the drive-thru. I learned how to talk to customers properly and cleaning out the frosty machines. All of the managers consider me as a dedicated, hardworking individual who is willing to do her work. My co-workers would describe me as a dependent individual that motivates them to get their job done. The hardest part of the job is closing everyday and no one else wants to close the restaurant. The most enjoyable part of the job is payday even though I'm not getting paid enough."
good,My typical day at work is operating a cash register and taking orders
good,Regular Fast Food working environment.  It's what you make it.
good,"Daily abuse by customers, but a fun environment most of the time."
good,"Fast pace work enviornment, I enjoyed the atmosphere working with people and being apart of the team. But, fast food just wasn't the place for me."
good,"Didnt pay very good. management were not worried bout working with employees, more like against them. hours could get cut if you made the manager mad at you."
good,"Working at Wendy's I thought I was going to stay and make a decent amount of money. This store I worked at was like high school, so much drama for no reason. I believe I had been set up because I am a competitive person. I do my job and the task I am suppose to do. Customers loved me. I never had a complaint, and I worked hard. The people that worked in this place are a little lazy. When drive threw was busy who ever had drive threw after the lunch rush was on their own. You had to take orders, prepare the beverage, take money, and coordinate your order on your own. When I had started I really didn't get trained properly. It was pretty much me on my own to learn. Managers chose favorites. The compensation for this job SUCKED ! I made more working at Cici's Pizza then I did here. I came in when called, I did my job and helped others out. I wouldn't recommend working at this store. Maybe the other stores might be better but I wouldn't recommend going to this store."
good,The environment was pleasant most times.  The management staff was good most of the times. The employees was not very pleasant when it came on to providing excellent customer service.  They did not care much about what they was doing.
good,"Not a bad working environment. Working at Wendy's has taught me to work with costumers and money. Sometimes there are issues with co-workers but we all learn to work well with each other. The hardest part of my job is dealing with negative people. My most enjoyable part of my job is talking with many other costumers, as well as handling money."
good,"like any fast food place , every teenage worker start here not the best but they worked with me around my school schedule"
good,There are low wages given after I worked there for a year I only got a 10 cent raise despite having worked diligently. People that were related to the managers got all the better raises and promotions
good,"It was an ok job for awhile. I actually got fired because I confronted a girl that was talking smack about my family and the manager told me to finish my shift then I was done so I said if you are going to fire me, then fire me now. I will never work for a company that said as soon as I work a shift for them that I was fired."
good,"while working for wendys they dont really care about their employees "
good,We are a very busy Wendy's and they have a hard time keeping people employed there. A lot of people don't show up for their  shift or call off.
good,Was a friendly environment was only work with wendy's until I joined the Marines.
good,"I learn to work with people a lot, that my co-worker and customer. The hardest part of the day is lunch time from 12:00 pm to 2:00 pm. The most enjoyable part of the day is when get my free lunches."
good,Fun knowlegable wasnt the perfect job but put cash in your pocket
good,"Rotated delivery truck, cleaning equipment and facility, doing minor cooking."
good,"As a crew member at Wendys, the goal was to provide the best customer service along with the best quality fast food.  When working at fast food, time was very important.  No customer should be left waiting for anything for a long period of time.  I was also a cashier, so I handled money which was an additional responsibility.  If your draw was over/short more than $5, you became liable to pay the additional amount of money."
good,I love the food that Wendy's offers.  Co-workers are hard working individuals.  The pay rate is minimal so that was what made me look elsewhere.
good,"Place were you can interact with customers and other employees, get the better understanding of a workplace, listen skill, awareness, and responsibility."
good,Yes. Do your job and do it well. You will still be a shadow of the things that go on. You can do great in that company. As long as you dont  try to be better then the crooked management. Wendys will always be a great place to work.  Food service is fast paced and busy. But be sure to stay above the influence.
good,"Working for Wendy's was just an experience that I had. I learned that you give what you get, but advancing within this company is slightly more difficult than with other companies. The hardest part of the job was pretending to be happy when I wasn't. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours that I got."
good,"Serving the customers and work efficiently under pressure"
good,"I made the most of what I did each day. The manager was bipolar with a capitol B. Other than that, it was a small regular paycheck."
good,"When I started at Wendy's in Fairfield, They had just fired 6 managers for stealing. I quit when the place shut its doors"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty smooth depending on the crew and manager. If we do not have a strong crew the day is going to be a epic fail. Working here i learned to be calm and kind even with the worst customers. I also learned to some what take lead. The managers weren't too bad, but they were lazy. Most of my co-workers sucked. They were also lazy and never wanted to anything. They always half stepped things and didn't care. The job wasn't really hard, just those times when we are busy and have no help. The most enjoyable part was working with the best nigh crew. They made even the busiest nights awesome. They rock!"
good,"Consistent moving of such fast speeds."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy especially during lunch rush hour."
good,general manager is not a people person rude with staff and definitly needs an attitude adjustment cannot handle pressure or being asked questions by employees other than that great place to work as long as you dont have to work with the general manager
good,they give me 4 hours a week for training ... how am i supposed to learn any thing ? and all the employees have poor attitudes
good,Poor management. They do not pay attention to the people that they hire and would hire just anyone. Managers also have an issue with anger and talking down to everyone that is beneath them. Management also fails at standing up for their employees when the employee is being mistreated by customers and other employees. They also allowed druggies to work as a manager!!!
good,Stressful work environment with too many young uneducated managers
good,"I would work around 20 hours a week. It was great because I would have enough time to go to school, but I wish I worked more hours"
good,"My typical day at work would be as soon i clock-in Stock everything if there are things that need to be stocked, then If I'm on drive through do my dishes, when those are caught up then i Help front cash with whatever they may need."
good,"A typical day at work for me would include me making sandwiches the jumping all around the store from position to position to cover everyones breaks. I have learned a lot from this job both good and bad but overall good such as safe food preparation, cleaning procedures, quality of food, and the experience of working full time in a face pace environment. Co-worker are scarce, many new hires quit within 3-6 months along with the more seasoned workers so i have never been given the opportunity to work with a full staff. That is also the hardest part of the job working full shift in where 2 people would call out and you just have to manage with out anyone being able to cover because of how short crew we have. The best part of the job was going to work with familiar faces and being able to joke around while working with a full crew."
good,"Hours suck, you get sent home if not busy, stuff keeps breaking, things go missing, and its falling apart. Wendy's sucks, but I need money."
good,"made sandwiches, run the grill clean store when slow run fry station"
good,Wendy's was awesome if you were a closer. Everyone was like family on night shift. The management was awesome. Everyone got along for the most part.
good,"I didn't mind a day at Wendys. The customers were mostly happy I love working with people so that was a good postition for me. My co workers were great and we all worked together. The management was decent never really had a problem, hardest part of the job was keeping up threw a rush hour."
good,"to clean the parking lot, cook the food for opening the store."
good,I would come to work at 4 am and get all the food ready for the day. Hardest part of my job was dealing with the customers who would come in very rudely and yell at me even though I wasn't doing anything wrong.
good,Everyone worked hard to get customers their orders correctly. Management was flexible and provided enough hours to all employee's.
good,get all work done at a fast and easy going pace
good,"The typical day of work at the Wendy's I was employed, was a very stressful. However, I learned a lot, as far as maintaining product for customers and working the grills. The management was below satisfactory other than maybe one manager. They showed favoritism before productivity when it came to scheduling also. My co-workers did nothing but complain, which also made it a negative environment. The hardest part of the job, was actually showing up for the job. Only because the managers made you NOT want to be there. The most enjoyable part of the job, was me resigning, and paychecks, occasionally."
good,"I arrive at the store, wash my hands put meat down on the grill start making orders as i hear them drop fries.I learn how to really work in a fast food place.The co workers was great at the time.However the hardest part of the job was the pay.The enjoyable part was learning the fast food ropes."
good,"If you're a teenager and you need some work experience, go for it. Minimum wage job and you're treated like a minimum wage worker."
good,A typicial day at Wendys was very stressful. I did my part as a Manager even though it became very hard sometimes. The store was unorganize complete from staffing all the way to upper management. The most enjoyable part was meeting new and exciting people on a daily basics. Regardless of what happens our customers get # one services.
good,"fun place to work part time,cooked and processed orders from customers ,assisted customers on thy cash register"
good,"Really don't care to talk about experience. some management was great, others very much not. Sometimes and enjoyable jobs other times not. Management would tend to mess with hours and that was difficult."
good,"I've been working for Wendy's for 8 years and I never really got recognition for anything, only the first three years. It depends on your location and work environment but my location's management team was not the best. I believe everyone should try working here however."
good,"My experience at Wendy's for me took a turn for the worst. Some past managers were rude and would take advantage of certain crew members because of the upper hand they had. Past General management was okay. Present managers are much better. Although, the General manager is rude. Customers have asked me who that person was and why she was acting like that towards you and the others. It's a good place for a starter job, just without the poor management."
good,I liked the job at first. The crew was very welcoming and it was like a family atmosphere in the shop but as I went on I noticed more and more flaws with the store and the management. And as I’ve worked there for the past 9 months the restaurant has gone downhill we lose a ton of staff because of managements incompetence and unfairness and it’s time  for me to explore other opportunities.
good,"It's a fast food place that only cares about themselves,the workers is what makes the store we have nothing to show for with our money or time .they work us like slaves for little money they can give you.not a good experience for me .better to file for unemployment"
good,Management could use some serious work. Better management to keep the work environment improving. Had a few issues with the managers creating problems between employees.
good,It is not the best place to work but not the best they will work with you to an extent but everyone has they're own clicks an the drama is beyond awful
good,The work itself isn't bad ..its the people. Some of the managers act like children and most of the employees have attitudes but I deal with it so I can get paid and go home.
good,They Tend to get agravated easily and yell at employees for no reason. When going in drive through you can hear the way the managers speak to the young kids. Super disrespectful.
good,"It’s a very interesting job. It’s will allow you to gain skills in lots of forms of Maintenance and food preparation. However, the only thing I would change is the pay rate because the workers do quite a bit."
good,"Good company to work for , just certain store is not the place to work very understaffed, employees not communicating, constantly busy with nobody to work."
good,The Managers Were Very Disrespectful Their Was Alot Of Favouritism The Enjoying part You Didn't Have To Have Long Hours And They Also Gave Short Really Short BREAKS.
good,"I worked at Wendy’s in Hampton Virginia and had many duties as a employee I have cooked, clean, taken orders, counted drawers, operated and cleaned machinery. "
good,i honetly think that the job is a great job for people that just started working. it isn't a hard job at all. there will be some problems maybe with custermers but as a employee you can always reason an take to your maneger if anything.
good,"My co-workers and (most) of my managers were great to work with. Some of the customers thought that “oh they work in fast food they must stupid” it gets really annoying, really quickly. Be thick skinned and be ready to clean everything on a constant."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's while in school, they worked great with my school schedule and gave me good part time hours. I enjoy working in a fast pace environment and pleasing customers. I enjoyed working together to get the job done."
good,"Clocking in, working, dealing with customers and clocking out. Really wasn't for me, however got me through school and pushed me to seek out other opportunities."
good,I applied for full time and they said they would but I got put for part time. I also asked for more hours every week my shift manager said yes and still haven given me any hours . Every shift manager has thee own rules so every is always getting into arguments because nobody knows and follows rules
good,"I was the cook and sandwich maker there, I took orders worked the register, restock condiments, trash runs, moped floors, washed dishes, and cleaned tables."
good,If you apply here you will be worked to your full ability. Management wouldn’t be the best at the job due to the managers and there intentions of working.
good,I do not know if I would recommend this job to anyone. I mean they pay great and the job is relaxed except for when we are really busy but the shift managers are rude and the manager honestly I do not think he knows what he is doing sometimes.
good,Working at Wendy's has to be one of the craziest jobs I've worked at. It can get really busy at one point and everything in that store can turn into chaos.
good,I worked there for a short time and the people were nice . The money was pretty tight but it could have changed since then..............................
good,"Working at Wendy’s was a new experience for me, especially with it being my first job. I soon realized fast food wasn’t a very good fit for me. Based on my opinions on my time at Wendy’s I have not applied for another fast food position"
good,The managers are so disrespectful & so inconsiderate. The wendys is so dirty they had a rat in the frosty machine like i really hate working here. Hopefully i find a new job soon
good,"Hired for Cashier position but had to wash dishes,  take orders and also make and pass out the orders.. very bad experience.  They wouldn't even give me a raise after all my hard work which was an insult to my ethic."
good,The wendy's  I worked at was really bad because  our really good manager  got fired. The temp also wanted to get fired and constantly stressed out workers so be careful  where you get hired.
good,"Some days are just bad but what else you expect from a job. For the most part it was an ok job, I had good friends there but the job itself wasn’t the best."
good,"Hardest part of the job will be rude customers. Not only is management shaky and somewhat unprofessional, there is very little benefits to the amount you have to deal with. Scheduling shifts however is very flexible."
good,To start it off Wendy’s does give you good opportunities and a lot of room to learn. There are a couple set backs with the company but what job doesn’t have set backs. You meet great people that make you want to works. Working environment is sometimes difficult.
good,Deberían de ofrecer beneficios a sus empleados como plan médico. Además aumentar el salario mínimo.
good,"It was a very stressful job. I was paid minimum wage with no option of pay raise in sight, but maybe that was because I was a part time worker. I worked hard everyday, I showed up on time, only called off for emergencies and never asked to get off early or for someone to switch me shifts. I felt unappreciated by my coworkers and the customers were most of the time demeaning to me when I would take their orders. It was very fast passed and a very stressful environment."
good,Good for teens who are getting out of high school i did not like managment at all they were horrible and did not care about your personal life or anything
good,Started off good till they cut my hours plus I was doing more then most of the manager did they kept making me clock out or go 2 different stores I did like that
good,I started working at wendy's 3 years ago. I started off making $7.25 or $8.25 an hour. In the 3 years I've been working for wendy's not much has improved.
good,It was a little fast for me but more hetic than anything. It was hot and cramped there so i felt to much pressure on my shoulder due to trying to keep up and what not
good,"I liked the people worked with and some of the management was alright but other than that the job sucked, you couldn't work overtime, there was always drama not exactly a place I would recommend."
good,aprendi como manejar dificiles   situaciones con los clientes. y muchas coasa mas aprendi en 5 anos.
good,I'm not completely sure how much i got paid because they don't really tell you. Also they over work minors. The management is very poor. They also have very sketchy people as employees.
good,"At first, Wendy's was a fun environment with a great set of managers. However over time, a lot of the staff quit at once, and new managers were hired. One of which was incredibly hostile and harassed me under false pretenses, and was often times incredibly unprofessional.  This manager would often throw fits and start yelling at the employees, even in front of customers. Despite her immature favoritism towards the employees (that she'd openly vocalize to everyone), constant gossip, even about our GM, and selfish tendencies to lash out, the GM did nothing about it and she remained on the team, which made working there unbearable. I believe this workplace has potential to be a great place to work again, but not until she leaves. I'd refuse to ever work there again until she is rightfully fired, which likely won't happen due to the discrimination due to friendships having a higher standard than workmanship. If this manager doesn't like you, I can guarantee working here will be miserable, even if you are a good worker."
good,"Some people suck, we can’t change that. Managers customers and crew members can all be amazing or simply cannot. You have to be able to work together to get things done."
good,The managers didn’t know what they were doing and everybody was doing whatever they wanted  and didn’t give nobody hours at work  Didn’t know what they were doing the job
good,Decent job if you do not expect good pay. The job is mostly intended for students and people seeking part time employment. Can be a good job if you don't mind low pay.
good,"It can be. A wonderful place to work but because the Wendy's is located directly next to the college, students who become employees can either only work nights or are constantly quitting because of school issues or moving around. It puts an extremely stressful load on everyone working there."
good,"A normal fast food job; it can be fast, sometimes slow. You will be working with different kinds of people from high school students to people that have been working for 20 years who you may or may not like, but just focus on your work and you'll get through the day."
good,"Short staffed and depressed lol, the people are good but the actual company that we work for doesnt care. They only care about profit, not about the staff and definitely not the managers"
good,"For the location i've worked for, it was a toxic environment from me. Conflict of interests and negativity surrounds you. After 2 months of working there, i realize that i didn't want to work there anymore."
good,A typical day at wendys you get a full dinning room of customers mostly close to pay day monday thru sat and on sundays its slow busy and you can clean. There was nothing hard about being or becoming a manager because i already had the skills so learning anything brand new was always a options for me.The most stressful thing about working is being short staffed wher
good,"This was my first job and I didn’t know what to expect, didn’t know what was too much. I was 17 and working to 11 on school nights until some customer told the general manager about it. Then they pretty much kicked me out at 10 (how it’s supposed to be) but I never got finished with all my duties because of the workload (cleaning while handling customers), and was yelled at😤. My manager often had us switch positions, so that if someone were to quit, we’d always have someone who can fill in just fine. She only moved people once they’ve mastered their station, or so they could get a feel of how other stations are done for a day. So while yes I was the cashier starting out, I also did drive-thru, and even grill and sandwiches (a job my manager likes to keep girls away from)!"
good,"I was Cashier, I cleaned lobby including bathroom, sometimes cooked, team biased job, fast paced, constantly taking orders and preparing food. Poor management skills."
good,"Wendy's is a great place to work in if it is your first or second job. The hours are long, you get almost no breaks and you are constantly in a hurry."
good,"it’s fast food, you can’t expect it to be great. but they do go around my school schedule which is nice, and they usually give you the day off you requested. each location is different."
good,Bussyyyyyy. This job really was fun and you got to work in a fast pace environment but staffing was always difficult. You were under staffed many times. Management was pretty decent
good,well I really enjoyed working at Wendy’s but some days we had people who barely did their job & they would want us to pick up what they wouldn’t do . the managers were pretty decent except for one who never really understood anything. like if it was a family emergency she would threaten to fire you if you didn’t come to work like work is more important than a family member on their death bed.
good,"There was constant drama, people called in all the time. People talked about you behind your back, they spread rumors and management didn’t really do anything about. It just wasn’t an enjoyable place to work."
good,I have been with Wendy's along time I enjoy see my regular customer's and making everyone welcome and to have a great day i.always tell them to plzs come back I have never had a bad complaint
good,wasn't to bad for a part time job . had worked for this company in the past so it was easy to pickup on everything. the training program is lacking. and not a great promotion program for moving up.
good,The worst working experience ever Management sucks work area was always dirty Managers always had a bad attitude They say they start hiring at $12 an hour but give you 8
good,I personally didn't like working fast food it didn't do anything for me it was horrible and just unnecessary i only did it for a quick buck while in high school
good,Stressful and very friendly with customers and members work place dirty perp before my time is very messy.. with all that being said I just wanna find a job I’m comfortable
good,"They didnt listen to you about a schedule of the days you cant work. They kept scheduling you for those days. Was a good job, nice people, remembered most of the customers."
good,Wendy's is an okay job to have if you have no bills to pay or priorities. I felt as if I was not given the pay or recognition I deserved for as much as I did under my job role.
good,"The area i worked in wasn’t the best so the place wasn’t very sanitary or fair to its workers. I didn’t enjoy the job, but i had to quit anyways because i moved away."
good,"days are long in management. 10hour shifts 5 days a week. shifts began at 7 ,11 or 4 so it kind of limits your time. the best part is all the customers you meet"
good,Good company to work for if you are in school. Face paced. Management needs to be changed most managers are rude and unkind. Learn more then one task.
good,"I enjoyed working here as a regular employee. I had a great deal of fun even though it was always busy. When I did move up to a management position, I liked it except for the Manager over the store and other employees who would steal."
good,No job is perfect especially this one. I would recommend have a serious manager meeting and discuss what can work better. The managers focus way to much on the drive thru time instead of properly training someone.
good,Everyone constantly joked around unless the owner was coming in that day.  It can be a hostile workplace at times.  It's not worth minimum wage to work here.
good,Its a good place to work. my only problem with working or this company was the General Manager and one of the shift leads. I reported to the General Manager that one of the Leads had called one of the other employees something racist and he didn't believe me or do anything about it. instead they cut my hours and kept threatening to fire me.
good,the hours would hard to live with working till 3- 4am 6-7 days a week. and the work wasnt bad it was some of the staff didnt do their part. made it harder on thegood workers. like myself.
good,They will work you like a dog and the hours you never leave at the time they tell you and they are out of order it was a great start while it lasted...
good,"The people i worked with great, the reason why i left was due to the poor management of the overall job and also the way the employees including myself were treated unfairly."
good,You have some good people and have some bad people. Most of the mangers are nice and the people are somewhat nice. You have to get in their good side for them to like you.
good,The people who I worked with where rude. The Manager had really no control. The Store was very chaotic. I'm stop working their but I'm trying to find something new.At Wendy's The Crew Is Worse then The Customers.
good,the main manager was amazing but 2 of the 4 shift managers were horrible. they played favorites and were harsh of employees they didn't like. they were crude and definitely favored more attractive employees. those two managers made my working there unappealing other then them I had an amazing team to work with and made many many friends there and think if they replaced the two that I worked with (they may have I haven't been there in years) it'd be a great place to start your working experience
good,"worked at all but one station, enjoyed the pace of the work day, pay could have been better. Fellow employees were easy to work with. I enjoyed having a structured day."
good,"I was a shift supervisor and a lot of responsibility came on my shoulders. I can easily handle time sensitive or stressful situations, but after years of doing it, it gets tiresome. Higher ups never took time to hear our concerns."
good,"At first everything seemed normal, but as I started working more I began to notice how rude two of my managers were to me. One of them would treat employees with disrespect and just plain rudeness. A lot more happened but I would not recommend anyone to work at the wendys in Colton, CA"
good,The people kept me there the most but it can get very stressful. There always seems to be a new person there every week. Managers are nice and hours are flexible.
good,As a teen a fast food restaurant is the way to go. I was 17 and worked 40+ hours each week. The only downside is the pay is not enough for how much work goes into the job.
good,For the most part it is like most fast food places but they like to dangle promotions as if it was the proverbial carrot that is never going to be attained.  But some of the crew and Customers can be a real riot
good,Its a really good place to work. The staff it nice but the management sucks. Had good discounts but short breaks. The food is good and it's always clean Inside and out .
good,"I learned a lot by working in fast food, the hardest part being how rude customers could be but it taught me how to better deal with difficult people. But management always ends up finding a way to manipulate you into doing things for them"
good,"Fast paced, small pay, and stressful hours, you only start at minimum wage, you are expected to work whenever they need you. No paid time off, no sick days, and no call outs without a doctors note"
good,pay starts at $7.25 and is rare u receive a raise. The management is not good at their jobs and majority of them don't care about employees. Steer far away from this place unless you are desperate.
good,I enjoyed working there but the reason i quit was because our store manager told the staff that if she didn't tell you to do something then it didnt need to be down so i felt that there was no reason to have shift managers which is what i was.
good,work place really fast. you do a lot of cleaning for the lobby and dishes and bath rooms . you work with chemicals that are constantly on your hands. sometimes odders may be over welming for some
good,I really didn't want to writ a review about wendys. I have no clue why you force me to write a review about a place that I don't feel like disclosing to you.
good,I dont much to say.  It was ok.  Hours given based on liking . Cashier had to do janitor work plus take orders . Managers are friendly. Clean environment.
good,Good job for a high schooler. You quickly learn people skills and how to multitask in an demanding environment. The customers can be challenging sometimes but that comes with the job.
good,"Wendy's is a temporary job that a typical high schooler can apply for. Its is easy and you get the hang of the job very quickly. The hardest part of the job was balancing school work, extra curricular activities, while trying to get a reasonable number of hours."
good,"This job was definitely a good first job. I was taught to work in a stressful, busy environment. I learned to work all of the jobs because we were a bit short staffed."
good,"very hard working with the people there, not a very good management, strange working hours depending on when people get food(?) and just not a fun time. I hate working with food"
good,"I never thought this place is a good one because they have parking lot."
good,"Typical call center atmosphere "
good,This job can be fun sometimes but it is also very very stressful and annoying. Like not getting enough hours and not getting paid enough can also cause the job to be stressful and annoying.
good,"This was okay job. It got me to point A to point B. I would not recommend this job to any of my friends. I do not plan on going back,.... Pay was minimum wage and hours were long,"
good,"I enjoyed my experience with Wendys. After going to college, I would like something much more challenging. Although the managers claimed they cared about changing my hours for school that did not reflect when the hours were posted."
good,Management have hard time to communicate with crew. Most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the costumers and getting to know people. I learned to have customer service.
good,Toxic work environment with some managers who really get off on the limited power they get as a fast food manager. No overtime pay or time and a half for working holidays.
good,Everything was fine until my manager yelled in my face for no reason at all and I felt disrespected because I didn’t even do anything wrong so before I lost my freedom I quit
good,"This is just one of those jobs where ""it is what it is"" you know it's a lame job with bad pay and no benefits. You take it out of desperation. When I took the job I did so on the condition that I would be trained to become a manager. It was obvious to me very quickly that this was a lie. They wanted a cashier. If they had been up front with me I probably would have just said no. But the job itself was what I expected."
good,"Very fast paced especially if you worked drive thru. Many customers will get irritated for slow service. Sometimes customers will try to use their expired coupons. However, you will meet various kinds of people connect with. Customer Service was a must working here. Must be diligent and acknowledge your mistakes, Hardest job was when customers tries to blame you as the cashier for making their sandwiches or order wrong. A lot of patience to be put out working here. Most enjoyable part was getting a long with my co-workers."
good,"Working at Wendy's was a real eye opener to see how unfair managers and supervisors are, like they bias towards some of the workers and only gave a selective few regular shifts"
good,"It’s hard to make a living off of 8-16hrs a week at $8.30 an hour. I’ve ask for more hours and they will not give me more. And it’s hard to move up at a fast food place. Other then that, some of the people you get to meet are really nice. Have really nice coworkers too. So I can’t complain to much about that"
good,It was my very first job. I had to learn fast and had to be good at communicating with others to get orders made and handed out in a fast manner. It wasn't the best but I learn from many things from being here.
good,This was my 1st high school job and the hours were okay and the pay for a high school kid. Manger was unprofessional and not helpful to someone just coming into the work force.
good,"On most days Wendy's is a great place to work at. "
good,"wendys is a good place to work if you assoicate with the right people when i first started there was a manger who put me on the spot for a mistake they did without informing me i cant read well so i usually ask for assistance. when  im at work i tend to keep to my self not for the way the employees talk but because i cant seem to figure what to do. wendys is a great place if you are open minded i find that most people are not satisfied to work there because their not getting anything out of it based on why their there there are people who do not care for their job and dont seas to benefit from being there except for money, which is one of the main reasons people who work there arent happy, in my opinion if you arent happy working somewhere why stay there and get worse if you arent benfitting your self being there dont force your self threw it{work somewhere that makes you some what happy because then you wont make others down about being there} #ideas] sometimes making a change will change the way you feel"
good,I'm a hard worker but managers are great people but lazy and dirty and doesn't put any effort at all and needs improvement i liked the job some days but there slow but make people work in fast pace there fast pace but managers are slow because there lazy either sleeping in office or watching movies on phone or talking or texting all day and making everyone do work
good,It’s a nice first job. Some of the employees are nice but it is usually understaffed. Do not expect any raises and I would not recommend the job to a person that moves slowly as it is a job in fast food.
good,Wendys is what I call a start up job. It helps to pave the way in understanding what it is expected of you in a job environment. I enjoyed my time there.
good,The job really wasn’t even that bad it just sucked when the managers sat in the office on their phones and didn’t help when we were short handed. Other than that it was just ok
good,I worked at a few different Wendys back home and there was only one I enjoyed. When i got promoted to a manager I only made a quarter more than minimum wage. The company doesn't treat all staff the same. Your checks when to almost all of your insurance if you had any and hardly anywhere took it.
good,"Liked working here, but management needs more communication and better staffing. Also a lot of crew members need to be trained properly. Also would like a more consistent schedule."
good,"Wendy's is a good first job to get. It's not hard to perform your job there. However, it is very fast paced and stressful. Some customers are very rude and demanding because it is a fast and cheap place to eat so they think they can treat the staff any kind of way. I would say it teaches you the importance of teamwork and manners. I would even call it a humbling experience. Unfortunately, Wendy's doesn't pay enough for me to be constantly cussed and stressed out."
good,"Requires an employee that will be willing to work within a fast paced environment (thinking on your feet), provide a collaborative partnership with with employees"
good,Most days at Wendy’s we’re fun . The company employees have a home feeling in the way they welcome an new employee . The environment has a home feeling to its easy to be yourself.
good,"working there was stressful and management did not want to help at all with the problems i was having with coworkers, so i left. fellow coworkers were rude and nasty along with most of the management"
good,Noone follows the rules. Everyone comes late or call out. To many kids and playing around. to much favoritism. Only some people work while others sit around
good,It was an okay working environment and everyone worked as a team. We were always very busy and the work day went by fairly quickly. The food is great.
good,"Wendy's is cool, wouldn't't eat there again after working, just because I ate it often. the management was okay. AA lot of co-workers were really kind and helpful to me."
good,I taught myself lots of stuff and had couple of my general managers show me stuff . The job wasn't to bad it is a good place for people that looking for there first job
good,I had a horrible manager. She would yell constantly and even throw food at employees in front of customers. I would go home crying almost every shift. I did not go back to this location until over a year later because of the experience as a worker I had.
good,Not bad for a first job but like I said it’s not a good job no benefits low pay the discount is ok but it’s not nothing major weekends are rushes some customers be rude it’s not really worth it as a main full time job
good,"fast paced environment"
good,Just work keep to myself sow up on time..sometime we get busy and i run around helping try to jeep things moving..tell jokes every now and thsn keep people smiling
good,"Dificultoso trabajar dentro de la empresa, donde hacian realizar trabajos muy fuera de las obligaciones y de forma displicente, sin comprensión de problemas personales al momento del conflicto y sin paciencia por novatos."
good,Make sure that you check your days before you leave because they probably gone change the schedule overnight it happened to me with out being notified just a warning.
good,The location I worked at had 3 new managers that were young and I felt were still finding their footing as a manager and the lack of experience and maturity in a unsupervised environment was unhealthy.
good,Didn’t really enjoy the atmosphere. Loved communicating with customers. I loved going to work it’s just the people I was working with. Most enjoyable part was making the customers smile
good,"First and foremost the managers are extremely aggressive with the coworkers. There is to be no facial hair or jewelry to be worn for each shift. I feel they need to loosen up with the staff and make it a more comfortable place to work. Worked there for a number of years to be treated with minimal raises, no vacations, and a lot of day to day stress. Great job for making minimal money, bad for having a life but than again it is ""fast food."""
good,"Since I have left, the current managers, which were fun leaders that would always give their jobs their all, have left due to personal choices made by the higher ups, either in the store or the franchise I do not know. The work was long for minimum wage at best with no solid promise of a performance review anytime in the future. Go at ones risk, and go with a hide of stone."
good,"Wendy's taught me so much from, handling money to customer satisfaction. I would recommend this job to someone who needed good hours and didn't mind working fast food. I think the hardest part of working there was all of the drama between the managers and the coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast pace work environment and the amount of people you get to meet."
good,wendys is a okay job if you really need it a typical day is fast pace. it is a well managed place from what i see the hardest part of the job is trying to make everyone happy
good,If you are in school this job is good for you but other then that it's not too good of a job. If the store closes at midnight you won't be leaving until an hour to two hours later.
good,"You have to have speed and can also multitask a good temporary job , no overtime also good team work on all shifts and also it’s a good experience because it’s close by the hospital so you experience a lot"
good,"a typical day im always in the drive thru,what i learned dont let people take advantage of you management always in some drama culture non exsistent hardest part the customers most enjoyable part when the day over."
good,"the worst part about working at Wendy's is most of the people that work there hardly helped each other "
good,"You were worked hard for minimum wage. The management was a joke. On the plus side, i will say though that wendys is a very clean fast food restaurant to work for."
good,"Coworkers would not stock or complete their position duties before leaving, management would let this happen repeatedly. I showed extreme interest in moving up to management and was told the position was mine then denied the position in the end. They lie and manipulate to get what they want."
good,I wouldn’t recommend working for the Wendy’s Corporation in that the pay does not equal to the time and effort that is placed into working there. The management I have experienced is very poor.
good,It has it up an down so good an some bad most of all the people that works there work hard but it's not enough to live off of some would want more for there work
good,"poor management, lack of staff, poor pay , poor effort, lack of care, great company but franchise wise horrible don't work there unless you like to get paid low and work a ton"
good,It was just stressful all around that place. the managers wouldn't help until the customers would complain about the time of wait they was waiting and it was ridiculous.
good,Work long hours with no break unless you're a minor. Fast paced and poor management. I knew more about the store and how to run it than the managers and most staff and still did not advance in position. But a good place to work if you need the money and experience
good,Fast food businesses is not good and Wendys is horrible it was constant stress and dealt with getting held at all day and not paid enough for working and hours are not good.
good,"typically work 4-8 hour shift depending on if you are a minor or not. the daily workload is not hard, so many employees tend to do the bare minimum. it stinks for those who work their butts off and don't get recognition. the owner at this location is a great guy, but does not pay accordingly."
good,"Not much to say really, its fast food so its a good first job but there is really no room to move up from there I worked there for 2 years and was never offered full time benefits even when I asked about them."
good,i learned how to work with a team and manage to get stuff done in a timley manner .  met alot of diffrent people an alot people that i havent seen in along time
good,It’s a good job it a fun  and productive place but it just time to find something better and try something new other than fast food I would recommend it to anyone if they like things like that
good,No job is fun when you have a manager there that’s always talking about you with another member that has the same position as you. No one would like to work under someone that always have an attitude .
good,While working in fast food isn't fun or anything but it pays for school books and bills. It's better than McDonald's which was sucky and at this location everyone was nice but it is still a very stressful job and it makes you smell like fast food and gives you acne because of all the oil in the air and you have to clean the bathrooms which is disgusting because of kids.
good,"I learned management, how to use my time wisely, how to keep myself busy with work and also learn how to deal with complicated customers. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say is dealing with the people because it helps you to learn and develop patience. The hardest part of the job would have to be cleaning the bathrooms because you will never believe some of the messes people can make in there."
good,"Wendy's isn't the best place to start your first job, yes everyone starts small in fast-food, but Wendy's isn't the answer. My first day at Wendy's was hard, but I liked it at first. I learned that I could never work in fast food places like that again, unless the managers are extremely nice, and chill, and not rude and disrespectful to the customers.Overall, truthfully, I just don't think anyone  should ever work there for their first job due to the fact that the managers are rude, they speak in another language, and you never know if they might be talking about you or not."
good,It’s was a great place to work until they sold the franchise and then it went down hill fast. Now it’s time for a change of scenery and I want to branch out and explore other things
good,Hours were short since I was just a part-time employee but anything helped. Learned how to cook and prep foods that are served at Wendy's. Enjoyed working with the people who were working there at the time I was. Nothing was hard for me just the manager sometimes gave some of us a hard time. Other than that everything else was alright.
good,If u are a young high school student this would be the right job. If u are a parent it will be quite difficult to maintain off one income. It was a great preparing for the real world.
good,It's okay to work there. They don't pay enough to do what they want you to do. They don't want to give employees any type of paid vacation or sick days. They don't know how to work together as a team. Their raises are not good.
good,This job was okay it wasn't a career different job and I wasn't passionate about it I wasn't planning on staying at this job for long it was something to do while I was younger. It paid the bills but it wasn't a stable job to have full-time to pay all my bills on my income myself
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere, and my coworkers. The hours were fine and the tasks were not difficult to accomplish. However, Management needs to communicate better and speak respectfully to their employees. Also employees should be better protected against raging customers and their verbal abuses."
good,Working at Wendy's is a fast paced/ stressful job. Some of the management was bossy and lazy. I personally do not like working in the food industry because its never a set schedule and a part time job.
good,"Learned things about customers that benefit me now."
good,"This was a good first job, I learned a lot and made a lot of new friends.  It was a good experience overall and was a good stepping stone for my current position. Good for a first job but no growth opportunity long term."
good,"Both times I have worked at wendy's as crew and management I have regretted it. I Was always very stressed, overworked and not fairly treated. Management is always rude to each other, and the General managers never have good control of their crew. there is no ground rules, and there is no problem solving till it is very escalated."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's consist of taking orders, cooking and preparing food, taking out the trash, and cleaning the entire store before closing. Most days there's only one manager but some days there's two. I learned a lot from working at Wendy's but the most important to me was patience. Often times we'd have mean and rude customers but then sometimes we'd have some of the nicest people come through the drive through and it makes it all worth while seeing their faces light up after we've completed their order in a timely fashion. The hardest part of the job was constantly having to go back in forth inside the freezers. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers laugh while they order their food. The culture of Wendy's when I worked there was friendly and everybody was like family."
good,Working at Wendy's you have to talk to customers and take orders. You have to clean the lobby and assist the drive thru. You have to work at a timely pace.
good,"i come in hoop on sandwiches, we are busy sometimes during the day. but i jump from place to place because nobody shows up for work and week days we close at 12 i bring all the food in back, wrap up the sauces, sweep and mop sometimes clean the frosty machine."
good,"Overall working at Wendys was decent, but moving into my own apartment and still being in class I needed more hours to make rent along with other financial obligations. I needed something that offered more than 7 or less hours a day due to my school schedule. A female manager there at the time, was in my opinion the most kind but also effective manager there. I enjoyed working with her. I learned how to keep calm when everything was speeding up, when more and more guests would come in, and when there was multiple things to do that needed done as soon as possible."
good,"Very unappreciative. Worked my butt off as a manager/shift leader and was not paid enough. other management was lazy I was always picking up slack. Store was normally pretty busy, general management expected more from some employees and less from others. it was a mess. Never wanted to pay me OT."
good,"Conditions weren't as bad as you would think, but on the other hand, not something to depend on as definitely didn't see myself succeeding working there as a benefit in the long run. Pay was ok or fast food but not something to live off of."
good,"Management sucked and company policies were almost useless. I got along with my coworkers well. There were definitely favorites among the management, so things you'd get in trouble for others wouldn't. Definitely wouldn't be coming back"
good,Over all it's not that bad. Conflicts with some people/ management is extremely likely. Not much is usually done when a conflict happens unless there's a lot of customer complaints about crew behavior.
good,Fast paced environment with lots of different tasks to keep u busy throughout the day. 0n a busy day it can become hetic and overwhelming but stay focus on ur customers and it will go smotthly
good,"I knew right away going into the job that it would be temporary. I was originally a cook there but was later placed as a cashier. The management had it's problems, but the biggest issue was the fact that they were not organized"
good,A day as a manager for wendys was usually pretty stressfull. It was a constant worry if your crew was going to show up on time or at all. I was expected to run ridiculous projections with minimal help or support.
good,the food is cook wonderfully and was made well and customers where happy. and crowded some people on work schedule had to go home the pay was okay if youre living with your moms with no kids to take care of.
good,"Workin at this company was great at first, but after a few weeks their true colors showed. They do not care for their workers at all. The management sucks and the environnent is poor."
good,When I first started here the job was great and I would get great hours. The pay was okay to start out with but then every other fast food job had higher pay and was saying that I could have better hours.
good,"Terrible management, no breaks , short staff, training with no pay. On a typical day it’s very busy & always missing product. Great product , great food and service"
good,Overall I don’t blame the company for poor management but the store itself. Both the management and crew weren’t professional and would often use fowl language and lack the ability to follow food safety procedures.
good,A typical day at Wendy's starts with signing in and cleaning the dining room. The environment is okay with friendly coworkers but managers there are very irresponsible and unknowing of their duties.
good,"Busy and everyone rushing."
good,"If you enjoy moving fast then youll love working at Wendy's! Weather your flipping the burgers, passing out food, or collecting the cash it'll keep the time going! Also very good team members!"
good,"its was ok to work there did not pay much no benefits, no vacation, management sucks, hard part is keep food fresh for customers, the food was alright"
good,"fast paced is fine, yelling at workers like they're incompetent is not. Me, as a cashier, never gets any breaks, i wish i had paid time off, the pay isn't worth it in my book. been working for 5 months"
good,they work u hard and want to pay u. I feel like a slave everytime i work in fast food. i worked drive thru. so my whole shift is fast paced. i constantly took orders and poeple were rude for no reason
good,"Mistakes are a common thing, yet sadly the environment I have been subjected to has to many holes to count in the story, many of them which are stressful. People I thought were my friends, now hate me for the most minimal of reasons. Life is not fair, I get that, but its fair enough to allow establishments such as Wendy's to exist, let alone be a thought to any hungry-consumer looking for a tasty burger."
good,fast food restaurant which means it is a very paced place to work.  has a lot of turn over of employees due to mostly high school kids work there. management does not work as a team it seems everyone is worried just about themselves and not what impact their decisions have for the store or other co workers
good,"My Wendy's I had amazing coworkers and when it wasn't busy, we could relax and joke around. If you don't like the fast paced environment then I don't recommend working here. I had a bad experience with management but every Wendy's is different."
good,"a typical day at work for a wendys employee is to expect a heavy flow of customers. you should also expect to deal with a array of customers. this is a perfect first time job, I just grew out of it."
good,It's a good job to learn multitasking communicational skills learning to work with other good work place it's gets super stressful at times but it always works it's self out and patience is a must
good,"Wendys is a easy job it’s fast aced & easy to learn you shouldn’t have many problems people are friendly at wendys "
good,"Annoying"
good,"The management was shorty, many times they were very strict about not showing up even when seriously I’ll and letting them know with time in advance. Overworked their workers, and always understaffed."
good,The job is good for a beginner or someone working part time. This is not a career field. The company is money hungry. The employees are treated poor compared to the management. There is no incentive to work there and being a manager watching the employees struggle day to day for pretty much nothing is sad.
good,Management kinda sucked. The employees tend to get really personal and it leads to some awkward interactions when they go their separate ways. Management sets you up to fail in telling you do something they know you don't have enough time for.
good,I started working at 15 and the managers tried to get me to work until closing. I didn't have a car at the time and my parents worked full time so I eventually had to quit because of scheduling conflicts.
good,Working at wendy's I felt as if being a cook I was very well under paid. The service was fast but the management was very rude and unkindly to their staff.
good,"While I am not particularly a fan of the way the Wendys corporation handles business, I do believe that it is a solid job for any young student looking to earn a little extra cash."
good,Good first job . Very fast paced and a good first job experience. No real advancement opportunities. Basic pay with long shifts . Short break . And management is okay
good,"Me hago responsable del grill,preparando todo lo que se ordena y dejándolo limpio y listo para la siguiente jornada de trabajo.aprendi todo sobre ser grilero,hay una buena dirección por parte de los managers.Lo más difícil es la alergia que tengo a los guantes y a los productos de limpieza que uso.Me gusta cocinar y atender al público."
good,I dont know I would recommend for a first job but not as something to see a future in. Management was terrible. Hardest part of the job was always being understaffed.
good,over my years at Wendy's I've learned to multitask and work in a very fast pace. i enjoyed talking at interacting with customers and was able to build relationships.
good,Es un buen trabajo pero la paga es muy poca en relación al tipo de trabajo que se debe realizar.
good,"Often found the job easy to tackle, disappointed with the lack of training. Management often thought I knew every task when I hadn't worked the task or simply got upset out of uncontrollable rushes. Unprofessional environment."
good,Very fast and over working long days. I learned the basic customer service skills. Management depending on shifts would vary. Workplace culture was general for a first job. Hardest part of the job was working alone and not getting help. Most enjoyable would be relax time.
good,"Management set unrealistic goals. Hard to move up in a place that does not care about the employees, and the customers came and went but was not very busy"
good,"At this job i was expected to carry the same work load as other mechanics while i had  a different title and while getting paid a fraction of co-workers salary, no breaks were allowed even though i had them documented every day, also they would do things rushed/cheap then get mad when i didn't because doing it the right way took too much time according to them. Co-workers were also very unaccommodating and there seemed to be no cohesion between them."
good,I feel like we need is a good starter position for anybody who is willing to work and build on work ethnic as well as build multitasking skills and customer service skills
good,I did learn about fast food life...it was stressful and fast paced.  did a lot of things myself.  I liked most of the people I worked with.  never enough help.  always there late at night to close.
good,very competitive and always busy. workers are very hard dealing with. Not managed responsibly. Although pays good. chances of more hours are also offered.
good,Its a great place for a high school or college kid to get work expierence. But not a place to make a career. the upper management are not very easy to get along with and the shift managers are poorly paid.
good,Its not the best place to work but it is a job. the managers were kind of harsh and you were doing a lot more then what you were getting paid for. They were also pretty rude.
good,"A typical day working at wendy's consisted of prepping any food products needed for work that day, stocking work area with all supplies needed for the day as well as equipment needed. I learned how to prepare various sandwiches and salads to the customers preference. The management was not the best management system I have been under before. There seem to be a lack of communication. The working environment at times was very hostile between fellow co-workers. The hardest part of the job was just having to keep up with the numerous technical difficulties that the computer system would experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was to know that I was apart of a team that would deliver fresh hot food as the customers expected."
good,"It was a tough job. When there was a rush, we had to work together as a team and it was tough. Sometimes we would get angry customers but we handled it professionally."
good,this was a temporary job for me and it served its purpose. the management is great and works hard for you so that makes the employees want to work hard. the pay is minimum wage and you dont get very many hours though
good,typical day started wit warming buns and laying meat on the grills and prepping sandwich station for opening of store. management helped with time and preparing orders in timely manner. Hardest pert was closing. the food was most enkojable
good,Fast food industry is a very hard job. You have to be able to deal with the pressure and not make mistakes. It was just not for me. I did it as long as I has to.
good,Wendy's was not what I was looking for in a job. Wendy's was very unorganized  and could never find what I needed to stock or clean my area. Tho the people I worked with were nice people.
good,Keep clean and make sure equipment is stocked for cooking food area that cook the food are clean and organized get into proper position to take orders from the customers and make the food as they order.
good,i had this job in high school. it fine it a part time job. you do the same thing you would at any other fast food job. nothing new or different an idiot can do it.
good,"Working at Wendy's was just like working for any other fast-food restaurant. There was a manager that has been there for probably 20+ years, and she is extremely unpleasant to work with, and work for. She is very rude, impolite, and impatient while training first-time employees. What I like most about Wendy's, is that they are an Equal Opportunity Employer. Most businesses emphasize that they participate in that too, but I have never saw any other business that hires so many people with disabilities. It makes me happy to see that they still offer the opportunity to be employed by their company to all people with disabilities, and MOST of their employees are dedicated to the company and have been, or stay within the company, for at least 2 years minimum. It's a great place to work for someone looking for their first job. The downfall to working for the company is that they offer no benefits, and the job is minimum wage."
good,The job was a ok experience u learn about customer service and quality of hardwork basically the managers was ok people but at times we was unorganized in staff and in work ethic but if u need money go for it
good,"The enviroment at wendy’s is stressful. You have to tolerate many difficulties. Some including people behind the scenes- such as managers. Some of the managers were great, but some of them had nasty attitudes and didn’t want to do their jobs."
good,it's an ok place to work. Fast paced and very busy during the day. Standard rate of pay. Management is alright. No real advancement at this location. I learned to not short change myself.
good,It was very unorganized. I learned to multi-task due to management not doing their part. Management was lazy and the store was unclean. The hardest part was doing other workers job while they sat around. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"It was always busy due to greyhounds stopping. The management was poor, and the environment was stressful. I hated showing up to work everyday because of how unorganized it was."
good,This job is good for a person looking for a part time or for teenagers. Its faced paced and easy and quick to learn. You meet great people working there.
good,"Management was stuck in their high school glory days, general manager was never in the store and hesitated on crucial improvements until absolutely necessary. Long hours, and often had breaks cut short due to high volume, high turn over rates."
good,The work was fine.  Being a manager was a decent job until about a year in I found out that people doing the same job as me were making 5 dollars more an hour.
good,I learned how to cook food at a required temperature for the customer can be served a proper product from Wendy's. Then I learned about how to manage my time to keep making food for each customer can have there meal on time.
good,I went it to work did as i was told and maybe more including cleaning and making sure I stayed busy at all times. Depending on the manager who was on the shift things would run smoothly. i try to stay to myself and make sure i completed my work.
good,"Some managers were rude and did not like helping you."
good,It is not a bad place to work the employes are quiet friendly and helpful management always listen about our problems and try their best to solve them but now days they do not have enough ours for work
good,I've always been told I'm a good worker and I'm an awesome person to work with and to be around and I'm a good listener and I learn quick and always respectful.
good,Great place to work. It was my first job and I stayed 8 years. The one I worked out the owner was amazing and always there for u when u needed something
good,working at wendys was a very fast paced environment that I was not looking forward to. I walked into the wendy's world with a blind fold over my face not knowing what to expect
good,I was a Wendy's cashier who did absolutely everything. Tried my hardest to make manager even was promised manager position but they gave it to a new girl who had just started. Didn't know what she was doing but working me like I'm nothing. I worked there almost 3 years with a 30 cent raise the whole time.
good,Honestly Wendy's was a good experience for learning how to be humble in the work place because Wendy's was kind crazy to walk into everyday but it wasn't the worst job I've ever had.
good,"It is a company where you can work but with a better management of supervisors, and active people who are always there to work quickly and in a group. We need people who feel ready to follow directions to better serve our clients and to make them feel good eating in our restaurants."
good,wendys was a laid back type job i hated working the long hours and late nights they paid fair but know benefits besides vacation after working there at least 1yr
good,Fast paced have to be people going person fast on your feet for straight 8 hrs  be able to cover other people shifts without being asked your expected to
good,I did not like my job because of the people that worked their and who was in management when I worked their it made it very hard to do my job when people are standing around talking instead of doing their job
good,It was okay just wish I had better job opportunity. But it was a convenient job for me to get back and forth too everyday. The people was nice to work with as well.
good,"The management there was not knowledgeable and not professional."
good,"It's fast food, you cook food and serve it to angry rude people. Very busy almost all the time and you go home smelling of burger grease and french fries."
good,"Good hours for a first job, not very competitive as they promote. They do teach you responsibility, as well as good time management. Fun bunch of people to work with."
good,didn't want to give breaks the work was hard they wanted you to do everything with no complaints and they didn't care if you were sick or not they still wanted you to come in even if you got everyone else sick.
good,"At work I would prepare sandwiches, cook fries and nuggets, and make sure orders were right. I learned how to work as a team with my coworkers. Sometimes I would work up to 48 hours a week and my checks would be short on hours I worked. The hardest part of the job was making sure that everything was going where it needed to go. Rush hours were very hectic. The most enjoyable part of my job was making customers happy."
good,Working there was alright because when I worked there I was just fresh out of high school looking for any job I could. The pay was minimum wage which is deserving for a fast food job due to it needing limited skills. The coworkers were mostly nice too.
good,"many people complained that they were not trained properly, if you were just starting you would have to mainly figure things out for yourself because there wouldn't be time for someone to train you. It was very rushed for you to learn things as quickly as possible with little help. Some managers would be understanding of this learning curve and others wouldn't be. Overall I think the learning curve would have been shorter for a lot of team members if more in-depth training was given."
good,"No raises unless you ask for it, and many times not even that."
good,"The high street Wendy's should not be one to represent the chain. The managers are irresponsible and do not set a professional example for the rest of the crew. Service for customers is haphazard, and the crew follow the lead of the managers, being lazy."
good,"Its usually depressing. I do not enjoy it at all. Though, the customers are nice and the people are not the bad. I do not really recommend a fast food restaurant."
good,For a high school student looking for their first job this is  a good start. It is average pay with good hours. There isn't much room for growth however some managers are much better then others.
good,Met many great people here. Learned basics of the food industry. I worked there over a year. Very hard to leave because of the friends I had made there.
good,"as management i worked with a good crew, meeting with people was always a plus, got along with other managers, a good location. benefits for managers were good."
good,I feel the ask you to work harder and go further than they will compensate but the work is easy the people can be great the pay needs a over haul and communication with management.
good,I worked at Wendy's for 6months I was treated poorly criticized of my work way too much co workers always had a attitude district manager didn't care to listen to issue I had just a very poor work environment
good,"We were owned by a corporate office called The Starboard Group.  Minimum benefits, health insurance was horrible and not accepted by most physicians, vacation time is not given, and overall negative view of employees."
good,"Fast pace job , constantly moving job, consist of cleaning , love the food . Definitely can move up positions like to management , multiple positions you can work in."
good,A typical work day consists of speedy service time management fresh products and speedy service at the window politeness and pleasurable dine in customer service
good,Wendys was an okay place to work. Definatly wouldnt work in fsst food again. The people there worked well together. But way too many jobs to do for one person.
good,"Unorganized company "
good,It's ok working there I just need more hours in more money I do alot at my job in my checks don't make my bills at all I need a better job asap I wish in pray I get more hours there
good,a typical day at work would be either taking orders putting a shipment away or being a cashier. I learned how to work fast and efficiently. the management could have been better and the hardest part of my job would have to have been putting the order away
good,The management is all over the place and some managers abuse their power as well as use it to treat customers and employees very bad. Very hard work and school life balance it felt I had to work long hours because an employee did not come on time and I had to wait til they came in so I can go home. They care more about the timer in the drive thru then treating employees right and had to cut ends in order to get food out on time including one time serving raw fries even though I said they are not cooked fully.
good,"They allow flexible scheduling based on your needs, but the job itself is really demanding in terms of effort given to the subject matter. Be prepared to work your butt off if you want to do well."
good,They could work on the way the management handles the employees.they could work on their drive thru times.but as a former employee i know there is alot more going on than just taking a order.multitasking is a must.being dependable is also a must not showing up for work puts the whole team in a bind.as a customer so far ive had good expierences at wendys.the food has been good and they have pretty good choices on the menu.where else can yoy get chili and a potatoe in the middle of summer.
good,A typical day it has its upas and downs. I learned cooperation and team work is a must. management wasn't too great people don't last. The culture was great! Same customer came in. The hardest part was having a good team. being a good team player not everyone puts in the effort. The best day is when we all got along and finished for the day.
good,Wendy's is a job great for high school students. The career advancement is not worth you moving up being that the pay is not enough to do what is asked.
good,"Overall for fast food its not horrible however, you normally end up going in and having to do not only your job, but everyone else's job. Management expects you to just pick up the slack and do it anyway. If you show them you are willing to work they will have you do all the work instead of managing and dividing it up among crew. Environment is overall friendly."
good,"I would recommend Wendy's to someone who can handle customers well and fast pasted other than that Wendy's isn't the best place to work maybe as a first job. But, You'll love the people you work with for sure. Certain managers will push buttons but other than that it fine"
good,working at Wendy's was okay. I worked there because I needed extra money not because I loved making French fries and burgers. the managers were a bit roude at times.
good,A typical day while working here I mostly worked at the front counter with money and getting orders out to costumers. There were other employees but not many of them were very helpful.
good,Very friendly people. depending on the manager on shift then its a fine environment to be in. managers want alot of labor from employee with little benefits and hours
good,Wendy's is a job to start off with but not maintain. Therefore I felt it was time for me to leave and try out new horizons. As I said wendys did treat me very fairly at times. But not at all times.
good,It personally is a great job you just have the drama if people minded their own business and focused more on their job then what they do then it would be no problem but instead people like to run they mouth and talk about people like its a school or gathering of some sort something.
good,I worked at Wendy's for more then a year and a half I could run every position in the store was a vary good reasurant only reason I had to leave was becouse I moved out of state
good,"the store at which i worked at would always run out of food ... ex: cheese, patties,buns,sodas. It wasn't organized very well. The manager also began to hire to many people and started to cut a lot of people hours short"
good,"Wendys  is okay for a first job , but that's all.  Every day I work is always different from the last. One thing that makes me not ever want to work in fast food again is the  rude, nasty customers, and sometimes the co-workers are not always the best to work with"
good,"It was a typical place friendly co-workers, decent customers slightly fast paced but expected for fast food A great place to eat.I would recommend a teenager pick up a few hours after school there."
good,pretty much what you would expect out of a low grade job. okay hours minimum wage not many benefits and people were replaced daily. but it was an okay start
good,Management  tends to take advantage of workers. Not enough hours. Not giving you your pay at the time of pay. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on there.
good,"i kind of enjoyed working at wendys but one thing is that they need to have more freindly workers and speak english in the work place , so that we can all have an understanding."
good,This job expected too much out of one person. There was never a schedule after each day the manager would tell you what you would work the next day. No training was ever done they just expected you to know how everything worked and to know where everything was.
good,Bad management and scheduling. I worked there when I was very young and it was my first job so it was okay. But since then that has been the worst experience I have had in a job.
good,Typical day at work was about 8-10 hours without a break. There were a lot of scheduling issues due to bad communication. There were also many issues with workers being paid.
good,"My experience was mostly great, excluding my interactions with upper management. Most of the upper management is completely disconnected from the workplace."
good,It was usually busy. The best part of my job was when the elderly customers came in. They were very sweet. The worst part about it was too many irrelevant distractions. There were so many arguments that did not have anything to do with the workplace.
good,I enjoyed my time while I was there. Wendy's will not be a place I'll return to. I did enjoy my managers and co- workers they were nice and easy going.
good,"very welcoming place to work, management seems to think their employees are lesser than them and creates separation between the staff and managers. very good with time off and easy to work with, not the best hours max 30 hours unless you're willing to pull 12 hour days."
good,"Wendy's required early morning set up. Unloaded shipping trucks, prep food for the day, cleaned  parking lots and eating area. Also customer service for customers during open hours, also did grill and food delivery to customers."
good,"Bad experience for first job , very unprofessional workplace , very unorganized, managers not on the same page , and work schedule is all messed up it could change at any moment"
good,For the 3 years I worked at Wendy's I found it was a very fast paced environment. Once the new management came in and took over the rules had changed. The new management wasn't as well taken care of the company as the old. The store seemed way more out of order than before.
good,"Any Restaurant Management job is hard to have a family life with this kind of Job.  Long crazy hours, stress and just is hard on your body. The company is ok to work for"
good,Wendy's could be a better and fun place to be if hiring processes would hire people who are willing to work in a fast paced environment and work for long hours on foot .
good,Working at Wendy's gave me an outlet and perspective on how to interact with people even with rude or disrespectful customers. Gave me a life lesson on how to treat people and give the best seevice I can to my customers. Also made me thankful for the value of money which has to be earned with hard work.
good,"I love the people i work with great environment, schedules need improvement, management needs a little help to improve the way the store location is run."
good,"this was only a quick part time job for me, i only worked two three days a week and only made 101.00 or so, it was a great 1st job though so i wasn't all disappointined just in the management they were not nice, and i needed more training."
good,"The crew and member could be need to be more nice and be helpful to each other as well customers like they should be treated with respect and happy better fun Great first job just to get you going,"
good,"it was ok other than the store manager who was always raging n drunk"
good,Taking people's orders and cleaning the lobby and restrooms.Working late hours for minimum wage. Not all the managers have the same opinions and views.
good,"Very productive and fast paced, lots of problem solving and Food prepping,  have to be focused and Punctual to Get through work load without mistakes."
good,Working at Wendy's has taught me how to deal with all types of people. It has also taught me how to balance stress with working while attending school full time.
good,"I would work as a cashier, take orders. work drive thru. i would constantly have to multi task. prepare food sometimes. I learned how to handle money in a quick manner."
good,A typical day at work would be filled with a bunch of customer but slow paced moving employees. During the day its very fast paced and constant but around 6 is when things slow down and employees being to grow lazy.
good,While I like the people I worked with our upper management was unrealistic at times. Goals for drive thru times were not on par for quality service and food.
good,"Wendy's doesn't provide proper training and disrespects employees. managers take advantage of employees, and steel from employees. not a safe workplace as employees are not taken into consideration of chemicals and weight lifting."
good,"A typical day at work is stressful, in that it is fast-paced and under-appreciated, the managers appear to need more training as we sometimes have to be our own managers. The pay is awful, the only benefit is the cheerful elderly customers."
good,At times it could be difficult but overall it's a good place to work out. Very flexible hours if you're going to school. The hours range from 7am to 1 am.
good,"U have to have patients wit people to work at Wendy's , It is very busy at times , There is always work to be done, Its not a bad place to work an the Mangers will show u along the way if u want to learn."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's would be clocking in, washing yours hands, and then getting right to work. At certain times work would pick up and we would get a big rush of people. At other times it would be very slow and sometimes boring. Depending on the people you worked with, you would have a fun, productive, and enjoyed shift. As far as management, it wasn't very great. There were a lot of times when you couldn't get ahold of the manager. The hardest part of the job would probably be satisfying all the customers when there were uncontrollable factors such as fries or meat cooking."
good,"I personally liked the job, it was fun and exciting but the other workers never usually did their jobs and the management was a huge joke. Management never and I mean never helped on the line and nine times out of ten they were sleeping with each other, either in the office or outside of work."
good,"The environment is not too bad very  busy  store, however, the pay is minimum wage with no benefits and the race is once-a-year 0.10 - 0.15 cent just a joke that's the main reason I left it's not rewarding enough I had  to work 6 days a week to come close to 30 hours not worth it."
good,"I worked here for a long time. If you have a flexible schedule and have nothing else in your life (you're young, no extra curricular activities, etc) this is perfect job for you."
good,"busy"
good,Great place to work just no job security or advancement there then. I could always joke with team mates  not so much the shift managers but could also joke with general manger. Would wait on customers during slow times and lunch and dinner rushes. Shift managers seem to think they were always better than other employees. General manager would treat everyone with respect and dignity. Climbing up and cleaning 9 foot windows was the hardest part of job . Customers and employees were the best part even on bad days they could turn a bad day into the best day.
good,I go in and I make chilli and cut lettuce preparing for the day.  Set up frosty machines. The management team is very helpful when anyone needs assistance there right there. There really aren't any hard parts of this job. My most enjoyable part of my job is I get to work with customers and seeing them smile when I say have a wonderful day makes my day.
good,Sometimes enjoyable fast pace not a lot of hours customers complained often supervisor and other works lazy unless head manger was in
good,"Good environment. Fast pace. Well manard crew. Good team working, friendly, great place to start the working world. Gain lots of experience,..........."
good,This was my second job it wasn't the best it was a very negative environment. I learned not to let the way my co-workers act reflect on me. Management wasn't the best nobody could hold the position. Overall it just taught me just to work the way I work not how they work.
good,Working at Wendy's patience needs to be learned in order to succeed. Not only does patience need to be learned for customers but also with dealing with staff and managers. The environment is very fast pace so being a quick learner is necessary.
good,this is not a job that should be obtained for the rest of your life i find this as a temporary job.This was my first  job and I know for a fact that fast food is definitely not my career .
good,It's awful there. Too much drama and they cut your hours all the time. The high schoolers that work there are lazy and don't do what they are supposed to and have people like me who work the night shift clean up their messes.
good,No breaks on certain days with certain managers. Rude manager. A lot of demanding. Fake personalities. You have to kiss up to make it there or you've just got what it takes to be a pushover.
good,The managers constantly yelled at everyone while they sat in the office and did nothing. Always made you feel like you are doing everything wrong no matter how hard you work. But I met some good people and had a good learning experience.
good,Bad communication skills I was sent to apply and didn't get accepted for the position they made me. Apply for.... So I really am disappointed considering my experience lies withing the Wendy's company
good,All crew members are rude and talk behind your back. This is the one in mentor Ohio.  There was not enough hours given and the manager took multiple sides and had favorites.
good,I enjoyed my time with Wendy's. I had a great group of managers that worked hard to provide a safe work place for the employees.
good,"stressful as soon as you walk in the store."
good,"The typical work day at this company is one where you come into work, work nearly your entire shift before you are allowed to have any type of a break.The only thing I learned from this job is that you have to learn to put yourself after the job. The manager is very rude and does not consider your well being as something that matters. Many of the co-workers will be friendly to your face and talk about you behind your back as soon as they can. They are not trust-worthy at all. The hardest part of this job was taking the mistreatment and the most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to go home."
good,"Fast paced, heavy physical loads. Management was fine although I'm pretty sure none of the team that I managed is still there"
good,I have had an overall good and beneficial experience here. The management has always been understanding to flexibility within the work schedule. Best part was definitely the co-workers.
good,Too many people didn't show up for their shifts so I was constantly being called in. The managers didn't do their jobs correctly. The work environment was always angry.
good,a very fast paced job were you have to be multi tasked and be able to think fast it keeps you on your toes and it gives you a experience in people skills.
good,I don't mind working for Wendy's.... I just feel they want to put me in the back all the time okay I been there going on three months but there's people that started with me some I trained. I don't be calling in or show up to work late only twice I have honestly Vs the ones who do I think if you wanna call in or be late all the time then you should be in the back.
good,The restaurant was closed down due to a water leak.  All employees were let go.  It was upsetting to everyone.  We all liked our jobs.  The building was old and wasn't up to code.
good,A typical day at work is boring and no fun at all what I have learned is time management and how to conduct my work in a orderly fashion management is always pointing the finger when something goes wrong instead of stepping up and taking the blame for their problem my co-workers are fun to work around the hardest part of my job is being disrespected by customers the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to know I did my best at my job.
good,"A day at Wendy's was very routine, and fast pace. You are to show up to work on time, have clean uniform and be presentable and ready to work hard. Wendy's was very big on quality of the food and food safety. Also some morning's. I was expected to work from 4:00am unloading a truck and prepping food by myself ."
good,"It was a nice place to work and the customers were great, it's just some managers take your hard for granted. Also, it's under appreciated."
good,A typical day work is slow most hours but lunch is really busy. I learned how to work with others and be nice to customers. Management was ok to work with they tried to work with your schedule.The hardest part of the job is getting along with some people. To me there was no enjoyable part it was fast food nothing fancy.
good,"I hated working here, mainly because most guys would treat me different because I'm a woman. They would belittle me and make me feel as if I'm only there to pick up after them."
good,I really did not like it I did not like my pay I did not like working there the customers were the best to meet I do not like working there
good,"I ran the cash register, working with the customers was not bad. but it did have it's moments. I would prefer not to work in fast food ever again."
good,"management was not the greatest, management would sit in office and leave employees by themselves. i was a crewmember, wendys on harrisburg pike."
good,"This place gave me nightmares at night. They're always busy, you have to fight to get a break, and some of the managers are really tough to work with. Some of the employees made it all worth it, but often, it was too stressful to balance anything else."
good,Fast food does not put into consideration everything else in your life. for example i still went to school when i worked there and they would make me work from the time i got out of school till around 11 at night. Managers and staff start a lot of drama also
good,"Usually a mix of young and older coworkers. After 4 years, I can say micromanagement is usually an issue. However it's still still a fair place to make money."
good,"I have had nine hour shifts last twelve hours because of training heavily based on video instruction and very little time to train. I learned to handle multiple positions at a time because I was expected to. I learned that a job is not always worth the stress it creates, and a decent paycheck is worthless if you don't have time to spend it. My coworkers were the best part of this job. Customers and management were the most challenging part of the job."
good,"It's a job to get you through school. Awful management typically, once in a while you get a good, knowledgeable GM. Promotions and advancement is lacking."
good,"not enough hours managers were nice but i traveled very far for a 3 hr shift"
good,"When I was a crew leader at Wendy's Restaurant, New Liskeard, I had a great opportunity at taking an authoritative position. "
good,"working here was an experience. it was my first job in fast food. i learned alot. from time managment to customer service. the hardest part about the job was closing. cleaning the whole entire store every night at closing, you get tired but its worth it because we had a 100 from expecation every time. the most enjoyable part is going home from the busy dayy to rest my feet."
good,"A typical day at work is that of any fast food restaurant. You come in, clock in, and go to your assigned duties for that day. "
good,"Management sucks. It's just a minimum wage job with minimum skill and you work with minimal people. The hours blow too. No vacation, no raises, no chances for promotion."
good,"Work environment is less than idea for shifts, haven't seen a raise since I've started here (5 years) managers keep quitting and I'm being sent to different stores. I don't get paid vacation and there is too much stress for the pay. Not worth the time, effort, or money"
good,I worked here while I was going to college to help pay the bills. The pay wasn't great and I game home feeling like a grease trap.
good,good food but too many kids work here no hours and low pay they do not feed you and the managers do not work.the people are very rude
good,Was a great place to work as a first real job. Helped prepare me for a career later in life. Overall an enjoyable experience
good,"I come home stinky and irritated most nights. This place is full of drama and I don't like it. However, it gets the bills paid."
good,This was a fun place to work. I really enjoyed everyone I worked with. I also liked that I got a raise after I proved my place. My only issue with Wendy's was the difficulty to go to high school at the same time as working. It really took a toll on my school work for a period of time due to the long hours.
good,Awesome! Getting the chance to serve food and to appease the customers needs. I learned how to count money effectively. Lower Management needs tuneup. Co-workers are good bunch to work beside. Hardest part of the job is to tell a customer their card declined. Most enjoyable part of the job is to serve and to see the customers gratefulness afterward.
good,"While working at Wendy's, I found that a lot of the people I worked with were not very friendly to me (a coworker) or the customers. The workplace was clean because everyone pitched in to help keep it clean. There was a lot of tension in the workplace between managers and crew members. The shifts were very long with little to no breaks. The hardest part about working here was the hours. I would have to work up to 8 hours before I could get a 30-minute break. I was also a student at the time and needed fewer hours at work so that I could also focus on school. I told my employers this, and they said they would respect that. However, they did not. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job was sometimes getting to work with the few people that were kind and friendly to me. There was only a few of them, but when I got to work with them, it was nice."
good,"typical day:"
good,Great Memories but Its not for everybody. Great job for high school students and not for a college students trying to make a living.
good,"Very fun place to work, fast paced environment. Not enough pay. Staff was friendly and hardworking always aiming to reach goals. Staff was great at working together and training."
good,Make sandwhiches and run all stations covering breaks.  Clean up store and the end of the night.  Too much work for the amount paid.  Employees get 50% discount off food.  Can drink as much they like.
good,"Working at wendy's is like a circus.  Youre always going, going, going. There is always something to do in the hectic work environment.  I learned good customer service skills, as well as interviewing skills. The hardest part of the job is knowing that the customers are always right. I enjoyed working in fast food because of the hours and convenience."
good,work was OK. typical day would be clock in and straight to work. it wasn't much fun working there. management was terrible .
good,"cashed people out on drive thru and front line. i made food and drinks, cleaned the store. did stock.  did dishes. the customers were great. always smiling, and if they had a problem it was easily fixed. the management wasnt too great"
good,"I was the night/closer sandwich maker here, on a daily basis I made front and drive thru food orders which included burgers, chicken sandwiches, potatoes, and salads. I learned how to push myself and work fast under pressure. My co- workers were pretty friendly we were all just trying to get through together. The hardest part was doing both front and drive thru by myself during high demands or rush periods. The most enjoyable part was a satisfied customer and getting through the rush and having a moment to revamp."
good,As far as this job I wasn't to sure about this being that I'm not one that likes to work fast food but its a job and I did learn some things from this job as far as working with a team.
good,my typical day at work was bring on time and getting ready for the day. I learned how to make salads and how to make them right. the management was alright I got along with them. My co-workers were nosey because one snooped around in my purse. The hardest part of the job was that I didn't have any. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I didn't have any of those either.
good,"Fruita, Co - Though I enjoyed the experience that was given and the people that I met - and thankfully I knew - this is not a place that I would work at if I didn't know the people I worked with. There'll be lucky times when you can get along with everyone and a shift goes well, but there is so much drama that went on with the crew members the year I was there, and not enough people who knew what they were doing or how to do things. Also, our company timed our drive thru and if it wasn't up to par or better we would be penalized by corporate and our General Manager, even if it wasn't our fault. Corporate also changed the hours so that - the one in Fruita, Co - stayed open until midnight and everyone didn't go home till one in the morning or sometimes as late as two in the morning. That wasn't the GM's fault, they fought for an earlier close, but if you're a college student who can only work nights, then it's perfect for you hour wise, if you're in high school you're screwed. Also, the wages are frozen, meaning unless you're a Manager or a General Manager you're not getting any raises, any benefits, nothing but minimum wage. Lunch is not for free, you only get a 50% discount for one meal and nothing else. If you steal food and get caught, especially with the cameras, you're screwed and will be fired. If you decide to work days, the day crew is so much fun to be around, but there's always the Asian buses that come through - except during the winter - and the rushes that - in the summer - could be more than once. The best part is it's not like McDonald's where you have to sign"
good,"Arrive on time, assess relief areas, address supervisor with assessments and receive work station. Work at timely pace to achieve maximum productivity"
good,"Lack of hours given, lack of training. Balancing school and work is difficult since they schedule you at times you can't work."
good,They never had the schuchle up when it need to be. Nothing ever got down about problems. Management was unfair and rude. Management would swear at you.
good,This was a part time job while I was in High School. It did not pay benefits. The schedule  and hours varied constantly. It was a good learning experience and I made good friends. I also loved to deal directly with customers.
good,This would be a decent place to work if you only wanted to make money to have fun. I worked here along with another job in order to pay my bills while I was attending college.
good,"Fast Food, what more is there to stay about it?  You make food, are on your feet all day, and get little pay.  Little to no recognition for a job well done. Always told you're not fast enough While being told to do Too much.  But, its fast food.  Its an easy hire, for low pay."
good,Management lacks in some areas but excels in others. I learned how to handle management paper work and how to manage employees.
good,"Unproductive,over packed, under staffed always...."
good,"communication with customers, providing quality food service on a daily basis. Daily practice of teamwork, sanitation and safety."
good,"Serving food to customer's in a timely manner, you as the manager must show repespect to get respect from the people you work with. Hardest part of the job is missing your family activities because, you have to work"
good,"I would clock in and make sure that all the things from the previous shift are done. Then I would count drawer at the beginning of night, finish anything that didn't get done and make sure that everyone is there or call my manager. Assist in providing excellent customer service. And at end of the night I would count bread and drawer and call my manager to let them know what we did that night and clean up and make sure door is locked and alarm is set."
good,there isn't a day that goes by that my boss does not complain. employees constantly calling off and there are many difficult customers. but that has only improved my customer service skills.
good,"Even though the cash register kept shutting down, it was fun using math skills to calculate everyone order and made sure it was calculated correctly to make sure no one was over paying."
good,It's fast pace and you must know how to multitask to be successful. It's a fun place to work. The job is very easy but can be stressful at times. I meet a lot different people and this make job very interesting.
good,Decent opportunity for first time employees. Appreciated the opportunity to learn and to earn a salary while doing so. It was one of my first jobs and I still had a lot to learn so the opportunity was beneficial in more ways than one
good,"When I was hired on, they had let me train in another facility as the new one was being done. Once i moved over, i realized it was absolute chaos. They tried cramming so much ""new and improved"" in a smaller space and more of a ""maze"" like work place. Always hot and little to none job variation/rotations."
good,Any fast food job is primarily for teenagers or those just looking for an extra few bucks. Very hard and fast paced work that requires long days on your feet and multitasking.
good,A typical day at Wendy's would start off good until it was time for the morning shift to get off. To me it seemed as if they felt that since the schedule said for them to leave at 3 o'clock then they didn't have to do anything 10 minutes prior to them getting off so the next shift would have the responsibility of carrying on their duties along with the other duties that were supposed to be performed by the earlier shift. I learned that just because you have managers at a job that doesn't mean they're always going to be responsible and try to make sure that the customer's needs are always being fulfilled. The hardest part of my job was trying to get my coworkers to stay on task and to stop relying on other people to help them with all of their duties. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the customers leave satisfied with a smile on their faces stating how much they appreciated my customer service and desire to get their order correct in a timely matter.
good,"Most of my shifts are decent a couple exceed 8 hours. I get along with just about all my co-workers. There's a decent amount of management , meaning there's enough managers provided for the day to get the job done. My hardest part of my job is supervising other employees during my morning opening shift, because it is my responsibility if anything is done incorrectly. I've learned to work with various types of personality types in this work setting. My most enjoyable part of the day is when it gets busy and I can test my multi-tasking skills."
good,"Working for Wendy's I had fun there while I was working my manage and co-workers were very cool people, the only hardest part about working for Wendy's was across the street was a night club and every Friday and Saturday when we used to close at 2 am 1:50 am a lot cars starts to coming and ordering food."
good,"wendys was a great place to work loved talking to the costumers and doing everything in could to help them and make them happy"
good,My duties here included Scheduling and Staff management Hiring and Firing of Employees as well as Daily Bank Runs to deposit Days Money.  Also learned how to do Inventory and Ordering here which I loved to do. It was not a very Busy Store so the hours were long.  My GM here was a great Lady to work for and I learned a great deal from her.
good,"The people you work with are a mixed bag, some good mixed in with the bad. The work hours are flexible, as long as you don't get too many. Benefits aren't that good (minimum wage plus the occasional raise). Bright spots do exist in the management, but they are rare."
good,Limited amount of space for employees which caused mistakes and accidents. Management wasn't fully focused on his restaurant unless it was near closing time and the restaurant was near empty.
good,"maintaining a great working environment along with great customer skills, custom orders and controlling store money and employee timecards"
good,It was a nice place to work and get pay. I loved that they worked with you when it came to the school scheduling and that you will still be able to work and go to school
good,"I worked very hard for little money.  At times it was difficult when you had unruly team members or customers, but I had to keep my head together and remain focused.  I did not have a set schedule so I was all over the place.  I would work 10 to 12 hr shifts without even receiving a break."
good,"my store was franchise and I had the worlds worst owner. Dirty, angry, cheap, broke laws. Corporate is the way to got better pay less stress more room to grow."
good,"Work was always stressful."
good,i had a wonderful and knowledgeable experience with wendys
good,I'm glad i left that place..the hours were crazy they expected for you to close to 3am and open the next day 730am...
good,The customers and job itself is not hard. Maybe standing on your feet gets a little tough if it has been a long day. It's a job
good,"Working a fast food job of any kind isn't fun. A typical day consisted of a lot of work for little pay. The majority of the management was okay. There were a select few managers that were completely out of line. With the way they addressed problems in the kitchen, and another manager often made his bad day our bad day. The co-workers surrounding me were just fine. I did have friends there that made the job fun. The money and my friends being there were the only enjoyable parts of the job. Dealing with the language and attitude of the certain managers was the hardest part of the job. The thing that I learned is that a job is a job. You have to do what you have to do to make in life."
good,"rent a center is a different type of job. "
good,"no real benefits. management, at the time, was not well put together. hardest part was dealing with co-workers bringing personal problems to work and not very many hours due to how many employee's."
good,"Duties included opening and closing store properly, food prep and maintenance duties. Store manager was great. They showed me the proper way and steps of handling my staff and store. Co-workers were amazing, very one treated each other with equal respect. The hardest part at the time was working with others and different attitudes. The most enjoyable was the manager trusting me to take on my own crew."
good,"advancement with the company was questionable, management was not offered."
good,"Wendy's is a fast paced environment. I learned how to multi-task, work under pressure and work with amazing customers. I didn't like coming home smelling like grease, but I really enjoyed the customers."
good,"Typically required to keep the store clean, deal with customers and get their orders ready in time."
good,"Great place to work but no benefits for crew "
good,"when the restaurant gets busy, everybody gets frustrated and angry, I learned how to use a cash register"
good,"This job is fast paced."
good,i always had to work three times as hard to not fall behind because other people dont have a good work ethic.
good,A normal day consists of a 9-10 hours shift. Often you don't have enough employees or a bunch of teenagers. Upper management directs that we keep customers happy but still push them through the drive thru at a fast pace. Goals are unrealistic. Communication is poor.
good,"The upper managment for this company cared very little if at all about how happy the emplyoees are at home. Multiple managers are forced to drive 100+ miles a day round trip including about 3 hours drive time. Very little understanding that the emplyoees need to be happy at home also. They're consistintley unable to say ""thank you"" to the people that actually do the work, instead of sit behind a desk."
good,I was taking on my job description and 4 other employees and never got any recognition for my hard work. You had a lot of employees that were rude and cruel.
good,"A typical day at work consists of me starting my duties on whichever station I've been posted at (i.e. sandwich maker, cashier, drive thru cashier, bagger). I have learned a lot since I've worked there, not only about the product and the company, but about people and working on a team. Our management are not only good at what they do, but they are easy to get along with and reasonably fair. For the most part, I love all of my co-workers, and they make the job more bearable. The hardest part of work is dealing with unreasonable customers. Due to our location, we have a higher volume of these customers than other stores. It can make the day hard, but we do a great job at providing great customer service and stay sane at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I am good at it. Not many people can actually handle the customer service industry, but I can."
good,Good company to work for. Has many opportunities for advancement into upper management.
good,I learned how to be responsible as a teen. I enjoyed going to work after school. I enjoyed making money and buying things for myself.
good,This place was so bad. I dont understand how you can have so many poor managers. None of them had any customer service and they all wanted to cut corners. (no pun intended) Lets give away 4 hour old bacon and nuggets no one will know. I didnt learn anything at this place other than never to work in fast food again.
good,High demand ofcustomers. Learn more about marketing and new products. Management is real flexible. Hardest part is dealing with the customers sometimes. I love meeting different people and their different personalities.
good,"Help Manager the shifts, correct the employee's on procedures, and a leader for the employee's when head manager is not around"
good,I can't say that I didn't enjoy the job but as far as me actually making a career out of it. I couldn't. At the time it was the only thing that I could find to be honest but i'm thankful for the chance to help them in anyway that I could. I've never had any money problems working as a cashier and I had great customer service skills.
good,"its a good place to work at when u are in high school but once you graduate its really not that great the pay is horrible, plus there management is not so great either. but besides that i learned a lot of thing while working there i learned how to be nicer to people, and how to treat and handle certain type of people. the hardest thin about the job was dealing with lazy co-workers because in a job like that you need to be active and know what you are doing. the day at that job was fun when certain managers were working the shift i have to say when my favorite manager was doing the shift i was designated some days it was so much fun, most enjoyable thing about the job was making the food and making other people satisfied."
good,It was a job. I learned how to work every position so I was comfortable working there. However I did not like the management because they didn't care about their employees.
good,I was an asst. manager in charge of running daily shifts. At times it could be demanding.
good,I like working at fast food .I work with this company 10 years .i worked in different locations in brampton.where i was at the end i do not like the management team.
good,One of the top five employees! Absolutely loved making people happy in any type of way.The company was franchise and the owner lost the company.
good,"A typical day at work from 9:45 AM to 4:00 PM would involve me clocking in and making sure the cashier area is stocked and ready, especially for lunch time. I learned how to operate the cashier register and the grill as well as the fry station. The management at Wendy's is sad, I dont get any hours & the manager is rude. I get along with all the co-workers, some i know from school or threw family. There isn't any hard part, but the most difficult part at Wendy's iz cleaning the grill & draining & cleanig the fryer. What I enjoy the most at Wendy's is serving the food and seeing the customer happy."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of a slow morning, meaning not to many customers. Just stocking up and cleaning the store until lunch time. Once lunch and dinner times come we are more busy and have more service. During the day 2-3 managers are in the store working with the crew members. We work hard and still enjoy working together."
good,n/a i would rather not say any thing about this company . It had poor management and it was a franchise.
good,I liked this job. I enjoyed working with people. I enjoyed most of my co-workers as well. I liked constantly being busy.
good,"The hardest part of the job will have to be the customers. Customers are the hardest people to work with at times because of their impatient way of thinking about things and also their attitudes towards us as employees. They don't understand  the fast food business at all, but some employees we love to see come everyday! They make our day brighter, but overall Wendys can be a good and a bad place; you just have to make the best of it"
good,I learned how to work as an team with people in an work place..........not only that but to deal with so many different personalities............I really put my customer service skills to the test by being nice to mean customers ......On an typical day at work I would come in and everyone is angry............I would put smiles on some faces and others I didnt this would be the worst part of the day when comming in.........The most enjoyable part would be when I got busy and was able to put on my working skills.......at the end of the day when I would complete my job the correct way is what I enjoyed
good,this was the worst job i ever their management was horrible they really didn't know how to manage people
good,"running cash register, putting customers orders together."
good,I loved how they help with my school schedule. They were friendly co workers.
good,"  This is an alright place to work, but there isn't much job security and the pay is terrible!  If you like a fast paced job this is for you.  Good for those that just want extra cash, not to support a family.  Opportunities for advancement are limited to if you're one of the favorites."
good,Managers didn't care about employees and were very unprofessional
good,Lots of Laughs and good times working there. never a dull moment!
good,"As a cashier I took peoples food orders, gave them their change, and cleaned the required areas. The Management could improve. The co-workers were not trained properly. the hardest part of the job was trying to fix my co-workers mistakes. The most enjoyable part was giving the children their special meal."
good,"i was a cashier, okay place to work... It was a job, no room for advancement."
good,i liked working at wendys buit i didnt like the factr that dont promote..i was there for 3yrs andf only got 1 raise and i could hve at least become a teAM LEADER or something
good,"this palace was overly stressful, the management was off and attitudes were given both to and with everyone, there wasnt a day without a problem, the general manager was very nasty and aggressive to the customers, it was very disorganized, to be honest i would never advise anyone to work at this store"
good,Wendy's is a good job to get started with. I got to experience the other side of the counter. management is good. coworkers are good. the hardest part of the job is when you get a lunch rush.
good,"This was my first job and everyday I dreaded coming to work, because I really didn't like working in fast food restaurants. I was the fry person as well as working the grill. My managers were ok, but some of them were strict, but I still got along with them. the co-workers were fun, anytime it wasn't busy, we joke around and tell jokes about burger inventions and other fast food restaurants. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the vice as it got busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers."
good,Each day was a physical and fact pass day.I learned to be more open and out going with people.We had good management.The co-worker where fun and made the days go by a lot smoother.The hardest part was to make sure you where always nice to the customer because the customer was always right.
good,My normal day includes taking orders and putting those orders together and depending on whether I am up front or in the window I then pass it out to the customers. I use the register to take orders and collect money. I clean the dinning room and the bathrooms. I also work the fryers. I restock items behind the counter and on the condiment stand in the dinning room. The other crew members and I all work as a team to give fast and friendly service.
good,I learned that there is hard workers and people that work as a team make things so much better. And a simple Please and Thank you mean alot and go a long way. Feedback is always good either good or bad. I think it's great for everyone to get feedback.
good,This job kept me busy and I was often hot and tired from the slack work environment. I wouldn't recommend this job.
good,"was odd job, no promotion, working environment was good, co-workers were co-operative and friendly."
good,"A typical day at Wendys would be taking costumers orders, preparing food, working with others and cleaning. I learned how to work well with others and how to work at a fast pace. The management was very good they were very friendly and helpful. My co-workers for very fun to work with and be around. The hardest part about the job was how fast you had to be and if something wasnt done right you had to do it again, do it good and do it fast. What I liked most about working at Wendys was the people I worked with."
good,"Very stressful, very fast paced and lots of responsibility for your tasks and others"
good,*Managment issues on a daily basis
good,When I was there there went through 4 managers in 3 months and so many employees quit. They do not treat employees well and management is very scattered and too laid back.
good,"It was nice working at Wendy's; however, it is not a place to grow, or for advancement."
good,"I worked at 3 Locations of Wendy's. Some managers did very well at taking care of their staff, while others should not have been there. The work day was unpredictable due to some managers' inability to leave home at home and maintain a professional work environment. That said, Wendy's was not the worst place to work."
good,"the job its self isnt't bad. its the managers that make it bad, they want to be friends of employees instead of be the boss."
good,"i learned lots of things how to take orders in the drive thru ,communicating to a lots of customer and enhance sing my skills and knowledge."
good,"I worked at Wendy's because I was a full time college. Although, I did not have a bad experience at Wendy's, I beleive that Wendy's does not pay their employees for there worth."
good,"I worked there from time store opened to roughly a year later. I enjoyed the customers, the friends I made at work and the hours I worked. I only wish there would have been more 20 to 25 hours a week doesn't pay bills for a family of 4."
good,My job at Wendy's ( Land O' Sun Management) was very fast paced. The environment was interacting with customer's from all aspects.
good,"I only worked 2 months part time before leaving this job. It was basically what I expected it to be. On your feet, dealing with customers, everything was fast paced. I enjoyed working on the register."
good,I enjoyed working at Wendys as a summer job. I wouldnt consider it to be somewhere to start and have a career for.
good,"This job is fast food. I worked here for almost 4 years. We became like family. The district manager was the number one problem about this job. A typical day would included her yelling in front of customers, making her crew sound and feel worthless. I learned every position and was able to get to know the customers. Most of the customers were ""regulars"". My coworkers were like family. The hardest part of the job was working with the district manager when she stopped by and getting little pay and not enough hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the best team."
good,i always came to work 20 minutes before my shift & never got off on time. Wendy`s was my first job i was there for 4 years & took pride in my job! i was young and responsible . i learned a lot about the company and how they worked . the management was unprofessional they made us do there work. we had to learn everything they suppose to know .the hardest part of the job was to impress my head bosses . the most enjoyable part of the job was to see my customers come in & leave happy.
good,"Taking orders, making sandwiches, expedite orders, prepare salads, and any other tasks that needed done."
good,"Starting off at Wendy's was a great place to work. Then the tables turned. A typical day at Wendy's was every co-worker was about self. There was no team work at all in that place of bussiness. At Wendy's I learned how to have great people skills. Management there was very unorganized. Managers were never on one accord. Co- workers were about self. They never wanted to work as a team. What ever you were assigned to due was all they did. If they seen another worker behind they didnt help. The hardest part about Wendy's is inpection days. Everything in the has to be very clean. The best part about Wendy's is being able to make money,"
good,"I enjoy working at Wendy's, but I personally would rather a job that has more qualifications and that challenges my skills. I enjoy working with my co-workers, but it makes it difficult to work when other co-workers do not take the job serious."
good,Wendy's taught me patience as well as the joy of working with others. Wendy's is definitely a place to grow as far as working as a team. There is one downside of working to wendy's which is the minimum amount of benefits offered. Besides that I would definitely recommend this job to any young person looking to adjust to the working world.
good,At the time compensation wasn't bad. Tough job long hours. A lot expected for little.
good,Wendy's was a good job for someone in highschool. no room for advancement. job simply to keep money in your pocket
good,"Usually busy at work, I learn to stock food items and prepare foods, cleaning the store. Enjoying working with the coworkers. I'm fine with management."
good,"Very low compensation, minimum wage. Flexible scheduling that includes lack of hours. Co-workers are spiteful think they are your supervisors. Extremely fast paced and high pressure with unfair pay. Did not get a raise for 10 months."
good,"It all depends on store/ franchise/corporate, I have worked two different franchise owner's as a manager A large franchise and simple 5 store franchise. I prefer the small franchise simply for the fact you don't feel like a number and they take more time to develop you. Wendy's is one of those places that what you put in the store you get back."
good,I don't like this job very much because it is not a positive working environment. I also don't like the job too much because I had been working here for about 5 months and still haven't gotten a raise that the manager said I would get.
good,All the managers wasn’t well put together but all and all it was a good experience they just need to give their employees more hours. I wish some of the crew members wasn’t so dramafied and full of themselves and that some of the managers ain’t play favorites but it is what it is; just a job
good,"It's a good starter job. The location I'm at, most shift managers only give their responsibilities to the crew while they sit on their phones. GM good"
good,"Has its ups and down, didnt keep their word about a raise, but is understanding when things come up and you cant come in, fair management, fast past, good starter job"
good,Working at Wendys was okay The people that worked there made you not want to come into work. Management was playing favortism to workers.The hardest part about working here was the employees.
good,"I typically go into work and focus on my duties unless someone isn't doing their job, then its my responsibility to get them back on track. I've learned that hopefully jobs can be different, the work environment here is great when busy. Management is good, easy promotions, usually always looking for someone to move up."
good,It was good at first and I was having fun but people where getting lazy and stop helping me out. So that all I can say about that . Company there some lazy people
good,"This job is a great entry level position for any adolescent looking to get a good job. Opportunities for advancement into a supervisor is easy to achieve, which then open the door for future opportunities."
good,It comes with good experience for new workers. They do see you as more of a worker then a person due to all the task that need to get done. Good for people who can manage more than 3 task at a time.
good,I was a general manager for years. My boss was wonderful couldnt ask for a better one  they where caring understanding. Really needs a change of pace for pay and equality wages. I left because of that newer GM's made more than people who went through the mud with them. The culture was great good environment just not a hole lot of advancement opportunities for someone to move forward to progress with the  company
good,I really didn't see myself going anywhere with this company due to the way they did things. And the favoritism was one of the biggest problems there in general
good,"Hard work , customers made the day go by I encountered with genuine respectful people, my co workers also made it enjoyable but always put the customers first ! Recommend"
good,Wendy's is a job people use as a last result. Not fast paced. Managers want to be cool to their employees more than make them work. Pay rate is horrible considering how much they make.
good,"The store itself is a lot to take care of but I actually am more than capable on handling a store myself with a cool head."
good,"I wouldn't recommend this job just to anyone, but if you are in school and need e money in your pockets I'd definitely suggest this place. your checks will be around 3-4 some on part time."
good,Staff constantly arguing with each other and the gm doesnt treat her employees with respect.  There always is yelling coming from the managers and belittling employees.
good,"Wendys wasn't a bad place to work, it was a good first job while i was in school.  I didn't have many things to pay for or buy, but it was a good first job."
good,I learned to work in a quick environment so multi tasking is one of my strongest skills thanks to Wendy’s. Probably the hardest part of this job is working short handed but again that only teaches you to work quicker with a good attitude!
good,"Poor management  and rude coworkers , the customer were nice but I wish they would have work with my schedule  and I was being mistreated by my manager"
good,"I was employed for a short period. I quit due to owning my own business and the lack thereof management. Only one manager was half decent. The other managers played favoritism, they let employees get by with different things, they didn't enforce proper cleaning and hygiene. Overall I wouldn't recommend this job."
good,"The job was a ok job for a high school job  to have until you graduate  , I didn’t really like working around food and stuff and taking orders but it was something for the time being"
good,"A typical day at Wendy’s would be me clocking in, cleaning up, restocking, getting everything prepared for customers when we opened, serving customers, and helping others when I wasn’t busy."
good,My current job is a means to an end but with my family expanding seeking something better salary wise benefits wise and room for advancement. Hard worker fast learner grasp the concept of what your company is looking for and want from their employees.Reliable and never call or take unscheduled days off.
good,not the worst job i had but it's fast food. what does one expect? i need to fill the character count here more. so let me pad this out................ perfect.
good,the work was easy and was fun to meet new people there but there was a short hand of staff which made it a little more difficult to run efficiently while taking care of more than normal objectives
good,"Honestly, it wasn't that bad. In fact, I wouldn't say it was bad at all, it was exactly as you would expect a job to be. Their pay is horrible, and I never received a pay-raise but I can somewhat understand why. I did most of the heavy-lifting whilst working there, so I felt unevenly compensated."
good,"Wendy's was definitely an experience. I enjoyed working there, wasn't many benefits but the food was good, and my coworkers were nice. Management was hectic the whole time I was there, I went through about 5 or 6 general managers. But all in all I dont regret working there."
good,I didn’t feel valued or respected as an employee. It was difficult being the only girl at times at work. I was not respected by the male workers who treated me like an object.
good,"My time at the Wendy's Establishment had its ups and its downs. It did give me more skills and enhance the ones I had. I did have  few times where some employees verbally harass me and one who physicially assaulted me. I notified 2 of my managers and it wasn't addressed till I told my Head manager personally. The situation was handled but due to the lack of Privacy, everyone knew the situation as if it were first hand."
good,"Long hours working fast-paced in the heat of the kitchen, lots of customers, not great benefits. Management was great, though, so not all bad. Wouldn't recommend."
good,They over work u and under pay u. Depending on what store they will work u like u have no life. I have 3 kids and I never get time with them. But I need a job so we deal with it. But it hurts me so bad not to get time with me kids.
good,"As a crew member you have it pretty easy at Wendy’s, once you get into management they expect way too much from you and will dangle promotions to assistant and GM positions but you will never be good enough for them. "
good,"Wendy's gave me a lot to learn and think about. i came in with not a lot of food experience, but wends quickly taught me and helped me succeed. I am very grateful for my time there."
good,"The job was often overwhelming and stressful. It’s retail so customers contributed a lot to the negative experience I had there. When I left the manager messaged me on Facebook and yelled at me for being an awful employee, even though the franchise owner loved me."
good,"Busy work place, management doesn't tell associates anything, and if you're part time you get whatever hours are left over from the full time associates which most of the time isn't much."
good,"When I was 17, I applied for a job at a nearby Wendy’s, I was hired in but I only worked 6-7 months. I’ve never had an issue because I was quiet and kept to myself."
good,"Wendy's was very clean and organized. The hours were very spread out though. The management was very laid back and it was easy to get to know them on a personal level. The employees were very diverse, no one was very alike."
good,The work environment was very fast paced. The people in this environment were very understanding and were fueled by accomplishing the overall mission.
good,Its an okay job but not the best sometimes you barely get any hours and they like to over work certain people. The mangers do more watching then anything they can see you struggling and not help with jack.
good,It’s a fairly easy job long as you do what is expected of you. Horrible pay and mangement will tell you different rules. The most enjoyable part of the job is making new friends.
good,Managers did not train very well. Had to learn on the go with no experience. Did not give great hours and offered very few to part time workers. Other employees received higher pay for doing less work.
good,If this is your first job you will learn some skills to achieve for your next job. If you are in dear need of a job this job is for you if you’re able to achieve a better job go for the other job.
good,"was the worst job I ever worked at"
good,My first job ever ; Just to get my feet in the door. But the management in that store was unacceptable and incompetent. Its good for a temporary job but wouldnt recommend it as a career choice.
good,It is a very quick paced work place. Mutitasking is very common in this area.  it was always fun and I get to learn more every day. dealing with customers too is a must.
good,"Hiring manager at the time who is no longer with the company, was really understanding to the needs of her staff and crew members. If an emergency came up or they had a schedule conflict she arranged for them to have the time off. The crew was willing to help any crew member that needed it."
good,At least you get paid cause you have to pay for all the other benefits. You only get free food if your a manager which is ridiculous. So you could be a crew member there and work a ten or twelve hour shift which they will try to get you to do without a break if they can get away with it and they want you to do it without having to eat at all all day as well
good,Hard work fast pace smiling comes with the job drive thur times is important move the line while you have a smile on your face fast and friendly service.
good,i ask to work friday- sunday because i have school and they do not work with my schedule. then when i call out because i have school they tell me that its my last chance or im fired. not a good place to work!
good,"Overall, working at Wendy's did help me improve my communication skills. Not only that, but it was a safe environment to work at with a lot of friendly crew members, and managers."
good,"It was a practical job for a first job, however, it was too little pay if you had bills to pay. You can get the hang of it quick nothing out of this world."
good,"My experience at Wendy's I would like to say was fair, but it started off good, but then became a hassle. I'm still a teenager in high school at the age of 17, and I work more than most teenagers or coworkers at my job."
good,"They gave no training, only to look at a laminated sheet. They could do better with training. No one worked together. Everyone would mess around and not work due to the lack of cameras and ""laid back"" managers."
good,the job is very fast pace and requires a lot of standing but wendys is a very good first job and i would recommend it over competing fast food restaurants.
good,"Great place for high school kids or college kids to start with a first job. I would recommend this job , it was a good place to work. Management was good."
good,"They are a really easy place to work at, there is just not really a good way to move up and I don't see me making a career out of it. It is a good job to start out on."
good,Great place to start working for a high school kid. Work around any type of schedule given to them. Good place to work if your life schedule is all over the place.
good,"It was an easy and fun job, but at times where the restaurant got busy, the kitchen got a little too crowded and hot due to the burger grill and oil fryers."
good,Wendy’s in Shawnee is a Greet place to work but just needs better management. Overall the employees are very friendly and always on our feet ready to work .
good,It’s was a fun work experience but the hours didn’t correspond with my high school hours but it’s a fun environment with the people I worked with and the costumers were happy
good,"At first I really enjoyed working there oh, I enjoyed the fast pace and I enjoyed being able to train new employees into positions dealing with customers what's the part of your day to day routine and could sometimes be a little stressful because no matter what the customer was right. I specialize in training and developing Future Leaders but the company was not very efficient that's getting their Future Leaders trained they would very commonly just promote people out of desperation which would cause a lot of issues in the short-term and the long-term management was quite lazy and the district managers got away with a lot"
good,"Fast paced environment, especially when working the back register and having to wash dishes. I learned to use my breaks wisely. Easy job, stand on feet all day."
good,"The job itself isn't all that bad unless you don't like working around hot stoves all day, or fast paced work. I did have really good managers there until they were denied to move up, and so they left. After them leaving I had one good manager and the rest really bad. When he left cause the higher management kept throwing everything at him, we had terrible managers. I left once due to having to move. The second time was because of management, and the lack of being paid/insurance so I was trying to look for something that would make me more secure."
good,"I liked working here, paid me very well. Gave me lots of hours as a teenager. Very easy job, they aren’t asking too much from anyone. Nice people and good environment."
good,"Extremely busy location. Co-workers are very pleasant to work with however management can be downright abusive at times. As an older store, it is in desperate need of renovation and repairs;"
good,They are some what fast workers ! Wokring at this company u have to really stay to ur self n dont talk to no one but the customer inless u need help because they are some sometiming people there !
good,It’s a nice place to work. Everyone is so friendly. It gets too busy in a typical day. I learned how to take care of customers. The place is diverse to many people. Doing fries and taking orders. Coordinating.
good,"I enjoyed working with others, but unfortunately the pay isn’t very good. I just graduated high school and is looking for a higher paying job. Inorder to start my life as an adult."
good,"Short hours but fun environment, though management seemed disorganized at times. Employee's were friendly and interacting with the public provided a valuable learning experience."
good,Was a good place to work. Upper management isn’t very fair. I would work for them again under new management. Crooks right now. All the hours late night was no joke.
good,"A normal day at Wendy's is a fast paced work if someone is behind it puts everyone else behind,  I learned to do more then expected of you to show you can handle hours and the job environment"
good,"Wendy’s was a great place to work at, but they kept cutting my hours. Very hard to get to raise. When you got a raise, they would cut your hours, so u really never saw the raise"
good,"Always liked working in the food industry and I like meeting new people and having fun and making some money at the same time, I've worked with alot of great Managers and crews."
good,Good fast paced environment... Other employees are very fun to work with. Decent pay for working fast food.i just need something that pays more. And the food is great
good,I loved it at first but then it just became a bunch of drama and hatred. I enjoyed the people i worked with for a while and then some became very ungrateful.
good,"Wendys is a fast pace job most of the time and the wendys team works well together mostly. We are not getting paid enough for the work that we actually do, and sometimes the managers abuse their power, which doesn’t make it easy for the crew."
good,I wasn’t really fond of my experience at Wendy’s due to the unprofessional management . They didn’t pay me enough and refused to give me a raise when I was more qualified then some of the higher paid crew members. They would gossip about their employees to other employees and not follow certain protocols that were set.
good,"Wendy's is a very involved job, and you will have management constantly following you around directing you and asking you to do things you are already doing.  Management is very concerned with the cleanliness of the store, which is good; they often enter cleaning contests which require hourly crew members to engage in extra and intensive cleaning of cooking and ventilation equipment, though, and management receives bonuses for placement in cleaning contests, while hourly crew, who actually did the cleaning, receive nothing.  Management can often be quoted as saying, ""If you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean.""  "
good,"A typical day is packed with customers beginning to end with sometimes a 30 minute break and half priced food. the hardest part is the time limit on orders, and the most enjoyable part is likely the social interaction between coworkers."
good,Wanted more hours better pay just needed more money work is easy I just need more money and hours when I come to work all is good I like everybody but I need more money
good,"I worked here for over a year and was still on minimum wage "
good,"Wendy’s was a great place to get hours, but they pay minimum wage and you do have a lot of work to do. You might end up working 3-4 different positions, separately or at the same time if anyone calls out, which can be stressful."
good,"The Wendys in which I was employed displayed poor management, and was a very unorganized work environment! Customers were rude and disrespectful and employees were corrupt and immoral!"
good,My time working at wendys was absolutely stressful. It was extremely fast paced and the managers were unaware and somewhat rude towards me and others that were working there.
good,Wendy's was a good place to job I was happy with my job but I'm just looking for something new right now.wendys help alot of young people with their first job that was good too.
good,"I had days where I felt I was being picked on. Management was ok at first but new management has come in and pushed everyone out. It was a great first job out of high school but you cannot make a living off of what they pay. If you're a certain race, you are likely to not become management worthy."
good,We'd often help each other around but there was always those busy days and the team would just not be so great with trying to cooperate the correct way.
good,"You never got overtime, but I would work almost every day and still not get it. They would send you home early to make sure you didn't get it. There was hardly any balance between work/home life"
good,i worked at a Wendy's in cartersville Ga off highway 20 and i loved it. The Crew was great Management was reasonable. Now i work at the one in Calhoun and they don't really care about employees or because they are franchise they can pay you whatever they want and give you the most work possible with little recognition.
good,I barely had any work hours. they would have me off all week then call me in for one hour and tell me to leave. and i lived across town. the girls were also messy and the manager played favoritism. I left because I was in school and had to do externship.
good,It was ok I mean I never really had a problem I liked Wendy’s I just needed more times to spend on school etc. it was a face paced environment which wasn’t a problem with me but for others it might be
good,"Need more reliable workers and better management and staff needs to know how to to talk to employee "
good,The employees and two mangers made it a bad work experience..  I didn't mind the hard work or running around helping everyone while maintaining my position but some employees and mangers didn't appropriate anything..
good,like any fast food jobs; when its busy things tends ti get super busy in the kitchen but nothing out of hands. One machine keep breaking down. But i learn how hard it is to earn money. All in all it was a fun experience.
good,The crew itself was well mannered and worked as a team. The cleanliness of the store was very well kept. The hardest part about the job was being stuck at one position because your good at it and looked over when wanting to move up
good,"I cooked fries and mopped a floor, I cleaned off trays. In this job I really got the experience to handle customers and got to see more of the customers point of view."
good,"I had a proclivity for detail by the time I left this job. There were so many little but essential tasks I had to master, and the management was certainly instrumental in my skill development."
good,"Room for advancement. Steady employment. Good benefits. Good management model, but low wages make quality staffing hard to find. Tons of opportunity for growth and development of skills."
good,Wendy's was my first job in High school. It was a great place to work getting out there for the first time. the co workers were great. Hardest part was trying to not eat the food every day
good,Upper management is never there to help when needed they dont want you to succeed unless you are a friend or somebody they can use and if they are using you they run you dry
good,"Your Work Hours Can Vary..."
good,"I didn't enjoy working at Wendys. Some managers were nice, but the general manager always found something wrong with whatever I was doing no matter how hard I tried. She wasn't very motivating, didn't enjoy working with her. Its very very fast paced and from my experience; dirty. Probably wouldn't recommend unless you know lots of people that work at one to make it fun."
good,Very flirtation management. It's like working in a day care with disrespectful over grown children. Picky team players  fraternizing through entire staff including management.
good,some days were slow some days were fast and some days were overwhelming and tiring but the employees were young and fun. some of the managers were terrible.
good,it was ok easy work the employes were nice and fun to work with the main down sides were a lack of hours and how little the pay was other than that it wasn't too bad
good,"There is no typical day while working at Wendy's. I have learned a great deal about how important it is to have patience, whether it be while working with a customer or while waiting on orders to be filled. There are numerous different leadership styles that have come and gone throughout the store, and I have learned that not one style is similar to the other. The culture that surrounds Wendy's depends on what type of day it is. Morning shift is more laid back and relaxed, whereas night shift is more rowdy and alive. The hardest part of the job, for me at least, is getting everyone to work together as a team. Fast food is not a glamorous job by no means, however it can be a fun experience when all your team members have each others backs. The most enjoyable part about working at Wendy's is seeing my regular customers and seeing their smile when they know that I am working."
good,"A typical work day is busy every moment. There is rarely a break between customers and there is always something to do, between restocking to cleaning the lobby and other tasks depending on position."
good,it was an all around bad work experince. The pay wasnt bad we got free food. the people were nice in a very fake way. i enjoyed being a fry cook. it was ok
good,"Overall, a great place to learn how to communicate with customers and employees. You learn valuable skills on how to handle irrate customers and resolve any issues or complaints they may have."
good,"Very few times I was recognized for going above and beyond. "
good,"Did not see potential of motivating management, Had a specific learning program, but wouldn't let those that learned quickly advance. "
good,Very fast paced but don't get very many hrs and sometimes it can be very stressful but overall it is a wonderful company to work for and they also have alot of rewards for their employees so that helps u stay modulated and u have to learn every position there is in the entire store which is a really good thing to be cross trained just in case u need to fill in for another employee
good,it was temporary I learned cashier cooking cleaning I came to work some times I would be at the widow taken order most of the time I was in front taken orders
good,Everyone was always happy.  The days there taught me well.  Fast paced work environment. Enjoyable place felt welcomed everyday. Amazing customer service. B
good,I literally have to do everything by myself because everyone else is always outside or in the back on their phones. And the manager wants to get mad at me when im just standing there doing nothing but so is literally everyone else. Like im sorry im doing 15 things at once and deserve a 10 minute break.
good,"Great restaurant love working there , enjoy my coworkers and the managers , happy that I get plenty of hours .. fun working environment  . The owners are really nice also"
good,at the beginning of a day at wendys it could be slow but over time it has its fast pace. since its faces paces it can get frustgrating at times because I need to keep beef up and drop chicken.
good,This was my first kitchen job and I had a good time working there. The management was great and if you called out they'd cover you. The co-workers were awesome. It was a fun place to work.
good,Working with them the time I have that's all I did was work 12hr shifts 5-6 days. There was a shortage of managers and I was placed at three different locations then they added a fourth one and I decided that this was too much.
good,"This job is kinda fun and it has a very flexible schedule, but at the same time it's very poorly managed Make sure they don't use you, cause they will"
good,You have to work well under stressful situations as well as able to multitask. Good costumer service is also a must in order to keep costumers satisfied.
good,I check my schedule make sure im staff for that day. Review paperwork and deposit. Make sure all equipment is working properly. Then i start a small huddle with the crew to inform them on our daily goal for today.
good,"I got work experience as well  as cash experience so it was a good first job. Would not recommend if you are just wanting a job because you have to do alot of horrible jobs and deal with a lot of customer service (angry customers, police etc)"
good,Working at Wendy’s was a great experience at first because I was learning things that I didn’t know how to do  but after like 2 or 3 months  in the job everything start going downhill because of the area we was in a lot of things happening it was affecting the workers and management They were starting to get bad comments from customers about the food and the customer service
good,Working at Wendy's is a challenging experience because there is a lack of support when doing the job and I am heavily depended on doing most of the duties involving preparation of the food. I would only recommend this job to the inexperienced workers to harden their abilities to handle stressful situations.
good,"A typical day at work was very fast-paced and stressful.  I learned how to work as a team better.  The management was pretty poor, there was only one, maybe two, good managers. The work culture was stressful and unfriendly."
good,Working here is great place to enter into the working field if you have no work experience. Hours and management can be very strict if the restaurant is busy.
good,"It definitely was something that was temporary, was told I could never make more then 7.50 as a crew member. The environment was doable but very fast paced and stressful, it was good for small income as a high school student, but you would have to work inhumane hours to make a living as a crew member."
good,"Although the workload was to be expected, the lack of care from other employees and the management was abhorrent. I'll admit that not all Wendy's are like this, the time I spent working at the one in Hilliard, Fl gave me a negative view of the company as a whole."
good,The Wendy’s company is good for teens in or just coming out of high school. But with the low wages lack of benefits it makes it hard for a person with responsibilities to stick with this company
good,"Very childish people, they have favorites and lack respect for their team. Team work can be very challenging because they lack order and the ability to keep workers on the floor, Bad management and to invested in associates personal lives."
good,If you have responsibilities do not work here. This is a good job for a child to start off but not an adult. This job did teach me how to work at a fast pace. The management always did what they had to do to make sure every one worked as a team. The pay is barely minimum wage and no one can live off that unless you don't have any rent or bills.
good,"not big on training,hey hire you and then show you some things but it is like they dont want to show you all the jobs duties.  I like working with people and training them.  I fell that you can train as you go.  But like i said they dont like to train in the right ways."
good,Not a company to try and start a future at no room for growth. They don't pay employees enough or get treated right. Ask for a lot from you with no incentives.
good,"The job itself is fairly easy if you're given the time to figure it out. Quite often you're not trained and just thrown into position. The people are pretty chill though, the managers are mostly willing to work with you if you have a problem, but there is a huge favoritism problem there. The biggest downside is that you're paid as low as they can manage it and make it a point to not let you have over thirty hours (unless, of course, they are suddenly short staffed, then they have no problem piling fifty hours on top of you with no days off for weeks at a time)."
good,"When I started at wendys I loved it but within the past 2 months 3 managers quit 4 employees and now me. The new managwr is horrible and doesnt try at all to work with the current staff, shes ride and trying to run everyone out. I worked 50 hours a week when everyone quit for a whole month with not even a thankyou. Just my hours cut"
good,"It was a horrible place to work  at for my first job, allot of harassment, picking favoritism and horrible management. Not a very clean place either.."
good,This survey is optional yet it's mandatory is rate the company.. That's ridiculous. Also we have to write a review? You're doing too much now. So nope
good,"I heard the manager say he wouldn't hire black people because they won't do their job, but he hires all the hispanics in the world. He drops your hours to give it to them if you are not a hispanic."
good,"Personally, my experience of working for Wendy's while I was also in highschool was an experience, to say the least. I did not hate it because there were a lot of kids that worked there my age but I did not enjoy it because the managers thought that just because they were in a position of power.It was okay to belittle certain employees."
good,"The management is never consistent and they do treat people differently according to who they like  more. Everyone is trained with the same goals and smokers are allowed more breaks than non smokers, generally leaving averyone else stranded when it gets busy"
good,The work was very stressful. Many long hour days consecutively with few days off. The store that I worked at had a great management team which made it half way decent to work there.
good,"when i first stared at wendy’s i promised a manager position . leaving my current job at taco bell was a horrible mistake . i didn’t recieve any greater benifits . i wasn’t compensated for my travel of 1 hours to get there daily , and i do t feel i was treated fairly , only because i was new . Although all wendy’s are different . i have a totally different on the business and do not wish to ever employ with them again"
good,Management was horrible. Any one and everyone was hired. The manager sat down all day while everyone did what they wanted to do. The hardest part about the job was the coworkers. No one ever did what they were suppose to do and always under work.
good,Working in our branch is kind of annoying because we always lack one or two sometimes 3 people per shift. Its fun tho when you know who are you working with
good,I was a cashier/cook at Wendy's for about a year and a half and it was quite and experience. Horrible treatment from both customers and management....
good,"Wendys does not give"
good,"nothing to write, this would be a good job for a teenager who is out of school and someone who would like the extra cash, management could be better, and working with the right staff could be better"
good,I've learned how to work well under pressure. My team at Wendy's is not always large but that just pushes me to become more efficient. I like the fast pace and generally enjoy making other people happy.
good,This job would be great for someone who is still in high school and looking to make easy money. The job is not hard. All you have to do is take orders and clean. Job advancement is possible for those who want to stay in that line of industry or just gain experience of management and then moving on.
good,My manager was amazing every sweet but the job was terrible I don’t recommend it to many people but as a first job it does the trick but as along term it’s not the best
good,"It was a decent first job for a teenager. The environment was pretty good for business everyday of the week, since the high school was  a block away and for four periods there were always students meeting up for lunch. Even after school. But as far as the work environment itself, poor management pushed me away."
good,I was never impressed with how little most upper management cared about most situations. They could care less about how stuff gets done or by who so they will pass whatever on to whoever they can.
good,Had a good time working here but it got busy and the help wasn't always there. Overall though was a good work environment and a great time with the right people.
good,"I still enjoyed working there, the people were great and I learned a lot. But the pay and work environment was terrible. Managers were rude and didn't care. Especially the general manager."
good,cooking all the different verietis of food waiting on customers. I also took on the resposibility of keeping the stock updated and placed orders for new stock
good,I kinda like working at Wendy s it was a fun job the manager was nice my coworkers we're very kind and it was fun environment even tho it was fast I move pretty fast so it good.
good,"Working there is fun and easy and easy to learn,  management  was poor there and hiring only there family really messed up the crew and the balance  in the team"
good,"Worked minimum wage in a big expensive city so it wasn’t that good in terms of pay. The manager I worked for was pretty unprofessional, but overa Wendys might be good for part time students"
good,"This was my first job and ultimately disappointing. Customers are generally mean-spirited. Sometimes they're creepy. I've gotten multiple creepy comments on my eyes. Overall, I'm expected to do so much for very little pay. I have to take orders, organize orders, handle complaints, clean the dining room, clean the bathroom, change the trash in the bathrooms, change the trash in the dining room, clean the soda machine, clean the ketchup dispensers, stock the condiment stand, mop the floors, etc. I have to do all this for minimum wage. I don't want to sound like I'm whining, but sometimes it's simply overwhelming and the lack of money is disheartening."
good,"I have worked in a lot of fast food jobs over the years, but working here was the worst experience i have yet to come across."
good,If you’re in need of a job come and get it it’s easy but they make you work . It’s not always a good team and no one works together so you have to work hard
good,"overall its a good place to start for young people but to make a living i wouldn't suggest it, it has its moments where its crazy like during rush hour"
good,Pay rate was low for the amount of work that had to be done. The work environment was fine and you’re able to meet different people due to customer sales.
good,It was a very stressful job. I was made promises that were not kept. I did not make enough money to support my daughter. I was very good at what I did.
good,"The job was demanding,but the Managers were great. It was very fast paced, very busy, I did receive meal discounts. I did get to do several different jobs there, if I could've received my pay raise I might have tried to stay."
good,"The managers were rude and hard to deal with, all but one. The crew members were amazing to work with and I had no problems with them, the customers were awesome and dealt with us having hard days, slow days, or off days. They always knew if one worker was off because they are regulars."
good,I feel like the Wendys that I worked at had good people but most of the workers were not really motivated but again they are really good people. I didn't see any job advancement there and I felt like it was a dead end job for the most part but it is a great place to start and build your working experience. I would recommend Wendys to people between the ages of 16-20 or for people that need a first job and to get them started.
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Wendy's was the look of satisfaction on customer faces. Friendly vibes for the most part. Great customer service experience gained.
good,This job is too over baring  as well as not having many weekends off as well as no social life. The gm is too much to handle and not a good general manager . The store is very unorganized and always running out of things we need.
good,It was a fast paced environment and an easy job but does not provide the pay I would like or need. The management also was/is not very friendly. They were not able to keep staff for very long due to this it was always changing.
good,difficult if you can't handle stressful situations; you must be calm when there are many customers at once. i don't plan on working at fast food again
good,"Poor work environment. Pay raises are mediocre at best, advancement opportunities are limited. Work environment is highly stressful and management does little to provide comfort for employees."
good,it was stressful because it was a fast food restaurant and you had to be quick paced and also that the management was poor.  everyone that worked there were not really getting along or weren't that much of team members.
good,"Wait on customers. Take order. Prepare orders. Cook"
good,"My job skills were learned from co-workers with management coaching once and telling me to watch co-worker who was leaving, I  would be his replacement.  I was given keys and told to set up every day to include; cleaning dining area, bathrooms, prepping vegetables, meats, fries and making chili. I also made tea and lemonade. I received one raise in 3 years."
good,"Wendy's was my first job"
good,"good for a person with no bills to pay no kids and no life or a high school student. also, managers don't care about employees they only care about their labor percentage. "
good,Very fast-paced. Competitive wages. The hardest part of the job was coming to work everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving work everyday
good,"I liked working their but its not something I would make a career out of, the people where friendly and the  food was great , it was also a very clean place believe it or not"
good,It was a great job for the moment. It's was just short hours or not enough hours for me and I had to stop because I relocated to my dad's. It's w great job for a young aldut
good,"I got this job fresh out of high school, and it was good while it lasted. I enjoyed the opportunity. A typical day at Waxahachie Wendy's was I got there around 11 a.m., and either went to second window, back cash, or worked the front. All positions were difficult at first, but i quickly adapted. My favorite part about the job was working second window. You got to speak with the customers and engage with them. Around 11:00 a.m. is when lunch starts to get busy. It's super busy until about 1:30 p.m., and things begin to run smoothly again. I left most of the time around 5:15 p.m.."
good,I worked a variety of shifts.  Usually I worked the closing shifts.  I managed mostly teenagers.  Most of the time this was their first job.  I left to move to California.
good,"Fast food isn’t for me , I want to work in a place where there is teamwork and everyone is working efficiently. I did not get that from Wendys, the schedule was so unorganized and they lack teamwork."
good,I worked at Wendy’s for five years. You have to be willing to work in order to keep your job and be willing to put up with a lot of hard work.  But all in all I had fun there.
good,"I've worked at wendey's for a year and 5 months and have seen useless workers which includes friends of mine to get fired but only after they get chance, after chance, after chance. It has a culture which brings the worst out of people who abuse the managment, as well as a managment which is much to nice to fire a bad/abusive worker at sight."
good,"Wendy's was never my first choice for a job. I knew that it would be a stressful job, but I couldn't find a better alternative. It had very few perks and the pay was certainly not one of them. I was forced to relocate to a different Wendy's store so I decided to leave the job. I want to work with new people and face new challenges elsewhere."
good,"Its a nice part time job for school students. The checks are always convenient. Sometimes it could be a little hot and tiring, but I still feel as though its a nice place to work."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with. Everyone worked hard together and acted professionally.My boss was understanding and I had worked decent hours. Overall, It was a good experience."
good,The overall experience is great. The management and other crew members depends on the location and that's what really depends on your experience. In any job there has to be a non hostile work environment.
good,"Very laid back at times, customers are very stressful and work can be repetitive without training. I enjoyed those that I worked with at times, though temp managers did not preform management well."
good,Wendy’s wasn’t the worst job ever. It’s fast food what do you expect. But the management could’ve been slightly nicer when it came to treating their employees like they’re animals
good,"Wendys was great fun for the first few months but the last two months made me dread going to wendys every day. I wanted a new spot like somewheres on the grill because i could not take orde taking anymore. I was tired of it and wanted something new and no one was willing to take orders. That’s why i ended up quitting Wendys, in pursuit of a better job with better pay and an overall better environment."
good,Not really a fan of working for this company. Pay wasnt great either for all the work put in. Too mamy hours and awakward ones at that. No family time ever.
good,I would say wendys is  great for a first job. However if your planning on staying long term i would recommend you dont. Wendys is a company who tends to take advantage of their employees/managers. They only do what benefits them.
good,"Wendy’s is a good friendly, quick with service most of the time. Some of the managers are really good others aren’t. The food there is good very clean."
good,"It's an okay first job. It's pretty stressful at the one I work at, I don't know about other stores though. It's very fast-paced and there's not a lot of training either."
good,It’s a challenge working in a fast food restaurant because everything is done an a speedy fashion you can sometimes make mistakes when your speeding so you just have to take your time and be patient everything will come together
good,Job was very unorganized and under staffed. It was very hard to have a smooth shift when didn’t have enough people to complete the shift. Things just weren’t well organized or thought for the prior supervisor
good,"Wendy's was my first job. It was great at first, however the more I learned the harder it got. I soon learned that we are understaffed most days and our management was poor. Our manager would schedule those unable to work. For an example, a coworker who broke her wrists. Another example would be when I was out of state for two weeks, I was still scheduled even though it was written I was out of state."
good,"Very routine based, learned communication skills, constantly on your feet, hardest part is multitasking and time management, enjoyable to put a smile on customers face and meeting their needs"
good,Well my day at work it was fast paced.Very busy. I learned where everything was placed at. I learned how to take orders. The most good part about this job is when you about to get off.
good,"I had never worked in the fast food business before , so the most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to work at different stations in the store. I actually enjoyed working there besides the constant favoritism."
good,"Wendys was fun sometimes, most of the time we were very busy and always trying our best to be quick and neat. Most days were harder than others but we always worked as a team and did the best we can to satisfy our customers."
good,Yet another good job just bad managers one would tell you one thing and then they would go to someone else and say the same thing I was told I would be manger for 3 months and then I was off for a few days I go into work the next day and someone who was there for 2 months got made a manger
good,i enjoyed my time at my location personally. The team was welcoming and there was no drama. The breaks were fair and so were the discounts. Great Job.
good,"Fast paced working environment. Everyone works as a team to communicate on the daily. Will get trained on all positions if your speedy enough. Overall, a good first time job for the experience."
good,"Wendys is a great place to work while you are in school, friendly work environment, fast -faced  especially around lunch time. Their is really not a real hard position at Wendys, if anything you have to know about how much serving of each product you want to baked so you wont waste a lot of the product. I learned how to work with different customers and how to time myself on giving fast service"
good,"I would say i typical day at work was pretty much easy. It was fast paced and time went by fast, at times the management team wouldn't help but once you got everything down in your head it was pretty easy to run the shift. I've learned a lot of things from Wendy's like how to run the shift and how to compromise with customers that weren't pleased with the service."
good,"The job was very fast paced and unprofessional. I would go in and have to jump on duty, because the managers were slacking. Sometimes, I would forget to clock in because they are so behind as I start my shift."
good,The managers where terrible at customer support and would hardly satisfy their needs in a situation. Other times they would be selectively giving out manager discounts to employees based on their race.
good,"it was not a bad start giving that it was my first job. However their raise system is not so encouraging, 10 cents every six months if the manager responsible remembers. i appreciated the opportunity though."
good,"I worked in a really bad shop, even the owners told us we were the worst Wendy's in the area. "
good,"minimum wage just isn't enough for me. in high school it was cool, but its an easy fast food job choice. cool workers. job just couldn't work with my schedule after awhile."
good,"Not a very good company as far as benefits. They offer very few and insurance is very high, 401k is not matched so you pay 100%. Never seen a bonus the whole time there even though they said we could get them."
good,Great place to work for a teenager. I left to  another job with better pay and benefits. I had fun working and learned alot. It was my first job. I loved my manager. I would recommend to any teenager.
good,Wendy's is a great company to work for. although all stores have different employees and the employees are a big part of how the job is. A typical day at Wendy's is very unpredictable you never know what to expect.
good,"I dont have much to say, they are a good place to work with, very fast paced and the works likes to have a laugh. and have fun to work with, they always keep a smile"
good,like any fast food chain wendy's  is a decent starting point for many young people entering the work force sub par management and job culture being two downsides in particular
good,hours picked up during high school so when i graduated i did not have a life except for the friends at work.  would not recommend to a career oriented person
good,"While working at Wendy's I learned how to deal well with stress and how to work well under a fast pace environment. I enjoyed working with the co workers and some of the managers. But, in the time I spent working there I was put in positions that I wasn't trained for so I had to teach myself because of the poor schedule every week. The head manager wasn't very nice and I didn't think that she handled stressful situations very well. Even after I quit working at Wendy's I still go there to eat and I hear the managers talking poorly to the staff that now work there. I loved working there at times, with certain people, and the food is always great. I just think that the management was very poor."
good,You'll never really know how to handle people or work fast food if you can't keep up with a pace or learn  how to get a certain amount of items out in under a certain amount of time.
good,Always busy and very face paced. Teamwork plays a big part at this job without teamwork everything will not fall in place. Make sure the customers leaves satisfied and happy at all times.
good,Wendys is a good place to get started. But I would not recommend it has a long term career path. The pay is very low for the work that youn are expected to do.
good,"ITS GHETTO BUT VERY BUSY AND FAST PACED, they do not let you get free lunch , they will cut your hand off if you eat one fry lol , some ppl are better to work with there then others will have u in the store till 4 am when they close at 1 am very stressful at times"
good,"- you get to be on a scedule with some of your friends"
good,"employees never want to show for shifts a lot of times we work short handed, easy to move up if your in good favor with bosses, just do the minimum to get by and you will do great"
good,"I didn't like working at Wendy's simply because of the pace and the pay,totally not worth it and wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE.The only plus side was getting a break if you work more than 5 hours,but it wasn't worth it."
good,"To begin the management was ridiculous, the manager(s) never had any good ideas to help their co-workers out including the little tings. For example, there was only one way to find out the days and hours you worked, and that was with a printed out sheet taped on the inside of the managers door, which was always closed with the manager in the back doing nothing, including when we needed help up front when we were extremely busy. No good communication was ever in play while I worked there, and I believe its is because how negative and anti-social our managers were. Now there was a single manager that knew what they were doing, also the one who had hired me, who had been relocated not even a week after I got on board. From then it went more downhill than imagined."
good,"The store was unorganized and dirty,There was favoritism shown to certain employees by the managers. There was also free food given to family members of the mangers and employee discounts."
good,"Wendy's was alright in the beginning, then about a month after starting I became dreadful of going in. They put me in positions I wasn't trained in and had me do things that weren't even in my job description. Most employees are treated unfairly and there is a lot of drama."
good,Fast paced environment but your work becomes almost like a home away from home. I have  grown to love it and hate it over my 2 years of being there. The regular costumers are what keeps going when i feel like giving in and giving up.
good,Very high paced with not enough associates to properly execute per expectations. Introductin was good to the work place and new relationships that I formed will probably last for some time.
good,They told me they would raise my pay rate. They neglected to make that happen. They were still paying me as a crew member instead of a manager. Then people would be late all the time especially the managers.
good,"No consistency in scheduling "
good,Long hard hours for low pay. Many times working with a skeleton crew and have numerous extra duties placed upon those working. Some of the managers were a pleasure to work with.
good,"Working at Wendy’s has its Pros and cons,but overall Wendys would be a better place to work at if the employees would come to work,and if things where a bit more organized."
good,I enjoyed working for Wendy's.  I learned a lot about managing people.  Also making deposits and food safety.  My favorite part was being able to interact with the customers.
good,"Its a fast food restaurant, so it sucks its a dead end job that will got you nowhere you want to go in a long term career. The day I quit was the most enjoyable part."
good,"it is different then most fast food places, due to the slowness of business, and lack of menu choices vs other food places, the pay is a lot less for employees due to that reason"
good,"a typical day at wendys is usually fast pace and lots of movement. "
good,"not the best but not the worst, could be better but every place could be better. it's a nice place to go for a quick burger but not a nice place to decide to make your forever job."
good,Wendy’s was an interesting place to work . I learned a lot while working there. It’s fast paced and always busy. If you have a good crew and manger your shift should run soomthly. But if you dont the job it self would give you a run for you money but. I wouldn’t want to make a career out of it.
good,Wendy's was a very good job they took a chance on me when nobody else would and I appreciate the Wendy's family so much and if I could get my job back I would love to work there again
good,"Learned how to use deep fryers, cash register cleaned lobby and got better at my people skills. I left because we moved and also it took about a month and a half to get my first paycheck."
good,The crew members were friendly to get along with an the pay was ok but cant live off of it . you get to meet great customers an get a meal but no benefits offered
good,It was just a simple after school job very fast paced. Compensation was low and job security was low. Work done and accomplished was a hassle dealing with irate customers and management barley worked.
good,Wendy's is a good place to work being in high school or early college but you eventually need to get away from there or they will try to keep you there. They only offered me a .50 cents raise and I was one of the best employees they had.
good,"A good first job. The mangers are hit and miss and the work culture could use some work, but an overall laid-back place to work. New employers are not adequately trained and often short-staffed."
good,"Around noon it will start to get super busy both inside and at the drive thru.For the most part, the manager I had worked with my scedule with me being in high schol when I was at the time."
good,required to work 12 plus hours a day no balance between work and home life. district manager only cared about himself and not any of his employees. wouldnt fix any issues with shift managers and upper management. general mangers at certain locations didnt assist with shift managers and crew members during busy hours of the day.
good,"it is ok you can work there for a teenager, ok it is  you work like you work at any other fast food restuarant it is a fast pace. you have to be on point in the drive thru. You have to be willing to  ork and move around at a decent pace and quickly"
good,"In general, Wendy's is a good place to work if you are young and starting your first job. It can get fast-paced at times, but it keeps the day going. You make connections with some regular customers, which is kind of fun, and you learn how to effectively manage your time."
good,"hated the environment "
good,It was okay overall but it seems like a job for young students who may have graduated a few months before working there. Not reliable to pay the bills that’s for sure
good,A typical workday consists of multitasking between cleaning and maintaining product for customers. I've learned that working together and efficiently allows for the tasks to get done faster with better quality.
good,At Wendys it wasn't that bad but i can say that the Wendys i worked in had a lot of inside drama with my co-workers. I worked hard and most of the time in silence because i wanted to stay out of any drama in the work place.
good,Wendy's is better than nothing. It's alright for a temporary job. Nothing I would want to stay long term at. It's not terrible but it could be a lot better.
good,Managers weren’t very professional they showed favoritism. You had to basically be available whenever someone else would call in and if you said you couldn’t go in if they needed you the next time you worked they would treat you bad and sometimes even cut your hours for the next week.
good,It is just fast food with inconsistencies and the ups and downs. It is not a job that I would reference to anyone but it is something that may help pay the bills.
good,It's for teenagers I would only recommend this job if you absolutely need one I thought the managers I worked for erected mature enough for the position
good,not enough staffing and sometimes the management isnt as great as it should be. managers go out and sit in the lobby when they are supposed to be working or they go out for smoke breaks and leave the crew members with no mangers in the store.
good,"Working at Wendy's teaches me how to handle a variety of customers. I learned how to be self-disciplined and manage coworkers without a manager present. The hardest part of the job is working short-hand and reaching service time goal but, the best feeling is knowing I did my part to help my crew members and customers have a great day."
good,"It was a great place to work since all of the cooking was pretty basic, and it was the first food place I'd worked at that had been so simple, the cleaning tasks were the only things I didn't like, and that was a first."
good,Wendy's is a job for teens. If you are an adult looking for work to pay bill wendys is not it. I live at home with my parents don't pay for rent and barely food. Yet I can barely pay my phone bill and my car insurance off of them. Plus they work you to the bone fro only 8 an hour.
good,"I was work at Wendy's for 1 year and 3-4 months."
good,"At first, I did enjoy my job. After being promoted to Management, all of the stress was put onto me and one other. Whenever we tried to talk to HR, they put our concerns aside. The higher ups never fixed anything unless it related to them personally. I enjoyed working with people, and greeting the guests. I learned how to have a lot of patients while working there, and it is a decent beginner job. After two years, it was just time for me to find employment elsewhere."
good,Overall the job wasn't so bad it was Just stressful to be productive through all the mess. the workers wasn't as bad as the managers. A typical day work be busy during the lunch rush then die down
good,"a typical day was making nuggets and burgers. also making fries an and chicken patties. Had to help out an yone who asked for your help, the hours I was given really sucked but the managers at my wendys at least were pretty cool"
good,"the managers keep changing every year including the gm. the crew members are split in between two groups either morning or closing. most crew members do not cross this line. they are constantly hiring new crew members on such a regular pace that many crew members are eager for call ins. that being the case the managers are able to get minute late shifts covered, missing hat shift covered and so on. the task are easy to learn the shift positions are made simple to help new hires learn quicker. this is a great job to hit the ground running in."
good,"A typical day starts with clocking in and stocking the workplace for the day. I've learned to easily cooperate with others, maintain stress during rushes, and accurately serve customers in a fast-paced environment. Management is poor, very hard to earn more hours and no other benefits except employee meal discounts. Workplace is constantly fast-paced, and tedious if some errors were made. Hardest part of the job is to maintain and complete numerous orders, and to be aware of sudden changes. The most enjoyable part is meeting lots of friendly employees who work together as a team, and earning the trust of many customers by months of accurate service."
good,"A stressfull and demanding job requiring 9 hours of standing and high stress rushes, you'll be lucky if management ever schedules enough people and be prepared to work under staffed and fill in the missing roles yourself."
good,Wendy's is slow paced and you have to do little work. The managers were really laid back. The customers were not bad. Wasn't really much to do but stand around and look like your doing something.
good,"It's a decent place to work, if you thrive in a fast paced work environment."
good,I think every wendys is probably different. When i first worked there everything was fine but as time went on management kept being switched around and things got very hectic
good,Wendys was an okay job it was the first job i ever started i learn to be fast smile and be nice we got new management and things wasnt going well i put my two weeks in in found something else
good,"This job will definitely teach you how to efficiently manage your time, as well as improve your dexterity and your patience. Is a good job to have to simply gain experience."
good,No problem with the company besides the minimum wage. The store I worked at was stressful and managers really didn't act as managers and treated everyone as less than a person sometimes. Along with rude customers and ridiculous complaints and requests.
good,"I worked drive thru and front register. I stocked what needed to be stocked such as napkins, plastic silverware, ketchup etc. Drive thru I would take care of customers then cleaned the deep fryer, did dishes, cleaned the floors."
good,"fast paced, enjoyed the other employees, loved waiting on customers and serving quality food. the hardest part of the job was working short handed most of the time."
good,I don't remember. Too many years ago. I have since moved out of that city. The district manager was laundering money and was sometimes abusive to the staff.
good,"I am not saying every Wendy's establishment is terrible, but the one in Irvine, KY is. No benefits, no raises after working there for three years, and overall is not a good place for advancement."
good,"Very good job to provide skills multi-tasking, prioritizing, and getting along with people in a fast-paced environment.  Managed the floor and learned about food service.  Management skills include hiring & terminations.  Unemployment benefit hearings.  Community benefits/fundraising/outreach marketing.  Inventory. Profit/loss."
good,I heard other Wendy's restaurants were paying their workers more than the one I was working at. I felt like my time wasn't being respected when I told the manager that I specifically can't work at certain times and days.
good,"Stressful job.  Not a great team atmosphere, did not enjoy the job.  Had issues with my manager a couple times because of relationships with customer service."
good,Good food and if u like serving the public this is the job for you. But if you don't want to work long hours for little pay then thus the job for you. No health insurance no 401K and really no way to make a healthy living.
good,"its a job, but fast food should be for teenagers, its'  management does not have much experience, they are very young.   Would only recommend for youth."
good,The company is ok to work for as a first job for a teenager. It is fairly difficult to work in for a long period of time as there are some rude customers and it is a very very fast-paced environment.
good,The work days were long and aggervating. Some employees would argue the whole day. I did learn how to use the cash register and i learned how to use the fryer.
good,"Stay stocked. Runnig out is the worst when you have a rush. Be rush ready at all times. And remember,         b.l.a.s.t. believe listen apologize satisfy thank."
good,"The store location was just off of a major highway near a well-to-do part of town, so breakfast and lunch rushes were considerable.  First time I got to learning a cash register, which was likely my best take-away.  There seemed to be a problem with functionality in the store, though, as the management wasn't able to fully enter me into the store's computer system until weeks after I'd been given the job."
good,"Was a great first job, but management cut my hours for new employees despite me asking for extra hours. Was told ""You will get called in"". Before this, I was constantly getting assigned 20+ hours a week and being called in frequently. Management liked me because I would cover sometimes up to 3 positions at once and keep up with their standards on all the positions. The hardest part was going in working as hard as I did and watching someone else do practically nothing and still receiving the same pay for the hours worked."
good,"Very unsanitary I will not recommend this place to anyone in my life , flies everywhere, mangers upset . I felt as if I was depressed every time I had to go to work."
good,The  managers were not welcoming and did not train crew accordingly. Overworked people and never had the schedule made and ready. Only one nice shift supervisor the entire time I was working there.
good,"When you are part of the food handling team and get paid as much as the customer service team, that's a major problem. The food team works harder, sweats harder, and makes things run. Period. Besides that the food is great."
good,I loved the job I just didn't love how the place was ran. There was to many issues with management and hours. It wasn't properly ran. Its only two managers.
good,I loved my job at Wendy's because I knew everything and worked here the longest. It got simple and easy for me to work everything. The management wasn't good at all they treated us very bad and didn't see how hard of a worker I was
good,Just a stereotypical fast food job that didn't care if the employees worked hard or not and even though we were treated fairly it didn't seem like they cared about how the customers treated the employees.
good,"its a convenience job for me  it works with my other pt job but still allows me to be home with the kids "
good,"it was ok but not paying enough. it was a lot to do for so little pay and the management team was very poor, they were out of control, very messy and unfair."
good,"Working at Wendy's is a lot for one person. Especially because most of the time your the only one working. Everybody is just standing around doing absolutely nothing. The managers are loving, but also rude at some point. Not very professional"
good,"My first ever job, and even though it had it's flaws, overall I look at it as a positive experience. Would I want to spend the rest of my life working there? No, but as a starter job for teenagers, it really wasn't that bad. It had the usual problems, with sometimes very rude customers and not always pleasant coworkers, but at the store I worked in, the customers were usually polite, the managers were actually willing to do their jobs, and most of my coworkers were fun to be around. All in all, I would recommend Wendy's - to youths."
good,A typical work day will be I clock in and usually start working. If i'm lucky i'll be able to get a break. What I learned about my job is time management and how to deal with customers. Workplace culture is diverse. The most enjoyable part about working there was the customers and being able to serve them.
good,"Busy hours help time to go by."
good,Wendy's was just a typical fast food restaurant job. I did not work long shifts because i had mostly worked there when I was in high school. The work was pretty complex.
good,I had a very bad experience working with this company however the company was not the problem.   A manager that they hired ended up having a problem with me and spreading rumors about me to other employees.  however the GM was a wonderful man and helped me out with getting another job.
good,"On good days the store is calm, bad days lines are nonstop on both sides. Many managers do work with employees but there are the few who sit in the office doing nothing all day."
good,Its ok fo work for for at least part time because the Wendy's i was at the management want trash. I was family runned and you could never mive up in that company the managers were family and tbe could kr wkhld never get in trouble
good,"I was there for a grand total of 3 months before I couldn't take it. I am thankful they got me quick employment when I first moved, but there were too many stressful situations, favoritism, and unfair pay that made it too hard to live on my own with."
good,"I only worked at Wendy's for 7 months but, we went through 4 managers. Each manager was driven out by upper management or left willingly. Crew members were mostly high school kids that either were over-worked or were allowed to do nothing or not take their job seriously. I also worked many 10-13 hour days and many days off. Many people were also promised raises that they didn't receive or took months to receive."
good,"Working for Wendy's, has been my most demanding job. No set schedules, lot of food rushes, and no benefits. I worked night shifts about 4-5 days a week and majority of over time on the weekends. My managers where great people and always tried o make our environment safe and fun."
good,"very little communication and very little support from the people above you , I would not go back and i did not enjoy my time there . Franchise is not run well"
good,It was a nice place to work.I did get to do different jobs there. Just being out of high school it was a start for me going out into the work world.You get to meet a lot of people.
good,"Some Day's were great some horrible. My shifts were the best tho!!!"
good,I would ask every time I was there to be scheduled more and the general manager would say she can see what she would do and give me a couple less hours the next week
good,"drive thru pay line makes an easy job taking orders with a kiosk moving at variable speeds with several orders mad on as many tickets as one  or 3, consistent work schedule, with rotation every hour"
good,"Honestly the food is amazing, the people are great, management just took advantage of hard working employees while others got to get away with goofing off and not completing job tasks, I don't know about 2nd shift but 1st shift was horrible in terms of the amount of work put on just a single position or two while others could just walk off when it was time to leave."
good,"Wendy's is fast pace environment, it can be vary difficult  to keep up with the demands of the costumers but overall, most of the costumers are great. the people who work there are very nice and helpful ,"
good,Nothing much to say. I worked there it was ok. I didn't see a future so I left to pursue other opportunities it can be a great starter job. Good for a first job.
good,"A typical day of work at Wendy's was very busy, I learned how to work a cash register and manage people through the drive thru. The hardest part of the job was the rushes throughout the day which was almost all day long and having to deal with a few rude or needy customers here and there."
good,my first job straight out of highschool I can admit that I loved it It was fast pace and up to beat would recommend this job to any young adult looking for work
good,"Overall, fast food jobs tend to be very fast paced and can be cut throat. It just became something that I couldn't balance while being in school. College is already stressful due to class, being involved on campus, and then adding work during the school year became too much."
good,"This was a really great place to work but the store manager who is the district manager now always drove around the store spying through the windows and it made you feel like you was always being watched, she also just drove around to gain miles on the company car so she could get paid for mileage as well which was coning the place out of money"
good,"A typical day will consist of items ranging from food to cleaning materials being out of stock frequently. I have learned to be resourceful and responsible for my work area. Management is moderate to keep things running but poor to provide better equipment to efficiently clean or maintain stock. Diversity is low with exception of a slim few, and the hardest part of the job is lacking the help i would need during a rush. My most enjoyable part of the job is being able to organize the orders that come in and fulfill them speed and accuracy as well as having customer satisfaction."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the team members and most of all the customers. Even the manager, Ms. Gracie Scott, is very friendly, understandable, and dependable. The hardest part of the job is most times we would be short staffed. So I would I have to maintain 2 or more stations at one time for example the front cashier and the grill."
good,"It is a typical fast food restaurant job, stressful, tiring, and sometimes infuriating. The hours fluctuated a lot, some of the managers did not seem to care that I was in nursing school when they would assign me 30 hours each week, even though I said I could only work 20."
good,"This was my first job and I loved it, at first. It was a nice olace to work until new management got in there. I met a lot of great people and learned a lot about myself here. Okay place to work.!"
good,At wends the day is usually fast paced. You learn to prepare food fast while making it presentable as well as communicating properly with management. The culture in the workplace of wends is rushed and fast but consistent with the movement. The hardest part is keeping up during rush hour times and the most enjoyable part was enjoying new desserts.
good,My sister in-law was to take me to and from castle rock and lied to the manager costing my job because she had known my sister in-law longer then I she believed that I was un willing to give he gas money to commute witch in fact was untrue.
good,"Even though the work wasnt hard ,mangers talk to you like your nothing and also are very lazy at times .They feel like they can tell you to do anything the way they want to because they make a extra 200 dollars on there check."
good,"a typical day at work includes taking orders, food preparation, stocking supplies, collecting money, cleaning food areas. I learned how to maintain composure when faced with difficult customers. hardest part of the job is to maintaining composure and getting the job done in a short time frame. Most enjoyable was working with the co workers."
good,I've only been there for only two years and it ended up messing up my social life and my financial situation. If you get sick or have anything happen to you personally they take it upon them to punish you for it. You'll really have to become the mangers pet for you even to treated equally.
good,"If you work for this company you will start out with to few hours, then get more hors then you can handle. "
good,"Take orders at desk."
good,"A typical day starts out slow, but can quickly turn into a fast paced rush hour. With no breaks, if you're over 18. Hardest part of the job is that you will always come home smelling like your job."
good,"I enjoyed working there, it was very fast paced, i learned a lot about cash registering, managment was fairly alright, people i worked with were nice, hardest part was when people would call in, and the most enjoyable part was i got to work with people i knew, and i was always busy."
good,Working at Wendy's made me realize that jobs are really what you make it. If you don't take it serious the people won't take you serious. If you want to show up and work hard you all get more hours.
good,I enjoyed working in the kitchen and also in the lobby. Kitchen work was fast paced and accurate. I had fun working on the toaster and through the drive through.
good,"Wendy's is a decent first job, they teach you work ethic and work around you schedule. The customers are rude and impatient which takes a toll on every team member making them less likely to have a good attitude. The managers always sit in the office and don't help."
good,when  I worked  there  was   fine  got  along  with   the   crew  and  management and   the  customers .  my   job   was   running  grill and  doing  outside maintence
good,"its a great place to work, help you develop yourself with the ability to move up in the company to better yourself, it's a lot of hard work and dedication"
good,"I was in high school when I started working at Wendy's. I was getting paid minimum wage but it paid my bills while in school. The management at the time was fun, we had a blast their. Now looking back on our past it was just too unprofessional, now I see how i got promoted but never got paid for it."
good,"Provide great customer service , maintain clean station, cleaned dinning room. Also was able to work at every station. Started off with sandwiches got moved up."
good,"It was a great job when I first started, but I was trained at the South Sioux City Wendy's, but worked at the Wendy's by singing hills. I just don't like how the mangers ended up treating me."
good,"The job was ok. They only thing that you would hate about this job are the customers. While the customers get angry, for whatever reason, that brings the managers tempers high and its gets put on the employees"
good,A typical day at work is pretty average. During rush hours like lunch and dinner the stress is high and you have to work at a very high pace. The hardest part of this job is to stay positive during rushes.
good,"At my location at the Wendy's I worked at, a lot of employees came and went including managers. The manager who hired me was very nice and helpful but left a month after she hired me. When I left the management completely changed and the a lot of the managers had egos and became very rude to the other employees."
good,If there is one thing i learned from Wendy it is the mangment does not care about the lesser people. My DM actually told me that we were pathic because we couldn't come in and close instead of the gm had to come and close after she had opened. They sent me home because i wore jeans but i never got the chance to clean my work clothing because of the schedule so i came back in dirty pants
good,Wendy's is a cool place to work. Great food. The management team is ok. They could use a little more work. The team members are very friendly and respectful.
good,The typical day at work is hard and can get very stressful. There are a lot of opportunities to learn small things. The management could use a little improvement But more of the people are fun and make it less stressful.
good,My review of the job is I can't speak for all Wendy's but the one I work at isn't that bad. The pay is okay for someone my age who doesn't pay any bills. The work is easy and the job is as well as long as everyone is doing their job. I enjoy working here each day and I would stay if I had opportunity for advancement.
good,Management is lacking.  There is little leadership. There is no minimum bar for employees. The ones that work do all the work the ones who don't get by with it
good,"A great place to start out for a first job. Allowed me to gain experience handling money, working with others and using customer service skills in a fast paced work environment."
good,Very lovely job but my only problem was me and the morning time with that manger she was really up right and also had her few favorites the employees that have been working there so I would love to work the night shift with out her there it would go good
good,"This job is for a 1st job basics its just if you are starting out, I stayed at this job for a long time but I learned a lot and it helped me reach some goals I had."
good,It was a fun and friendly place to work and productive as there were limits on how long someone could wait in the drive thru. I enjoyed working there.
good,"During my time working at Wendy's I did different things. I worked on the register with customers, I worked at a fast paced sandwich station having to keep up. I enjoyed my time here."
good,The hardest part of the job is the long hours on your feet and keeping up with demands. The best part about the job is being able to speak with consumers.
good,The job was great Overall. I wanted to spend more time with my kids. I was working at different locations and it came very time consuming.
good,"Great conversations with regular customers and being able to help them to the T, because you interact with these people everyday like you know them."
good,It was a okay job that paid the bills. The coworkers was nice. Management could have been better. The food was good. Customer service was okay could have been better
good,"A typical day at wendys has its ups and downs. It can be stressful."
good,One things for sure fast food is a hard working job at every position. Fast paced always on the move. First job I had and I'm glad it was.
good,Requires a lot of working and a lot of bouncing from station to station. Can sometimes get over whelming but after the shift over with you can say you were able to get through the rush of the shift.
good,Not a career job in anyway. The benefits are not that good. No overtime is offered at all. No paid holidays for crew members. Favoritism is showed a lot in the workplace.
good,"cashiering, bagging, food preparation. at this job you'll learn every position. its fun but i wouldn't make it a career. flexible schedules and nice management."
good,I like working there the people was nice but the management was awful but it was only one manger that was mean the other one was nice
good,"Somewhat okay , good work area I was in. Management was okay as well. Work schedule couldve been better, only was working 2 days out of the week. overall everything else was okay."
good,"I Personally Feel That New Employees Have More Of A Drive To Get Things That Need To Be Done In A Workplace Done, In Order To Move Into A Better Position. Other Than An Employee That Has Been In The Same Position For Whatever Time Period And Feels That They Deserve More, Than The New Employee. Basically The Superior Employees Got What They Wanted When I (The New Employee) Was Working Harder, And Or Making Positive Changes For The Company."
good,"I was welcomed with open arms, and trained very well. As time progresses I got up to speed on everything and learned to work at a fast pace and also multitask. I had many duties, such making sure was stocked at the register, cleaning the dining area, cleaning the bathrooms, and also making sure that anyone in need got help."
good,"Wendy's is a great job to have for high school students. The corporation works well with school schedules and extra curricular activities. Although Minimum wage is doable for students, however I would not recommend this job for those with greater priorities due to the basic pay."
good,"I would cook burgers, make sandwiches, pack fries and nuggets, and sometimes take orders and money. I learned how to stay working at a fast pace. My coworkers weren't the best. The hardest part of the job was no getting behind on orders on a busy day. The most enjoyable part was working around something I love."
good,"They don't care about anything, you don't get any compensation for the extra work you do. They make you work a 12 hours shift and you only get a 30 minutes brake. Don't care at all about your personal health."
good,I absolutely loved working for Wendy's. The customers are what made the job perfect. The pay was okay & the head boss was amazing.
good,"I barely had much training bore I was sent to sandwich making, doing only online simulations. I didn't get a lot of hours, only really getting about 9 to 15 hours a week. Management wasn't as nice and often times didn't send anyone to help me when I was in front at the cashiers by myself when I had a store full of people."
good,"Always had a stressful time here, had expectations that weren't realistic and would be ridiculed if goals weren't met. Was fun at some points, but not worth the stress"
good,Great customers and friendly people. The management staff do not care about your welfare or your original availability. Co-workers are great and I have learned that people can change up at the switch of a hat.
good,"As much as I loved working with some of the people I did, I hated the job. Everything was go-go-go constantly and became exhausting. The managers all have good intentions and know what they're doing, but the training for new crew members wasn't very good. The only problem I really had was the amount of under appreciation that went on in that place."
good,"I was the main fryer cleaning person but I injured my back and the company would not compensate me or move me to a different position to keep the strain off of my back. Long story short, I had to quit before I ruptured a disk."
good,Learned alot of defferent things and what and how everything get done and its fast eniviroment also helps double task and how to serve customers get register experience
good,high paced burger flippin'. Did not enjoy any of this job. Super high paced on a busy highway. Good management. location has since been shut down
good,C'etait une belle experience je m'entender avec tout le monde bonne esprit d'équipe.
good,Very respectful and outgoing place... I enjoyed my job and my co workers.... The team members was very joyful to work around with.. The food is great out there..
good,From my experience at Wendy's I have learned that there are two types of people. The ones that are kind and the ones that don't care about what you do. The manager wasn't friendly and didn't take work life balance into consideration.
good,Company would over work and not compensate for the work done. Favoritism when it came to management. There had been a lot of slack when it came to the employees doing there daily duties. Alot of unscheduled breaks. Too much food given out to friends and family of employees when they visit the restaurant. Way to much fratnerzation between management and employees.
good,"fast food sucks in general. no one likes their job and it shows, you can move up but you wont make a lot and you will work crazy hours and have no time for anything else."
good,most days are terrible because there is a lack of staff and that means that the workers must work overtime. there is a bad work environment because no one wants to be there and is in a miserable mood.
good,"When I started I was assigned to the grill. I wanted to change my station, but the management did not approve my request. Overall I did not enjoy my time at Wendys."
good,Job is fast paced at times which I enjoy.Most crew people and other managers were hard workers and worked well together. I enjoyed the customers and the work. Again the temperature was unbearable at times.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's included the following: Me coming to work 15-20 min prior to my scheduled shift. Reviewing the employees that I will be working with for the day. I then complete an inventory count of food, and verify that the safe left from the previous shift is correct. I coached my employees as to what the expectations are for them that day, and when the shift is over, I complete the process again."
good,"A typical day at work for me would start by coming in about fifteen minutes early to say hello and check if anything new changed withing the office. Once it was time to clock on I'd have my headset ready and check to make sure my station, which was the grill 100% of the time. I would be on grill for the busiest times of the day and when it slowed down I would be asked to take out trash or wash dishes while someone else watched the grill until I returned."
good,"I mostly ran cashier or drive thru. I learned to be patient and got way better at multitasking. Management was okay, could have been better. CO-workers was fun to work with. The hardest part of this job was satifying rude customers."
good,"My personal opinion of Wendys was a great place until they got a new General Manager. She decided she was going to come in and be rude to a lot of the crew. i had many conversation with multiple crew member about how she had been rude or done something that upset them in one way or another. I feel that she came in and made a whole bunch of changes that weren't necessary. "
good,"You basically have to use ""teamwork"" and crosswork in multiple areas. One minute you're on the cashier, the next on grill, and you finish your day off on sandwhich station."
good,"The only thing I learned was how to properly make a sandwich. It was very hot in the kitchen. The most enjoyable part of the time was being able to get free drinks, but only when it was slow."
good,a typical day at work would be me preparing food at a fast pace while answering orders on the headset. Making drinks and making sure everything is organized and the dining area is clean.
good,"I really disliked working for the company because the customers were very rude, the managers had lack of communication skills. They barley gave me hours."
good,"The pay was bad."
good,Not enough money for all the the things you are required to do. sometimes management is not leading by example the hardest part of the job is my travel 2 1/2 travel time there and 2/1/2 travel time home I enjoy working and refuse to give up until something better comes along. sticking it out.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of an impatient manager who gave us unrealistic expectations. I learned a lot as far as working a grill, making sandwiches, and making chili. But the rest of the things I learned there I learned on my own through trial and error. I picked up new tricks and tactics to help me finish my job faster, keep up with business, and still serve quality food. The management did not appreciate my working style and I often received unfair treatment from them. The hardest part of my job was pleasing my managers. It seemed like everything I tried to do right, my general manager considered it was wrong."
good,"I personally think that Wendy's is the perfect part time job for high school and college students. If you're a manger, it may be okay but as a crew member you don't get paid enough to support yourself and your family."
good,"Most stores were put together and ran smooth, but when it came to being able to be with children or families it was very hard. A normal day at work started pretty early at 5AM and would end about 12 hours later. Shifts were mostly the same and many of the other managers and crew worked well together. My co-workers were great. I got to know most of them and created a decent work relationship where we just knew what to get done.  The most enjoyable was breaks. We are on a college campus so every time the school is out we are out so most major holidays we got to spend with families."
good,"at fast food restaurants many employees do not take the job very serious, some people need to be trained more on the field they are placed at. Managers need to give example with their job performance"
good,Management is horrible they play favoritism give hours to people they like instead of the hard workers.  Co-workers mostly females who gospel and argue with each other. Hardest part job is the role the male workers have to do while at work.
good,Fast food very high pressure but challenging. Good compensation and ability to advance. Could have better with medical benefits and quality of life.
good,"My typical day at work includes either food preparation in the morning for open, sandwich maker or order taker. I have learned customer service skills, how to multitask, work at a fast pace, and team leadership. The management could use some improvement. Can be rude to new crew members. Lack of teamwork. The hardest part of the job would be the lack of teamwork. What I mean by lack of teamwork includes: people talking/ not staying focused, not helping other crew members, not enough people working. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone is doing their job and serving the customers and to see the customers happy."
good,"A typical day at work i would work 1-2 positions depending on the crew. I learned how to work all 5 positions (dining room, fries, grill, sandwiches, drive thru) Management was poor bad scheduling and bad leadership. Co-workers few lazy workers the biggest struggle was following procedures correctly. hardest part of the job was trying to get co-workers to follow procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers and the relationship they had with the employees."
good,"A good job to have to pay for food expenses otherwise expect long hours of standing, cleaning a greasy kitchen, and cooking tons of hot food."
good,"I want to start this by saying I love to serve people food, and that desire is the only reason I have put up with this store for as long as I have. Poor management that would rather partake in high school drama than work. Unruly Crew members who can do anything they would like with little or no fear of corrective action aside from the incident being written down. Safety is a joke. The advancement aspect is little to none as well, I personally have been promised a promotion for the larger side of half a year, including me taking all the classes and tests required. Only to be jerked around with a plethora of BS reasons as to why it can't happen, and I should just wait. My recommendation is if you are a hard working person and you like for your work to be recognized, do not apply here."
good,"During my time working at Wendy's, 4 years, I found I learned a lot, but after a while the working environment became too negative and I didn't enjoy working there anymore. Some of the other people working there don't treat you very well. However, the some of the management team is nice to work with, others not so much."
good,"At Wendy's I am always a busy bee, never resting and constantly getting tasks done."
good,"-A typical day at Wendy would be,  7am show up and get the restaurant set up before we open, Work hard and leave at 4pm."
good,"A typical day for myself at Wendy's would start in the evening, most crew members and other management disperse when i arrive. I take the initiative to prepare the crew, as well as prep all areas to be rush ready before i begin nightly cleaning. There seems to be a lot to do, in a small time frame, given very few crew members. I have learned to take charge, speak up, solve problems as accurately and efficiently as possible to get tasks completed. As for the environment, crew members as well as management tend to become close; like a family, which makes the work environment atmosphere very fun at the appropriate times."
good,A day at work consist of cooking cleaning and fast paced work if it got busy. I learned how to work under pressure and maintain my calm when dealing with rude people. The manager where I worked showed obvious favoritism for certain workers and would only promote you if you were kissing up to her. My coworkers were tolerable it kind of depended on the day. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a professional way of doing things because there is so many things that could happen that will push you over the edge. The most enjoyable part of the job is sometimes there are awards ceremonies and during holidays the manager or other worker will put something fun together for the employees.
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's as I was younger. It was a good starting point in my life to show me how to balance school and work. I learned how important it is to work hard in life and how to save money.
good,The managers showed a lot of favoritism towards some coworkers. I only worked there for a summer job but once school started i got really busy with school activities and the manager didn't want to give me certain days off for school. Most of the coworkers were very friendly.
good,i have o clean fill up the refrigerator and take out the garbage also i close five days of weeks until 1.00 am Monday to friday. set the timers make sure everything organize.
good,"The management was horrible, schedules was confusing from time to time, co-workers was nice and humors, the job was easy work to me. I was always done on time completing my duty."
good,"judgemental staff, unstable employees >was sexually harassed and the management didn't tend well to me responding to it  and alerting them. I ended up leaving In the end so i could end the harassment myself. He was 22, I was 15."
good,Always crowded and management did not do a very good job at keeping the peace during rush hours. Over all a successful company.
good,Positive work environment that was fast paced and always busy. Management always did there best to make sure the store had smiling faces and positive workers
good,"i left this company because i wasnt going anywhere there, 8 years on and off and by the time i quit i was only making 8.75 per hour"
good,Love the customers but work part-time only. I can not get health insurance since I don't get enough hours. Its a fast food job with not a way to get a higher income although I love Wendys and the food.
good,nothing too great. my coworkers were pretty cool. the work was exhausting but that is to be expected while working at a fast food place that is close the interstate and constantly busy.
good,"Easy communication."
good,fun and easy going work place and easy to get along with the co workers felt like we were family. managers were nice and understanding
good,it is a place to work if you are in school. management is young and so are employees. they make a very simple job harder than it needs to be.
good,"I would go to work right after I was out of school then work till evening. I learned what it took to hold a job and work with others as a team. Going to school and holding a job is not easy, it showed me how utilize my time well outside of work to make sure I was not running myself into the ground."
good,I learned how to be more patient with others. Co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part about Wendy's is that the management could of been more understanding.
good,"When first starting off, it was confusing beings that Wendys was my first job. as the weeks progressed, I mastered basic functions through out the restaurant, also making new friends with the other crew members and managers as the years progressed. of course there were difficult moments dealing with customers, but there were also days where everyone made the job enjoyable."
good,"Fun place and good management, most of the managers are nice and supportive. Working at wendy's requires a lot of dealing with customer which improved my customer service skills. Hardest part in working at wendy's is that there is a lot of cleaning."
good,I believe the faculty was very unprofessional. My reason for leaving are medical reasons due to the fact my manger couldn't understand my concerns.
good,"It wasn't much of a fun workplace than one would think, you went there, did your job, then went home. You would repeat that everyday you worked. Had to stay focused and make sure you are working fast-paced and not in anyone's way."
good,"extremely disorganized, wanted morning shift team members to perform  managers duties without the pay, morning shift was left to do work the team members from the previous night was supposed to complete"
good,"You never knew what position you would be on if you were willing to learn and/or flexible. I was told I was going to be a cashier, and they kept me mainly on the grill. They told me that you start on the grill and work your way up, and with many, that was not the case. "
good,"It is hard to go into to work each day when I know something is going to happen no matter how hard I try and no matter how much effort I'm willing to put in. "
good,"When I first got hired in the job I was totally waiting on a job to hired me but what made me angry was I kept getting the same pay rates through the year I was tired of getting 8.15 or 9 an hour I basically just work because I need some type of employment coming through, so I just my harddest everyday, The hard part was changing filter pads but soon I get to know every thing mmore faster my paste but never got a raised the raised is only 5 for a raised thats why I need to work at better job instead of a restraunted job."
good,Good place to work for a first time job but for furthering your career opportunities its not the greatest. Doesn't have great work incentives and people who have worked there for years say they only got a 10 cent raise even becoming a manager. Fast advancement if you do the work and learn the business.
good,"This was my first job, I don't have bad things to say about Wendy's by far. It was memorable and gave me my first taste of work ethic. It wasn't a forever job- rather a temporary job for a teen in high school. It was good experience, but there wasn't much room for growth or advancement opportunity."
good,"Provided positive customer care for hundreds of customers each week."
good,"The owner of the Wendy's was not greatest. He owned seven stores and benefits were okay. The management staff were ok the position of running the store was not that hard. I started from cashier to General Manager in 1yr 1/2. Typical day is counting safe and drawers, making salads, prep sides, doing inventory, checking temps and window times."
good,"A typical work day consisted of us usually working with employees who weren't trained fully. I learned to depend on people who I considered reliable or experienced. I've felt some of my co-workers were hard-working, yet most were lazy. The hardest part was working understaffed on numerous occasions. The most enjoyable part was working with people who were dependable and weren't anti-social."
good,this job was like working in high school all over again. there was a lot of fighting and arguing. the managers where more like friends the employees and that just was not the environment for me.
good,"Was working way to hard, to make nothing. Did the same amount of work as the higher level managers, and but they were payed more. You are only paid by your title, and not how good of a worker you are."
good,For the most part my complaints are with the low opportunities for advancement.  I have been a manager for over 10 years and have not moved up despite numerous attempts.
good,"A typical day at work is very fast pace and a lot of hard work. What I learn at this job was how to solve customers problems very well. Management could be better about hiring people that are willing to work hard. My co-worker are wonderful. The hardest part of the job is  the lack of enough people to work on night shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I met there, they're so kind."
good,While doing my job I met a lot of interesting people and learned a lot about different things from my costumers. I wish there's was more internal opportunities to bond with my coworkers but besides that it was an okay job.
good,"They were really stressful"
good,It gives you good experience.  The management is good. The hardest part is working the closing shift.  I have been there for eight years.
good,"a typical day at work consisted of coming in to find your position of the day. which could be changed through out the day."
good,the pay is what keeps good people away from wendy's. if they paid there people they would have better people and would also retain people longer. which would make a better work enviroment.
good,"My typical day at work was that I learned how to make sandwiches, prep. food, cook food, and be a cashier. My co-workers did the same as me , some of my co-workers were lacking off. The hardest part of the job was moving at a fast pace than usual and dealing with the unprofessional managers, The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people that were nice."
good,"When I was working here, they were nice at first, but then they got worse. I had an allergic reaction from the mixture of the soaps and sanitizer that they cleansed the dishes with that made my hands go numb and I was sick. The next day my hands were still numb to where I could barely hold my phone to call off for that day. When I tried to call off the management was rude to me and was trying to make me come in to work even though I really couldn't do anything. Also, I couldn't stand how unclean the environment was. I haven't been able to eat there since I had worked their, and it's not from the food, it's from knowing how unsanitary they keep the place."
good,The people are good and it is hard work. It is for high school students not a career opportunity for people who don't know what to do with their lives.
good,"I would come in and go straight to work. I learned how to work under pressure as well as keeping a positive attitude. Management was okay, but a little unorganized. They would call me to work on my off days every time I'm off which was a little annoying. Co-workers had too much drama. Arguments weren't frequent but common. The hardest part of the job were cleaning the bathrooms, you never knew what to expect in there sometimes so it was a little scary. The most enjoyable part was meeting the people and connecting with them while work was slow."
good,Always busy and learning new things. Management is sure to put you through orientation and safetythen are able to cross train you quickly.
good,"At Wendy's I learned the crew and managerial staff care more about themselves than they di the actual product. A typical day is usually littered with directionless staff and multitasking crew which creates a flustered, stressed, and overall toxic workplace environment. My co-workers varied from caring about the job and team, to only caring about getting their paycheck while performing as minimal work as possible. This lead to conflicting team work and overwhelmed crew members. Many crew members also showed a complete disregard for company policy, and proper hygienic practices. The most difficult part of a typical day was dealing with multiple staff members that would task me with multiple duties, while I was online for product preparation. This would distract me from my job priority which would cause conflict amongst the product line. The main positive working at Wendy's were the employee discounts. granted they were getting cut back due to company budget cuts."
good,Very good first job. but if you're not into the fast food business then I suggest you do not apply here. work was very easy as I would just make the food for the costumers along with keeping my area clean and outside in the parking lot.
good,"My day would start early,which i enjoyed...i learned all the ins n outs of the fast food industry. I love my managers and I enjoyed working with my co-workers. Hardest part of the job,was making sure that we all had the store in order before we opened,the most enjoyable part of the job was the re-peat customers and the family we bacame with working side by side on a daily basis."
good,"it is what it is, it's a job you just have to have the right team and the right support or everyone fails from bottom to top. Every job has it's up's and downs I just haven't found much room for excelling if you are a fast pace learner or got that so called drive."
good,A typical day at work is rough I work the night shift so we close the store down teamwork is a requirement but really isn't enforced by the managers.  Typically myself or another co worker are doing most of the shutting down while the others are lounging around.  The job isn't hard if everyone cooperated but if there is a hard part its just that majority of the work is done by one person it isn't set up that way but if I want to get out on time I have to pick up the slack of others.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the free food we receive at the end and the friends I made at work.
good,Fast food was not my ideal job to advance in. The management was awful and the culture as well. The hardest part of the job was working with teengaers and adults that were on a different mentality level.
good,Well the place was in bishopville and of the highway nice people that i work with. management was okay. the co worker so nasty. so i just went in to work and go home that was it.
good,A typical day is always busy .But i always like that kept me busy . The  Managment was always helpful . My co-workers are the awesome people to work with .
good,Working at Wendy's is the same as any fast food place. Its faced paced to keep up with the demands of the customers throughout the day. I didn't mind the work but I had to leave because my last season of football begins.
good,a day at wendy  clocking in. counting my money before i start taking orders . taking a 30 min break. coming back after my break and taking more orders. and when my shift is over  my boss count my money. and i drop some of the money in a drop box. then i go home for the day. i have learn to be quick on my feet.at all time. and very patience. i have learn to work with my co workers as a team. and help then out when needed. the hardest part of the job is trying to get the order out as quick as you can. even when its a busy day . the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people. and seeing new faces everyday.
good,I took food orders and did money exchange.  I also clean up my area and I would help make food.  I did enjoy working with my co-workers.
good,"Working at Wendy's I got my first taste of a real job. Id show up early eager to work and learn new things .The best part was trying to prove myself to the managers and other team members. I always want to be the best at what I do so I worked my butt off. The managers used to say to the other employees ""look how hard he's working, the floors don't need to be spotless"" and they'd laugh and id smile but I thought to myself ""this should be the standard"" and it was really shocking to me that they found it funny I worked so hard. Regardless, none of the other employees helped me out much causing me to have to do extra work, which I honestly didn't mind, but it would have been nice if the managers actually did work or the other team members would have helped more. I hope to find these qualities in the people of the next job I have."
good,"A work day at Wendy's is fun fast and hectic.I learned how to open the store ,how to prepare sandwich stations and grills and how to make money transactions in a timely manner."
good,"Normal day starts off making chili and cleaning everything that hadn't already been cleaned by the night crew, then I stock and label meats and cook them. After lunch I take out the trash and break down boxes, then clean some more. Management is what you'd expect, no one is a tyrant and everyone tries to gets tasks done without too much trouble. Co-workers are mostly high-school and college age kids."
good,I do what needs to be done and continue on my day. i don't involve myself enough in this company because i don't believe it is suited as career job for me it is just a stepping stone to something better
good,"Conflicting Schedules, Un-paid overtime, cut in hours without explanations."
good,Staff was cool but not the manager. I liked my task I had to do until I started to see I was the only one doing the most work. Then I got fired in Hurricane Irene. For a no call no show when I called them and told them no transit was running. I was fired for no reason.
good,"You can have extra overtime and make extra money when it is available. No free meals for employees. A regular day would be to work at least eight hours, or maybe 12 hours. Schedule tends to change without notice. Not a reliable schedule with set hours, must be available when called in to work. Work on weekends, late night, or the graveyard shift, must be willing to work any shift when asked to do so."
good,"Fast food requires a great demand from the employees. You must be fast paced, have interpersonal skills, be able to handle all customers, take order efficiently, keep a clean environment, have everything stocked, handle transactions, and help close the store. Fast food has a high turn over rate. The hardest part about that job was handling the stressful environment while handling horrible attitudes from the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was being with friends and having those nice customers that made my job worth while."
good,"A typical day- arrive, take out the trash, wash hands, stand at the grill, lay down meat, repeat for eight hours."
good,"the people I worked with were very nice, everyone was will to help everyone even though management was a little lazy the crew was able to make things good."
good,"Great place for a first job. While you're in high school just trying to get some extra money in your pocket. Not a place for starting a career. No benefits. As an employee a typical isn't too bad. But, as a manager the days were very stressful. It drove me away from the company. I started to notice all the flaws of the company as I grew older and wiser."
good,I Learned a lot from Wendy's like how to manage th work and how to plan daily activities. Co-workers are very kind to every one and very supportive and i enjoy working with them
good,A typical day was to show up and check the board to see where you are working that day. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment. Management was ok. My co-workers were nice. Hardest part is getting all the large orders done. Most enjoyable is the food.
good,wendys is a good starter job is was my very first job it its a very busy job and can be stressful but does not meet the needs of someone my age or with my responsibility
good,"I enjoy the customers that come in but i dislike the management, organization and energy in some of the employees. I learned to be more kind to the people that come in the restaurant because those are the ones that will keep your business running. There were no hard parts in the job, I learn very quickly and I move according to the paste of the hour. The most enjoyable part would be to clean, restock, and organize the teams stations to make their jobs easier."
good,"Not alot of Job recognition by the managers"
good,Assisting in the day to day operations of the company. Managing a crew of 8-12. Making  deposit . Open and close the store
good,"If you are looking for a job that can put a few dollars in your pocket then by all means do what need to be done. However, if you are looking for a job with room for advancement Wendy's is not the place for you. Unless, you would like to be over worked and under paid."
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting customers and performing my daily duties such as: cleaning, taking orders, and taking cash and giving change. I learned to be more friendly and nicer. I learned that others' needs come before mine and it is essential to work as a team. My managers did their job. They helped the crew members and were understanding of our needs. My coworkers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of my job was to do the very best I could to help the customers with their needs. The most enjoyable part of my job was putting a smile on customer's faces."
good,I worked alot of hours and got paid every two weeks. I would work in drive- thru and the dining room serving customers their food. I cleaned and vacuumed the dining room at the end of the night when I worked afternoons and if I worked day shift I'd do it before my shift ended
good,"The management was great in 04. Made great friends. Grill sucked. Fast pace during lunch and dinner, super slow between."
good,"Usual long work weeks "
good,"Everyday is presented with new challenges.  Example, scheduling conflicts with management and hourly employees.  Running a shift with minimal staffing while maintaining high quality out put of products and providing excellent customer service.  Hardest part is not knowing what condition the store will be in when arriving for shift.  Not knowing if there is enough staff for shift.  Dealing with subordinate managers who don't communicate."
good,"Too much political bs. Everyone was family, they were more concerned about the people who had longevity and family  members in certain positions than they were about the business."
good,"cool,fun easy have a long standing period ,love the customers"
good,"Usual day consists of cleaning work area, preparing food and making sure that all products are in correct placement. Management was defined by multiple mistakes made and they blamed the employees instead of fixing the problem."
good,"nice place to work nice people only mild conflicts"
good,"All work no family time.Worked 70 plus hours per week."
good,"Stressful. Was not well trained and immediately put on front counter, which I was on for the entirety of my working there. Good coworkers and decent management. Fast paced and often frustrating."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's begins around lunch time. I take and prepare orders while trying to maintain getting each car through the drive thru in two minutes or less. I have learned a lot at Wendy's as far as how to deal with workplace drame (because there is a lot of that) and I have also learned how to make conversation with strangers and how to not be so shy. Another thing I have learned is  teamwork can make or break a day at work. Through the years we have went through many different managers which has also given me experience in adapting and adjusting to different people and different ways of doing things. As of now management is going great. I really like the direction in which our store is going. I enjoy my coworkers, we are like a small family. The hardest part of the job is dealing with different customers and their attitudes. I have learned to kill them with kindness. The most enjoyable parts of Wendy's are meeting different people who come through (most recently we had a NFL player to come in). It is also a way of being familiar with the people who live in the community. I appreciate everything Wendy's has done for me, especially with being flexible to my high school and now college schedule. However, I just feel like it is time to move on."
good,typical day was very fast and very tiring. Learned to work fast and stay out of the way. Managment did not help out with anything...they didn't even teach me anything. They had one of the normal employees to train me. Co-workers helped out when ever they could. Hardest part of the job was cleaning the grills at the end of the day. Most enjoyable part of the job was going home!
good,This job is a place I have worked on and off for six years because being a good employee it's a job I can always go back to. The company has great managers and employess that get along well and work together.
good,good experience for young adults to gain work experience and spending money.
good,"I learned that you have to work as a team and to move in a fast pace to get every customer order in a timely fashion. I have to treat every customer with respect and make sure they are satisficed. "
good,"Product is excellent, but getting good help is the biggest obstacle in this business."
good,Hardest part about working as a manager for Wendy's is the awful pay and denial of raises even after years of good hard working service. The pay inequality among management between men and woman management is a serious problem still with woman at the disadvantage.
good,management was really bad at the one i worked in. The workers were  a nice bunch off people.
good,"Typical day at work would consist of leadership, basically being a role model to all employees. Making sure employees follow safety procedures around the store. I am a team player, love working around people, i am confident in everything i do and always looking forward to a challenge."
good,"Cook burgers, take trash out, keep my section stocked. I work hard. I help others with there stations as well. I clock out go home do it again the next day."
good,"The managers are, unfortunately, uncaring and some are bullies. The co-workers are great, though. They make you feel like your apart of a large family, making sure you are OK and they make you laugh and feel good about yourself. The hardest part of the job would have to be closing the dining room, when you have to scrub, and I mean SCRUB, the dining room floor, or stay at work until 1:30 in the morning, so you can close down the drive thru. It SUCKS! However, the most enjoyable part of the job, is being able to make lasting connections with your co-workers (and SOME of the managers), who actually care about you. I am told every time I bike home from work to call the store so the manager(s) will know I made it home safely."
good,"My experience with Wendy's great company, but i feel as though that they dont treat all employee from inside the store perspective the same way like management in the stores"
good,Low pay but overall was a good place to work as long as you are in school.
good,"Although this job always provided me with plenty to do, the ever-evolving schedule made it impossible for me to plan anything else.  Also, the wages were low, and I was not taught as many new skills as I had hoped to learn."
good,"You get treated like a nobody daily, management staff is lazy. Manger watch new employees struggle and then laugh at them."
good,"I enjoyed this job cause I ran the back drive, stayed busy constantly and I felt I did a great job there"
good,The restaurant was typically busy. The management wasn't up to par but my overall experience was okay I guess
good,A typical day at work got very easy after I got the hang of things. I learned how to become a proper manager and owner if I was in that place. Management was okay but very petty. My co workers were very easy to get along with. The hardest part was going in and dealing with bad attitude but not from the customers. The most enjoyable was seeing my customers smile.
good,"Nice team atmosphere. Quick and fast pasted job. Customer friendly, even if your day wasn't going good it would change after leaving there. Already had experience in stocking, but it never hurts to learn different ways of doing the same job because you might learn something that helps that you didn't know."
good,"A typical day at wendy's is always fast paced, i learned alot at this job the basic functions in a fast food restaurant. The GM was more of a boss than i leader which was one of my cons in order to succeed you have to be a leader not a boss."
good,"The management at Wendy's wasn't good. They talked behind each others backs all the time to each other and to employees, couldn't agree on anything together, and one manager would tell one employee to do something while another manager would tell the same employee to do something else. If you told them that a manager just told you to do something, they would get mad and say to ignore the other manager and just listen to them. Getting food to customers was slow even when we weren't busy. I had to refund customers their money back more than a couple of times because of how slow the management and crew where. The hardest part of my job was having to deal with the management. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers."
good,It was just a horrible experience. A stepping stone to where you really want to go in life.
good,the hardest part of the job is being ablt to perform your best work performance and at the end of the day the management does not thank the crew for their hard work and effort the majority of the time. no consideration
good,"When it was a corporate store, we were great. Problems came up when it became a franchise. The co-workers and management team that I started with were great. Everyone worked well together and competed productively against one another. Under first manager, I learned what the true concept of teamwork was all about. The hardest part of the job was getting done at a decent hour. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and different guests that I had the pleasure of meeting."
good,"hot, greasy, very slow at certain point in the day. big group of people that hang out in the parking area. cooking equipment needs an upgrade. management is alright."
good,it was a work place that you had no time for breaks.worked with good co workers
good,"A typical workday was usually busy. While me and other crew members would run the line, managers would either do their counts or stay in the office. With the right co workers the day went smoothly. The most difficult times are were when we were under staffed and the service was busy. The most enjoyable part was having relationships with the regular customers."
good,"At Wendy's we are a steady company busy in the begin on the month and slow at the end of the month. I learn how to talk to customers and get orders out fast. I think the management is poor because, they all show favoritism some type of way. my co-workers are friendly and we all work as a team. I believe its nothing hard for me to do at work and i don't have no weakness but one in that's standing in one place i like to be active when i work cause i like to get the job done fast. The this i enjoy at work is when i have customers leave with a smile on they face."
good,when i was hired at jc penny's it was good and then it turned back and gotten worse when new management came along
good,a typical day at work would be trying to get through the day without quiting
good,"I enjoyed working there on days where we were fully staffed and able to complete business goals. The pay was horrible, but thats expected with a job at fast food. The General Manager was more understanding then the Managers low then her. The other managers showed favoritism and were rude to past employees that they did not get along with."
good,"Prepared the food for customers, kept the dining room cleaned and took orders for dining room and drive thru"
good,"everyday working in all around "
good,"I found that this place when not with proper management is ridicoulous. High school kids make a joke of everything, they play around alot"
good,"Working at Wendy's was great. The start of the day would consists of swiping in and to look at the  board of out task for the work period and i would get right into work mode it was costumer service so i ensured that that was happening. "
good,"Setting up for lunch or dinner rush"
good,"The job itself is easy once you get the hang of it. It's dealing with the people (crew, customers, and upper management) that is difficult. Overall it has a horrible work/life balance as you may have to work extra from time to time over your scheduled 46 hours. Your schedule also changes from week to week and if your shift is short-handed you will come home exhausted. The best part of the job is flexible working hours if you're going to school."
good,A typical day at wendys is stocking and fast paced. I learned how to make the food and also how to greet and solve customers complaints.
good,This was the job I worked through out high school. After I graduated my hours got cut even though I was supposed to move up to full time. I didn't see any future with the company.
good,"As an Employe in Wendy's, 2 of The Manager's were very kind & understanding but, one of the newer supervisors wasn't very friendly to the new employee's. I had issues with one of the co-workers but, once I brought it to the managers attention we were able to resolve it. Over all aside from the small issues. It was a great & fun experience. I wouldn't mind working at another Wendy's again."
good,I enjoyed being able to assist customers on their needs. I was a cashier.. My co-workers were friendly
good,"A typical day for me would consist of cleaning, running my register, greeting customers and making sure they leave with a smile. Management is decent and my co-workers are great. The hardest part of my job is dealing with angry customers. The easiest part of my job is making sure my customers leave with a smile."
good,"Customers were kind and thoughtful when first starting, and co-workers were great at assisting me when I needed help."
good,"fast paced, working late at night till 3am was fun, sundays were very busy. hot in the summer and cold in the winter"
good,"not sure if I should be writing this but the first couple years were ok until I started needing to pay my own bills. They taught me all the skills I needed and I was very hardworking with a keen attention for detail and order. I didn't mind putting in the hours either. I was never considered for a management position of any sort and I was bullied in the workplace and when new employees were hired, the staff who was there for years before had their hours cut. It was very cheap and the management needs to be upgraded on how they run a restaurant."
good,This was a nice part-time job for me after school. I really like this job.
good,"Wendys is a great place to be at if you want to be the person to have no life. I love my crew but the management including the GM needs to be redone. My gm will take as many days off and make the other managers work all the days, plus he wont work nights only days. A typical day at my job would be coming in at 3pm getting my shift together making sure the store is stocked and start running my shift until the end uf the night at 12am. I had to make sure drive thru time us below so many seconds."
good,A typical day at work was very hard and the customers would yell a lot for no reason and my manager didn't know what she was doing. I learned how to calm angry customers down. The manager told all the white people that we had to learn Spanish to communicate with the Hispanic works since they didn't know English.The hardest part of my job was keeping my manager happy. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I made an angry customer satisfied.
good,Can be a very fun place to work. The hardest part is working with some of the people you do. It was good overall job. My favorite part was working the night shift. It was never a boring job
good,"Would go to work 3-4 days a week, work for about 6 hours a day I learned to deal with different types of customers and how to talk to them if they weren't in a good mood my co-workers were ok some of the time, I would say the hardest part of the job was lunch and dinner rush and the easiest was at night when I had to clean and close the dining area."
good,Training is fast as well as intense. You must be willing to work a great many extra hours in order to succeed. If you aren't willing this is not the job for you.
good,train on preparing the salad bar. then making salads to go. work at fry station. work on the grill cooking the burger and making it.
good,"One day of work at Wendy's is not easy but I did what I had to do to have a job. I've learned how to deal with ignorant people, how to work with a cash register, how to make sandwiches, and how to take a customers order. My co-workers at Wendy's were some of the friendliest people I have met in my life I had a wonderful time working with them. The hardest part of the job was the fast paced non-stop on going sales of the food and getting the food out to customers at a reasonable time. The most enoyable part of the job ws the 30 minute reak everyone had at a certain time of the day. Working at Wendy's restaurant was a great experience for me."
good,"Good food, some good workers, but the store manager left alot to be desired. "
good,"Maintaining products being dropped,the management is great at times my co-workers could be better the hardest part of the job is getting everything done on time without forgetting things."
good,I did not really like my job it is sometimes boring and they mostly talk in spanish
good,"Never liked this job, standing in one spot all day isnt for me."
good,"Working Here I Learned A-lot About Being A Cashier . Management Had Poor Conduct, Not So Positive With Crew Members . Hardest Thing About Working At Wendy's Would Be The Amount Of People To Serve Daily .In All , I Enjoyed Working Here ."
good,I would enjoy it more if there were a little more new people working.
good,"In the two and one half years I worked at Wendys, it changed drastically. Overall we were expected to learn all crew member positions (front register and dining room, drive through, fry station, grill, sandwiches and coordinater) and go wherever we're placed maintaining health and safety procedures at a fast pace. Ability to multitask and provide exceptional service at a quick rate meant the oppurtunity to advance in the company. When my stores district manager put in an inquiry on a promotion for me, my general manager said she wouldn't promote anyone from her store who did not have a drivers license. This is not a requirement from the company and my boss was aware of my desire to move up from day one, telling me they support me and I deserve it. Clearly after a year and a half of giving my all this news lowered my spirit but I continued to do my best. I enjoyed the friendly customers and coworkers and particularly extra cleaning jobs when we weren't busy. Though they were required to be done, no one specific had to do them so there was always things to do! My absolute biggest benefit working at Wendys was the schedule. What you wanted, they tried to provide. Knowing this, I requested 10 hour shifts for four consecutive days but I understand that is a luxury most companies cannot provide. I enjoyed my job a long time but left do to mandatory hour cuts and unfair treatment. Relatives ect. of higher ups recieved better raises and often did much less work. If I work for a company I WILL give it my all but I want more than a 10 cent raise a year and no benefits. Full time or overtime"
good,Grill cook with variety of different personalities in the work place. Culturally diverse and fun atmosphere at times
good,"Normally, i'll clock in and begin setting up my front register area for the day. I usually had to do most of the work because of the lack of gusto in the other front couter employees. Id clean the bathroom, dining area,tock up all the food on front, etc. The customers would trickle in during morning hours and we would progressively become busier as the day went on, Im very good about keeping uip with the rush. The only real issues i had were more than occasional displays of favoritism, the managers's daughters felt they didnt have to work and constantly gave attitudes to the customers and other fellow employees. The best part of the job was DEFINITELY going home."
good,"make sandwiches/ potatoes/ and salads, handling counter/customer/drinks/money."
good,"sum lack of traning. inconstance in management. I also seen manager's talk rude to employees. We all had to have head sets on, you can hear everything said. Some words can't be mentioned."
good,I loved comming into work knowing that I was going to have great managers and co-workers to be with.
good,Required effective and efficient customer service. Patience while working in team oriented environment is necessary.
good,"Greeat coworkers, The customersHaving parties, the manager wasvery nice an understanding"
good,"Great place to start good work ethics. Helps you manage your time, learn to work with a variety of people. Motivates you to get an education."
good,It's fast paced and you work several positions at once. There's no benefits and don't expect a raise.
good,"A typical day at work would've been greeting customers, taking orders, maintaining a clean dinning area and sometimes preparing the orders. Management was pretty strict. My co-workers and I got along pretty well. The hardest part of the job was smelling hot grease for hours but the most enjoyable was feeding the people."
good,"When I first started to work here I was a high school student, and though I barely got any hours, it worked well with me. But wendys had me do a rediculous amount of multi-tasking for litile pay. Ridiculous management breathing down my throat, I worked drive through. If your not a convict or extremely desperate.... find a better job IM WARNING"
good,"Its a typical fast food restaurant. They only care about faster, faster and faster. The store was nasty, needs to be shut down and cleaned. The worst thing was the store manager did not care and was skimming money and supplies from the store."
good,"Taking customers orders, handing cash, dishes, morning food prep, assembling food, training others for positions."
good,A typical day was high energy and busy- i learned to work well with a team- management was a bit rude - my co-workers were helpful and friendly - the hardest part of the job was trying to remember everything and keep up - the most enjoyable part was learning and being able to do something new very well
good,When we come in we jumped right to work on either the grill or sandwiches . The days where always busy with lots of customers. Lunch was probably the busiest part of the day. The management was doing there jobs...
good,A typical day at work is basically getting ready for a lunch rush
good,typical day at Wendys if working line like i did was just basically dropping fries and making burgers but this job requires a great hearing ability and fast preperation
good,"any thing from cleaning store to preparing food, taking orders, serving customers, helping the manager with opening prep for the day"
good,One of the lowest paying fast food job. So coming from McDonald's to Wendy's was like wow. Other than that it was like any basic fast food restaurant.
good,"I went in at 7 to prep for the day, ran cash register, and ran the lines. I got off at 4."
good,overall a good place to work for a high school or college student..
good,What can you expect from a fast food job. Low pay and bad work.
good,Nothing much to really say it was work did what i had to do.This job had its ups and downs like anything else in life. I really enjoyed the crew members I worked with. A typical work day is a lil laid back early morning then becomes very busy between 10am-2pm. I learned how to still remain productive and function effectively during high volume. The thing I enjoyed most was the opportunity to meet new people and to really get to know our regular customers making their experience worth wild so that they would continue to enjoy the wendys way.
good,"Fast passed, always something new, contionusly training management and crew. Making the difference today to make tommorrow better. Good customer satisfaction makes the job rewarding. Dealing with problems you have never faced before is the hardest part of the job."
good,I loved working at Wendy's. I got along with everyone and I loved my regular customers.
good,I wouldn't recommend it to college students or family orientated individuals because of the uncertain work hours and indefinite hours.
good,"Clean food preparation areas, cooking surfaces, and utensils."
good,"A typical work day is fairly busy. Not over bearing though. I learned a lot about management. Working here gave me really good communication skills, time management skills, & just an overall good experience. The environment was pleasant. I got along great with all my co-workers & bosses. & I still check in with them from time to time. The hardest part I would have to say wouldn't even be customers but if a co-worker were to not show up for work it can get a bit more hectic then usual but we always please our customers. Other than that I loved working at Wendy's. From the people you meet every day to the experience."
good,I learned how to oprate the cashier. I had enjoyed cooking. However the hard part about the job was when i had to work during rush hour.
good,"Its a really fun place to work, with the rite ppl, but some ppl might not like u cuz of your higher power"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of prep work, taking orders, cleaning tasks, food preparation and sales. I learned how to use a cash register, how to clean in a timely manner while will doing it correctly and i also learned how to multitask. Management was not very consistent, our store had a lot of transfers due to fraternization with the crew. Co workers were easily managed but weren't taught well to work as a team. the hardest part of the job was the crew not working as a team to make time goals. The most Enjoyable part of the job was the fast paced environment and being face to face with customers."
good,"read above...nothing to write home about, the overall store was a sad little affair, and there was no free meals even though they paid a dime on the dollar for food."
good,This was one of the best job's I ever had. I loved the workers there.
good,"The pay was good, the people in stores were fun to work with. There is no life outside when you work as a manager. Schedules change weekly, sometimes more as needed. Corporate had unrealistic expectations and gave no tools to meet them. In my time there I learned a lot of skills that will be useful in other pursuits."
good,The best thing about Wendy's is that you always have something you can do. Time always seemed to go fast because of he non-stop working. Working here I've realized its time to better my career. I don't feel the management is as professional as I would like.Many co-workers should be fired but are allowed to get away with things that are jaw dropping.The hardest part about the job is I feel like I could manage it much better then it is now. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy and knowing they will return.
good,I enjoy my first job. I learned how to work with others and make the custmers happy. I always learned how to cook.
good,Prepare and serve food. Cash Register. I learned everything about customer service at Wendys. Management was alrite. Some of them. Hardest part is when you get a rush and your not prepeared. (Food Wise)
good,"Learned alot enjoyed my crew. Love the customers, work schedule not bad. enjoy working with others in a team environment."
good,Help me build teamwork and productive skills. Tyipcal day is long. 4- Close. Co-worker are good team memmber we keep each other in line. Hardest part of my job is just not messing up.
good,"Everyday I was there I felt trapped, the management would rest, and do as little work as possible, while the employees did all of the stressful, time consuming work. I liked my coworkers, and at times I liked my managers, but at $7.67 an hour the emotional distress, and physical labor was not worth it. The most enjoyable part was dealing with customers, on a typical day I had to deal with hundreds of customers, restock, clean, get yelled at, than stop everything when a customer came, than I had to run the food, make drinks, get money, prepare frys, and bag the food. This job would have been a lot better if people helped each other out. I learned that Wendy's is not a well run corporation, but this whole experience did help me mature, and grow up, this was an enlivening experience for a 17 year old."
good,"At the time of my promotion it an enjoyable place towork. But with Gm,s coming and going their values have changed"
good,A typical day at work was rush hour in the morning and disrespectful customers in the night . I learned to be patient and respectful. The co workers played around alot and the manager was helpful
good,At first it was a very good working environment and we got along with just about everybody and really didnt have a lot of problems to speak of. Then we changed Management and it went down hill from there. We had unbelievably slow employees and people that didnt seem to care about their job. I had too keep in mind that not everybody was like me. I loved to work and I work very hard as well. The most enjoyable part of the job the free food we received at close time.
good,"Working at Wendy's, you would basically want to quit because of how much my GM yelled for nothing. It was my first job and i took it very serious. I learned how to make sandwiches, salads and also learned a little about the grill but, i was mainly working on the register. My co-workers were funny and they actually brought life to the store. If it wasn't for them, i would say it would be boring at work every day. Some of my managers had attitude problems and the rest was very relaxed but also stayed on us to do work."
good,Alot of mutli tasking involved. Cashier and customer service always neccessary.It was nice to interact with customers and making them happy with a nive warm meal.
good,i was the one that trained all of my employees that worked will me
good,wendys overall is a good place to work i would like more room for advancement work and life balance
good,Working at wendys has giving me the chance to learn how to multi-task at a fast paste. Staying busy is a everyday task at wendys. Management is getting better. Co- worker are friendly and very helpful. There nothing hard about working at Wendys. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we get to make our own schedule.
good,•Soliciting and packing orders
good,"My day at Wendy's consisted of me attending to the front register, cleaning the restrooms, cleaning the dining area and mopping the floor. My supervisors were very patient and thorough with their training. The hardest part of the job was taking certain machines apart to be cleaned. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people."
good,"A typical day at that job was cashiering people and giving hospitable service, keeping everything clean and stocked."
good,"A typical day would be either flipping patty's or cooking fries of taking orders at the cash register. i learned how to work the register how the food was made and cooked. my managers were nice. my co-workers were nice. the hardest part was dealing with customers they were very rude, and impatient. the most enjoyable was the discount on food"
good,i was there part time for reasons and was going to school didnt learn much but how to make burgers but met alot of good friends from there my manager who was a vietnam vet inspired me to go military
good,It was a fun job to have. It was just work hours are completely crazy.
good,"A typical day of work all depends on who is scheduled to work that day. I do not usually learn anything new on a daily basis. Of course, I am only scheduled to work 2 days a week. The management staff seems more interested in employees being their friend than anything else. There are a few good employees with a great attitude who know how to work as a team, however there are others who have no idea what team work is and are constantly complaining and making everyone else as miserable as possible. The hardest part of the job is the stress caused about time and not necessarily quality which makes no sense to me. The most enjoyable part are the nights we have a great crew who knows how to work together and get things done correctly and efficiently."
good,"The time I worked was busy mainly because it was lunch hour. It was not that hard to handle, i can take the fast paced responsibilities. Management was good at first but until I had the recent problem I did not like how it was handled. It could of been done in a business like way. The hardest part I would say would be remembering to make the shakes for drive thru because it was so busy i wouldn't always hear them call out for shakes, but I soon caught on. The most enjoyable is meeting new people."
good,"Good company, met some nice people to work with. Had fun working there. Great food and drinks."
good,"wendys is a great place to work if you're still in school, Its a good 1st job."
good,I started working at Wendy's when I came home from college. It is a good place to work.
good,I enjoyed working at Wendys but it was time for a career change for me.
good,Its really easy just got to keep your work place clean something they failed to do. I really liked working there until new management came in. They were drug addicts
good,Good place to work if you're looking for something that can help you in the future towards other jobs. Job work life balance was mediocre and the management varies store to store.
good,"Great company to work for..flexible schedules..room for advancement..lots of potential for bonus earnings..training available.."
good,I love my job and who I work with but making 7.50-8 is not enough for what we deal with and nobody can live off minimum wage it's ridiculous.!!  Wendys needs to up there pay before they hav nobody working in there besides teenagers people with out kids and nothing else to worry about but themselves...
good,I love this job alot! But the problem is is alot of just drama and not helping me out when i really need it but i bend over backwards for them and they can't help me out when i needed it most
good,"Great for a high school student looking to make some money through school, not a full time job or something to stay with. Provides work experience that can adapt to other careers, such as multitasking and time management."
good,"Management at my specific location was unnecessarily unpleasant, maybe if they had more realistic expectations and relaxed it would not have been that bad of an experience"
good,I honestly don’t know what to say. I do t like my job here and I need a new job desperately i need an environment that’ll help my skin because fast food is not the right place
good,I loved working for Wendys. Until I was promised advancement and a raise if I met certain goals. I met my goals. I worked for Wendy's for over 3 years. I was never given any position or any raise.
good,"This was my first job ever, as I had just turned 16. I did not really think about it that well, and it was just too much for me. The rushes made me feel overly exhausted, and I am leaving soon. The management didn’t train me well, and mostly let the other employees train me, which they also did not do so well."
good,"Good start up job. Was a fast hire, managers are very friendly and helpful. I would hire back on if the jib was located closer to my house. Good pay for the shifts they have."
good,I walk into work say hello to everyone wait for my manger to clock me I normally come in between morning and night shift so I float around until 5 then the night time manger tells me where he wants me everyone is nice but sometimes they get lazy and play around and not want to do anything and I work till close so I be tired and ready to go home but other than that its a great work space
good,"Most of the time"
good,"I really had fun working there. The employees are very nice and easy to work with. And the managers will work with your schedule sometimes, but if they can they will"
good,Managers are good. Not so much for the store manager. It's a fairly easy job but often under staffed like all fast food places. They have too many dishes to wash.
good,"Big company with big company culture.  Great to gain experience, especially for digital projects.  Not much room for advancement or long term employment anymore."
good,"Management was all over the place, there was no communication between anyone. I would usually find out stuff from overhearing things, instead of being told what exactly was going on. I was moved from one store to the next three times over within the year i was with them. I never compensated for gas even though I was forced to drive over an hour to work because out of the blue my regional manager decided without even talking to me that I was going to work at the Decatur Wendys,"
good,Wendys overall is not a bad company to work for if you work for the right people. they can be flexible with you but only after you bend over backwards for them.it would have a better review if the higher ups actually listened to the things being brought to them. Its a starter job.
good,"Great job for kids ."
good,The hardest part about working at wendy's was doing the trash because I had bring all the bags up a huge flight of steps.I learned how to mops restaurant floors correctly and also learned how wash dishes that have been burned during the cooking process.
good,If i got paid properly then i wouldnt want to leave. Need better pay for management. Its like working as a crew reason most managers resign because unfair pay
good,I would highly reccomend for a student but no chance to move up management is sloppy but they will work around the hours that you need and will give you the basic training needed to safely do your job.
good,"Entré a trabajar en Octubre de 2017 y renuncié luego de 3 meses porque no me querían pagar horas extra, y por la mala relación con mi gerenta. El pago era cada quince días, el sueldo era muy bajo, siendo el primero de $480. Los siguientes sueldos no llegaban a los $4000. Cobré un poco más de eso cuando renuncié. Generalmente cobraba entre dos mil y tres mil pesos. Igualmente hay que considerar que era otra la situación económica y ya no tengo información sobre el cobro de sueldos en esta empresa"
good,"Had some poor management at times "
good,"It depends on who you work with that actually's help you out and everything,even if you have a bad day at Wendy's there is someone there to make you feel better."
good,"Low pay and incredibly stressful environment. Management was poor, allowed other people to manage my drawer. Overall a bad work experience. I only worked there for 3 months."
good,"At first, working there and not knowing anyone is pretty scary but everyone is easy to get along with. They worked around my school schedule but had difficulty working around extreme sick days and family emergencies."
good,It's a job I go to work do what I'm supposed to do and go home it could be better on certain situations but I'm not the one running the place I just do my job and try to help the company as much as I can
good,Never made enough money to pay bills. They never gave me enough training for the things they had me do and the workers worked poorly and slow. And didnt keep good workers environment.
good,"At first, for it is my first job, it was a good beginner job. The only problem with the job is that employees aren’t reliable and it really showed in the effectiveness of the job. Though the management was good and it taught me about work-life."
good,"Used to be a great place to work and great for career advancement. But lately they don't really seem to care about their employees,  or the fact their employees have family, kids or a life.  They allow the managers to mistreat crew. Some general managers yell and degrade their crew and managers under them and after allowed to get away with it. Don't get me wrong not all the stores are bad. Steer clear of"
good,it was a good job while i was in high school. start times where very flexible  with my school schedule. management was good but the owner of my store was not nice towards any of his employees.
good,"I been working for Wendys for 2 and half years I enjoyed the job , knew everything there , but management was rude , it’s easy , you just need to be fast paced , and serve fresh and on time"
good,I personally liked working at Wendy’s the staff was great everyone got along for the most part. The general manger was really ignorant and made me dislike the job
good,Pay is good I made like nearly up $500 on pay day and I was in high school working full time hours. They do little free meal cards. Management is aight.
good,Working here is a good job to start off with but doesn't pay much. A typical day at work is fast paced .Management isn't that great. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers.
good,Great place to work for a first job needs better management. I worked night crew so my job was  complicated  But  extremely easy. I loved the fasted past of working there
good,I didn't like working because  they  were rude and they didn't pay enough for everything and the hours I had it was not working here anymore so I founded a different  job but while  I worked here I learn lots of new things
good,I had problems with the management where they did not speak to me respectfully. They take advantage of their crew and an old manager who doesn’t work their anymore was very rude to me multiple times. That manager had 6-8 complaints and she was never fired. I call that white privileged.
good,It really was a wonderful experience to work for this company. The pay was nice but it was not fit for the lifestyle I choose to live. Working with a great team was really lovely.
good,But if you plan on making it a career you better enjoy the store you are at. I don’t really want to talk about anything else because each person’s experience will be different.
good,Management kept decreasing my hours for week. My hours were splitted amongs other workers who wanted more hours. Then they start giving me more off days as well.
good,Management screwed me over as a part time crew member I was working 40-50 hour weeks but only getting payed for 40 hours and the extra hours that I did work were put on next weeks pay check. Plus the location I was at had a rough patch I was called in a lot because of other employees quitting or no shows.
good,Found that it's perfect for obtaining skills but not good for long term. stressful and very fast paced environment. My experience was not bad but felt no value.
good,"I'm a people person, so the customers made me smile every day that I worked and Visa versa. The hours not being organized put a strain on me and my other life functions."
good,"pay was too low for the amount of hours and how hard the work could be. there were many people who were promoted to managers or shift leads that were not responsible enough and were terrible workers. the process for promoting needs to be discussed more with all parties. training to be a shift lead, at least for me, was very quick. on my first closing shift as a shift lead I had not  been told that there was a alarm system and didn't know how to set it."
good,"Working here can be great, however if you have a set schedule outside of work you can severely get screwed. You must expressly say you don't want to work night shift or you will be put on it. Even if you're in school, they don't care."
good,I have worked there for two year worked in times where we only had 12 employees on the schedule and like eifht of them werent night crew. I have worked on days where it was just me and the manager in the kitchen. I have worked my butt off for mt job and for what to be treated the way i am? I give and i give and i always get the short end of the stick.
good,"Willing to work with scheduling, but short staffed and need to work on morale and building up the younger crew members. Also wouldn't hurt to have a more competitive wage."
good,"The restaurant had run out of items multiple times because of the general managers lack of attention to inventory. Our manager is always disorganized, unprofessional and treats the employees poorly."
good,Wendys is a wonderful place to work. Except the main issue there is lack of communication and lack of care for employees. Everything is about the business while it should be about both the business and the employees.
good,"Working at Wendy’s I wouldn’t say was the best. The managers never really fully trained me in what I needed to do so I had to watch the other staff and figure it out. I would also almost never get a break time and I was working 40 hours a week. My experience with Wendy’s wasn’t the best, but I do not think it has been the worst experience."
good,"I felt pretty okay about working there, had a little complications with the staff but got it resolved. Other than that I loved the staff and management."
good,"It was a relatively fun place to work, the crew was very close to each other and worked very closely in a small space, there wasn't a lot of room to chill. People would get very angry and yell at you if the food didn't come out fast enough."
good,"ivv worked there a good time and its wasn't the job I hoped to have at the time but i was in high school but either way, I learn great communication skills that still help out now"
good,Ok job .  Manager holds grudges if you request to much time off. When you are able to work more hours she cuts back because you requested time off previously.
good,"The job is okay and the management needs more work. Some of the members aren't the best there and if you need a job for the first time to start off with, it's alright. But if you have the chance to find a better one elsewhere, you should find better opportunities!"
good,If paid $14 an hour plus benefits it may be worthwhile and staffing would be fuller than it is. Many fast food spots are very short staffed. I believe that working many hours on your feet and problem solving with crew and customers should be paid more than minimum wage. I consider fast food work is hard labor due to the fast paced environment and the amount of time on foot.
good,"I have worked for Wendy's for 7 years a year and a half as a crew member and 5 and a half years as a manager. To start I wanted to say it isnt a bad job. There are decent health benefits,  a bonus program and vacation time. However, to me the cons out way the good. I work ten hour shifts five days a week and hardly ever get a break. We are always short staffed so as a manager I am forced to run several positions at once and still maintain guest happiness and food safety practices. In my seven years I have worked at 8 locations longer than three months. The district manager throws you in between locations at will with no regard to how much time and effort you have put into to training crew members and getting rapor with customers you are suddenly thrown in another location and asked to do the same you did at the previous location with a completly different crew and fellow managers. Also there is no set schedual. I hardly ever have two days off together I am constantly either opening the store or closing the store or working a mid shift with no consistancy. I'll have maybe a monday and a friday off one week and the next maybe tuesday and saturday. Raises are a joke I only make three dollars above minimum wage after being wih the company for seven years? The bonus program is not an excuse to pay employees less. Not to mention it really only benefits the general manager and district managers. As a co manager I get only half the bonus the general manager gets while I do the same amount if not more work than they do. Also there are no other perks for a non general manager. The general"
good,"For perspective the only good manager said ""just because I get paid 1$ more than you doesn't justify me yelling at you for the littlest thing"" if you were unlucky and came in on a day with a bad manager they would constantly stress you to the point of the quality of the food you were putting out dropping"
good,My first job. It was very tough and they had alot of pressure on me to do everyones job and if i didnt do it it wouldnt get done. I got promised more pay but never recieved it.
good,"This company is great for those seeking basic employment. While not a life long job for most, the company overall is detailed in its training and has policies in place that uplift morale in a unforgiving industry"
good,"It’s good place ! The management should give hardworking ppl raises instead of asking for it , good place to work , I would recommended to anyone who is staring ."
good,I would recommend it as a first job because it isn't a life long career and I would say it teaches you how to deal with customers and unpleasant people.
good,a day at work is usually always fast paced and not relaxed. things I learned is to multitask. management let the employees work out the problems a lot of the times. the hardest part about the job is the rude customers.  the most enjoyable part is laughing and getting along with your co-workers.
good,"A day at work would require stocking your work station, preparing beverages and bagging food for customers. Moving the drive thru in a timely fashion. Working with other employees to ensure the best service for the customer."
good,"Wendy’s is full of drama, the manager talks to her self non stop and yells nonsense at all the workers. There is so much drama it’s like a high school cafeteria."
good,Working at this company was stressful yet ok sometimes fun but recently it ran through its 3rd RM. Sense ive been there different management different issues.
good,The Wendy's I have worked at had a clean environment and staff was nice. I really liked the manager there. She does not work there anymore but she was nice too.
good,"Simple job tasks of computing someone's order, making their food and getting it to them in a timely and respectable manner. Can be very fast-paced at times and the work efforts of your whole shift/crew are needed. If several people are slacking, other's have to pick up their slack."
good,"Taking out trash, greeting customers, keeping lobby clea, getting food for cooks as needed, washing dishes, keeping condiment area filled, cleaning bathroom, breaking down boxes. "
good,Good and flexible hours  friendly staff and always  room for advancement. They’ll place you where you feel comfortable and good pay  to start off with
good,"Bed better employees, need to induce the rules.  Not letting them be standing around. Work on team skills and working together.  But all around I had fun and learned allot while being the for my first job"
good,It's a job to get you to the next one but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a career.  Advancement is almost impossible and the work to pay ratio is unbalanced
good,Everyone just played around. no one really worked. Good job for a highschooler after hours or a summer job.  It’s basically impossible to make a living off of this paycheck .
good,Always was understaffed. Managers were very inconsiderate. Always would run out of food and supplies. Many of the managers were very nasty when it came to sanitization.
good,One thing I liked most about working at Wendy's was you never know what to expect coming In. I enjoy helping people an seeing their face after giving them good customer service.
good,It's like any other fast food restaurant you work at.it had it good moments and bad. We were short handed alot.so that was frustrating.But overall it was not too bad and the G.M was very outgoing and kept moral up.The hardest thing about it was we couldn't keep employees.The best thing about it was that by the time we opened half my shift was over.it taught me that a lot of patience and understanding
good,"The place help me get in the workforce, It was a job that got me bye, i advance to management but wont want it to be a career. I took pride in it anyway."
good,"Typically in day I used to handle many customers , I have  learned a lot from different types of customers and situations, the team i used to have a all briefed about the roles accordingly with fun and learning work culture, pressure of management is always there but i used to perform the task effectively, at the end of the of the way we all smiling and performing our jobs responsibly ."
good,"During our slow hours it wasn't too bad, but during our lunch rush and dinner rush was when the fun happeneed. I learned that working together benefits in the long run especially in the fast food industry. Select managers were enjoyable to work with as well as fellow employees."
good,The managers there are VERY rude and it would not recommend anyone to go there for a job. They pick favorite employees and talk bad about the other employees behind their backs. It's not very clean either.
good,"Its a first time job for Teenagers, its a job where you can grow and learn as young high school senior, you could be productive when you go get another job elsewhere."
good,"Everyone helps everyone, no one leaves anyone out, it depends on who the person is and what they do in order to help that person, they all work hard and do a great job. They were very polite and patient"
good,"Working at Wendys is a fairly easy job, the only real problem with working here or any other fast food place is usually the management. It is always changing daily and a lot of confusion comes while working in this work area."
good,They need mature workers and they need to stop hiring friends to work together  it’s like everyone knows everyone they have shootouts inside the store they have people jumping behind the counter to grab they mate out the door last week a worker jumped on her child’s father in the store it’s just too much
good,I was left alone to do everything!! I never got off on time and the DM was horrible. She was rude and thought she was better than everyone. She yelled at the staff in front of the customers.
good,Make foods for the customers. Also some of the customer are very nice to talk too. learned how to make different salads and burgers.the hardest part was to learn which burger got what on it.
good,"I just feel like this is the typical first job for high school students: Minimum wage, part-time with minimal benfits (mainly because of it being part-time)."
good,Working at wendy's was very fast paced but also laid back. Management was wonderful to the crew members giving them incentives to work harder and praising them when they were doing well.
good,"The Wendy's I worked at was not a franchise and was independently owned, so my ratings don't judge the company as a whole, but from my experience with ONE Wendy's. The store was located close to my college, so commuting wasn't an issue. The co-workers were friendly and nice. As a manager, I answered to our GM and the owner, both of whom were understanding about having to come in late due to finals, midterms ans things of that nature. However, the reason I left was because they would not accommodate my new school schedule cause I would have to work on weekends as opposed to working Tuesdays and Thursdays when I had class from 0930-1800.But all in all, not a bad job"
good,"I took orders and engaged with the customers. I cleaned the dining area, work area, bathrooms, took out the trash, and supplied/organized stock and supplies. I learned how to multitask and efficiently complete the customer's order. The only problem was I never received official training. I learned through watching how others work and watching videos that are required to be shown to new employees. I was occasionally told to manage the grill or make sandwiches even though I was never told to practice these particular methods"
good,Great experience working there even though I was in a tough situation that caused me to only call out for a day. Belief is one thing yet in business grounds for understanding goes a lot further.
good,"not getting enough hours"
good,I worked there for about a year just until I went to college. Was a good close to home job. But I wouldn’t work there again. Just wasn’t the right job for me.
good,"Wendy's is a nice place to work if you don't mind a fast paced environment! You have to catch on quick for a job like this. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and management they became friends to me, so that made the job a little easier and more fun!"
good,I strongly believe everyone should experience working at a fast-food especially when you are 16-18 but as an actual career it Is definitely hard to survive. It was a great job in high school that taught me to value money as well as how rude people can actually be but it was definitely not a job I needed in college.
good,Learned register and burgers  was a great place hours just got cut back badly because of college kids but other than that I never really had a problem.
good,"Due to poor management, I regretfully quit my job with Wendy's. I thoroughly enjoyed my responsibilities and team at the job. But one supervisor and her poor managerial skills caused me to quit and never look back."
good,"Surprising, Wendys was a great company to work for if you wanted to advance.  There's little to no vacation time unless you've been there for a ridiculous amount of time. Team work is key there though and you want to be humbled and learn how to run a restaurant."
good,it is good for training ground and get some experience for those who are newbie but not for a life time job. need suggestion box for both customers and employee.
good,"At first it was a good job. People were nice there from time to time but it was stressful. I felt like the training was rushed and that some people didn't know everything that they needed. After school started it felt like they were hesitant to change mt days. Which I understood but when it got to the point where I would only request not working Mondays, it took forever for them to change that. It was only until the last 2 weeks at my job did I even see that. The work itself wasn't bad."
good,They keep managers at work for long periods and gms are on call with a strict schedule. Not flexible. Hardly gave out raises. Upper management very rude and uncaring. Company owner didnt give proper materials for training. Never fixed anything in an older building.
good,Wendy’s is a organization where you make the most out of it. Only thing I enjoyed was the employees and discount on foods. The service was great depending on the scheduled crew.
good,"I feel like the General manager does a whole lot more work than she receives credit for. She is an excellent employee and should be respected more by her boss or bosses. She is always there to help the employees even if it is not necessary. She gives rides to some of the employees that have transportation issues, she works with personal schedules and always tries to make sure they are off when requested, and helps new employees learn the proper procedures without getting hateful or stressed out. She is put down and disrespected by other managers or team members who feel like they should be in her position and its not right.!!"
good,It was good for a fast food part-time job. I had long shifts during the night but management made it easy to get through it. I enjoyed working there for the most part.
good,In short Management needed some improvements and needed to let go of some employees. I will miss working with some of the managers and my time there wasn't all to bad.
good,"Wendys offered me my first job.  It was okay for high-school, however it does not offer enough to pay bills.  That is why I had to leave the company!!"
good,Working at wendys help build you for future things that has to be done in a fast past.The job isnt easy to do because ypur always busy and have something to do whether its your job or helping others or assisting guess.
good,Some management needs improvement. General manager refused to work around personal events. Threatened to cut hours and belittlement in front of other employees.
good,"Wendys was a very easy job to get, and keep. The management there is so used to low performing employees, so any hard work is much appreciated. Overall, working here was not worth putting in the extra work to make up for the people that werent good at their job."
good,"It was a fun place to work, I started off as a cook but soon start working cashier. I had a great work environment with friendly co-workers and nice managers"
good,Poor management made for a stressful work environment / work place. Provided decent pay and benefits. Did not provide steady hours. Uniforms supplied by the company.
good,"Wendy's gave me an opportunity to save up money during the summer. At times it was slow and at other times it was really busy. I learned how to work the cashier, the Frosty machine, the fryer, and the drive-thru window."
good,"Management is lenient towards their favorite employees, if they don't like you they give you all the awful jobs every day. The old GM wouldn't even come out of the office to help when we got busy."
good,My experience at Wendy's restaurant has been ok so far. Great learning experience. Some co workers are friendly and others may not be TO open to conversation.
good,Entry level job. It's very easy to learn everything you need to do for this job. It isn't hard unless your team doesn't work together. Focus on your skills and you won't have a hard time
good,"Overall the workplace is fast paced, but a bit unclean. I hoped to get a better job in retail continuing my experience to bigger pay and new experiences."
good,Wendy's is good only as a side job. Your paid minimum wage. You don't get any health care benefits. Your surrounded by kids. You often have to do your job as well as someone else because Wendy's is always short on employees. They are very understaffed
good,"Good place to work for a fresh out of or in highschool job, friendly people, could use better management towards employees on accountability of communication"
good,Although my time at Wendy's was rather difficult I do thank it because it has prepared me for heavy duty work. Having 3 total employees per shift at a fast food restaurant is very difficult. it only that but to be placed as a manager without prior experience was stressful but gave me a lot of experience. Also working about 32+ hours as a student during a school semester I had to manage my time perfectly.
good,"Wendys is a great place where you could learn more about the role someone has enrolled for. However, since you are required to go to work 6 times per week, it somehow comprise work-life balance which is essential for all employees."
good,"Started off really good and got along with everybody but then a lot of ppl have drama tht makes things harder also the managers and gm’s are sometimes rude , it’s a lot of work but i enjoyed it most times"
good,the store was outdated and the managers showed favoritism.  undeserving people received promotions.  this is a job for a high school student thats it.
good,"This job is a very fast paced job. When working the drive thru it is a must to get the car in and out as quickly as possible. My managers were great and always tried to be sure everything was under control and nothing got chaotic. The hardest thing about working at Wendy's was being short staffed all the time which would double my responsibilities and make things a little harder, but I always worked as quickly as possible to ensure that my customers were satisfied."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's considering it was my first job, obviously fat food isn't where i wanted to work forever so i ended up leaving on great terms, told to come back whenever i want and that me and my work for Wendy's will be missed. It is a positive work place with great people."
good,"It isn’t terrible as a starting job, that being said I would suggest this job for mostly teenagers, or anyone who doesn’t pay bills, mainly cause the work is relatively easy, but the pay isn’t much."
good,"things went well for a time, unfortunately the franchisee was more focused on the bottom line instead of how you get there. my location ended up becoming the profit driver to cover for poor management at other locations. this led to cut corners and under staffing to save money. over time my satisfaction waned and was replaced with the feeling like i was never going to please the boss. not an environment i felt i deserved."
good,I don’t agree with some of the managing choices and how they treat their employees but for the most part I had a good experience working there. Very fun supportive coworkers and mostly positive energies
good,This is a job if you are a single person that doesn’t have a lot of bills or children to take care of. It is quite stressful at times. The district managers always complain about how fast but don’t care about quality.
good,I was working to hard for the pay I was receiving. But the job was great while it lasted. It was just time to move on to some better for what I was trying to do.
good,"It's my first job so i can't expect much, but it is very unorganized. Nothing is really stable. The pay is pretty low considering the amount of work that you have to do. It is often fast paced, and sometimes there can be rude customers. It is often very hot as you are around grills and fryers all the time and constantly on your feet. Lunch break is whenever you can get it basically. It is only 30 minutes and unpaid. You do get a 50% percent off of your food for the employee discount and the drinks are free."
good,Everyone is friendly and chirpy around customers. Will always try to please the customers. A lot of things could be upgraded like the inside and some new headsets.
good,"While I enjoy working at Wendys I am seeking a full-time day position to allow me time with my young daughter. I love the customers, they drive the business."
good,Didn't like working there. They didn't have any respect and their attitude was really ignorant. I would not recommend this job to anyone. They gave you really bad hours.
good,"Typical fast food job, and all the daily stuff that a job like this entails. Quality of food and standards in considerably higher than most places. Not a bad place to work overall"
good,You will love working but don't get to comfortable with co-workers. Pay attention and listen. Move as fast as you can on fast day's and also smile. Be respectful to customers.
good,"Depending on if we were short staffed or not, we're either really busy or really slow. Environment was full of drama most of the time. Customers were rude at times."
good,"I didn't have a lot of problems working for Wendy's. I just feel that you can't pay bills or live with the wage you earn there. It's good for extra cash, but I ended up having to leave since I didn't make enough to live in my area."
good,It was a nice job for being my first job. I would not like to make a career of it. It is good for a high school student who is just starting out to gain work experience. To also gain good customer sevice. You meet differnt people on a daily basis.
good,Some supervisors had a ego problem and did no work so you had to do their workload.  The staff all got along.  Everyone had their workload and it always got done so the next shift did not have to do theirs plus yours.  Managers even did dishes if it was busy.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. I enjoyed interacting with customers. It was often late hours on the closing shift. I did a lot of different things so it wasn't boring.
good,"Upper management makes promises they can't or don't keep. Very behind on technology. Move managers around too much. They need to keep managers in one store long enough to built consistency and loyalty with their employees. A store can not grow when the management changes as much as it does here."
good,It bad mangagent sends to do a better job with crew and east clean floors AMD clean area and then at the night or middle shift they need to check on there stock on see what running low AMD were there are instead staying in office
good,"I worked at wendy’s for a little under a year, and worked every single day and got called in way too often. The management has never been great, and they even date the employees which is very unprofessional. You don’t get raises, despite the fact that they tell you that you are."
good,"Can be a fun place to work. Depends on management team working together and not back stabbing each other. Crew usually better than mgmnt. Seems like company stopped worrying about their employees and only care about the customer's dollar,"
good,I honestly didn’t like working there because they never switch u around to other stations so you would get really tired of other people do easier and harder jobs.
good,Barely made enough to live on. Working paycheck to paycheck. Not so friendly coworkers. Not so friendly management. Hardly got a break unless asked for.
good,I lost the job due to calling off a week before a funeral they said it wasnt a problem and wanted to fire me when i came in for my first shift after the funeral because they said i gave them no notice.
good,This is a good job to start out with. It teaches responsibility and time management. It is very fast paced though and most of the time they do not have enough people working so very stressful. They have very flexible hours though.
good,Working at this particular store was a little more stressful than before but I can say I met some great people. I learned to have patients in dealing with young adults who knew so little about being responsible.
good,Bad GM loved the co-workers but could be stressful at time. Loved the people I worked with but the GM didn't do anything in the store. If there was a new GM it would be a lot better experience.
good,Wendy’s is a fast pace restaurant where you have to learn quick and also learn patience you also have to have customers service skills cause a lot of customers are not too friendly
good,"Very busy keeping up with multiple or big orders through the drive thru or in the dining room, everyday during lunchtime. The most enjoyable part of the job, is the people. All the people I work with, make it worth it being there everyday. Also as managers, free food is also very enjoyable."
good,"When I worked at Wendy's, their wasn't a lot of..structure. I always had to find something to do. I wasn't put in any kind of 'category'. Their was always another manager every time I clocked into work."
good,"fast-paced environment job was to perform great customer service,  cash handle funds, solve problems, fast on feet, multi-task with taking orders and typing."
good,filled with outgoing people who’s just as goofy as you are makes the workplace a more enjoyable place to go everyday. It has taught me a great amount.
good,Very bad management communication at the Wendys I worked at but every Wendys is different and some managers understand and work with you about medical or physical complications
good,Great for someone who is looking for some customer service experience as far as a career base I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but it is a great experience
good,I would recommend some one in high school to work here not some one who is trying to make living for themselves starting wage is 9.50 and you can't really do much with that
good,All in all not a terrible place to work however the franchisee did  not follow the rules and regulations of the provinces labour laws so unfortunately I would give this a negative rating.
good,"Typical day at work would be stressful during the busy times and when there was down time you had to restock your stations and clean. "
good,I loved working there but I would not go back. It was fun to meet new people and work with them. When we got people that came in we worked as a team and got stuff done.
good,A typical day at work was finding something to clean if it wasn’t busy and learning something new if a manager let you but often times it was relaxed.
good,people didn't wanrt to work and drank liquar on the job and we got robbed. Hated it there. Diffiucult worrking there and after the robbery i move to another Wendy;s.
good,If you need a part time job it’s a good job to have. It’s very fast paced and requires a lot of patience involving customers. I enjoyed my time there.
good,It was fine in the beginning but then the General Manager left and the entire store was in disarray for months afterwards. The shifts were extremely erratic and there was seemingly no one in charge which left people confused about what they needed to do.
good,Its a nice place to work just wish the communication was better. I wish people would want to work to get money not don't work and expect money. I feel the management team could be a lot better i don't dislike the place just wish it was ran better and i wasn't just another worker.
good,"I wouldn't really call wendy's one of the best jobs I had ever had.  "
good,"A decent job that is just poorly managed. I like working at Wendy's it can be fun and challenging. The only problem I have with the one I work at in particular are with the managers. They are very easily distracted, unfair and in the past have made me uncomfortable personally."
good,"i didnt work here long but the time i did spend here was fun at times. most of the night managers are where fun and nice, not sure if they still work here"
good,I was hired because I had friends that worked there. The environment helped me learn how to handle quick atmospheres. It paid decent and I could get time off.
good,Working at Wendy's taught me a lot about fast food restaurant business customer service skills minimum wage could've been better and the benefits could've been better too
good,"My experience at Wendys was good, except for the management of the restaurant. My general manager constantly put me down and made me feel unworthy. Overall and aside from that, I enjoyed working at Wendy's."
good,Wendy's is a fast food restaurant.  Enough said.  It's a good first job.  I wasn't given enough hours for this experience to be considered anything more than a stepping stone job.
good,"The coworkers and some of the managers are amazing and outstanding people but through out the two years of working at Wendy's what I can tell you is prepare yourself for the ""Drama"" that comes and it will also help if the GM would actually bond more with the employees to make the company successful by bond I mean actually work with the employees in the morning and night shift."
good,"At Wendy's you will never sit idle especially during the lunch hours. Always expect to be either working the register, making food, or cleaning the kitchen in some form."
good,"Staff was friendly, became family and we loved each other. Managers started going downhill when the new boss was put into place. Not a very hard job.."
good,"Not the best job in the world defiantly not the worst, it has its positives and negatives but  it needs a tighter rope around it. I really enjoy the people I work with but needs improvement."
good,"Overall the staff was OK, no complaints, its just that there was no vacation or insurance for regular employees. The location was a good idea wondwrful plaxe"
good,"Wendys is a good place to start out but not career wise. When you are in high school it is a good place to start but when college comes, you needs something more. ."
good,"a lot of yelling, very little patience. rushing and no actual benefits for anybody working less than 35 hours"
good,"On a typical day at work, it was always busy. People would get off later than their expected time, and the managers where everywhere trying to help customers and employees. I learned how to multi-task and deal with customers. The management at Wendys was poor, as my co workers would always be pressured to staying late, and they would almost never go home on time. People called in sick, and some people are didn't show up for their shift. The hardest part of my job was consistently doing multiple things at once to move the busy lines and keeping customers happy. The most enjoyable part was working with my peers."
good,"You are treated very poorly, the managers are all from Puerto Rico and if you were white they would talk bad about you in Spanish so you couldn't understand."
good,Good first job but physically demanding depending on position. Good job to get team work experience and good for meeting new people. There was a very rapid turn over rate.
good,"Overall, the atmosphere made it difficult to work there. What I did enjoy is dealing with the public. You learn how to service people from all different backgrounds."
good,"wendies was a regular place to work wit low pay no choice to raise and hilly stressfull, where cleaning the bathroom turn to kick out meth users from the toilet area"
good,Good place to start getting exposed to the working world. The hardest part of this job was making sure your register was 100% accurate and hadn't been stolen from etc.
good,Worked here for a few months had my availability from since beginning yet it was never respected. When asked to come in and I couldn’t manager would get mad .
good,"Wendys was a good place to work , didn’t give benefits or pto . Didn’t give us any sick days paid . "
good,Wendy's is a great place to work and good team members as well Eveybody helps and everyone do they part as a team members I was a cook an also help clean the store
good,"The type of things going on in the restaurant I worked in were disgusting and unprofessional. The manager, for some reason, has a hard time with scheduling so most of the time I didn't know when I worked."
good,"General Manager is amazing, crew is generally friendly, however some of the shift managers here were very poor and caused the crew to suffer due to lack of leadership."
good,I was responsible to close my section and clean that up. I greeted customers. I placed orders in. I was responsible to clean the bathrooms as well if I was closing
good,Fun and fast paced place to work but lazy management with managers that sit in the office all day eating. Was treated unfairly for having epilepsy and was terminated for calling out of work one day for having a seizure.
good,"Workin at wendys is like a typical fast food restaurant. You have you nice and rude customers, you make sure the store clean, stock , and make sure you’re doin you job. Only dislike is the pay is not worth it and no benefits."
good,"Wendys es una corporación buena en lo que a locaciones se trata, buen trabajo pero sólo como part time"
good,It was ok. I am just looking for something else that pay a little more. As a shift manager i was expecting to have sick leave our vacation time and maybe annual raises and i don't have none.
good,"I found the overall summary of Wendy's alright for one of my first jobs. The days were tough and customers were hard, but I handled it very well. I was always professional."
good,It was really calm just slit of crazy people but I enjoyed working there for the most part. The general manager was real nice though he treated us as if we was his family
good,"The managers sucked at my particular location, I was the best worker there and never got the pay raise they promised me after a year. The managers were very hard to work with and liked to bully us and I just wasn't having it"
good,The work environment is so unprofessional. Most employees are loud obnoxious little girls. Managers are old perverts. This is just am unprofessional workplace.
good,working at Wendy's was ok helped prep foods before opening then stock area took customer's order collected money handed out order sometimes had to make and bag order myself if other crew members were not doing there part of the job.
good,"The manager was overall a sweet person however, Wendy's as a whole is not a good environment to work in, low pay, stressful hard work. Don't get me wrong I don't mind stress or hard work but for low pay I mean come on."
good,What I like about Wendy's is that it is team based or there is a good communication between employees. Managers do not follow some of the rules they should.
good,"To work at Wendy's, you have to have a positive attitude at all times. The management is constantly leaving and the lack of communication can cause stress. But once your running a shift and you've been keeping up that positive energy, you'd be surprised on how you can make a difference. Being Friendly and Food Quality is important to the store, as Dave intended it to be. So as long as you know whats wrong from right, you'll be okay. The most enjoyable moment is knowing that all of your hard work and effort will make you stronger."
good,"At the store location I worked at, I only received two raises in the two years I worked there. They love employees who give 150%, and it will give you job security. However, they still don't provide a consistent schedule, and it's hard to get more than 35 hours some weeks. It was overall a stressful work environment."
good,"Wendy’s has been a good start for working, it allowed flexibility in my daily schedule. It has helped build my confidence/self-esteem. I have gained experience working with different people and personalities."
good,Faced paced job in customer service. Good for gaining employment experience. Typical shifts were between 4 and 7 hours each day. It was difficult to get management to work with scheduling around school.
good,Great place to buildup your experience when you first employment. Pay is very low. Nice people and management was extremely professional and appreciative. My coworkers were professional and willing to help me as needed with a welcoming attitude.
good,A heavy work day where you have to be ready for whats to come. Paying attention to detail and being attentive and paying attention to what the customer wants.
good,The job is pretty simple but it is a good first job with competent management. there are some good basic skill you can learn here including food safety regulations.
good,Manager cares more about her child she does as she pleases at work wearwears what she wants to work leaves when she wants and talks about customers then business
good,I hated my job there... It was really stressful because I was usually running drive thru and it would get extremely busy and we never got breaks ever.
good,I asked to be paid at least $8.15/hour they got me started at $7.78/hr working only 15hrs/week.  Hard to pay any bills with this wage. I don't recommend working here.
good,"Cool place but mangers are not to nice there."
good,it's a good summer job. You shouldn't expect to make a career out of this.  If you need hours they'll be given to you.  Do not expect to make more than minimum wage unless you're a manager
good,"Typical Day: Come to work, Hear about who did what with who, take orders, hear more gossip about stuff, take more orders, go home."
good,"Working at Wendy's is not the best but you do what you have to do to get by. Its always short staffed so we have to work even harder, the pay isn't great, and the customers can be very rude."
good,"Had an overall decent experience with Wendys. Will always have good memories and stories, I enjoyed the people I worked with and most of upper management. Learned a lot here through becoming a manager and running my own shifts. Often times had a hectic and sometimes exhausting schedule, with not much room for career growth. A lack of appreciation from higher ups was demotivating. Professionalism was slightly lacking within the company, and it sometimes felt like a day care. There was frequent drama between employees and kind  of a “high school” feel to the environment at times.  After almost 4 years, I’ve felt as though I’ve gained all there is to get from this company personally, and that it was time for a change."
good,Easy to learn workplace. Employees are respectful and team work reliable. Can be a unclean work place at times but very good first or part time good forsure.
good,"Needed a job to pay bills, my daughter worked there for 4 years and I took the job for 6 months, but the pay was horrible and decided to work at an assisted living for $2 more per hour."
good,"The work itself isn't bad, or even hard, but the coworkers make every day 50 times worse. There is simply a lack of decent human beings who work there."
good,"A typical work day would include restocking my station, obtaining my drawer, needed to cashier, and assist and serve the customer. I've learned to cashier, how to speak to customers and also how to multitask wile moving at a reasonable past. Wendy's isn't that cultured, simply because it is a franchise, an i mostly see the same customers on s day to day basis. The hardest part is closing the dining room, meaning i have to clean the dining room and two bathrooms, sweep, mop, ect. The most enjoyable part of the job is the positive energy between the staff members"
good,"Job training is a minimum, but if you're quick to catch on you might end up staying. Management is poor because the training for it isn't great. In any fast food setting, the crew gets blamed for being poorly trained."
good,"Long hours, on your feet all day, great crew for the most part. I learned a lot about how to manage portions of a business, and how to get the best desired results from those I was managing."
good,"Some of my coworkers did not seem very friendly and easy to work with, and some of the managers seemed the same way. I didn’t enjoy working with the people and wished they had guided me a bit more in the beginning, but it was a good job."
good,I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. the general manager thought that the store was more important than my eighteen month old daughter and that is not correct.
good,They let me leave to early did not get enough money. I cleaned and I stocked and washed dishes and trays and did the bathrooms and I only worked there for the summer.
good,"I had worked at Wendy's for several years while I was a teenager and going to college My time there can be best described as mixed. There was some good times and some not as favorable times. But I owe the company in a way as it instilled in me a positive working attitude, hard work ethic and excellent customer service skills. I do wish that I could have advanced more in the company before I left, especially after being with the company for so many years. But working there has helped make me the man I am today."
good,"Decent place to work if you're only looking for part-time, the hours are flexible, and the people are friendly, you are provided a break when you work more than 5 hours, but the shifts usually wont be longer than 7"
good,"You get there usually everyone is happy and in a good mood, until it starts swarming with people. That's around 7:30. some get stressed because they cant handle it and start getting upset. The Hard part about my job there was the amount of responsibilities I had. Not only did I have to do my job but if we were behind I'd have to pick up the slack. which is not a bad thing, we all could use help but when I needed it help no one was their, so my work become undone because I had to help others. the most enjoyable part was my co workers. I mean after work everyone is so different and friendly."
good,It's a fast paced environment. When we do hit slow times we are tying to make the best of it by cleaning the store. I learned to work with all kinds of people and defusing a bad situation. Sift mangers up to General mangers are good but after that management is not the best. I think the hardest part of the job is would be working the grill station. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting along with coworkers and talking with the more older customers.
good,Not much to say fast food isn't the best job. For me it was my first job to have some money of my own. At one point all of the managers ended up quitting except for two and the company went downhill from there.
good,"A typical day at work ends with stress, I have learnt a lot about how to deal with customers, run a store, and how to make better friends. Management isn't good what so ever."
good,My manager was awesome. I got promoted to manager within my first 3months. I worked my butt off. Some weeks you’ll get 32-40hrs then the next week you may only get like 15.
good,"Starting out, the crew I worked with was lovable, fun and welcoming, even if I was relatively shy in nature. After orientation I was taken under the wing of many of the crew members and taught in a diverse number of ways how to do things, which was what made me the happiest. Time went on and I got more and more comfortable there, the crew revealing to be more and more fun loving and beautifully chaotic every day. We were family, which was evident in how we worked. I learned a lot about customer service in general, that not everyone you take the order of is personally out to get you, even if we had some troubling people. Management was frustrating at times as hypocrisy seemed evident constantly. The most painstaking part of the job for me was the seemingly constant weight I would feel whenever a manager was around. They could be intimidating, almost bullying rarely, but I had still managed to get over it. The most enjoyable part of the job was after working several long hours cleaning. After my hours were up I'd assist the rest of the crew with their remaining duties, and we'd mess around and have a good time. They seemed to really enjoy me there, and I regret leaving as early as I did."
good,Quick pace environment with high emphasis on quality results and quick turn around times. Customer service is top priority along with food quality and safety.
good,"Fun place, some managers were not helpful, very fast paced, hard to keep up at rushes, most days the customers were consistent, always have to keep moving"
good,Cool if your young...it was okay they work with you on hours but pay kinda sucks...meet some cool people and have a lil fun sometimes and pretty cool managers ...only some of them
good,"My typical day at work was clocking in and making a position chart so all the employees knew where to go and what tasks they had for the day or night. Then pretty much start making food, stocking what needed to be stocked, cleaning, then when it got towards closing wime i would count the registers, make deposit slips, then lock up the store and leave.I have learned to be a leader and learned how to run a proper store and to provide excellent service. The management was alright, there was some lazy ones and some that ""went by the book"" (which is not a bad thing), but over all were great people to work with. The hardest part of my job I think was dealing with people who complained about having to work or called in all the time, cause it would put the people that actually came into work behind as well cause we would have to take on more responsibilities due to lack of employees. The most enjoyable part of my job was the most amazing and fun people that you did work with and all of the returning customers that stop by day by day to say hi and grab a bite to eat."
good,"I think Wendy's was OK for my first job but I'm looking to move up and forward.there are no benefits for cashier, it is very hard to get a raise. it was alright for a good job."
good,In my opinion its a great way to build customer service experience and real life situations when dealing with the public. When I gotten out of the restaurant I am so much less stressed and able to have more time with Family and also I am able to work stable hours and work a full time position.
good,It's a good job for the people who can't really do much manual labor. You have to be really good with people and you have to make sure everything is fresh.
good,"Working at Wendy's was my very first job so I don't really remember much to have an opinion about this business. However, I would say it is perfect for a 16 year to start out getting to know the basics of being a cashier and food handler."
good,"High stress job."
good,"Lack of communication from previous managers leaving their shifts. "
good,"Team effort, goal oriented and self driven to meet weekly store targets. The most enjoyable part of the job ""Wowing"" the customer's"
good,"I’ve worked hard to get where I am and feel I’ve plateaued. I’ve relocated quite a few times and am now at the worst store I’ve been at. Management is untrustworthy and hypocritical. Lacks true leadership and too much drama is involved. Ive learned you can do whatever, whenever for others and no ones pays the same. Used to love my job until the past year. Times have truly changed"
good,"while I was there I cleaned dining room, cashier, cooked, and closed. I meet a lot of nice customers and a lot of nice employees. when I needed a certain day off I would let her know I needed it off and she would give it to me."
good,"Working with the food was appetite killing, and seeing that most employees didn't wash their hands or wear gloves before handling food didn't help. The first aid kit hadn't been stocked in over the year and when I cut my hand one day, they seemed confused on why I wanted a bandage for such a small cut. "
good,When I worked at Wendy's there was a few terrible managers that I have since heard have quit or been fired. Many annoying and lazy co-workers. Making the salads was a good and enjoyable job without any interaction with customers.
good,This job is very fast-paced. The management that I’ve dealt with was poor and unprofessional. Some stores are different from others and same with the management. How everyone works depends upon the how the manager(s) work.
good,I loved all but how management insted of being matur÷e and respectable and comeing to you with issue would talk to employees abought u and never even try to figure truth and would trash talk you like ur scum
good,lower level workers were at first harmful and unresponsive but over time became adapted and helpful to the sink or swim attitude shown at the Wendys. Over all the mangers excluding the general manager were not only helpful but effective doing multiple jobs at once. Whilst the general manager was not lazy she was harmful to the work environment often making other uncomfortable and stressed where previously there were no issues. Because of this often under the general managers watch there where often mistakes and wrong orders in the customers food. Overall a interesting experience in my short six months working there i saw roughly 4 mangers and 15+ employees leave before I did the same.
good,"it was a good place to work and i enjoyed being able to cook all the foods they offer, but the manager was a poor leader. i also didn't have a vehicle at the time and was taking the bus which was about 60-90 min ride and i was late a few times and she fired me, i was the main cook as it was inside a mall and only open a certain amount of hours."
good,In this work development we will experience a rush normally at 3-5pm. Everything is neat and stocked. floors are swept. All Employees are  well trained and the environment is drama free.
good,"Wendy's was always busy and quick paced, we rarely had any slow days. My coworkers were amazing people, my managers were cool, and the customers were rude. But rarely I would run across an amazing customer that made me enjoy working there."
good,"Wendy's is a fun place to work at time but not all the time. I learned everything at Wendy's, A typical working at is when you walk in ready to work no relaxing."
good,A good job for first time employees like high students and collage students on break.  No job skills or experience needed.  Can be stressful and annoying at times.
good,"It was first job I had! Lake st management was good back in the day!Food was great! I should have stayed,"
good,"https://www.job-applications.com/wendys-crew-member/"
good,"The day was almost always busy.  I had the opening shift so it got the restaurant ready for the day including going to the bank.  There was the food preparation, turning on the fryers and grills, checking various temperatures, and expiration dates on food.  On truck days there was checking the delivery of the orders, and then putting the orders away and maintain food rotations."
good,"Very exhausting,you get to meet different types of people. Its challenge to work with teenagers. THe hardest part of this job is standing long in the job"
good,"Wendy's was a good first job for me. It showed me both what I like, and what I dislike in a job. First off management was horrible, the managers knew less than actual employees. Also, most of the time you are stuck doing the job of two other people while they sit in the back and chit-chat or use their phones. There is no discipline or respect in these types of restaurants which is why I am trying to keep away from these fast-food environments."
good,Nice workplace just to far from home.  Especially with a baby on the way its going to be to hard to travel an hour way.  However I moved up in the company fast and I learned alot.
good,"While working at Wendy’s, I’ve learned to work better as a team in tense situations and overall better customer service. I feel that while working at Wendy’s, anyone can learn the basic skills needed when working as a group for a greater goal."
good,Wendy's was a decent entry level job with good enough pay for the job type. I am glad I worked there for the experience and introduction to the working world.
good,"Typical day at work involves custodial work, cooking food, food preparation. This is job where you interact with customers. The job is fast paced. This is the first job where I learned customer service."
good,I worked there for a short time and it was an unorganized stressful job. I had the hours but low pay and not enough income. I maid $9.30 an hour when the lowest I will take is 10.
good,Nothing there was good about that job I would never go back to work there I had to call the better business bureau on them I won't go there to eat still til this day
good,Just a normal day in day food .it's a good places for a first time worker or that just need a job to get on there feet. Mostly just a typical day in the work force.
good,"Depends on the store your at and how you work. Everything will be fine. Be prepared to work when you clock in, Work in a fast steady pace, make sure customers order are correct to avoid any problems"
good,"i was 17 years old when i started working there a lot of good memories great people, good energy, the hardest part was probably all the cleaning we had to do"
good,"Work was fast paced and went by smoothly."
good,"Was a good first job, good enough to pay for bills for just coming out of high school, not meant to be a livable wage though by any means. Fast paced and easy to pick up."
good,Great place for students to work while in school. Really enjoyed seeing the regular customers who came in weekly. Pay could be better but overall a good company to work for.
good,"Not enough pay, hours are different shift hours ... Managed a 15 people team ..  Trained and handled cash .. Very stressful job position ..  Handled food .. Food certificate..I learned to appreciate a comfortable job"
good,"Clean work environment, fast pace, long hours. very young staff. I learned how better to deal with  and motivate staff and co-workers"
good,It was alright to work for But needed more hours and really hated to let it go when i did...i just had to many bills and other things to pay..other than that the managers should have been giving orders and not the employees..when they get on the ball..they will have a good team...
good,"They could appreciate there employees better. Show that they matter to the company more often. It was a job that took up most of my day, it didn't even make the bills to meet the needs of survival."
good,"Most days were stressful, and often boring. The people there are enjoyable to work with. This job helped me learn how to deal with very stressful situations, and work well under those conditions. The management is good, for the most part."
good,"Didn't mind the work duties so much, but I always worked weekends, and a lot of those nights were with a shorthanded crew and sometimes the other crew-people or shift managers were either stressed-out and/or somewhat incompetent. "
good,"Not much pay & they take you off schedule too give managers excessive hours , 60+ hours a week. Should be making 400$-500$ every two weeks. Made 100$ every two weeks."
good,"Job culture is great the problems here is management, not all good workers make for good managers, this was evident time and time again when I was a worker for them, in planning all the company stands for is great in practice not so much."
good,"I personally didn't like working there, there was some issues within the management circle, and the crew was highly affected by that. I wouldn't take back the experience it gave me though."
good,"Great people to work with, staff is always short so you always have to do more than 2 associates jobs just to catch up to get yours done. great food, dirty place, they try to clean it up but it just need a whole new building"
good,"Didmt learn to much great friemds"
good,Wendy's as a company is probably a decent company to work for but not at the Grove City location.  The environment is hostile most of the time. The pay is not worth the stress.
good,its a nice company to work for it just depends what store you work at. I have experience different work environments and sometimes depending on the store you might witness or hear things the human ear shouldn't hear.
good,This job had no great points to it. It was really hard but after the right training which was hardly ever given you might be able to survive the fast paced crazy  mangement
good,"It was busy, but management was poor. A typical day at wendys was you clocked in and started frying foods. I learned how to fry frys and chicken nuggets."
good,"I learned how to maintain my work area and stock when necessary, during my time at Wendy's. Although the hours were not as excpected, the overall environment was proffesional."
good,"The people I worked with were great, the managers not so much.. If you ask me I think the person who hired the managers should pay attention more before they promote someone who is not good for the job.."
good,"As a first job I thought it was a well experience, I wouldn't say I loved it but it was nice to have. It was nice to have a job and buy whatever you want, and spend your free time working. It was my first steps into the real world."
good,"It was fun when I first started but a few months after everyone just started showing their true colors , arguing , talking down bad on the next person , & somewhat team work."
good,"The job was okay.   Managers had a short temper which created for a bad work environment and created tension between coworkers.  If the job was done wrong, managers made sure that it obvious that the job was done wrong."
good,I like the job overall very easy to learn. Skilled in every position very good with costumers. Looking to broad my future finding a new job and taking it to the next level work wise.
good,"Typical day at work , was stressful, The manager was unfair to some workers ,I learned not to give your all into something , because you will get nothing in the end"
good,I like wendys alot the food was good sometimes the managers were rude and sometimes they would even have the nerve to be rude in front of cust mers but other than that they are ok
good,"My time here at Wendy's I worked with two different General Managers. "
good,The job requires team work and it is very easy to learn the schedule of the restaurant and how things are run. Hours weren't many and the chances of promoted were not very good.
good,"Worked there for three years. Fun coworkers, certain managers were very productive and engaged. Great customers. Alright working environment with minimum complications"
good,Very stressful and fast paced. The fast paced I understand but everything ends up so confusing and you won't know what to do. Managers would get on you on mostly your first day if you aren't fast or not doing it right. I see teenagers on their first day with no experience and get yelled at for making things wrong. That's probably why Wendy's in Harrison is always hiring because people are constantly quoting.
good,"Fast paced. Handle money, prep salads, prepare fries, burger, nuggets, salads, drinks. Drive thru and dining area cashier. Clean, provide great customer service. Etc."
good,i would say if you like to be around food and make food then do it but  i do not like it and plus ever since i worked work there i gain weight so that was not good with me but the company was good and maybe it depends on where you work at
good,"The Establishment was unorganized, workers were underpaid, bad work conditions, unsanitary, schedules weren't organized and they hired unreliable people"
good,A lot of things in this job can be improved. And a lot more training. That goes for everyone in the facility..........................................
good,"Working at Wendy's if very hectic. We have set positions, but no-one ever knows what to do. So, the more experienced workers are forced to do their job and the other positions."
good,"The culture under the franchise is totally performance at ALL COST."
good,The job was typically hectic day to day. I learned discipline and patience with customers. Management did their best. Work[place culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job was maintaining all the tasks without being just a tad bit over exerted. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with coworkers.
good,I've worked in a number of restaurants both fast food and family style and this is the most dysfunctional I've ever had the misfortune of working for.
good,"The management likes to take advantage of the people who work there, and act as if they arent real people who have lives outside of working. they are very difficult with scheduling and are poor sports about giving references flat out refusing, which is completely unfair to those who have wenyds as their first job. they are poor with handling payment and the management attitudes tend to be demeaning"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with. My breaking point was when I was promised something, a promotion, and was not given what was promised to me. I was given very menial reasons as to why I wasn't promoted and then was offered a $2 raise to stay. I couldn't accept because I could no longer trust the integrity of the upper management."
good,I was happy here until i felt harassed. Assistant manager thought it was a joke and told me to suck it up. I did not feel it was a safe work environment at all.
good,"The work is not worth the pay. Not the best of working conditions. Nice coworkers, managment is not the best and they do not work well with your personal schedule."
good,"This was my first job and I was treated horrible with my anxiety, yelled at, grabbed by my arm and pushed and told I wasn't worth the job. I stayed until my grades got bad."
good,Great fast paced work environment.......minimal stress....convenient flexible hours...great employeess and management............clean workplace......
good,"I love my job. Well, I love my coworkers and I love the customers (some). This was my first fast food job and man. I didn't know it could be so long and tiring. You're on your feet moving all day, moving around. The most enjoyable part of the day is in the evening it's busy, you're working hard and time is flying by.The hardest part of the day I would say is the last hour before we close, When we get a rush and still trying to clean and do all the closing procedures. store close at one and we try to have it all cleaned and out at 1;15-1;30. it gets tough."
good,A typical day at Wendy's involved customers constantly coming in which make the time pass by. Problem I had was I was not properly trained on the register. Management skills were not where they should have been which made it hard.
good,"Overall it was a fun experience and I learned a lot. For example, having more patience with people and being more kind. Also, i learned to be quick and my customer service skills got better."
good,"Fast food was my first real job at the age of 15. It was here that I acquired what would be the base for all my job skill, work ethic etc. The fast pace atmosphere required everything to be done on the fly. I could go on, but all in all a good learning experience."
good,"This job is for children and beginners. I appreciated the job when i started at 17, but as I got older the pay wasn't enough, and no benefits.The workers weren't the best to work with either."
good,"Working at Wendy's has proven to me that I shall never work another fast food restaurant.The management was extremely biased towards the employees regarding days off, hours, positions being worked, who got free drinks, etc. I learned how to take orders, make the sandwiches, work the fryer, to clean the bathrooms and dining room, maintenance on the soda machines, morning and night prep, etc. The workplace was upbeat and fun depending on the manager, certain managers had opinions of me and other select employees which led them to make sure we were miserable. The hardest part of the job wouldn't be the early morning or late night shifts, but dealing with a particular manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck"
good,I spent 9 years at this company I could work 35 hours a week and they only gave me 20-25. I didn't call off for two years straight and didn't advance any further then crew. Manager was horrible did not know how to talk to people and then when you report events to corporate they do nothing. They are under new management so might be better now.
good,"Being a crew member at Wendy's, you are trained on every station which really helps out the team if there is a rush as you can move between stations and keep everything flowing smoothly."
good,I do not recommend wendy's to young men/women for their first job. The managers will not help or give assistance or properly train you for your job description. I overall did not enjoy Wendy's because as this was my first job I wasn't properly trained or aware of everything I had to do.
good,"If your a great worker who values your work ethic, you will be taken advantage of. A lot of lazy people work in fast food so what can you do. fun environment though."
good,"I mostly worked as an opening and closing manager which consisted on making sure everything was set and ready for opening, with closing making sure everything was ready for the next day. "
good,"If you know anything about a customer service job, especially in fast food, you know its not great. Most people would tell you that its not a job you should be looking to keep in the long run, and I would disagree. While the pay isn't good, there are plenty of opportunities to advance. You just have to dedicate yourself 100000%."
good,Other employees constantly call off always short staffed. Employees work here for years and receive absolutely no raises. Fun work environment when fully staffed though.
good,"When I worked there, at first everythi,g was fine. Not very long after in at problems with employees...... Then the staff. Employees wanted to fight and management didn't want to give advancements until questioned and ridiculed. All in all it was a good starter job but I wouldn't want to stay."
good,A typical day at Wendy's started off with organizing the dining area and insuring everything was disinfected and up to safety codes. The managers were friendly and very motivating to keep working.
good,When I started working there I was trained very well. Everyone understood that the teamwork aspect of the job helps the job go easily. I enjoyed working with motivated people that work in one accord.
good,"This was my first job, I worked about 20 hours in the beginning. Training was a breeze and I was in all areas, eventually I became a supervisor after completing all training. The enjoyable part of the job was the people you worked with. Although, there will be difficult people along the way."
good,"Very stressful at times , always afraid to make a mistake . On the other side meeting customers and making them smile was one of my goals every day. Taking care of my employees was a priority of mine."
good,I like some things about the job but you need more hours and friendly staff we have too many people that act like you can't tell them nothing and the GM is horrible so I don't wanna stay
good,"I've worked at several stores but the current store is the worst.  GM does not train or develop managers but rather works them hard, disrespects them and is a bully.   The co-managers are professional and trusted and we work hard to achieve good service despite no communication from GM and are all frustrated to the point of leaving."
good,"Having changed over from corporate to franchise changing many of the regulations deflated. It was complicating having all benefits changing, as well losing many of the long term management; team members found it frustrating to maintain and increase sales while training new management. H.R being switched over also found it hard to maintain communication."
good,"Managers change more than crew members, scheduling was always an issue and always under staffed. I was not put on the schedule anymore when i did work for them and when i called to understand why i was told i had no job"
good,"It was a nice job in highschool to have.  Because they had such flexible hours.  But after highschool, and getting my EMT license, there was no point to me staying there"
good,It's a fast food establishment. I worked in food preparation and cashier. The Manger was wonderful. Her assistant's not so much. I had to quit due to food allergies (Dr's orders).
good,It's a okay place to work at but not a place to work if you need to support your self. Work here if you need a summer job. Or if your a high schooler.
good,"I held this position for a month during my senior year of high school. I left due to the lack of sufficient training; and, also because I felt I needed to place my full focus on my studies."
good,"Love the fast pace and loved being at my favorite fast food restaurant. Upset me that I was getting the lowest pay out of everyone, but i would work 30-45 hours a week, as a minor, and got taken advantage of.  GM was very rude at times and barely let me stay hydrated."
good,"Cashier front lobby  "
good,It is a fast paced job that requires a lot. Often you are asked to do more than what your job entitles and work past the time you were scheduled. You don't get pay raises frequently in fact the pay raises are 5 to 20 cents. It's goof for a job as a 16 year old not past that.
good,"In fast food, you have to be moving at extreme past to get your drive thru down which isn't a problem as long as people could work together right? wrong there can be a lot of unprofessional people to work with a lot of times."
good,"Stayed busy worth work and had enough elbow room. Job was meant for a man, but a women in the kitchen never hurt anyone.  Management needed a lot of work."
good,"Customers were rude and we were constantly understaffed. I found myself being a cashier, sandwich maker, and grill operator on some occasions. I felt under-payed and overworked."
good,"Its great to start off at getting out of high school, it helps you built confidence being trained to make your customers feel welcomed and being able to upsales. Bad part is that crew members rarely got the 40 hours because labor was always too high and even though breaks are short, they dont let you skip it."
good,"The best part of working at this job was satisfying my customers with respect and making them happy. My main focus was cleanliness, hospitality, and the acceptance of diversity."
good,Team work and great customer service. Work in an orderly fashion. Keep dining area clean. Work in a timely fashion with a smile. Take orders and fill orders in an organized and timely way. Wendy's has fresh foods.
good,"In a typical work day, you never know who you're going to encounter. Some people are great, and some not so great, but you treat everyone the same. I have learned a lot over the past year that I never knew before. I came into this job not knowing anything about fast food and I have learned so much, like how to do drive thru speaker and front register. Management varies day to day, you have your good days and your bad days, like with most jobs, but if you do what your supposed to do, the shifts tend to fly by. Workplace culture also varies day to day, sometimes you have co-workers who are in a bad mood and you have some who are in a good mood. I find it easiest to work when I'm able to laugh with the friends I have made. The hardest part of the job, for me has probably been learning to deal with all types of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk to and connect on a personal level with customers, and the friends I have made. When you recognize some of your regulars, or your favorite customers, or friends and family outside of work the day just gets better. I love being able to talk with the friendly and familiar faces when I work."
good,"I would say Wendy's is one of the best fast food resturants to work at in Bay City.  I would go back if I had to, flexible hours, fast shifts, friendly customers, etc."
good,It was in a way very laid back but i learned a lot. i clocked in and immediately  gt to work. I am very versatile and can do multiple positions. I am a valuable asset to have. Management was ok. the culture was ok. the hardest part of the job was the non stop. the most enjoyable part is working hard.
good,Wendy's was my very first job. I learned a lot about good work ethic and customer service. I did manage to stick around quite a while with it being fast food.
good,"A typical day at work was very repetitive and i was continuously doing work for positions other than mine at once. I learned how to manage my time and how to start your work early so you don't have to worry about it later in the day. Management was very rude and bias, had their favorites and those were the ones who moved up. The  workplace culture was very lazy and laid back. Hardest part of the job was the wave of people we got during the day and lastly the most enjoyable part was opening and closing."
good,its okay job just not for me. easier hours gained up not very flexible with scheduling. not every good pay and requires a lot from one self. management is horrible
good,"Wendy's provided a chaotic environment due too the lack of professionalism, and organization from not only employees but management as well. With that said most responsibilities were placed on me. Stressful yes but also even with the lack of appreciation I was able too learn a lot. I was known for my reliablility and hard work which gave self gratification in the end. An upside to working here was that I and the exception of a couple others were optomistic and found ways to make our job fun and enjoyable for everyone."
good,The particular store i worked at refused to give me the raise i was required to receive after 6 month of work. The RGM at my store was not qualified to have her own store and let emotion cloud judgement.
good,"Friendly co-workers, although management is not very productive. Pay rate is horrible compared to the amount of work you'll be doing. Friendly co-workers and customers."
good,"the establishment has lots of moments where it gets extremely busy. the hardest part is completely cleaning the place before it closes. despite the amount of work we have to do, there isn't really much benefit. the best part would probably be the friends you could make with your co-workers"
good,"When I worked there, they weren't very good about raises and min wage bumps. I never kept my raises when the min wage went up. Plus, they taught me how to do everything, but they never gave a formal training schedule until I'd been there 8 years...THEN I had to prove I knew what I was doing. The people there were great, though. I ran into a problem a few years after I started and a coworker helped me out."
good,"It was a great job, but some of the people working there sometimes don't know how to speak with respect. You will love your customers and that what will make you want to go back to work for them. My customers were the reason that I loved my job."
good,Just my store alone everyone was more friends then employees and managers. It just didn't seem like a work place so much. Some took their job more seriously then others and it created conflict.
good,Wendy's is a good job for someone who needs to get back on there feet and for a first job. It teaches you how to work well with others. Teaches customer service. Teaches you how to multi task and how to speak well with others.
good,job duties typically stayed the same daily. youre assigned pretty much to a certain position and do what that position requires. management at times seemed to favor people also.
good,learned how to prep from scratch. opened new restaurants with the company. started as an asst. manager and worked my way up. the main negative was being general manager position without proper training
good,The dropout rate is high and it can get ungodly busy but other than that decent place to work. The lunch rush is the worst part of the day. But night shifts can be even worse if you don't have good coworkers
good,it was a great experience but i didn't like it because the coustomers were rude so i quit and i'd rather work at a warehouse where is more calm & not too busy
good,Its an alright job. They have flexible schedules so they can work with you but the pay for the amount we do isnt worth its better to go with corporate
good,They will use you to benefit them self and tell you one thing and never hold up the end. You have to work 50 hours a week. Most enjoyable part is going home.
good,"A typical day at work at Wendy's is stressful as it is fast-paced and the managers are constantly yelling at employees to work because they are to busy talking among themselves. For the amount of work the employees do, the pay should not be at minimum wage."
good,It's a pleasure to be here and help out. I was hired last year in 2016 and I'm still here hanging in there. I enjoy working for Wendys but I am currently looking for a bigger & better job
good,Wendy's provides a good place to work for those still in school but management needs to be more understanding about students school schedules. The Wendy's I was at gave you less hours as a punishment if you needed to take a day off. For example if you took of a day for a doctors appointment you could expect only one shift for the next 2-3 weeks. Unacceptable.
good,Management is a joke. Good team members for the evening. Don't know about mornings. They do try to make sure get breaks. General manager has bad attitude.
good,This is a good place to work if you're a high school student looking for work. It's good if you just need something for leisure or for a little cash
good,The best part of job was the loyal customers and placing a smile on their faces. Once you apply online they call you set up phone interview then if you pass the first you have two more interviews to determine if you are best fit for the job.
good,loved working here very frienly people and you also got good pay and oppurtunitied to advance through the company and airport
good,"Great starter job, lots of flexibility which allowed me to manage being a full time student and extracurriculars. I learned that hard work merits increased responsibility and how to manage several tasks under pressure conditions, which has been a useful life skill."
good,"- A typical day at work was fast, always busy"
good,"I only enjoyed my time working at Wendy's because I enjoyed my management position and the people I worked with. The other managers didn't like their jobs and didn't care, and I ended up picking up on all their slack and didn't make enough money to be running the whole store, which is my reason for leaving."
good,Overall like my job but they would have me do other workers work who they allow to slack. Good place to work if under the right leader. They do not give raises when deserve.
good,"Come to work, clock in and usually you already know what you are doing because the manager has a board with duties on it. Usually im in the back window drive thru, taking orders or cashing out orders. In between hours I wash dishes and prep bacon as needed."
good,"A lot of politics, they want you to not have a personal life and work your life away. Still a new company so they are still trying to figure things out."
good,I worked at Wendy's for 3 months in Apple Valley Minnesota as a cashier.  I didn't like the experience because the work environment wasn't very welcoming and I worked long hours.  The management wasn't very organized and there was a lot of hostility between the workers.
good,They are under staffed and they don't pay there employees enough. A lot of call offs and can't  find people for the amount of pay. They promise advancement to keep employees. I would not work for them
good,"Co-workers work as a team, have management support , have good internal policies and attension to detail hardest part is the straight hours standing o"
good,"A typical work day as a Wendy's cashier begins with stocking condiments, napkins, and utensils upon arrival. Most of the day is spent standing at the register and taking customer orders. At times when there are no customers in line, I would retrieve used trays and clean and dry them. I learned how to work as a team to assure customer satisfaction."
good,"lots of standing around when its not busy. would recommend as a first job but not to make a career from it.lots of drama. management can be super strict most of the time, especially when the general manager is visiting, which is when it gets stressful"
good,"During my employment at this place of work, I have learned how to become more independent and reliable on myself. I have learned to make the first move whether the attention will directed upon me or not. I learned to not look for others to do things but to instead get up and get it done myself. ""If you want something done correctly, you have to do it yourself."""
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace environment, however, coworkers and management wasn't always pleasant and neither were the customers."
good,"I learned that the wendys management is not some one that you would want to work for because it was alot of confusion, anger , and drama between employees and mangers."
good,I learned a lot about team work and how to work in a fast pace environment. I also got the opportunity to interact with costumers.
good,Easy job but no room from advancement. No benefits even at full time. Management is extremely unprofessional and very rude to employees.
good,"Its just an ordinary day at work. Nothing great or exciting. I've learned how to do so much such as the register, the fryer, the grill, the drinks, and the dinning room. My managers are really great, yes they could be on your case sometimes but other then that they're terrific people. My co-workers are wonderful. Very helpful. The hard part of my job was the fryer. "
good,"I need a job that will pay better and has greater opportunities to advance in the career. Typical work day i come in start making the chili then clean the grill and deep fryer next I stock the fridges with chicken, fries, and hamburgers. At ten I make sandwiches for drive thru. I have not had a problem with any fellow co workers some just are lazy and could careless to be there. Management is on top of things and always on the floor with us coaching us along. Hardest part of the job to be honest I do t think there is a hard part it's pretty easy to me. I enjoy challenging myself to reach the 110 mark on the drive thru timer."
good,The management was not the best they would point out your mistakes and would focus on you and your flaws because you were new and inexperienced.
good,An ideal first job for a teenager or college student. It's a fast paced work environment but the jobs are easy. The food is decent for being fast food.
good,Gained some experience as being a cashier and working in retail/customer service. Not the best with management and they barely train you in what you have to do.
good,It was a nice summer job but the employee's seemed very childish and like they were still in high school a lot of bickering and overuse of power somewhat disrespectful but i just witnessed it never happened to me personally
good,The management was way to laid back about things. I mean don't get me wrong was pretty cool at times but other time it was very unprofessional. Everything else was okay though.
good,"The co-workers were not intelligent enough to do common tasks. The hours were not what they promised, and refused to add hours."
good,"I loved my job a lot but some of the managers, not all, were just not the nicest and kind of rude. It was an okay job for still being in high school. I made a lot of friends and actually didn't not wanna eat the food after seeing how it is made."
good,"A regular day at work was just barely staffed and poorly trained due to the stores inability to keep new hires from quitting. management had recently been changed in the month before I quit and while things were better organized, the overall working conditions were relatively low. The hardest part of the job was preventing conflicts from arising between coworkers and customers alike. The only fun part of the job was occasionally hearing the intercom from the Carls jr across the street from us."
good,"The management at the Wendy's company is the worst I've ever seen i couldn't believe how disrespectful and rude they were and they did not care about the customers or the crew members. It was terrible. After 2 years there i couldn't stand it anymore, after constantly pleading to corporate to do something and getting 0 results or answers. GM's running off with employees and selling them drugs it was outrageous."
good,"overall, it was a huge part of my everyday life. The crew was so enjoyable to work with, but the management and higher up not so much. Typically fast food is only for a first time, foot in the door kind of job, but this place was really fun to work at. some people just take it too seriously i guess. the most enjoyable part of this job would've had to be the feel of the rush when all of you worked together to get a bus out the door. The hardest part was pleasing the head managers, it seemed no matter how hard you tried, you were still doing something wrong. I learned a lot about work ethic during my time working here, it was my first job and it taught me a lot of what i know now."
good,My overall review of Wendy's Corporation should use better management programs educate their staff on a ServSafe customer friendly environment thank you
good,"I was one of the hardest working managers that this company had . I dealt rude customers major zoning and city issues. There were parking ordinances in place, regular customers that had issues"
good,A typical work day is me counting money. I clean up behind the crew that went home when I get there. Management needs to be improved. My co-workers are ok but some need to be working somewhere else.
good,"A typical work day at Wendy's will normally begin with getting caught up to speed on everything that needs to be restocked/prepared, followed by me running around trying to keep up with our hectic customer volume. The management is the main problem with this company, mainly because their is no room for advancement or a pay raise. My coworkers get along great and work well in a team, which makes the work environment more lighthearted and help me look forward to coming into work everyday."
good,It's not a bad job for those just starting out. But it's harder then people think. You'll get your mix of hard workers and slackers. So just make the best of it.
good,"I worked at Wendy's from right after I turned 16 for two consecutive years. It was good for a first job, helped me get my first car, but I would not want to go back."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a lot of customer service. I learned new skills and techniques, I loved all of my co-workers, and the hardest part of my job was the fast pace sometimes. The most enjoyable part was the teams I got to work with,"
good,More playing around then actual work getting done. Managers are always on their phones and constantly yelling at employees when they are not on their phones. Most employees hired here are lazy and think they deserve more than minimum wage.
good,"Not very fun, gives you a little spending money, it's a job where u have to do lots of gross things and figure out all the grossness behind fast food restraunts"
good,"One manager doesn't know how to treat anyone properly, doesn't care about school or anything else, a typical day is very stressful."
good,"Working at a fast food restaurant has thought me how to be efficient and fast at the same time. Making people happy and follow the guidelines and polices of my job is my goal everyday. I have gained experience in the following areas: customer service, food safety, money and food handling, management, communication, and more."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's usually consisted of seeing many of the same faces I saw within the previous week. You begin to know the customers to a certain extent and a type of over-the-counter friendship is formed. I learned a more efficient way of doing dishes which is much more sanitary. Management ran things smoothly and my co-workers were fun to work with and get to know, if they stuck around long enough. The hardest part of the job was when business became slow. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the regulars."
good,"Great place to gain patience, more experience in work ethics, and improvement on customer service skills. This should only be a High School job, Nothing more. But if you need a job quickly, they will hire you in an instant as it is a job that no one really wants to do."
good,"Working at tj maxx was not always fun , and games but I enjoys getting up to go to work each and everyday. The people and management are okay. There were some on and off days"
good,"Management at the Brownsburg location was sporadic and unpredictable, but a fun community of people made this an interesting first job. The company was very helpful with training and learning various positions."
good,Being that it was my first paying job it was interesting to learn new skills. Even though I came into the store with good communication & customer service skills they were boosted up a lot. Great co-workers. Most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers.
good,closing at wendys it quite difficult due to crew members and management not helping to finish off closing tasks.at times crew members dont come in and still have there hours.
good,"Job is very boring and repetitive, barely makes you want to go to work everyday. The crew members are very nice and easy to get along with except for the fact they barely play their role. After working here I vowed to never work at fast-food ever again"
good,I had fun working for Wench's. Making all the different sandwiches and learning new things about the fast food industry. The drive thru and fry station were a challenge but that's exactly what I like. Sometimes I felt the employees weren't treated equal but other than that I loved it.
good,When I first started at Wendy's I was a cashier I gradually learned more and was offered a manager position. That position is very stressful but you learn a lot from it I loved it.Everyone there was like family. I eventually found a new full time job paying more so I decided to step down and stay at Wendy's part time.
good,"No real down time constantly busy, as a grill man I was required to do most of the cleaning with next to no help. Each day as soon as I came in i would be constantly busy; cooking food, washing dishes, gathering trash, cleaning fryers, cleaning grills, cleaning the oven and whatever the manager could think of for me to do."
good,"Good working conditions, the management was o.k. but could pay more, they will give raises if deserve them and easy to work your way up to management. They also give benefits and paid vacations"
good,It was very slow there was not much cleaning going on. it was a lot of favortism their people was calling out not coming in and than not even working when they was their.
good,"instead of one person training me, i had 6 different trainers, some would go over what i already learned, while others skipped over stuff they figured i already knew. constantly yelled at for being slow because i was trained improperly and had to ask questions which slowed me down."
good,"Every day is the same is generally the same. You take the orders of the customers, make sure the dining room, counter, and the bathroooms are clean and stocked. That's pretty much it. The job pays minimum wage but its easy work for the money."
good,It was my 1st job and I learned how to move at a fast pace the crew members are nice and some of the management . It needs improving to make it a fun enjoyable place of business.
good,I had a good time working for the Wendy's in Texarkana Ar. It was challenging at times with some of the co-workers/customers . But it always panned out to team efforts with help from the management..I learned that you can't provide assistant to everyone because not everyone will except it... Hardest part was trying to get along with the stubborn employees we had but it was done. The most enjoyable part is when everybody gets along all day and at the end of the day everyone has a smile on their face!
good,Management was pretty bad. People would try to fix their schedules around the manager rotations so they won't be stuck with the bad ones. Some employees would never show up to work and we were always under-staffed. I had to work all positions with the help of one other person. People were always quitting and being hired. It was an endless cycle
good,good for a first job but after time or certain age you should want a better job with way better pay and benefits because this is not a career job
good,"I learn a lot, but on my own, you learn how to deal with angry customers on your own, most of the managers are lazy, you do the work for them. I enjoy working with my coworkers (team work), doing the sandwiches & stoking. What I lease enjoy is being at the window"
good,Fast food isn't cut out for such minimum pay. It is very fast pace at times but the job is pretty simple. Sometimes they have you clean the nastiest things like grease traps or the fountain machine drain. Its a typical clock-in and clock-out job. It is good for a teenager's first job or as a back up or temporary job.
good,"We are always short staffed and manigmet makes you feel gilty"
good,It was a learning experience a very good job. Like every job there are the good and the bad but it's very hard teaching yourself everything.
good,"Friendly staffs and managers. I've learned some skills in customer service, cashier, prepping salads, and maintenance crew. The hardest part of the job was to not let the drive-thru time beep. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see the customers happy and enjoy their meal."
good,"I was young when i worked for Wendys, but when i did work there it was very hectic and people seemed very angry for no reason. However i did learn how to have patients while i worked there. My co-workers and I got along great but the management was horrible. The worst part about the job was that it was very unorganized and the est part was meeting new people."
good,I personally believe that position in fast food is never meant to be permanent but you have to make the best out of all situation. So if you keep that in mind while working here you should be fine.
good,My experience working with Wendy's was an overall average experience it was not great neither was it bad. The staff were just very lazy and irresponsible which led me to do most of the work while on my shifts.
good,"Happy and fun workplace. But benefits were not good."
good,"People like A consistent Manager, to keep it fun and in line to get it done."
good,"only managers and crew chiefs get their higher hours. No overtime for crew members. hours vary with season, and also there is no set schedule. second shift is the toughest. Most enjoyable time is when it slows down and we all talk while still being productive. hardest part is the rushes and completing orders in time."
good,"Mostly Friendly Environment, given responsibility in training new employees loved helping, Wonderful Customers, Great Co workers and i loved working at Wendy's."
good,"i loved the employees i worked with, i learned to work at a fast pace. he hardest part was dealing with the pay and lack of respect from certain managers, the best thing abut the job was the customers and my fellow employees"
good,"Wendy's is not a glamorous or easy job. I was a janitor, and occasionally ran the cash register at the front."
good,Most days were extremely hard working here but I was able to overcome every obstacle. I learned patience and my customer service skills have grown tremendously.
good,the regular customers are great ! scott is a fantastic manager the other managers are too caught up in what peoples saying and not on what theyre supposed to be doing
good,Days were usually the same. I would stay on one side of the store and make sandwiches for front while most of the other crew member were on drive-thur side.
good,"Its a fast pace job and you have to keep up with it. Make sure you stay to yourself. Its under new management at this time. Many people are getting hired and fried. The job is how you make it , do not get me wrong its a friendly work area but it can be unfriendly at times."
good,"Being employed for Wendy's franchise and corporation has been a great learning experience. It is a great first job because it teaches customer service, and requires hard working skills. It also teaches you how to have a positive attitude in uncomfortable situations with customers and co-workers. The most challenging part about the job is the short break periods, and the salary. The most enjoyable part of the job is associating with customers, and being approved by there satisfaction."
good,"I recommend this job to teenagers that are in highschool and they need extra money this definitely would be a great job,especially if you like a fast paced environment."
good,"This job was just a start of many different jobs, I learned of food safety as well as holding 40 to 50 hours a week depending of the workload needed. Turnover rate was very low from what I remember but overall just wanted to do something more than flip burgers for the rest of my life"
good,Even though I didn't work here for very long; this was y real first job and It did teach me how to balance school and my job. Vey close to home and very understanding and easy job.
good,"Typical day started with cleaning all the messes that no one else bothered to clean, whether it was at my station or not. The lunch and dinner rushes were stressful, as expected, and the weekends were particularly busy. The management team was good but my co-workers were fairly lazy, with a few exceptions."
good,"Wendy's is a very fast paced environment, you must be able to do multiple tasks and  fill in wherever is needed. "
good,"to much drama, dirty work field, no consistant determination from co workers. i was schduled untill 10 and would not leave until about midnight as a minor without concent"
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's depending upon the Manager. There is not a lot of compensation for the amount of work put in by the employees.  The work is fast paced and busy all day. You work long hard hours and not enough pay and no benefits are offered until your a manager. I was harassed by a manager and I complained to my general manager and nothing was ever done about the situation. I finally resigned due to the unprofessional nature of this particular manager. The general manager said that she would speak to this particular manager... but no formal write up for this particular managers behavior was ever issued.  Instead they would keep the one bad apple that spoils the bunch and have a high turnover rate of employees that quit due to this one mangers unprofessional behavior. I let it be known when I quit that that was the very reason.. no one ever contacted me.  I was an amazing and dependable employee.. I was good at my job and enjoyed it unless this particular manger was on duty.
good,A typical here is demanding and only a fragment of the coworkers have patience. Personalities clashed a lot but i stray away from the mix but its ok. Not exactly something that would be a good experience. Ive learned that not everyone is fit for leadership roles. Its hard to find people who could give impartial judgment on a situation without it becoming harsh or threatening. My coworkers were decent. Some of them were rough around the edges some were cool. Hardest part of the job was waking up early and scrubbing the drive thru pads and the most annoying job experience ever for me. And obviously the most enjoyable part of my job was break time. That was a respite away from the fray. Even if it were 15 mins.
good,The business it self was a good company But i Had major issues with the franchise only paying shift managers on average o 45 cents  more per hour than employees and the asking us to do job duties and mandatory manager meetings off the clock
good,"Family and Friendly atmosphere as you enter, you are greeted with kindness. Working is fast pace, but when it slows down, conversation is initiated. Hours are hard to get because of biased management. The people make it worth going to work though!"
good,"Wendy's is an enjoyable work atmosphere, for the most part. Its like any fast food job, dealing with customers and trying to get the food out as fast as possible. The best thing about this job is how most of the managers are calm and collected when a mishap occurs."
good,"As with most fast food places, expect low pay and long hours if you are in management. As a salary manager, I consistently put in 60-80 hours a week, often without having a day off in the span of a month. Overall, you know what you are getting when you get in to it and the advancement opportunities are there for those who wish to move up. However, this does depend on the General Manager of your store. I worked for one great GM that helped me move into management and eventually be his replacement when he left. I also worked for one that made me dread going to work every day and had a clique of people she liked and allowed to get away with anything they wanted. There were employees physically fighting, drinking and smoking in the store."
good,"great busy and fun days love working with people "
good,"Instilled great work habits, being on time to work, not calling off work and coming to work with a positive attitude. The only negative is the pay and also the management. Minimum wage is the salary with little to no chance of a raise. The management is incompetent and for lack of a better word lazy."
good,I love the fast pace when working at Wendys. the hard part about working there was working with food while hungry. I also learned how to multitask much better.
good,"I worked mostly as a sandwich maker for the PUW or Dine-in or sometimes both. The rushes are stressful and I often messed up or became overwhelmed when I had to deal with two lines. The management is helpful and generally flexible with hours. Between rushes, I would have to stock or clean up around the dining area. I got a good amount of variety in the positions I worked. I also learned good cooperation and communication skills."
good,"I'd come in at 5pm and close the store. usually it'd be slow generally throughout the night. tasks were usually about cleaning and wrapping the store for the next morning."
good,Fun place to work with a not ok management.  A lot of high schoolers and immature mentalities.  Only a couple people made the job enjoyable.  Handfull of people actually cared about their job and not a paycheck.  It was great to be able to serve people and serve them in a timely and accurate enviroment; in my part at least.  Was positioned in the same place almost every shift and once in a while it would change.
good,Meet new people and get to serve them. Very fast pace location to work at. make sure the food is hot and fresh and not expired.
good,"A typical work day.  You start up the grill throw some meat on it an wait for your customers. I learned how to count money,have patients with your customers and multitask. Management wasn't the greatest but I learned to control how to talk to them to understand. My co-workers always had problems multitasking or catching up. The hardest part of my job was being a cashier an having to go through lunch or dinner rush. If I was ever lucky id have my boss help me if they weren't busy. Most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with my customers! Always had a smile on there face no matter what!"
good,"when you have worked in fast food for 3 years you learn how to do every thing from drive thru to making sandwiches to working on the grill everyone plays an important roll in the fast food environment to work fast and make sure the customer is happy and satisfied. "
good,"Typical day at work was taking & completing orders in a short period of time, while going above and beyond a customer's expectations for good service. Also maintaining a clean work space & restrooms. Co workers are friendly and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was just meeting new people everyday. The hardest part was keeping up with the pace while maintaining everything else asked of you."
good,It was a learning Experience for me not all the people working were dedicated to the position and were just there for a pay check.
good,A typical day at work was like going to see the same bad movie over and over again. Being mandated to watch every scene. Although my co workers made it a little better and more of a motivation to go.
good,Did't really like the job the crew were amazing. I learn a lot because i sent extra time to how to make all the burgers. i've  always been I I'm a really good clear.
good,Work was okay. I enjoyed working there. Love the management and I liked working with my former coworkers. Management was fair and I can have the days off I need
good,"The grills were so dirty that I stayed sick while I worked there. Even after I quit I was sick for weeks, I worked with grill on nights and cleaned the grill better than other people but yet everything was so dirty I kept getting sick. I would not recommend this to anyone,"
good,working for the company was very under privileged there was no room for growth.the hardest part was cleaning the store after hours and still maintaining business the most enjoyable part was meeting new people working together as a team to get the job done.
good,"Working for Wendy's was a great learning process. From the simple things to situations that required a little more muscle to get the job done. It had a great working atmosphere, along with great people who were always prepared to help at the drop of a hat. I received good hours throughout the week that were more than well needed at the time. Their business is definitely one to start out a working lifestyle on, then build up from there."
good,"1. Walk in and immediately be behind because the day workers would leave everything for the njght employees. "
good,Wendy was a great place to work for my first couple of years but the quality of management has gone downhill the last year. I worked very hard and was not appreciated by management and even had my hours cut for no reason.
good,"cleaning fixing orders that have been messed up cleaning no down time, long hours, would not work with people still going to school"
good,The best part of my job at Wendy's is serving the guest. I love the fact that are satisfied and are smiling. The worst part of my day is an unhappy guest.
good,"Fast foods Places are just very hard to work for, specially if you have a life, a relationship, or kids. Great work experience for teenagers (15-18)"
good,Wendy's is a good job to start off with. I've learned how to deal with alot of rude customers from time to time. The hardest part of the job is being told to clock out early when you have yet to reach the end of your shift.
good,"A typical day of an average employee starts when you arrive. You clock in, and check with the manager what position you're needed in for the day. Most workers are needed to know several, if not all, positions, so that the management or shift leader can easily assign tasks, cover breaks, and ensure the night goes smoothly. Coworkers can definitely vary, but I can say that the ONLY reason I still work there is the coworkers. Most of them are pretty friendly, and they're just trying to get through the week to the next paycheck, just like you. "
good,Working here I experience fast food in a bad way. I believed this job was unprofessional and I didn't receive many hours like I was supposed to because of how they set things up. they also were unfair on how they treated both shifts
good,"working at wendy's was a good experience, it wasn't my favorite place to work at. but I'm grateful for the opportunity they gave me."
good,"I learned how to deal with the public, I always got along good with my managers. The hardest thing about my job was dealing the heat very hot in there. The most likable part of it was meeting new people every day and making new friends."
good,"I liked working with some of the people there, and enjoyed the opportunity to work in a clean environment. But I disliked my manager. I was worked overtime without extra pay or benefits. I was also harassed there for a time before I quit. I also never received any raises even though I hadn't been written up in my whole time there."
good,"my day would typically be the same. I worked a shift where I would be on sandwich prep all day. I would work front and drive thru, normally by myself. even when busy. I wouldn't get a break unless I worked 8 hours and often times they would give it to me an hour or two after I came in or and hour or two before I left "
good,Wendy's is an okay place to work. The work experience really depends on which location your at. I do feel that Wendy's over work their clients for such little pay.
good,"I loved my job as a cashier/ cook, the guest were fine i was just looking for something with more flexible hours and less gossip within the work place between employees and the employer."
good,"This Wendys was probably the worst first job experience ever. The managers we extremely rude, and most of them had no clue what they were doing. The bullied me around one day and told me I was doing an excellent job the next. They also had me working an enormous amount of hours, sometimes above the maximum amount I was legally allowed to work. Overall, the working environment at Wendys was a terrible first-job experience."
good,"Started as a teenager working there, most people were easy to get along with and work smoothly through out shift. taught me customer service and how to present yourself and your product to the customers"
good,will move good managers all around to help better the company but will not promote them or compensate them for doing this.
good,Typical day at work was either really busy which was most of the time or consisted of picking up the restaurant and maintaining it's visual appearance. What I learned was patience and multi-tasking. Management was either really great or really faulty. Co-workers were fun and hard working but sometimes felt like they saw favoritism there. The hardest part of the job was nothing. Everything is pretty simple once you get the hang of it. Most enjoyable part was making friendships with customers and employees and getting to be a part of  the Wendy's crew.
good,"Store manager was a dick, but the shift managers were easy to get along with, Fast pace, but for the open shift, they had 3 people to get 6 different tasks done. The day went fairly quickly, although partly because the average day was only 5 hours."
good,"I've been working at Wendy's for almost two years and was promoted to a management position within my first year.  I've done all that I have been asked to do to get promoted to Assistant Manger but I was told that I cannot be promoted because I attend college at night and cannot commit to the time that they want me to commit to to be an Assistant Manager.  I think that is so unfair for me to be punished for trying to better myself by attending college.  That is the main reason that I am looking for another job, because I have no plans on quitting school and I don't want to remain stagnant with the company."
good,"working at Wendy's I cleaned the tables, served orders to the clients and prepared the food. I learned to multitask working this job. my co workers we worked together as a team. the hardest part of the job was preparing the orders by yourself."
good,"For anyone who is in desperate need of money, I would recommend Wendy's or any other fast food chain. It's a paycheck, but it's not something you would want to live off of forever. For little pay, you do work your butt off. It's almost ridiculous. I didn't have time to do anything outside of work. I did, however, learn a lot from working at Wendy's. Sometimes the job seemed rewarding when complimented or making one smile. Other than that, it has caused a great deal of stress on my life. I am still grateful for this job, though."
good,"It is a very easy job, you just clean, stock, and keep the customers happy. Management is hard to please though. You get yelled at for doing to much work then you get yelled at because you are not doing managerial work, when you are only a crew and only get paid for crew not manager."
good,i hated wokring here dealing with poor working conditions and dealing with the rude people coming in and out of that place
good,"Wendy's did not make their employees feel welcomed, very unprofessional. Knowing how I am I keep things very organized and stay to myself. Management were very poor at their jobs and lack of communication."
good,"A typical day starts about 3 hours earlier than the store actually opens. There's a lot of prep work that goes into a day. Everything was made fresh every day so it was like starting from scratch every morning. Being that it was my first job I learned all of my customer service skills, and the basics of cash handling here. The managers kept everyone on task, the whole crew always knew exactly what they needed to do. The hardest part would have to be when a bus would pull in. It had to be all hands on deck to make sure we didn't run out of anything. The most enjoyable part is working as a team."
good,"Can be stressful, mostly teenagers. Late nights. Long days. Good breaks, free food. Discounted items. Upbeat. Not the best computer system."
good,I worked part time till I could find a full time job. people were friendly. I really enjoyed the customers. I had worked in fast food preiviously so food prep came easily.
good,"As a grill operator my job was easy, even during rush periods which got very busy given the location was also a truck stop, same old stuff every day, cook burgers, potatoes, bacon, chicken, and chili. My co-workers and management were great."
good,"Wendy's isn't a bad first job, the pay is minimal. Management is nice and understanding. Co-workers are fun to be around. The work is easy for the most part. I learned to deal with difficult customers."
good,"I say this job isn't bad, it's fun and engaging in activities but it's dirty work and fast food. I would make sandwiches or take orders while my co-workers would get friends or make drinks. The hardest is whenever it's busy and the pressure is on but I enjoy when it's down time and I just relax and talk with my co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work required me coming into work, sitting down and immediately getting into the phone queue to answer calls. I would take between 60 and 80 calls per day, with the next highest person taking about 40 to 45. I learned how to troubleshoot quickly, remote into equipment, and create tickets. When I was first brought on, I was told that the main goal was to help managers, with the call times not being really prevalent. By the time I left, all they cared about was the amount of calls you took and tickets you closed. I once took 73 calls and closed 75 tickets or so, and was told that I should have closed 80. I also inquired at one point as to why I was taking so many more calls than everyone else, and was called an outright liar because the manager didn't feel the need to monitor the screen that showed ""Rankings"" for calls taken, average call time, etc."
good,"This company (Starboard Group-Wendy's) is a franchisee for Wendy's hamburgers. All the stores are more than 15 years old and are in various states of deterioration. "
good,"My typical day usually started with me finding out what job title my manager needed me to cover down on that day. Depending on what I was put on, fry cook, grill man, ect.,depended on what challenges were brought to me throughout the day. This was something that I did like about my job because it made my days go by faster. Helped me learn how to stretch my abilities as a worker by operating in stressful situations. My management was very skilled at the time. I didn't mind listening to someone that had control of the store during the madness that fast food brought on. They would always motivate and help when help was needed. Helped me be confident in what I was taking care of, or step up to the plate when management needed help. I learned a little bit about leadership, team work and people skills. This was the first place I learned anything about being a professional, how to carry yourself, to show respect for others in the work place, ect. The hardest part for this job seemed to always point to having that professionalism. When people got mad for things that you didn't have control over really got to me while I was working here. But I grew as a professional and quickly learned that these things happen. We have to shrug it off and tackle the problem head on. End result being that we control the situation and fix our issues instead of making the situation worse."
good,"A typical day at work is like any other day except Thursday's. I would clean and re-oil the fryer,the hardest part of the job was trying not to get burned from the hot oil, as far as the management it wasn't to bad besides the fact that the managers would get power trips just because they wore different color shirt. But other that it was enjoyable to go to work because my fellow coworkers were very nice and very welcoming in the working environment."
good,Every day are the same someday we are busy running around and other days we is peaceful and quiet. And we deal with clients everyday. I've learned that what you give in a work place you receive back and if you want to make something of your self you have to reach high. Sometimes our management is poor and out dated but we learn to cope with it and make it better ourselves. My co workers are working just as hard as I am and all of us has a goal in life and support each other in our goals. The hardest part of the job is sometimes you receive clients that are not very nice and rude and you should be nice and make your customers happy and give them what they want even if you sometimes can not make it happen. the most enjoyable part of the job is that we are a family and se stick together and support each other in good and bad times
good,"working at Wendy's could be good at time and bad. However, whenever I had to work I made sure I keep a positive attitude at all time no matter what happen. Also I learned working at Wendy's to keep to myself and everything would be ok."
good,"A typical day is working at a station (fries, grill, etc) taking orders from guest and preparing there food properly, quickly and effectively.  The hardest part of the job is during the lunch rush and the dinner rush.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I worked with and our regular guest that came in ever now and then."
good,"every day is typical to work, why? because everybody have to work fast and is not easy."
good,I'm a cashier and a shift leader. I always make sure the customer gets what they want an make sure my co-workers are doing the same. I really enjoy the people I work with. It's a friendly environment in which one feels welcome. The hardest part of the job is usually the customers and trying to make sure they get what they want. Always wanting to give them an enjoyable experience so they will come back.
good,"En un dia tipico de trabajo llego a tiempo y sin faltas. Aprendi casi todos los puertos existentes. Existió una buena relación laboral. Lo que mas me gusto fue aprender los estilos de cafés y bebidas frías de la parte de cafetería, también mi turno preferido es hacer apertura del local ya que podía stokear, limpiar el salón,  darles los buenos días a cada cliente, la adrenalina que tomar y hacer el pedido en mucho menos de 1 minuto como cajera y nunner."
good,"Didn't work there long, but it was a good and nice environment. Everyone worked as a team, and got along well with each other. Most of the crew was younger than I, but overall a good place to work."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is pleasing my customers making sure they are happy
good,"Its a complicated job that requires a lot of hard work and dedication ."
good,"I learned what its like to work in a fast pace place, I loved my managers and my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping everything in line all the time and the best part was working around people I liked."
good,loved the people i worked with. managers weren't to good though. lack of respect and motivation.
good,"The days started to repeat themselves, and the managers became terrible people. I took everything that was dished at me, and enjoyed my time there. The hours slimmed down to nothing and unfortunately had to leave."
good,Very busy days. Not much to learn after you know all about the job you have to do. Management always change.
good,the managers at the Wendy's location in question were un-focused and took issues from home out on the workers at times.
good,Its a good first time job for some one in school or just needing a side job.
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers, taking their order; Preparing their order in a timely manner.  Maintaining adequate supply in drawers; Stock and rotate inventory regularly.  I have learned how to communicate with co-workers to be able to maintain customer satisfaction and contribute to company success.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with unccoperative customers.  Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with a great team of co-workers."
good,"a typical day at Wendy's is hectic. you have lunch rushes, after work hour rushes, angry customers, irritated customers. what i learned from Wendy's is patients. patients is the key in dealing with customer service. management was terrible, everybody had they unprofessional ways of doing things. the hardest part of the job is the rushes. the excited part is interacting with new people."
good,"When I was working at Wendy's I was a cashier. I would come in and punch in. Count my bank and get onto a register. With my headset I would talk to customers and take orders. Once they got to my window I would review their order and take the money for the order. They would go down to the next window and take their food and continue with their day. When I wasn't a cashier, I would be in the window and help pass out orders."
good,Typical fast food resturant. No job advancements. enjoyable parts was the other team members coming together topast time in there
good,at wendy's everything is constantly moving everyone is going in a different direction to get the job done. i learned how to properly clean fryers and i strengthened my memory skills. the management are very understanding and fair. the co-workers were alot of fun always had other workers smiling. the hardest part of the job was the surprising amount of prep work that needs to be done constantly. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a customer leave with a smile
good,"I am actually used to working in an entirely different field so I did get the hang of the job as quickly as i would have liked, and I felt that the managemnet could really use some work on their attitudes, as well as some of the other employees but I do think that it is a much better fit for teenagers."
good,"The customers and staff were the best part of the job ."
good,"i would come to work in my uniform, and clock in. everyone was very nice to work with. the hardest part was to learn everything on my own with no help."
good,"Too desperate for workers that they rehire people that they have fired, or wont fire people who should have been fired after the first 2 weeks. Managers are usually good or decent, but all the people above them have some of the most ridiculous ideas that aren't good. Overall, it was a good learning experience but it could use a lot of improving."
good,Work is what you make of it. It helps to have a positive attitude to help offset anything that may go wrong.
good,good co workers and un able to handle busy times and keep respectful
good,Wendy's works very hard to provide good customer service to their customers.
good,learned a lot about making sandwiches management sucked bad
good,"This establishment was unprofessional and unreasonable, i learn some experience but i left to find better improvement for myself and to better my life experiences. Some co-workers and 3 out of 7 managers knew what they were doing. I don't have any resentment towards them but it was an experience."
good,I prepared food for customers and was a cashier. I learned how to make a hamburger. my co-workers were ok. The hardest part of the job was remembering what went on 50 different sandwiches. the most enjoyable part of the job was going home.
good,"I found that Wendy's taught me a lot of how to work in a quick and friendly manner. How to stay calm under pressure and handle situations that are thrown from the unexpected. It taught me to think ahead and plan the tasks I needed to do throughout my shift, helped me learn and maintain cleanliness and also improved my social skills."
good,Go in for shift and get put into a position. Do what is required for that position. Co-workers are great and management has some issues to fix between themselves.
good,"Cleaning and cooking, Serving customers. Learned how to deal with the stress of rush hour."
good,this place was alright to work at for a person who is just looking to make some money for personal use. Good place for young workers and students
good,"team work enviornment"
good,"Umm...its ok, but wouldn't go back to work there. To many simple minded people that work there. I know a lot of people that has been there for over 20 years and still is a cashier. No motivation for people to grow with the company."
good,"hetic, stressfull, overwhelming.  Higher up above store level expect too much out of you without helping you out"
good,was fun but only for a little while upper management has no real involvement in the daily tasks and goings of the store leaving plenty of room for improvement.
good,"very boring had to wash dishes every day did nothing "
good,"I worked third shift at Wendy's. Management was not the best. Co-workers did more talking than working. hardest part was closing because I had to clean, cook, Stock and serve customers all at the same time. overall I did not like working in fast food."
good,"Days were usually fun because I worked with a family member. I learned how to focus on business. Management was friendly but, not helpful. Filtering was difficult. I enjoyed the atmosphere."
good,"A day at Wendy's started out by clocking in then asking a manager which position we went to. Here i learned how to handle cash, deal with customers,clean and prepare food. I liked most of my co-workers and some of my managers. The only major problem I have had with the managers is favoritism. The job never really had any hard parts except dealing with rude customers. I liked the job because it was easy and gave me a job, but now it is too easy and i am ready to move on to bigger and better things."
good,Cooking and cleaning and maintaing a safe work station. providing great customer service and team worlk
good,"I learned a lot from working here.  At the time I quit I was a Store Manager. You work over 50 hours a week all the time, receive no health benefits, hadn't received a pay raise in over 5 years."
good,"terrible pay but good work enviorment, management was terrible they where always on power trips but really had a good relationship with coworkers"
good,"Wendy's was my first job, I was excited to go because I loved the money. I learned after working more & more that is wasn't the place for me because I had more responsibilities and needing more money. What I enjoyed the most was delivering all the customers food on job & hearing compliments on how good the food was & how quickly we got it delivered to them. The Managers were terrific, I built a strong bond with the store manager because of how good I worked in she really enjoyed my personality of keeping a smile on the co workers and the customers face."
good,"A typical day at work was a bit uncomfortable."
good,it was and ok workplace but i wanted a better job for me that could pay me better a job that i know i would be at for a long time a career job
good,"The assigned duties were not too much, however, team members slacked off quite alot and I was left to overwork while they conversated and/or smoked, or dined.  At closing time one manager would not lift a finger to help with any duties, but smoked with other employees and encouraged slack behavior.  When told the proper way to do a task for quality, I felt as if others despised me.  I would be willing to work there again if there were a change in management and a minimum of three employees were replaced."
good,I love talking too the customers that come into Wendy's. Typical day at work I run the Grill or Dish's. Management is ok I feel like they need better Managers who are not rued too the employs. My Co-workers are awesome they make me laugh and make the work place better. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the Managers that are rued. The best part of the job is the awesome customers that come in.
good,work stress level is based off co workers and managers. Job is easy
good,"The work area was small, but coworkers helped me when I didnt know what to do or if I didnt know how to make a certain sandwich. The most hardest part of my day was having a rush. My manager was very respectful and understanding towards the employees. On a typical day at work I run the cash register, maintain the wellness of the lobby and restroom area, and also transport all trash out of the building. One of the most important things I learned was customer service means everything in any business or workplace."
good,"Management at Wendys is a coin-flip. You can have either really great management or really bad management. Fast Food is high demanding where you need to work quick and the coworkers around you are completely stressed. Their is very little room to advancement in wendys, and you will be working a lot of hours for half they pay you would get at a regular retail job. However the Environment is great for starting to build a resume and give you a good sense of work ethic if you make the most out of what is given to you. I look at this job specifically as just an entry level job meant to be temporary for people just getting out in the job market."
good,"Being on grill was a very demanding position, in the Wendy's I was located (drivethrough restaraunt). I did learn many things while working on the job, however I did not enjoy my experience there. It was getting to the point where my crew would frequently ask me to help with their duties, and force me to leave mine unattended, setting me back alot. I recieved alot of false critisism and did not appreciate my Manager's attitude towards me, as she did not treat everyone like this. Other than the emotional aspect of the job, if you can mundanly do the same thing each day over, this is the job for you. The work itself was actually the only thing I enjoyed about this position."
good,"This job was a good start for me it taught me how to do inventory, write schedules and work fast paced"
good,It was fun to work there but it was also taxing because some of the management didn't know what they were doing.
good,"A typical day at work is fun but draining. I learned that you definitely have to have patience to deal with angry customers. Management is usually helpful. My co-workers are friendly. The hardest part bout this job is dealing with the unsatisfied customers. The most enjoyable part of this job is my co-workers, they keep me in a good mood."
good,It was great to work with the public but they can be messy. Great food and atosphere.
good,"Taking the customers orders/ delivering food to the customers/ cleaning"
good,"Enjoyed the type of work. Every location is different. The co-workers were helpful. There wasn't anything hard about the job, it was interesting working with a wide age range of people.I learned how the store was operated, and that every location is different."
good,I hated it. Especially only getting paid 7.50 an hour only made me hate it even more. I quit a couple days after I finished orientation.
good,i really learned what hard work was when i worked at Wendys it prepared me for my future jobs.
good,"Overall Wendy's was a good place to work, but the worst thing about it was all the drama that the other employees kept going. I came in to work, I did my job and i went home"
good,"I would usually be on the grill for a bit, then an hour later or so they would put me on ""back change"" which would collect the money at the drive through and would also wash the dishes. When I worked to close I would also wash the tiled floors and be one of the last ones to leave."
good,Working at a good steady good steady pace produci ng good serving times an good accurate services learning how to work through hard task keeping a good attitude in front of customers working with great mangement keep me with knowledge of the product an offering good pointers working with a team the is understanding an helpful
good,I worked in the mornings and sometimes at night for people who couldn't work for other reasons. What food temps need to be in order to serve the food to the customer. The managers were good to there word. I really liked everyone that I worked with. There wasn't anything to hard. We always joked around during the slow hours to pass the time while we worked.
good,I learned to have a lot of patience working in that work environment. I came up with new and improved ways to teach my employees. The management team was not the best to work with there was no communication which always caused a lot of problems. The workers were overall a good group of people. Hardest part was learning how to manage all different types of people. The best part about my job was I had leadership.
good,I would come in do food prep great customers take orders clean up prepare food unload truck deliveries. how to preform in a fast past environment. Able to help in tight spots during a rush. Worked together equally to get tasks completed correctly and in a short time period. The most difficult part is having to correct peoples orders in a short period of time. Seeing a happy customer.
good,"worked from start to finish "
good,"Working at Wendy's had it's ups and downs.  It depended on the manager that was on shift.  There were three managers at the location that I worked that were awesome to work for.  I would go out of my way to do extra things for them because they made work enjoyable and they didn't show favoritism.  I think that the owners of the location that I worked in are wonderful people."
good,"Not flexible with my schedule while i was at school . Other than that i enjoyed working with customers, and i liked all my co-workers"
good,"Love the fast paced environment. Customers were not so nice at times, so learning how to deal with that daily was a challenge I did very well at over coming."
good,The co workers are great people every one works together. Two of the managers are very immature and do not take the job as seriously. You always meet great people but you will eventually get disgusted out by the food.
good,"all business, I learned to run friers. The managment was mostly good. Great co-workers. The hardest part of the job was closing at the end of the night."
good,"good place to work,its just the pay sucks.good people that works there also."
good,typical day at work is very busy from start time 11 to when im done at 7. Ive learned how to interact with customers is a friendly manner.  the hardest part of my job for me is jus trying to keep the same energy level the whole day.
good,"Learned how to manage money,prep food and customer service"
good,Really just to much going one for one person. Never really time to get yourself together 
good,i close 5 nights a week and the work seems fairly easy to me everyone is prety easy to get along with... very hard to get a raise 
good,"•	Serve customers in eating places that specialize in fast food service and inexpensive carry-out food."
good,Fun atmosphere. Average pay. Decent benefits. Your typical fast food job. Does offer opportunity to advance to management.
good,I was very disappointed with the way that employee's are treated .I thought company would of been better.
good,Working at Wendy's was beneficial to me because it was my first place of employment. It was not always the greatest but i was proud to work at Wendy's and I made it a great experience for myself. 
good,"work part time as crew member but rarely if ever get a 30 min. break or any break at all working over 5 hrs when is required by law to have one if work 5 hrs or more.  Versatile in position continuously on your feet moving from one place to the next, where ever help is needed. Fast past with great team effort."
good,clean cook clean that is most that you will do sometime you will clean out the frige freezers the bathrooms 
good,I learned every aspect of running and maintaining the fast food franchise. I have worked there strait out of high school and was an intricate crew member for the closing procedures. I enjoy working with our customers and take pride in my work.  I enjoyed my position with Wendys but realized there was very little room for advancement and am looking to learn new skills and look to a future of hopeful advancement with your company. I am a responsible father of a beautiful little girl I need to provide for and make proud. I would very much appreciate consideration to grow with your company. Thank You.
good,It was ok learned how to cook more waysto cook an to be quick about it because people dont like to wait
good,"the work had to be done fast, made new friends, but fast food wasn't really in my line of work"
good,ive learned every spot in wendys i can train new employees work the computer take care of costumers and any complaints they may have. all the managers and crew members are great people to work with
good,not enough team effort. also. putting in poposition that your not strong in
good,I loved working there but management was bad. They would yell at you in front of customers instead of taking you inside the office to discuss the issue. There was several complaints on the issue also. The place was okay i loved working with all my crew member.
good,Fun to work there but busy all the time. The breaks are only 5 mins once a day. Alot of standing and moving around but the people I worked with were nice and I got along well with everyone.
good,A good job to start a working experience to learn traits of a good employee. Flexible hours to work around schooling and necessary appointments.
good,"A typical day at work for Wendy's is preparing food, and sometimes back up the cashier and dishwasher. Management was good, as were my coworkers. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep up with orders when we got slammed and the most enjoyable part was being able to prepare food for others to enjoy."
good,"Take orders, greet customers.The managers were nice and mean but i got along with everyone."
good,I'm working midshift most of the time from 11:30-8pm. Management team are good they are with team work but not that knowledgeable when it comes to human resource problems/concern. Happy work place but because there are different raises sometimes you can't understand each other because you have different culture. The hardest part of the job is doing multi tasking kind of job but sometimes they did'nt see that but if you commit mistake they easy sees it. the most enjoyable part of my job at wendys is your working but you can't feel that its a job its like your playing while working because its fun and you have the chance to talk to different kind of customers.
good,"This was my first job, and I worked there for 2 years. I loved the people I worked with but unfortunately, the hours that was given to me were terrible for a High School Student. My shifts consisted of working from 4 p.m, which is when i finish school, to 1 a.m. Therefore, I had no time to study."
good,"the staff was good, and didnt work to many hours for school but it was a descent job"
good,"the managment and my co workers are ok, and a typical day there is it's a fast past work, the hardest about the job is meeting our goles by the end of the week but i do enjoy talking to our customer to see a smile on there face"
good,I was a grillman.. I be behind the grill allday.
good,Work serving the customers while learning how the menu and drive through system works the management was good but the hardest part of the job was to keep up with the rush hours of lunch and dinner times when allot of customers come in and drive through the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and making sure they were satisfied.
good,This is a good job if you want to keep health insurance. You dont have to be a full time employee to get Cigna insurance. You do however have to pay for it. This is a job for making spare money but not for taking care of bills.
good,I've learned alot since working there...alot of patience for sure...there are some great management along with some bad management but since they are my boss you have to go with the flow...sam e with co workers...there are some great hardworking people along with your lazy ones...hardest part of the job is dealing with working with people who don't want to do their job but still get paid...I believe you should work for your paycheck as should everyone there.Most enjoyable is working with other hardworking people as a team and of course friends I have made.
good,"Great job at the time, didn't have full time available so no benefits."
good,Good to have a job that is in the outdoors and requires physical activity!
good,"it was awful but like i said it depends who you work with, all the people i worked with were really impatient and rude with everything they did it was a disorganized environment."
good,I've met some of my really good friends in the workplace but there are some days when the customers are rude and treat you like an incompetent child. Some stores are dirty and I can't bare to touch some of the things. I come home smelling gross and feeling very fatigued. The amount of work and the long hours are not really worth minimum wage. And one person could not support themselves off of it.
good,This certain store was compltely out of controle and run down. I became a manger with in a month of working there. In one pay period i worked 184 hours trying to get the store up to par so that we could pass inspection.
good,"Overall it's not a bad job when you only have to put gas in your car and give your parents a little money each month. The job deffinitley has its good days, and its bad days. My particular Wendy's, the nicest way to put it would be; most co workers are disrespectful. The team work ethic can be HORRIBLE sometimes. The team work ethic of my Wendy's makes me want to work at McDonald's. Nobody has any respect for the GM and people tend to play around to much. I''m currently looking for a new job."
good,"same and repetitive. come into work go to post begin work, prepare sandwiches,"
good,My job is to mosty clean the restarant and parking lot. I do the same thing every morning. Sometimes if I get an 8 hour shift I am able to work the fry station and the grill.
good,My day was different from day to day. Monday's I came in @ 5:00 am to take inventory. I ran a great inventory level and payroll percentage. I would supervise the opening team to make sure they stayed on schedule with preparations. We would work as a team through busy lunches and dinners. I took this poorly performing store and turned it into a profitable store. I enjoyed the customers and employees very much.
good,"The typical day at work was taking care of the customers,cleaning and participating in all activities. I have learned about the value of a customer and how to treat them with the up most respect. My co-workers are very friendly and have much respect for teamwork. The hardest part of the job is when your short of a staff during rush hour, But the most enjoyable part is when the customers leave happy!"
good,"as a cashier i handled customers orders and served drinks and fries. management was very nice and a pleasure to work for, the most difficult part was keeping areas as clean as possible when there was a steady flow of customers. Most enjoyable part of working here was being able to chat with co-workers on down time without getting in-trouble."
good,"I would say that the particular wendy's that i worked at was very clean and well run for the most part... they had some nasty people that worked there but that was fixed pretty quickly... the management was okay. We went through a ton of management. but overall i would say that the wendy's that are NOT FRANCHISED is the cleanest fast food restaurants in brampton/mississauga which would include britannia, derry, 410/steeles, main and financial. It was fun while it lasted but i wouldn't go back"
good,"I was a cashier for the lobby for a year and some of my co-workers were rude and disrespectful. I left because I had to move out of state almost over night, I didn't have enough time to give my 2 weeks"
good,I was working this job as I was a full time college student. There was nothing wrong with the job. I just believe that Wendy's does not pay people for what they are worth.
good,"They wan't you to believe this company is an excellent place to work however, I wouldn't recommend to anyone who has any ounce of integrity. Annual increase in pay averages .10 cents a year."
good,it was alright but need it more hours to pay bills an more money you cant take care of kids a house with that job or thay need to give more hours to the ones who wont to work give hour to the people thay no
good,"It was a fast paced job during rush times, but if we were not in rush it was slow and there was nothing to do."
good,"it is a job! it is very easy to work for, The worker are all very nice and are willing to help you if you get backed up, well at least when I was workng for them, I helped people out thate were backed up."
good,"The job was ok, I had to come in in the morning to make salads for the day. I also had to make sandwiches and sometimes run the cash register.The people I worked with were nice and helpful. Most of the management helped too, I know a lot of the employees felt unappreciated. The worst part of that job was being under paid for all the hard work. The best part was the people I worked with."
good,Overworked and underpaid.
good,I enjoyed talking to the customers they made my day sometimes. I worked the night shift and all the college kids was there at night and they was fun to work with.
good,Good part time job for while your in school but if you want a career then you should search elsewhere
good,The environment is positive flexible. Nice customers and staff
good,Working with customers is the hardest part of the job having to please the customers needs and making sure that they are satisfied with the service that we provide for them. Working at Wendys is a great experience learned alot more about resturant managment and customer service.
good,Always at work would only spend 9 hours of the day at home and 5*6 was sleeping
good,"I was the sandwich maker so i had to be the fastest hands in the building. learing the different builds of the sandwiches was easy and I did well in this position. I worked and trained young teens for the most part. The management was easy to get along with. I would ahve to say that me favorite part of the job was just being able to move as fast as i wanted because that was the purpose! I loved going fast and i was good at it, some employers want you to slow down and take your time whether you're capable of more or not. Not Wendys."
good,"This was my first job I remember that 6 months after I started I was promoted to safety marshall, within a year to a manager. I would had to mak sure all cashiers had the right amount of money to start their shift. I would help with the food and supply order. Some days it was hard to work with the general manager we would never know if he was in a good mood, I think that would add stress to the job, I learn a lot from my fist job."
good,"Wendys is a fun place to work, compensation could be a little better, bebefits is good, advancement is sure once you put in the work. it is very hard to balance your life with work schedule"
good,Easy Job very busy requires alot of patience . The job is usually consist more of cleaning and sering custoers
good,"I am constantly learning how to build upon my customer service knowledge, while connecting with managers and other crew members. The management Wendy's are constantly teaching and am impressed with most of their leadership."
good,"Between the two stores I had worked at, one a corporate and the other franchise."
good,"okay place to work for the summer, fun place to work with alot of down to earth people"
good,I learned to work in a fast paced environment and how to provide exceptional customer service.
good,"I learned management skills. Managers weren't always nice and expected us to work when we were ill, and I mean throwing up."
good,"when you are a teenager, this is a good job just to start making money. The staff is nice, and very cool.The managment is very relyable. Good place for a first time gig."
good,"I was to build hamburgers during the rush of the day (lunch time). I worked all after noon and then into the night shift. I got $5 worth of free food and one break, I would clean the Wendy's facility before I would clock off and go home."
good,I learned the basic skills of management and how to handle a management position. A typical day at Wendy's was fairly handling. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the different personalities of different employees. It has been a learning experience.
good,A typical day at work is coming into a crazy workplace with a lot of different tasks. The hardest part of the job is the customers. Different attitudes and demeanor.
good,Great food for great customers every day going to work i knew id have a great time. I learned from my management to take the initiative to learn skills they could not teach me. Co-workers Id try to motivate to stay positive and out going but in my opinion the most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction i received from grateful customers.
good,"My typical day at work was easy as a back cashier , so days were not so good but I deal with it . When I first start working at Wendy's , I learned how too cook the food , how to work the dishwasher and cashier . The management at Wendy's wasn't the best because they were disrespectful too others outside the work field such as costumers. My co-workers made my day at work because we stayed working with each other , and having positive attitudes , and working fast . The hardest part of the job was begin the cook. The most enjoyable part of the job was begin a back cashier ."
good,Working there was decent. Not bad customers it was the managers that made the job unplesent.
good,it was a easy job but our company was ran differently and slow
good,guest with hot enjoyable food. its hard making sandwiches. Management keeps you on your feet. Co workers help hand to hand when you need help. Hardest part is knowing what comes on the sandwiches by heart. Most enjoyable is the fun you have with one another.
good,"Long work day, learning mult management learning cooking skills"
good,Working for Wendys will allow the opportunity to learn many positions with effective training. Each employee will have the opportunity to learn each position to prepare for any short notices or emergency. Wendy's take pride in cleanliness and quality of the product while servicing the customers
good,"This job is good for people with no or very little work experience. It's very fast paced, close courters and very demanding job."
good,"This is Wendy's. No one should walk in expecting anything over minimum wage here, I know I didn't. From a crew member's standpoint, you clock in, work your position, and clock out. The crew is usually fun and management is usually tight. Comments like ""Our food cost is high"" and ""we need to cut labor"" are common day phrases. Corporate sends impossible goals to the stores. So management tries to cope the best they can, but a skeleton crew of 6 for lunch does not yield low drive-thru times and good customer service. The company is too money tight, which I'm fine with. I used to be in management, which I disliked so I stepped down back to a regular crew member."
good,"Hard to get a raise, if you're 18 you're almost guaranteed to work the closing shift (very early in the morning, but varies store to store, mine was 2:30 a.m.)"
good,"The company is great just need to get better mannages, great people and environment, outstanding food, cleaned stations, cleaned restrooms, and great pay."
good,"Taught the basics. Typically left to figure the rest out on your own. The customers make the job interesting to say the least. Overall, a decent entry level job."
good,With a great supervisor it's a great company. The pay is not bad for being a fast food restaurant. Great benefit opportunities to take advantage of. I would recommend this job to others
good,"The management was really helpful, accommodating and flexible."
good,If your looking for a good first job then Wendy’s would be a good place to start. They are people friendly and help you get better at the job and make sure you are always on task.
good,It waa a great experience. I met alot of great people along they way. There are alot of issues within higher than needs to be worked out unfortunately such as Gms and managers.
good,The job was just really boring. I like to be moving around and active while im at work. The managers where really strict all the time. Wasn’t enough employees
good,"Food was always fresh for each customer. Wendys prioritize in customer happiness and satisfaction. Although understaffed at times, tried their best to get food to customers in timely manner."
good,It's a happy environment when there isn't anything going wrong. Also the management needs to be a bit better then just not really being there for everyone.
good,If you want to work at Wendy's you must be able to handle high-stress situations and be able to work faced paced with other coworkers. You need to know how to handle people and how to react in certain situations.
good,I loved working for this company however if you are unable to stand on your feet for mot that 4 hours at a time I would no recommend it. And if you are a smoker you get one 5 minute smoke break during s 9 hour shift so if you couldn't handle that then I would not recommend employment here. The management will pick and choose who they will enforce company policies with and if ever you and a member of management have a disagreement with each other than you should know that the general manger will find a way to make it your fault and you will catch a lot of flack for it.
good,"The management is just poor.. A little too abusive with authority. A great place for a 1st job for someone, because they can actually teach u how to work, but not a cateer."
good,The company is okay the management could be better but no to shabby. I enjoy the crew because we all suffer together and work as a team. Im very happy to call few friends
good,"Been there for almost a year . Managers disrespectful . Don’t get paid enough, giving away expired food . Don’t clean , wash hands . Keep me there past 12o clock on school days"
good,"A good job if you can handle fast paced work, high stress and heat. Occasionally  workplace hazards would fly under the radar. There have been several walkouts and outbursts on the floor because of pressure."
good,This job was one of my first jobs and I loved working there . Nice facility and nice management . Would definitely recommend to future first times workers
good,"When I first started working at Wendy's I knew it wasn't up to part, but I took a chance anyways. Throughout my working experience, I've witnessed things I did not wish anyone else would witness. It wasn't a place / environment for me."
good,After a month of working there you will see the managers true colors. They don’t give you the hours you request often and you will often be worked 30 mins after you are supposed to get off.
good,Overall working at Wendy’s is fun and great and I enjoy coming to work. I enjoyed until I had my stuff stolen from work out of the employee closet and then they proceeded to tell me oh well. After only working three weeks people were already stealing from me and turns out there had been an ongoing theift for a while and didn’t anybody say anything to me prior working there.
good,"Wendy's was a good first job although, it did have many issues between staff communication. Wendy's is definitely a good place to learn how to operate a register and learn better communication skills between you and the customer"
good,They were always understaffed so the job was very stressful for the workers they did have. Everyone had to pick up the extra slack but managed pretty well.
good,A place that will build you. Hard work busy drive thrus and hungry customers. This job will teach you patients and how to be a team player. The checks are every week and thats helpful for most people.
good,Management  was rude sometimes but the co workers were nice just like family. we would work from 6pm-3am every time they closed. its a nice summer job but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to a 19-22yr old in classes.
good,"The Wendy's I worked at was a small town scene but was always busy. Fast food is an unforgiving world but can make your day go faster. Pay for a closing manager was extremely low. They made me a low offer even with my experience, then after I left, they offered the next manager with zero experience $2 more than me and even more when she wanted to quit. So expect low-balling on wages and unfair offers. Crew was fine, but misbehavior was not accounted for or taken care of. Overall a decent enough starting job, but not worth your time if you have any sort of experience."
good,communication barriers between some workers. typically mostly slow but had some rushes that weren't too hard to handle. could've had things move at a faster rate if management permission wasn't needed for order mishaps.
good,"When I first started, I worked at a training location. Needless to say, this store set the bar for surrounding stores. They are very hard on new employees but if you can get through it, you're golden. Basically you have to earn respect by your work performance. They want to know you will be worth the investment."
good,Al though there is requires for you to work under pressure and work fast. Be able to multitask on any station you are assigned. As long as you are able to get things done fast and officiant you will do just fine.
good,"Unless you really enjoy food business and know your strengths and limits, I would not recommend working at Wendy's. Personally, I had to go for the better of my surroundings in life. As a customer though, I used to really enjoy the food."
good,"Overall a very stressful environment to work in. Although I did have some good times working there, it has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Would not work in food service again."
good,Honestly the easiest job with little pay  not much else to say other than the lack of pay and pay raises. Store has yet to be renevated honestly the worst set of owners.
good,For working at Wendys for over a year I can say that it’s a good part time job for people in high school. I would not recommend trying to make a career out of Wendys.
good,"It would have been a wonderful jon if your schedule was not all of the place. You get 10 vacation days, but you are made to take 5 of them in thw same week so you can become overworked quickly."
good,"Benefits aren't that great. Hourly pay isn't enough to make an impact of help vs cost of living. Management and quality environment really depends on location, Hours are flexible though."
good,"It’s a very tiring job and sometimes they want you to give up your social life just to come in when they’re understaffed which happens a lot. I work there 4 days a weekend, I never leave on time and there’s always constant drama. I feel like I don’t get paid enough."
good,"It’s a frustrating job , but over time you get used to it .Then it becomes easy , once you get in the groove . After a year of working,I got a one dollar raise"
good,"I enjoy working for Wendy's for the most part, although it is difficult for me to be on my feet for long periods of time.  Good  place for developing people skills and  multi- tasking."
good,"Not a terrible job for someone in a pinch. You will have frequently bear the brunt of aggression from the silently enraged middle class, but you'll at least make some money doing it."
good,"This is a fast-paced work environment and very laborious job that's remarkably taxing on the body. There are certain loose formulas that must be strictly adhered to in all food preperation, serving, and restaurant operations. Most of the people working there are very stubborn and set in their ways too."
good,working at wendys taught me how to deal with different types of races and personality..they also taught me how operate a team by myself n how to take charge to keep our store move in an comfortable pastfor not just myself but my team..wendys really brought me out my shell
good,It was easy to work there but at the same time they would put you on wonky hours. Management was really laid back and didn't really show that they cared. They would also not do much work and sit in there office for half of the time that they were there. They most enjoyable part of the job was getting free food at the end of the shift.
good,It’s an okay job  get paid  a good amount compadre to other companies  crew members are friendly but managers tend not to help  get paid every two weeks and pay is put on a card
good,Didnt mind the pay just didnt like management i didnt mind the work it was decent never had any major issues just didnt see eye to eye with the gm of the store
good,At Wendy's there is no such thing as a set schedule so you have to keep up with looking at the schedule. Everything has to be done in a timely manner because there is a timer on how fast the food goes out
good,The only problem I had with Wendy’s was that the management didn’t respect my school schedule and that I would have to leave at a certain time. The crew there was good and I never had a problem with them or any customers.
good,"the employee was very friendly, I enjoyed working with them. The Management team was not organized. Scheduling  work hours was not done correctly....."
good,Great work place environment most people are nice and cool to be around. Good place to start off working. Low pay Get 5 cent raise very 6 months.  Work not equivalent to pay
good,"Worked here for about two years started at $7.25 and made it to $9.00 in two years. Very difficult to climb up, too much favoritism. Overall is a nice beginning job, I attended school and worked night shift."
good,"The job is simple yet demanding. If you work there longer than a year, prepare to be utilized in EVERY WAY POSSIBLE. They are more willing to have one person know & do everything than train multiple people. The pay is not the best for the amount of physical labor & tasks required. The managers depending on which store you work at show favoritism/partiality. This affect how many hours you receive if you're not a good worker. Lazier people, teenagers, & crabby old people have a more significant amount of power & pull in the store. Everything from what position you're working on, to the schedules, to raises, revolves around them.   This can become stressful when there is eight people & only two really know what their doing & is carrying the weight of everyone else: instead of working as a team. If your crew is good, it's a walk in the park. Laid-back conversations & can be very fun after lunch & dinner rushes. There are many employees of different ages, races, & social backgrounds, but everyone is friendly with one another like family. The Wendy's Culture is indeed real."
good,"The Wendy's I was working at, yes it's good for a first job. When you get there and work there it's a whole different story. You'll figure out fast that you have an option to keep it going or go until you find something better."
good,The overall job is very simple and easy to accomplish but the management wasn't very good. There were a lot of issues with communication and scheduling. They put their own personal feelings above the job and that got in the way and caused a lot of issues within the workers themselves.
good,"The management team was fairly poor. Very unfair with how they ran shifts but they always make sure that they get the job done. A typical day at work could go one or two ways, one of them being really good or really bad. Its all up to you and your attitude."
good,"Working at Wendys was great, however, there was no 401k or insurance benefits offered. There was room for advancement, but the pay was not fair. I would not personally work there again."
good,"Very fast paced, got to be able to move fast and get orders accurate. The staff seem very friendly and will help if they are able too.The work is usually pretty clean work except if you have to clean a machine or ovens and other stuff, not to dirty."
good,It’s a very laid back job. You have to be precise in your work & work well with others. It’s a good job for quick money...............................
good,"It's not something you want to work at for a long time, but it's overall a good job. Good for a high schooler or college student. If you want to stay there to become management or even higher it's a good place to do so."
good,"Its a good starter job, Honestly some locations are busy and some aren't you just have to be willing to actually do work once you are hired you cant be lazy"
good,Very unorganized place to work. The managers are very immature from the place I worked. I did not enjoy working there but I had to because I needed the money.
good,"Trabajo pesado y estresante, aunque tiene sus buenos momentos como todo."
good,The experience there was great with the repeat customers. Great to meet new people and interact. Management tended to show favoritism to some. Recommend this position for younger individuals without a family to take care of.
good,"In my opinion your are asked to do alot for the few people that were there to open the store. Your were expected to unload the truck, powerwash the drive thru pad, stock the stations, get the food cooked for opening, mop up the floors, etc.; To me the job requirements did not match the pay."
good,This job was beneficial to myself as it helped me pay the bills I needed to pay throughout my time in high school. It also allowed me to meet a variety of different people.
good,Food is great the employees are friendly as can be  would go back again  but the restaurant is a perfect environment for families to go and enjoy hope wendy's never goes away
good,"I've been working at this restaurant for over a year. I still haven't received my evaluation or a raise. The place is what you would expect of a fast food restaurant. Fast paced, a lot of food prep and cleaning."
good,"This job was super easy to do, but definitely just a temporary position and was one of my first jobs. Good place to be if you want to start out in food service."
good,"At the start, working at my location wasn't so bad. But then school and work started to drain me mentally. I managed to push through, but my hours started to cut into my personal life. Management wasn't very flexible, so I decided to try and find a new job."
good,"Fast pace environment, friendly staff and managers as well...always productive and a good place for a first time job. Managers are easy going and easy to please..."
good,"The days were busy, no time just to go to the bathroom for a min. It was to stressful. Mangers always arguing over stupid stuff. It was overwhelming. Just crazy."
good,"Depends on unreliable, unmotivated disrespectful and disobedient young people. No advancement and extra, unappreciated work expected from Leaders due to lazy workers. Underpaid and overworked leads."
good,the managers were always rude and always loud . the GM would yell and curse at the employees and even the other managers. I left because I didn't get paid enough to be treated poorly
good,"I only worked here for a few months, my sister helped me get the job. Wendy's was my first real job. After leaving my sister tells me that management steals money from the safe and gets away with it. I believe that is unfair."
good,"Don't get me wrong, working at Wendy's isnt that bad. I  met amazing people and it helped me come put of my shell as I used to be very shy. I'm not able to talk to people with no breeze. The only main problems I had when working there was that we were always understaffed and in my area the people weren't always the nicest and very odd. That's understandably not able to get handled, but the management was very bad. At my Wendy's we only had 3-4 mangers throughout the week and because we was understaffed, almost all of them worked everyday, the whole day. I understand having to ask people to stay longer, but when it came to working, some people had to work way more than others for no particular reason. One manger I had wasn't the friendly at times in fact not alot of people liked this person. When it came down to my pay and being told I was suppose to get a raise after working there for 6 months, I was pretty upset when I realized after working there 2 months away from a year that i was still working at the same price an hour that I started with while others got raises after their 6 month."
good,"A typical day at work was going above and beyond for my team members and making sure not only my job, but theres was done as well before the next shift.I learned alot about haveing to always depend on myself to get things done and noone else that when you want anything done in life you have to do it yourself if you want to be 100% sure it's done.The culture of my job is great.The hardest part of my job is communication with my boss.The most enjoyable part of my job is when i punch out to go home to my family knowing i'm getting a paycheck at the end of the week to provide for them."
good,Working at Wendy’s I love it but the closing part is unfair for one person to do all the moping stocking up and vacuum plus to clean two washroom it takes almost 3 hours to close and the pay is not worth it
good,A typical day would consist in good greetings. Whenever I clocked in I was instantly put to work. Harder work but most definitly was worth the time I was working. I wouldn't work there again though not really a long term job.
good,It was ok but really no-one to talk to you or help train you to do things correctly and never enough employees scheduled. Alot of people call off. Wendy's does a lot of things that are not fair and they are always hiring managers because they don't pay enough. Some days would be great days to work but sometimes when you would disciplinesomeone another manager would still let them work.
good,to take many orders and serve food all day get a 30 minute break drop fries and clean dinning area. had to be very fast with it always smile and the customer was always right
good,"A good first job, though the management and staff really made it difficult to want to stay. Rarely left my shift when I was scheduled. Customer service is never glamorous, but the customers at my location were especially entitled at times. However, pleasant customers made the job worth it. Highly stressful. Free employee meals were revoked due to food costs, now only 50% off."
good,"This job was very easy to learn, I took orders in the dining room and it was simple but drive through was the hard part. You have to be good at multi tasking"
good,"Working at Wendy’s definitely set the bar on what a working environment shouldn’t be. My first week out of training, I didn’t get a day off for three consecutive weeks. I worked almost 45 hours a week and only made 400 dollars in two weeks. I worked at a time when the McDonald’s was closed for construction so we were always busy. The work schedule would constantly change with no consistency whatsoever. I would have to beg to get more than just one day off a week. And since some of the people I worked with were too slow, I would sometimes get pulled away from doing my job to help with theirs."
good,Not a bad place to be. Can be a fun place to work management is good. Fun employees get along with everyone. 9/10 would recommend this job to others..
good,Okay workers and managment wasn't good. Alot of high stress and more than enough fast pace situations considering the entire place was understaffed and the little people who worked there didn't pull their own weight.
good,It's not the company's fault that my coworkers were mediocre at best. The hardest part of my job was picking up the slack everyone else left behind. I knew I would be staying long each shift because I was finished but nobody else was.
good,Typically day is usually getting yelled at or centered out because sometimes its hard to catch the right pace. Yes its fast pace but management doesnt have the patience to stand by you and train you and make sure you have the job down pat. When I first started I got told I was costing the company money because I was making mistakes but nobody joined in and helped. If you have mental health they dont support that either because they make it seem like it's their problem and they dont want their hands dirty. Some employees are laid back and easy to work with others not so much. Hours or inconsistent. Honestly one of the hardest places to deal for work with.
good,Must have an optimistic attitude or your day will be a dud from there on out. Constantly have to coach and train your staff if you want to remain on top. Always know your numbers.
good,"They Really Need More Benefits, There Were Little To None. You Never Knew What Was Really Going On. The Rules Constantly Changed Because Different Managers Kept Coming From Different Restaurants."
good,Overall it was ok the job was easygoing. Management was kind of Shakey but it was not that bad. Hours was ok. Environment was pretty much ok. I enjoyed the co workers I was working with.
good,"if you're looking for a first job, i do not recommend working at this wendy's. you will be treated very poorly and not have the proper training. the culture isn't very diverse. The hardest part of the job is to know what you're doing without anyone even telling you what to do."
good,"This job was very demanding, and has very high expectations but will not competitively pay with others despite advertising that they do. If you just need some extra money, sure but this job is not a good in the long term."
good,"It was my first job when I was teen. Started as part-time because I was still in high school but after I graduated became full time. It can be fun depending on who you work with. It can also be stressful, like during lunch and dinner rush. But for a fast food place that's normal."
good,Hardest lart of being an employee at Wendy's is that you have to be able to handle situations with customers on your own sometimes . You only get discounts if you have works that day.
good,Yeah pay sucks but they give you your hours if you work for them. Management a little off but they good people. If you like making sandwhiches running grills running fry stations and more postions then yeah you should defiantly apply. Uts mire for teenagers just starting off though honestly. Its a great part time job for the ones of us who have a more paying job and just want more money. Oh yeah and if it was to be your first job it will definitely teach you how survive on your own.
good,"I believe every store may be different. I worked at a franchise and my region was made up of only 5 stores. The owners were great and had positive intentions, however they were far off on how the employees actually operated the store. "
good,I was a shift manager and had to deal with upper management problems and had trouble finding help. I was called in on my days off almost every time and had to work over a lot.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wendy's because it gave me a chance to work on my customer service skills but I didn't like my management team, they never sympathized with their employees and when I was sick they made me come in so I resigned due to the fact that they would let a sick person serve their customers."
good,"Going throughout the shift it was quite easy as long as you knew your job. After being able to do your job well, you are able to start enjoying your time with your fellow crew members as long as you kept being productive."
good,If you are just looking for some quick money its fine but its not good if you are looking for a career. I would say most people who work there are still in High school.
good,"Working at Wendy's was okay when I first began to work there, but after I was there for a while it started to get harder because we were losing crew members which made it harder for the people that worked there. It was fast paced but was fine because I was used to it."
good,Working here was real easy going and simple. There was alot of fun and alot of drama. Most of the time it was drama. The company itself did a really good job at trying to make sure the staff and customers were happy.
good,it was really good working there until we got brought out by another company and things went down hill fast because the new company did not due what they said . they changed a lot of things that did not seem right .
good,This workplace isn't my ideal workplace. I only worked there to save up funds for college. This is a very fast-paced fast food restaurant with not a lot of job satisfaction.
good,it is a very fast paced environment at the airport where you will have to think faster than you move.  they promote from within and look for people inside before they hire from the outside.
good,"I worked here for years, around four years and there was some things i loved about it but the one thing that got me was how strict the managers are, it's like being in elementary school but instead you're getting paid."
good,"The stress involved in the super quick rushes were outstanding no one stayed for long usually and the managers were very nice . lots of heavy lifting involved, swapping duties a lot"
good,It’s not my favorite job but it’s fine. The pay is super low . Way lower than my last job but I stayed because my coworkers are great. I’m about to put my 2 weeks notice in though because my last pay did NOT add up to my check at ALL .
good,I didn't like how the treat me and i could nt handle anymore so i left twice and wont go back and they have bad employee and they don't treat people right
good,every one there was about they business when i worked there of course there were a few bad apples but they really did not spoil the bunch i would consider working for the company again but only in management.
good,When working at Wendy's i helped lead a team although briefly due to management issues which i hope now are fixed. My time spend there was good i learned many aspects of the workplace and never left one day without asking if there was anything more i could do for my team before i left.
good,I was a griller made sure everything was stocked up trash got took out cleaned the stoves and walls swept the floor and mop and made fresh tea and wash dishes
good,"Lunch periods are very fast paced and intense, but overall fairly simple job. Management was normally really good, the hardest part of the job was the pay minimum wage is close to impossible to live on."
good,on opening days it was relaxing because you had a few hours to set up. during the day time very little people showed up but around lunch there was always a huge stressful rush
good,The job just doesnt work out for mothers with the hours. I have grown with wendys but I have small children and I need more time with them which is why I can no longer continue my employment with wendys.
good,"I worked on grill for around 4-5 months I got the hang of grill really fast but it was very stessfull trying to keep up while having to cook all the food while trying to do dishes, and clean fryers. I wanted to get put into a different position on line, but my manager never really heard me."
good,"working at this specific location of Wendys was horrible. "
good,"It was good learning experience, at times it was hard to deal with many situations. It had and equal amount of pros and cons. I would not apply there again due to my own personal preferences, but might suggest it for someone else."
good,"As a high school student it wasn't the most fun job, however I had a stable schedule with respectful workers and competent managers. The worst part of working their was having to do a deep clean every-night (which took approximately an hour and a half). Other than that, it's a good place to work."
good,Fast food job that pays you more than minimum wage. Overall willing to work around your schedule. At the time I was there I had very poor management. Could workers were good though.
good,"My day at the job starts up at 7:30 when i clock in first thing i do is put chili on sometimes i have to make it fresh if there was not any left from night before. Then take trash out from night before put grill together cut on vents, fryers, and grill. Filter or change used grease, sweeping the parking lot, sweeping and mopping floors and grilling and frying product before store opens at 10 o´clock."
good,"Very fast pace job, work long hours and have to deal with the bad or rude customers almost every day. Most of the workers are fine but some are bad mainly the high school student that work there. Lot of no call no shows,so be prepared for them to call your phone to see if you can come in early or take over someones shift on your days off."
good,The manegment and crew members where great to help with other jobs that the crew members needed help with. If you where in school or had another job they would work with your other schedules. They also worked with you with Dr's appointments as long as you had the proper paper work when you returned back to work.
good,They were a very good company to learn & advance in my knowledge of food service. I had a incredible experience here taught me values & the people were family like.
good,Favorite part was rush hour because time flies by quick. I surprisingly grew to like being on front register and having regulars and remembering their order and small gossip everyday.
good,"Not the best work environment, however it was a good first job, gotta start somewhere! People are usually on drugs and not the cleanest placw for suuuuuure!!"
good,I do not remember this job very much and only took it to help me during college. It was a very hard job and fast paced with not the best manager however it paid good money for the time being.
good,I managed all day to day operations. I ensured the facility and food was safe forvour customers. The company has a very high turnover rate. The days are very long.
good,it is very stressful and for what getting yelled at for everything. their is too meany mangers so if you are good with one you are hatted by the others.
good,"they change your hours with out notifying you. if you have any children that you actively have to take time off for at times then dont go there they do not agree with you having any life other then wendys. if your sick forget about it,"
good,I loved working at wendys as a teen so i Decided to go back  in a way i enjoy it  but  I personally Feel like  No matter what the employer  Should make it a point  to  give Employees  a break  there no reason  we should be expected to work 7-8 hours threw with no breaks or Chances to grab a bite to eat  i think since i started there i have taken 2 10 min breaks  and  that was on a 7 hour day I would mind  it if it was like i'm sorry we have to work you straight threw   but here  because of that we are giving you Free meals.
good,Some managers are required to do more than others. Disciplinary actions are non existent so crew members do whatever they want to and know they will get away with it. Not staffed well so when someone calls in you have to run short staffed.
good,"Other than being disrespected and unappreciated, I was also stolen from by a fellow employee and the lack of cameras in the break room left the crime unsolved."
good,"Non-flexible hours. Fast-paced. Managers are very adamant on being rock solid with orders. Minimal time to close, overall not a bad place ,but not flexible enough."
good,Working at wendys is hard work if you aren't accustomed to fast food. Sometimes it is hard to advance in position depending on what manager you work with.
good,I loved the work invironment but the pay sucked I was told I would get a raise but every time the subject came up no one had answers for me. But I know that if I ever needed a job I can always go to Wendy's.
good,It was that bad of a place to work at Rilke we got a couple new managers. They crossed trained me on how to do every position so they could depend on me.
good,It’s okay to work but not the managers. They’re very unprofessional and out of order.  I would recommend that hire s whole new team to keep their business running
good,The company wasn't bad to work for.  Just the hours and pay wasn't enough to get by in everyday life. When trying to pay bills and take care of a family of 6.
good,Polite service with a smile making sure the customers leave with a smile on their faces I also loved meeting new people and helping others with everything needed
good,Good place to have your first good job but nothing to be looking for a long term. If you like dealing with high school kids calling off or coming in late getting to cover their shifts but wont be getting over time at all you'll love this place.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's most days out the week. The flow of the line was good and although the management was loud and tough, they got the job done."
good,Would recommend as a first job only. Not enough to sustain life on your own.  As you simply cannot make enough. Even with government help and section 8 living.
good,"honestly the management sucked, wouldnt even cooperate w crew members , the job was very except the way the way the managers treat employees is so disgusting ."
good,"It'll be a better place, if they had a lot more security and overtime was avaliable."
good,"Overall, it was pretty fun until things became shaky. It is a pretty good start for having a first job. The only thing I’ll say is mainly focus on time management. Gotta be quick for this job."
good,It was okay working there at the beginning but after awhile I started to notice poor management skills and it wasn't the type of work atmosphere I wanted to be in. There was a lack of communication skills working there and it eventually became stressful.
good,Upper Management does not enforce rules and policies employees work off the clock as to not get overtime. No consistency in disciplinary action among employees.
good,"A great opportunity for those who are new to the country. If english is your second language, you will learn by getting paid. improve customer service skills by working on the front counter and interacting with many different customers."
good,"Our general manager refused to talk to us about raises or any advancement in career at all, treated employees unfairly and with favoritism. The pay is terrible considering how little you get back in reward."
good,"It was always a busy, get up and go pace that I am now super tired of."
good,The job was easy and I was good at it. The customers and my general manager were terrible however. It did not pay well but gave me some good management experience.
good,"My experience was that it was pretty easy to learn and get to know everything, i worked there for 2 years in high school and 2 years after. There were alot of people working under different names, that got paid double what i did. They never wanted to promote me to even a shift manager, but they would always promote less reliable people. I ended up quitting because they always assigned me to a shift that a shift manager didn't like me. The manager would always down grade me, talk about me in front of my face, and when i would be in the middle of doing something, she would tell me to go to break and it would usually not be at my assigned time. I spoke to the general manager about it and his response was that she was the higher up and i was to follow her commands. After 2 weeks of bad from the shift manager, and nothing being resolved,  i put in my two weeks and left. The stress was not enough to make me stay working a minimum wage position."
good,"the job was straight out of high school, the wok experience was great, I learned a lot. the hours were ok, just not for a person with family and bills."
good,"the pay rate isnt enough to do all that work. I learned about stocking and prepping the equipment, also learned how to cook n make the sandwiches etc."
good,"As with any fast food job, don't expect to make enough to pay your bill. But for those of you who still haven't moved out on your own yet, or just need to supplement your other job with some extra money, Wendy's isn't a bad option at all. Despite the fast pace, the restaurants are always staffed to meet the customer's needs and workflow encourages collaboration with your co-workers."
good,"its a job, I get paid, get ok hours.. but I got told things that was going to happen and it never does... more hours, I got hired as a manager but because I couldnt close they took it from me.. didnt even tell me I wasnt one anymore... my punch number now says crew not manager"
good,"A great job for your first job, not really a job you would want for a long trem job. "
good,"Very stressful environment. As my first job I worked as a fry cook here during high school. I am colorblind so I had a bit of trouble browning the hamburger properly, management was not at all supportive, simply telling me to start over whenever I made a mistake without any additional guidance."
good,"This Wendy's has a lot of kind hard working people but has somewhat poor management and poor pay, you don't make enough to survive daily. And hardly any advancement"
good,"This company expects it's manager to eat sleep and breath Wendy's. This is understandable to a certain extent, but not at the expense of your family.  Thank you"
good,"It definately varies from person to person but in any job the longer you there your the first to go or get pay cut"
good,"I liked working at Wendy’s at first, but then they would leave me by myself in the drive through, while management would be outside smoking. This would make my anxiety levels go up."
good,Its not worth it to stay in these work place..management are not  hearing what employee feels....its like u work  just becoz  u need money....always long line....were not getting our right time for breaks and lunch...were working like a robot..
good,Wendy's was a good first step for me getting a job while still in school. They were great as a job for while I was still learning because the schedule was flexible and forgiving.
good,Most of the day to day tasks can be simple but the overall experience comes down to the managements ability to have a full staff working. Customer service will be hard to adapt to.
good,Wendy's was my first job. It helped give me a sense of responsibility. Fellow employees were easy to get along with. Management was always helpful. Recurring customers made the experience fun.
good,"I really don't like talking bad about jobs I worked at, but this one out of all of them was the worst place I ever worked at. I never felt so uncomfortable working at a job. Management was really strict on us and talked down to us. Employees were very rude and I always felt like I had to be on my toes 24/7. I had to leave because I couldn't handle it anymore."
good,"There wasn’t a lot of help, low crew members and very stressful environment. The managers weren’t too great, there’s wasn’t any help and when you asked for help nobody wanted to help."
good,Wendy's was not a bad place to work. They just expect too much out of management and do not permit delegation of a lot of tasks that could be completed by crew members.
good,"I am working 16-18 hours amongst two days, Saturday and Sunday. I’m expected to work at a high pace and with great accuracy when taking orders. I open the restaurant, I work all virtually stations: Register,Fries,Grill,Drive-Thru."
good,"Fun first job but they only pay enough for a 16 year old to work there. definitely not enough money if you have bills to pay. Hours are terrible too, you could work until 1 am one night and then work at 6 am the next day."
good,When i first started training they more or less threw me to the wolves and then when i messed up they would occasionally correct train me but basically was trained through experiencing the work and then learning the right way.
good,It was a job that had it's days where it was good but also days where but was bad. They are usually good with working with you on the hours your available to work. I enjoyed my time there but towards the end not so much.
good,"A typical day at worked depended on what position you were working, and what day of the week it was. Some days were a lot busier than others, like weekends. The job itself was not too hard. The management were great as people, but some decisions made did not seem to make sense. Scheduling was only available on Sunday for the next week, so it was very hard to make plans. Everyone I worked with was great, I loved the people there. The culture was fine. Hardest part of the job was handling the busiest times. The most enjoyable was just talking to other employees."
good,when i first started everything seemed fine but after a while things just got bad.started with one person then was just like down hill from there. wont be working there again
good,Wendys was my first job and I was still in high school so I was working only part time. what I did like about it is that it was faced paced and really kept you on your toes. The managers were nice and helpful with any situation
good,It helps pay the bills but I live paycheck to paycheck I'm trying to find a better paying job so I can provide better for my family a live a little more comfortably I say it's okay place to work I would'nt want to be a manager there because I couldnt deal with the younger employees
good,Very fast passed environment chaotic at times very good place to learn communication organisation and memory skills not sure what else to say but its a fast food job there all the same. Right.
good,a typical day at wendy was fast paced and stressful.i l learned how to operate dffrent machines.the work place wasnt bad but the managers were horrible.the hardest part of the job would be making sandwiches when its really busy usually weekends .the most enjoyable part of the job was pay day
good,"The pay is okay but I do feel the Mangers st the Wendy’s I worked at weren’t bad the greatest, I feel like they could have a little bit more respect towards their other employees."
good,"Work is intense and busy use food safety to serve the community"
good,"You gain customer service here and learn how to be quick on your toes meet a lot of nice people, help all type of people. Jobs real easy just have to work with people that really knows what to do in there area. And management needs to be more organized."
good,Wendys was stressful and treated the management and staff as if we were expendable. I had to run shifts with less people than physically possible and got reprimanded because shifts wouldnt run smooth. was made to feel bad for taking my vacation and sick time
good,"A typical day would include me working on the grill, cleaning the restrooms, sweeping and moping floors, cleaning my station, and removing the trash. I learned how to work in a fast past environment. The management there was pretty good. The workplace culture there was good. The hardest part of the job was that it could be overwhelming at times. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be working with good people."
good,"The hardest part of this job was keeping up with the customer demand and satisfaction, especially on the days the store was understaffed. "
good,Managers treated night crew terribly. They played favorites. Customers treat you bad and so do your managers. They were unable to meet my availability. They would schedule me long shifts without breaks and they would schedule me to open after closing.
good,"It’s a nice place to work however if they want you to come in and don’t , managers will give you the stink eye. If one of the managers don’t like you, they put you where they know you like it least and it’s basicsllt time out until they feel you’ve had enough punishment. Pay is okay but raises are given to the favorites and favorites get offered promotions unless they’re desperate and losing workers. However they never let you go hungry and I appreciated that a lot."
good,Wendy's is much like any other fast food restaurant. Keep your station clean. move quickly. You do simple math and petty cash handling as a cashier. Make sure you get their order right on the first try and type their name for the order ID. I don't mind my work responsibilities because I know they are standard for all restaurants who go by the same health codes and standards per state. The hardest part of my job is finding a good way to schedule my time there and at school which is a major obligation as well. A quick talk with your manager and a little dedication on your part should solve the issue. Thanks for Reading.
good,Typical day was fast paced and went by fast. Learned customer service and how the food industry operates. Management was friendly and accommodating. Culture expressed a hard-working and friendly environment. Hardest part of the job was handling issues between co-workers and customers. Most enjoyable part of job was the fast-paced and friendly atmosphere.
good,"it is  very stressful, it is very fast paced. the management is rude at times, they do not know how to talk to people. the hardest part is when other people do not know how to work in a team"
good,"Only work here if you absolutely have to. I really wasn't terribly interested in anything I did there, and was paid less than I should have for the amount of stress included. I used to hear the loud beeping of the fryer, in my head, before I went to sleep. Life is not meant to be lived in a place like Wendy's, at any point in time. Please."
good,"In my store, it was either make or break.  You had to be able to keep up and adjust accordingly.  My management team, in the beginning, was awful.  Over time, it improved.  The work environment is rough and definitely not for the self-sufficient."
good,Buena empresa pero muy bajo salario y poca facilidad de ascender de puesto
good,A typical day at work would be me starting out the day setting up the stations and learning the ropes on how to make a sandwich or Etc. The management was ok given the fact that there were some managers that were layed back and others that were really strict. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the sandwiches and moving at a fast past when it would come around rush hour. One good thing that I got out of working at Wendy's was working with all of my co-workers. We all worked well together and if someone was struggling they would help them get back on their feet.
good,Not a place for me to work. It was a lot of drama going around . People were very unprofessional. So that’s not where I wanted to be and also the pay was too low.
good,It was a very fast pace work place. sometimes customers could be rude & not have any patience.but they were flexible with my hours & if i needed hours they would try to help find me some hours. so overall it was a positive workplace .
good,"though the work environment can be stressful at times, the employees are great to work with; they really do make all the busy days worth it in the end!"
good,When showing up most times you can expect not everything to be caught up or done but you  are at least greeted and usually have a good time while at work.
good,Wendy’s Was A Great  experience But Somewhat Streeful Because I Didn’t Get Enough hours or Days So I lost Childcare And I was Without a Job And no Way To Make Money So I Can take care of my  children
good,Keep to yourself and you won't have any problems because most people only look out for their selfs depends on which one you decide to apply to work at cause something show a lot of favoritism at there stores.
good,"Although the pay was low, and I was working 8 hours or more a day, Wendy’s taught me how to work well with a team, how to collaborate to get the job done, and how to deliver best customer service possible."
good,Cruel unfair management. Customers of the area are nice. Cut throat environment. Fast pace work. Only hope of happiness at Roseburg oregon wendys is your co'workers.
good,"Very stressful and unenjoyable for the amount of work. Learned how to deal with difficult customers, coworkers, and managers. Management was uncooperative and hard to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to coworkers."
good,It’s a cool place to work. It’s very fast paced. You have to be on your feet at all times. You always have to be cleaning. Fast food is a place where you have stay calm and be positive.
good,Management is poor. And the hours they give us causes us to have no time for homework. And they need 2 weeks ahead of time to call off. And they are hard on emergency’s
good,"This is your ordinary fast-paced fast food chain. The only difference is that this specific location actually kept employees because of its ability to train people at all positions, and the flexibility of scheduling. The night shifts are in high demand because THEY ARE high demand; not a of people can keep up. Day side workers are consistent and usually have been there for years."
good,its ok learned to be faster on sandwiches and taking orders and making sure customers are satisfied and I also learned how to calculate the total of the menu when the computers went down.
good,I learned so much working for Wendy's company and I am forever grateful for the experience. There is nothing negative I can say about working for the company.
good,It was always crowded place and sometime the machine were broken so it was hard to do the job properly.People were were nice and really helpful when you're new. So that really helped.
good,Wendy's was good for advancement as they did a lot of internal promotions when I stared with them. Again the hardest part of the job in fast food is staffing and retention.
good,"People there care about getting the job done but not well enough to show their coworkers some respect. That is all I have to say about wendy's but this site is making me type more."
good,"I worked overnight and had a great crew for the most part. Management was decent, and even though it's a small and somewhat cramped work space, it was a good job. I would recommend working for Russell at the conway store."
good,I gained cashier and food prep experience in a fast food establishment. The management was difficult to work with as they weren't consistent with job responsibilities. They kept switching my jobs during the same shift. A positive part of the job was working with a team.
good,the job is all fast pace work and multi-tasking. You also need good customer service skills and be a fast learner. This job also has very flexible work hours.
good,"I love the team I work with. The corporate is corporate and there isn't much more I can say about them. As a shift supervisor, I didn't have to deal with them so much. While I love working there, it doesn't financially support me and I feel like I've gained everything that I need from it. That is my own personal path. If you chose to make a career from it, it pays off very well. The only con is that it can take a long time. Sometimes it takes over ten years for it to really start paying off."
good,A typical day would be fast paced. You are responsible for accurately handing out proper orders to the right customers. The hardest part is when it is really busy is to be accurate and handle the stress. People are expecting there food quickly and sometimes that isn't possible. The people that had worked with me were really good people which made for an enjoyable day. This would be a good place to gain some customer service skills.
good,"As a crew member you will be responsible for taking care of customers as well as other job duties like stocking and cleaning.  However, depending on where you are stationed you may find yourself working alone as business goals may cause the Management team to focus help in other areas."
good,"Wendys is a really great company. The atmosphere is always fun and friendly. Most of the crew tend to become really close friends. The food is really good. Beginning a workday, getting the crew huddled to make goals for the day has always been exciting and fun for me. Wendys is the perfect job for students. As a manager you are required to have open availability. Having open availability could be a good or bad thing depending on what shifts you are scheduled."
good,"Wendys is fast paced don't recommoned if you are supporting a home, its more for a side job or teens. Still a fun environment to be in. Offers 401k and benefits"
good,When I first started with this company it was very fun. After a few years it became clear we as employees did not mean much to the company. I received one raise while there for a total employment of six years ending my pay rate at 7.55 per hour. The scheduling became inconsistent being asked to come in later than previously posted so that I would be ineligible for a break. I resigned from this location in order to pursue a new career avenue.
good,"This place is very busy and requires alot of effort. Better chances to grow higher in this institution. However, there are many clashes among the managers and sometimes backlashes from managers lead to negative environment at work. The managment team and crew respect each other and respects each other's believes and cultures."
good,"The hours were steady, minimum wage pay as well. It was stressful, but thats generally how food service is. Management was not good,  employees/coworkers created a negative work environment that was not managed well."
good,you can only expect so much from a fast food job. the management wasn't that great. most of the customers were OK but had a bunch of bad ones too. you leave there feeling greasy and gross
good,Job must be done in a timely manner in this fast pace environment. My experience at Wendy's was short lived due to lack of crew and caring of management.
good,"Started here in high school as my first job. Was good to have as a job to get someone use to the environment of working. Hours were mixed, as well as the shifts."
good,I didn't enjoy working for Wendy's during the time I was there. I felt as if the labor and the workplace culture was not satisfactory. I believe that the company needs to be managed better.
good,"doing excellent customer service to all people work place is okay , the area is a fun location to work hardest part is taking out the trash late at night for a female."
good,Lots of swiftly moving back and forth. Customers treat you badly. Management understood the struggle. the coworkers were cool. Very clean restaurant. Wouldn't go back.
good,Fun place to work but don’t have days off during some holidays to spend it with family. They open up for very long hours. Not friendly at all. Under paid as well
good,"Management was terrible, in two years of working there, my store had went through 5 General Managers. And the Managers who stuck, were very cliquey. It was obvious if you were a favorite or not on how you were treated, some employees were treated so badly  they quit because of one manager targeting them. It was easy, mindless work, but as someone who had gotten to a Crew Leader, and was trained for Management it was very dissatisfying. Upon promotions, I had no raise, or anything, but was expected to do more. Wendy's as a company was good, my store and franchise  was just terrible."
good,Wendy's was not the best place to work at. My hours were cut down once new management took over. The job was slow paced until the lunch rush hit. If you would rather work at a job that is busy and want hours then Wendy's isn't the job.
good,Working with Wendy's these passed 2 years has been interesting. Being able to adapt to fast paced environments has been a good use. They are also flexible with schedules
good,"The job is either manageable or super stressful, entirely dependent upon the General manager and your individual store, as with all food chains, and most jobs really. "
good,I enjoyed working there but I need something new. The people I work with are nice but the management could be better. Overall it’s a decent place to work at.
good,I just worked and made sure I pleased the costumers and had good costumer service. I learned people skills and costumer service. Management was okay but not professional enough.
good,This is a very stressful place to work and the environment is really hot. It is very fast paced and I learned that people are a different kind of rude when it comes to fast food restaurants.
good,"The work and company was great, easy going and fun, but the managers picked who to advance in position based on who everyone liked instead of who actually did the work."
good,poor management within the company that do not look after for its employees even when issues arise and employees bring them out to their attention they don't give a sense about it
good,"I started this job when I first moved to TN. Atmosphere is pretty chilled. Nice customers. I took customers orders and served their food. I kept the lobby and bathroom cleaned. I never really got a break or anything. Gets frustrating when you are the only front end person working on a busy day, especially lunch and dinner hours."
good,Very demanding and no approval if you did your work correctly. Not a friendly atmosphere. Management wasn't paid enough to where they were always in a bad mood.
good,"Helps you learn communication, multi-tasking, and team work better. Allows for flexible hours worked a week. "
good,Working at Wendy's is a hit and a miss. It can be fun sometimes but the night shift has a lot of cleaning to do. The techniques are super old style meaning you have to work much harder for the cleaning. The work isn't too hard throughout the day but they want low labor rates and want you to give your all but there are no incentives. You barely get a raise and the manager is what basically determines how work will be for you. Also you only get 50% off your food.
good,You are most likely going to be worked to death which is not worth it for the pay. I was always overworked and exhausted. It is like any other typical fast food job.
good,"Like any fast food place, it comes with its own stress and issues but starting this as a first job isn't too bad. I had this job in highschool and it wasn't that bad."
good,"Its a good place to work , for a school student . Barely get hours and pay is fair. Management is also fair . Get free lunch and 30 minute break . If they see you work good they will put you in drive thru . Sometimes the managers will leave for like 30 min and you will be left to take orders and make drinks also pacl the food all at once."
good,Working with friends is always fun and exciting! Management was supportive and friendly but at times do not follow your availability and just schedule you to work on days you absolutely cant.
good,The Mangers do not to listen to the worker which got really frustrating at times when your trying to convey and tell them you can not work a curtain day
good,was getting good hours for awhile but then it got cut for no reason it was like 8 hours shifts to 3 hours and working 6 days out of the week then went to working 2 days out of the week
good,"Working at Wendy's was a great first job for me.i loved the people I worked with,however I believe there could have been better management,but as a first job it was overall good"
good,"a typical day at Wendys was I would go on fry or grill station depending on the day. Work stock up and leave. I learned how to cook burgers chicken and chicken patties, fries nuggets and tenders. The manager was OK I guess. I believe there was a lot of favoritism but its whatever. The hardest part of the job was the fact that the people some of them were very mean and were not people people. The most enjoyable part was also the people a lot of them were really nice and I felt good."
good,"Easy job like any other fast food place, good management at night, good training before hand. easy hire, easy to learn how to clean and how to work the machines"
good,"On a typical work day on can expect it to have many rushes and overflows of customers. From this I learned to be fast-paced and plan ahead and to prep ahead of time playing close attention to the details. However, I had a very bad manager and it just wasn't the ideal experience for me each time that I worked with her. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working alongside some of my friends and meeting the diverse group of employees and customers."
good,"there are to many people working there, so employees are getting less and less hours. Some managers are miserable and not fun to work with. break room is small and cold."
good,"Its ok you high school kids and people who just love fast food but I couldn't see myself working there for a life time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,"A typical day would have busy rushes which kept us productive. I learned how to adjust and adapt when things weren't working or I needed to problem solve. The management did the best they could to accommodate with customers and employees. The hardest part was closing and scheduling. My hours weren't consistent, I'd open and close back to back. It was difficult to keep up. The most enjoyable part however were the friendships and team that I had."
good,"I learned how to work well with others, a typical time at  work is having to listen to two mangers at the same time, enjoyable part is coming to work."
good,The managers do not care about the store or the business. Employees are allowed to do whatever they want. Rules are not enforced. There are no repercussions to negative actions.
good,As long as you have the right managers who actually MANAGE! An I crew that work together as a team and everyone getting treated equally! You would have a wonderful time while getting paid
good,It’s fast food what can you expect.  The harder you work the more work you do the more hours you get. Are used to work open and close all the time and would frequently more work more than 12 hours but when school is back in they were very flexible with letting me go home early and come in later
good,It can be very fast paced and stressful but if you keep a leveled head you will be fine. Having good coworkers and compliments from costumers always made the day better.
good,"Working at Wendy’s in bridgeton was an experience. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to apply there looking for a long term job. Because of where the store was placed, it was very busy. Sometimes I felt overworked."
good,Wendy’s I’m Bridgeton is a good place to work only temporarily though. It’s pretty intense since it’s right in the middle of town and mostly everyone goes there to eat.
good,The job does not pay enough for an adult to live on in the average market. Is a great place for the typical high school student. Does not give great benefits.
good,"Working at Wendy's wasn't bad at first. Going to work was actually phone i loved the GM, the employees, and customers. until we got another GM who was unprofessional,rude,and not compromising at all. Minus the GM being a pain, i still got along with the customers, and employees really well. My job was handling the cash register, having great customer service skills, and making sure the lobby and bathrooms were spotless(cashier). I also was on grill at times and did prep work. Overall wendys was a good job, just poor management in the last days."
good,"Wendy’s is a great high school job although there is no opportunity of further advancement. Very flexible with scheduling and hours. Only 2 shift one can work, either mornings or nights. Difference in pay does not vary from shifts."
good,"Some days depending on who was working was fun, other times I thought of seeking else where for employment. Sometimes you received a 30 minute break sometimes you worked a 12 hour shift without one."
good,nothing much to say about wendys i worked with alot of mexicans with favortism. it was an alright place to work but not for the pay. the managers were kinda rude i mean arent all managers
good,"This was a job that I had to get at last minute. I definitely wouldn't make it into a career unless you like having a lot of stress and dealing with obnoxious teenagers who barely work. Be prepared to work 3 roles at once and with little to no help from the other crew members. Management could improve if they would stay on par with scheduling and handling of the crew. Everything for the most part seems to be misplaced or out of order for how the business should be ran. Otherwise if you need pocket money and don't have many expenses, then go for it."
good,"Come in at 9 am and prepare bacon and other freezer product for the remainder of the rush. Clean up quickly and then move on to taking orders in the drive-thru, collecting payments and between orders clean around your area and do dishes as well."
good,My review on this is the store could become much better but lack of managers play fault into that. And I put Work in everyday and I was never given my opportunity to become a manager because everyone saw that everytime I came onto the line we had things running smoothly
good,"Stressful, fast paced shifts. Typical day consisted of rude customers, management and team members. Hardest part was being rushed to take orders. Some managers were nice."
good,"Good overall work experience, management is nice. They take pride in what they do. Friendly fast service is a must. Customer service is the most important aspect of working at wendy's."
good,They are always short staff they are so unorganized and I’m tired of my work not being recognized we really never get help on the floor like that depending on what manager is on the floor other than that it’s everybody for themselves
good,was a good job poor managment other than that i really liked my job good pay and good coworkers for the most part easy job and good hours i wish managment would have been better
good,"The Wendy's that I worked at had poor management skills, and seemed to always have something go wrong each night whether it be a crew member or even a manager. Workers were being treated better than others and a motherlode of favoritism went around."
good,Wendy's is a nice place to work.  The people are great.  The job is rather easy but there is a lot to do for one person.  Cleaning is a big factor and has to be done quite frequently.
good,"great first job with potential to grow professionally within the customer service field. It teaches you customer service, face paced, and has various roles."
good,Really fat paced you have to be able to multi-task or the job can be extremely stressful. The managers leave off the line to go count drawers so sometimes you will have to do two positions at a time.
good,Not enough hours and too many people work there so hard to compete for them. It's an easy job and quick to catch on. I learned in less than a week. Not too busy so you have a lot of down time to clean and get things done
good,"As a transferred employer from out of town, I expected higher expectations in regards to training employees thoroughly. Unfortunately, my Wendy's location was a training store that did not provide proper training."
good,I was encountered with very one-sided management that was very biased and would favorite a few personnel based on their time working there. He would not give anyone a chance. Have seen many people leave because of this one manager.
good,"It can get really hectic if no one is working together. But, that's only if you are not a good worker under pressure. If that is the case this job is certainly not for you."
good,Cleaning and sanitation was commendable. Easy to follow food preparation and assembly. Manager was very personable. Fast paced environment. Community orientated.
good,You work fast and you have to try to remember orders and sometimes we run out of things and a customer gets mad or sometimes there is not enough workers and you are doing more than two things at a time
good,Wendys is not a bad job. The pay is just too low for me to be able to continue to work there. The managers are great and the employees are nice but the pay isn’t worth it.
good,"Wendys is typically a fast-paced environment where you need to keep up with rush hours, and it requires you to think ahead if you don't want to fall behind. After working at Wendys for over a year i will admit that my communication skills has improved, and the shell that once prevented me from expressing myself isn't as calloused. However it can be stressful for when you get a complaint from a customer, or if one of your co-workers are slacking off. Overall Wendys would only be good for people who are looking to get into the workforce like teenagers, and is great as a little side job. But it shouldn't be a part of a long-term plan."
good,"This is messed up, I just did a review for this job but nothing is right. I wouldn't work here again, I wouldn't want my children working here either."
good,"In this company as long as you perform your good, if you are hurt or sick upper mgmt makes it very hard on you to perform and talks openly about you to other managers and stores"
good,"It was my first job. I learned how to wok with everything as the the job went along. i did enjoy my job but, at time i felt like it could be better. The people could have been better."
good,"It's fast-paced and stressful. A minimum wage job and can sometimes have outrageous days, especially on weekends. The customers can sometimes give you a hard time, but that's expected for a fast-food job."
good,I never got any training. Then my manager called me the day after my invasive back surgery to ask me where i was. So I told her i was not coming back sense she was too high to remember anything.
good,"Typical day would be clocking in, washing hands and preparing the fresh food to begin cooking. At night, washing dishes, cleaning the floors but the most enjoyable part of work was seeing the costumers faces light up."
good,The days are never typical with that being said you have to be very light on your feet.  Being a part of the management team i always know that i have to set the tone for the shift.  Hardest part of the job is when the sales day is light!!  The most enjoyable part of the day is when we can enjoy a life moment with the customer.
good,"The environment was constantly changing, in which never boring. Abilities to learn many different areas including opportunities of growth. Flexible work hours and everyone worked well together"
good,"learn to deal with customer service, with employers, I learn to manage time well because some days can be busy which you have so many things to do. the most enjoyable part of my job was to resolve conflict."
good,great first job to get people started working to make some money. highly recommend as a part time starter job. work can be very fast paced and its expected for you to learn quickly
good,I had to get a job to help me financially get through University and needed something that I didn't have too much responsibility in so I could still focus on school. Wendy's was good for that. The pay is minimum wage but I expected that and they were extremely accommodating for my school schedule.
good,"During the busiest rush in the morning through lunch hours, I'm always capable of keeping a calm conscience and stable manner. But no matter the quantity of my duties, I'm always able to succeed efficiently on the job. Hard-working is always one of my primary skills from the time I'm on the job til I finish. I can communicate tremendously to others and translate as well. I can also complete multiple task at once while working well with others. My accuracy of showing up on time is consistently throughout the week. I'm very honest and trustworthy. I do consider myself the perfect person to operate with others, verbally and physically, on the job."
good,Working at Wendy’s was a good experience for me developing my skills as a team member . While learning on new & trending things taking place in the fast food culture
good,"Can be very stressful during rush hours, I learned that alot of people are very rude and will not contribute to a team environment and will do (not do) whatever they want once they have the job. No real incentives to try hard or actually do work very well. Very nice managers but some don't contribute anything to the working environment. Half price meal and free drinks at work."
good,I learned how to improve my skills by management by objective. I had nearly not advancement opportunity unless you wanted to become a manger. I don't believe I could have handled the demands of being a manager.
good,My review is it’s an ok place it would be better if they had more friendly staff and better hours and also better advancement opportunities and benefits
good,"This is a great place for a first job. Opportunities for advancement if you'd like. Laidback, fun environment. Management was very friendly and schedule was very flexible."
good,"My typical day at Wendy's consisted of coming in early in the morning to open the grill. I would clean the parking lot, including the dumpster pad. I would pull up the lunch stock, turn on the grills, fryers, warmers. The management there was working together as one unit. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my coworkers which made the day go by better."
good,"When beginning working there, I got told that I would get so many hours which I did not. I only got to work 3 hours and barley got paid minimum wage. Its very small. Theres not really that much room to move around."
good,"Working at Wendy's was okay. I did Everything but work in the office. I was offered a position as shift manager, but couldn't work the shift they needed me to."
good,"Wendy's was very quick-paced, hot, stressful, and there was employee drama."
good,I loved working for Wendys until this certain district manager came to town. He made 90% of the co managers and general managers feel stupid and unwanted.
good,"Honestly this was more of a step your toys in job. Very few hours were actually had. for the most part, it was just making ocassional burgers, fries, nuggets. but mostly it was cleaning and such."
good,Would get to work and feel out my daily checklist and then get on the floor and float to which ever needed me. I would delegate duties also i was in charge of doing the daily inventory. I would do a nightly deposit and the paperwork.
good,Wendy's is more so for underage children no adult trying to support a family will succeed off these paychecks you will definately be eating out of Wendys garbage can
good,its ok if you don't mind the pay and its a nice first time job for someone who has never had a job or any work experience. over all I would tell somebody that it is an ok job to have and the management will work with you.
good,"I worked at wendys for a year in high school and it was exactly what you would expect working at wendys. The managers were not friendly, we were always rushing and stressed and we only made minimum wage."
good,"Good place to work if you have a good GM. The GM makes all the difference in the job. They can make your job easy or hard. I have been there for 4 years and I have had three different GM. You have some that are over the top, some that are great that you never want to leave, and some that are just there to make everyone else life hard because they are unhappy with their lives"
good,A typical day was fun but at the same time stressful and very fast paced. I learned how to speak to customers in a polite manner and learned to have more patients. The management needed to be more focus and organized. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers and being able to work with them.
good,This was a good first job. I stayed part-time for years for extra cash. I left because i have another full time job. I would have stayed if I didn't have another job.
good,"I made it all the way to Supervisor and even though we were supposed to have meetings once a week, there were none. I never felt more out of the loop then I did when I was a crew member. No meetings and no more reviews, even though they were supposed to do them."
good,Overall not the worst job in the world but definitely not something you want to try and make a career out of. Management was iffy on how good they were. Overall very mediocre experience.
good,"I personally had a bad experience working for wendy's, the wendy's i was located at was very racist and judgmental. The management sucked. But however I wouldn't discourage another individual to work there."
good,"If you're looking for a job to start at, Wendy's would be a good place to start at. You're basically in competition for your hours with all the other employees."
good,"The location was my biggest issue I believe. The management was mediocre and lalzy. They did not offer many benefits when I worked there, but corporate may have changed their policies by now. Not necessarily a bad chain to work for, just a bad location."
good,"Typical day consisted of working register,calling out orders, using fryers,using grill, making food,bagging food and placing food on trays for customer pick up,working dishwasher, preparing food for next shift."
good,the hardest part of my job was working with the younger co-workers because they didn't stay on task and it held everybody else back from what they were doing I liked my boss he was very nice I like eating free food I learned the cash register how to work it and to keep working at a fast pace in the drive thru
good,Yell at you point fingers and make fake documents. But do not look at their self. But at other stores it's like a family and fast pace. Stressful but fast paced
good,"A typical day at work is busy, fast paced, and required constant concentration, especially if one worked in the kitchen or as a cashier, you need to stay on your toes at all times and master the skill of multitasking."
good,"Definatly a good start if you're just starting to work. I worked there for a year and a half and only got a 25 cent raise. For all the hard work you put in, in my opinion you do not get the right compensAtion for it."
good,"Working at Wendy's was great, but working hours should be less and  the ability to have all mgmt should have alternating weekends off with better pay."
good,I hated working at Wendy's. It was confusing and the managers yelled at you when you asked for help. You stayed in one position all day. No teamwork in the workplace.
good,"Wendy's, like a lot of restaurants, is a franchised company. The number of company restaurants declined by several thousand in the last 5 yrs. There are only like 300 company ones now. They've gotten rid of a lot of the people in Columbus at headquarters. The culture has changed. Way less changes to move up now. Miss old leadership."
good,It's a good place to start for a first job or temporary job while in high school. You get a good amount of hours you mostly get what you ask for . Otherwise than that it's a good place to start
good,The work schedule wasn't always up to par and selective days you may or may not get a break. People quit and call in  leaving the employee's  that are there with extra positions to fufill  .
good,"The job is always quick-paced and steady busy, sometimes overwhelming/stressful. Depending on the position such as cashier, cook, others— I used information already learned over and over again such as speaking, smiling, how to provide customer service. Cooking learning the menu and food preparations. At least one manager in the store at all times. Hardest part of the job is the speaker positions. The most enjoyable part of the job is staying busy and being fast-paced while being able to communicate with beautiful people."
good,I like this job because it is very fast paced and it keeps you busy.  the location i am at is a bit unstable because of management but the wendy's franchise is awesome.
good,Its a fun place to work its just some managers gossip about crew members with other mangers and crew members. Also the scheduling is a bit all over the place.
good,"A great place to work  where OJT were in detail and Team was great. Had a great time working there. Learnt alot to be a team player where we worked as a family. But due to manpower, had to work very long hours"
good,You learn a lot from working at Wendy's. It was very fast paced and you can be under pressure at any time of you shift. But overall it was a good experience
good,This is a poorly located store with lack of management . I only work part time  based on lack of opportunities available . Not a long term company full time but part time add on job .
good,"Some days start off pretty slow and calm. The temperature back in the kitchen can get pretty hot. This kind of job is for dedicated, fast-paced workers that don't mind doing the mindful work of others. Hourly wage for team members should definitely be raised. Wendy's doesn't pay their workers the type of money they deserve for the tasks they get done."
good,"You need the ability to stand on your feel for  80% of your shift , My wendys just started giving benefits. The pay isn't very high after advancing to crew chief but you will have opportunities to climb the ladder after advancing crew chief I heard managers get a lot of benefits and pays great"
good,"I have a strong service and hospitality background, and think that this company is a great place for those who aspire to work in the restaurant industry"
good,"Wendys is a great job for students part time. It is easy to advance into management. BUT, it comes with the cost of unreliable help from corporate and no appreciation for the work load. I resigned from Wendys because of the lack of respect and the wage compensation"
good,"Wendy's is stressful because you have to learn how to keep your time low and some of your coworkers would not help you and they let you struggle. You have to learn every position. The harder you work, the more hours you will get."
good,"At the store I was working at, it was very busy most of the time while I was at work or going there to get food. Only in bad weather or certain holidays. it would be slow or less active."
good,"If you like to work part-time that comes with zero breaks, then this is the job for you! The management isn't all that great entire working with only one cook during rush hours and having more then one when it's relaxed. The workplace culture is other wise quite easy to get along , really friendly people. The hardest part of the job would be working as the cook! every other position is so laid back the cook is basically doing everything, mopping the work station, taking out all of the trash, cleaning the dishes, once the dishes are cleaned before you could ever leave the sink must be cleaned. All of the meats, fries, nuggets, chicken must be restocked. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting some help and just getting off work. Wished I just get to make sandwiches or be the cashier....."
good,"Wendys was a lot of fun, i met a lot of nice individuals. I enjoyed the job, however management was awful. At least once a shift my manager would yell at us in front of customers if we didnt do something to her standard."
good,"Quickpaced, Helps you become more pacient, managers can be both nice and rude at times, hard to deal with certain types of customers (disrespectful ones)."
good,"Typical work day starts slow but gets fast at lunch and dinner time. I have learned so many things. All the things that i can learn that happens in a restaurant. Managers are good overall, sometimes it can be hard. Hardest part of the job is when you have to do extra work that other workers are too lazy to do. Working with young workers same as your age is the fun part of the job."
good,I dread working there they do not schedule enough people so they are always under staffed which just adds pressure to a situation that should not be stressful
good,"Over all Wendy's was a fine place to work, had a good group of employees and most of management were good people and showed that they really cared about their employees, very understanding and would help in any way the could."
good,"No team work "
good,"the customers were great, the crew was a very wide variety of people. A lot of the management is great except the general manager wasn't cut out for his position he didn't practice patience or self control. He was a great man when he wasn't throwing things slamming doors working with him was probably my only struggle. I learned so much while I was there though. I learned to believe listen apologize satisfy and thank. I I loved meeting and working with new people all the time."
good,Alright place to work. Not enough responsible or good workers. Too many people not doing their job and worried about other people. Always enjoyed making my own food though
good,"I like this job a lot and the people I met. Physically demanding at times. The night time management was great but there was a complete war between day and night time workers, it made for a difficult place to work. Typically bouncing for job to job inside the restaurant from cashier, dishwasher, sandwich maker, delivery to customer."
good,My review overall I learned a lot. I loved it at first. But I feel I don't get treated fairly their. I do everything I can for Wendys. I come in when needed. I cover any shifts. I never say no. I stay later come in earlier. Do everything possible to make it a better working experience.
good,"get to meet new people everyday , The hardest part about this job was it was not a lot of working so some days I had to work cashier and also run to the back in make sandwhichs Some days it was hard but I like working fast and stayed busy so it became easy."
good,This job is not bad to work for. Always busy and not much down time. Always learning and able to advance in your position. Really good atmosphere as well as the food.
good,"A typical day at work isn't that bad as most people would think. First you clock in, look at what position you're being assigned that day, and you work your station and make sure it remains stocked. I'd very much appreciate a higher pay, but $8.20 will always beat minimum wage. The fast food place is definitely not for everyone. I have great customer service skills when communicating with people and I've learned to always be the bigger person and remain professional. The people are actually really fun; I just despise when I work my shift and the previous person has ran out the door before even stocking anything up."
good,ordinary restaurant work such as cooking and cleaning. the longer employed there more like a family. friendly employees and management.  nice place to start out.
good,"The pay here is so small that you can work full-time and still struggle after getting your check. I only worked here during high school just to have a job but it was the absolute last time I would ever work in fast food. Pay is small, and the work is constant and demanding but you have to deal with unruly customers"
good,Very bad management and very rude crew members. Taking leadership was also very poor. Everything was just poor. I have nothing good to say about this place
good,"typical day is very busy"
good,"- a typical day at work is chaotic and nerve wrecking "
good,Wendy's was and overall positive experience. I learned how to work with people and be a positive part of their dining experience at the restaurant. Fortunately my employer was very flexible with my hours and gave me time off when I needed it. It was a fast pace environment which taught me valuable time management skills. The most enjoyable part of the job were my uplifting coworkers and management.
good,"I liked working at wendys.it was very fast paced,but thats how i like to work.i started on the fryer,and then i knew everything,they tought me how to make sandwiches,and learned how to do the drive thru.there is always room for advancements in your job there,work your way ip to a better job with more pay."
good,Very fast paced and productive work place. Learned restaurant environment. Management was nice. Hardest part of job was fast pace.  Best part of job was discount on food.
good,Its good for learning teamwork and doing cashier work and customer service. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the number of customers in a fast amount of time. The enjoyable part is the people you work with are good at what they do.
good,I worked at Wendys for a few months and picked up on Cashier skills. Also learned how to deal with customer complaints and built trust as a team and figured out problems like a team should.
good,slow and out of order not always on task with there job . low business skills. ive learned to be motivated in the process of working and also staying on task
good,"busy all the time"
good,From working at Wendy's i learn how to work i a fast pace environment and also take care of cleaning up the store. i learned customer service by taking care of the customers and giving them what they ask for.
good,Working here was fun but the work seem to get stale and they had more jobs on top of that without any warning. In my opinion I would've appreciated being treated like a grownup instead of a kid when especially when you do the work how they want it
good,"Bascailly everyone there had a problem with each other, when there was a big puddle of water on the ground nobody wanted to clean it up, they are disrespectful to the customers,  the manager doesn't give us enough hour's, people don't do what they supposed to correctly, stealing food without permission from the manager"
good,"I liked working there, it was a good learning experience. Although, i would not recommend for someone looking for something permanent. the managers were probably the best part of the job. They were very understanding when it came to scheduling and days off."
good,"Overall, my experience working there at Wendy's included learning every position. The general manager, at times took advantage of those workers with good work ethic and was not afraid to cut hours regardless of your performance.  I would not recommend this job for those with an education."
good,the food is good but when i worked there most of the people where stuck up. but that ok cuz your not there to make friends. your there to work and thats it.
good,while the job was simple and straight foward the management was horrible and rude and hard to work with. I still throughly enjoyed my job. I had a bad experince with management while trying to take time off when my mother took ill and died less than two weeks later.
good,"It was a good job to start off but when I found a new opportunity, I put my two weeks in. I was then told not to bother coming back. Before this though, it was good work place other than the schedule would change everyweek."
good,"It was a decent first job. I didnt like the fast paced environment but I got used to it very quick. The management was okay. Overall, Good company for a first job"
good,"The business was great to work at, but unfortunately they have some very rude employees there that honestly try to make everyone's life miserable. They were not very well with scheduling due to know that two people had a problem working together. Unfortunately the managers don't really care about the business just themselves and what they get to take home for dinner and their family on the house."
good,It was a ok job. We have love to do a lot more. At the beginning it was good then a lot of drama among the coworkers was started to come up. Work is work and the drama need to be lefy at home...
good,Learned to cook hamburger patties and French Fries. Learned cash and was fairly good at running drive through. Good starting job if you happen to get good managers.
good,As you would expect ; a decent starter job. Can be a lot of work. Pay is not good. Management and crew do well. Environment is friendly. Advancement exists if you're interested.
good,"Typical days at work for me would include, taking orders from customers, and cleaning the dinning room area, rest room areas, and front cash registers."
good,"I for starters am only using this job to help pay for college to get my degree in computer science, I work incredibly hard as a manager and the compensation for the work is worthless, the other managers don't care about their job so it makes my job harder because i believe in putting all your effort in your job whether you like it or not. A typical day at work involves me wondering is someone not going to show up today? how much harder am i going to have to work on top of what I'm working now? I learned how to manager people, to defuse any kind of arguments between the staff and customers, Hardest part of the job i would have to say is the being under appreciated portion. Where somehow the blame falls on you when you clearly weren't the one to do so. most enjoyable? other then getting to know the staff and where they came from no other enjoyable moments."
good,The reason why Wendys was to unproductive is because they didn't have enough people to do everything that was supposed to be done. I was cashier but I also had to go out and sweep the floor or clean the tables or clean the bathroom and I barely worked cashier which was the spot I applied for. Keep in mind the managers were doing nothing while all the employees worked there behinds off. That's why I left the culture was horrible.
good,"Just another fast food job, same as everyone else, management has gotten worse over the year but good job for a new person in the work force or desperate for a job"
good,"Working at Wendy's was actually great. I got good hours but the pay was so low. We were always promised a raise but never got one."
good,"If you can survive on around $800 a month, this job isn't bad. Make yourself irreplaceable and it's easy to get into management positions if you're interested. It'll be stressful at first if you aren't used to working in a restaurant environment but eventually it gets easier. The best part of working here was my manager was more than willing to give me the schedule I wanted and the regular customers are really sweet."
good,"Unorganized Disrespectful Co Workers , Never A Fixed Schedule Always Had Coworkers calling out . Store Very Dirty I Got Any Breaks it Was Always Arguments"
good,"Good for job for the beginning,doesn't have a lot of staff but still some best with the staff they do have,keep on top of all employees and treat equal at times"
good,"When I worked at Wendy's our night shift crew was outstanding. Our management team was horrible. We only had to good managers, which caused friction within our team. That disrupted the balance and flow of the restaurant. I would join the team at Wendy's again though, just under new management."
good,I left wendys to find a bettrr job that fits me. Wrndys is a good job to start for a first job. Teaches how to be quick on your feet and hard working .
good,"Not a very good places to work management is not that great, and neither are the hours overall it is a job, but on the other hand couldn't say that i would refer anyone to work there"
good,"Love the job just in search of something better. Job is very easy, gets frustrating sometimes dealing with the rudeness of customers but overall it's a job"
good,Handling Money and first hand customer support were among the things that i learned the most. i knew what to expect daily and was a good first job and met great people
good,"Wendy's had it's perks. I love the fact that I got to meet some good people while I was there,  I was sad that they close down restaurant, I wish I can see some of my old co-workers​ again to see how they are doing."
good,"The work is very fast-paced, especially at lunchtime. The main thing to make sure is that one is able to keep up with the constant work that is going on and to be able to work quickly and effectively."
good,On a typical day I did my own job plus 1-2 other peoples Jobs Due to them slacking off. The General Manager isn't the greatest person in the world to deal with and can sometimes be very unreasonable.
good,I had a terrible experience with management. But they were able to work around my school schedule. My job included working with the customers and taking orders. I would bag up the food then hand it out to the customer. I spent a lot of time cleaning after close and doing dishes.
good,"It started as a great job the the management staff was horrible. "
good,"This is my first ""Fast-food Experience"". Within this year alone, I have experienced enough ups and downs to fill a lifetime. With all do respect, Wendy's seems more of a corporation then a fast-food restaurant. There is a computer based training that has to be completed before stepping foot onto the floor. Tattoos are not permitted and complaints are taken VERY seriously. These are all good standards but to be honest my work environment is absolutely terrible.  The management is absolutely terrible and everyday seems to have a new drama, different broken equipment,zero sympathy and an underlining inconsistency. I'm not sure if that's how a majority of fast-food production works or it's only my location. I only know that there are many issues that need to be fixed because ""walking on egg shells"" isn't very fun and I could've gotten all this same experience outside of a traditional job and gotten paid 20 times more. If I could leave, I would. I have too many responsibilities just to pack up and go."
good,"the job experience itself for me was ok overall , but the way the company is ran it self is very poor and there customer service was very poor also. i like it because of the hours i was getting but it wasn't worth it."
good,everyone there was nice to be around but it was a very stressful job and didnt pay enough for everything i did. I love working hard but not for under pay
good,Good high school job. Open later for more flexibility. Not really employee friendly. Takes care of customers by offering good food at affordable prices.
good,Was a good job  until they hired another manager and she would always have an atitude you always gotta do stuff that the managers are supposed to be doing
good,Depending on the day and time it could be and easy stress free day or it can be really stressful.I learned that if every one works as a team and gets a long it will be easier to work.
good,If you can work in a fast pace environment and can adjust to rapidly changing work environment it is a good place to work and you get to work as a team
good,This job provided me with a job while i was in high school and my first few years of college. Flexible hours made it easy to work around my school schedule every semester
good,"I worked in the past one of my favorite in general"
good,Working at Wendy's was an enjoyable job as far as being fast paced. However I was never offered benefits or promotions during my time there. The biggest pro was that the manager I was led by was very competent.
good,"I have been working for wendys for a max of 5 years, at the beginning I really enjoyed the job until the management changed and then the culture and environment change."
good,Given no breaks when worked for 10-11 hours. Did not work with school schedule. Told cannot work late because of school they worked me late any. Harassed while working as well.
good,The management could be so much better! I would like to be somewhere that lets me show how good of a worker I really am! I enjoy my job but things could be better!
good,"I started with little to no experience. Went from the fry station, to the cashier. i could work any position, any time someone called out i was the person they would contact."
good,"Must like food service, I was not interested in food service but needed a job so I thought I would try it. My friend worked there and the food was good."
good,"It has been 2 years since I have worked there, it was an alright place to work. They had some over time but not much. It was an easy job not a lot of stress."
good,The Wendy's I worked at had rude and disrespectful management and the breaks were unpaid. A very dirty establishment and not an overall nice place to work at.
good,Everyone who works here is to the 5th degree. Managers work with you to a limit but get mad if it you don't do it the way they say. Crew members are never right.!
good,Are typical days at wendys is hear the women gossip about anything and everything they could think of If some of the women wanted to get away with a harrasment charge they could by how some of the other crew talk to each other
good,"depending on the culture of the environment in which you work can determine rather or not the job is best for you. Wendy's have different braches and the company I work for is Muyhamburgers. I have not have the best experience. I enjoy the customer service part of the job, I enjoy making people happy. I just not happy with the company and how they care for there employees."
good,Worked at Wendy's for about 9 years. The work place was fast paced and it granted alot of hours to those who had above average work place skill. Easily a beneficial part time job.
good,I felt the job atmosphere was good when I would work. sometimes it just was not always enjoyable because certain tasks just seemed to take a while and sometimes the customers were displeasing and that was hard to look past
good,Working at Wendy's is a chore and you don't get paid enough for your labor. When I worked at Wendy's I was constantly working. My shifts were about 8 - 9 hours long and I was asked to work doubles or even triples frequently because of short staff.
good,it a good job for kids who need money to go to school.i liked it did a lot work meet people it was good then cant say nothing bad bout it.if some young people want to work or older do it money to pay some bill
good,It is a common fast food job. As long as you stay to your self and do your work you should get hours with no problem. However there is much drama and at times it is hard to stay out of it even if you say/do nothing at all.
good,"A typical day at work at Wendy's consist of me coming in to work and clocking in, After that ask the manager what position they want me to cover, Most of the time I would be on grill but towards the end of my time there I would be on the drive thru taking the orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with my really good friends, it would make the work day fun and when one of us needed help we were there for each other to get the job done."
good,"days would consist of cooking and cleaning"
good,I was all around from cashier to sandwich artist to over seeing orders were correct before giving customer there food. Most part was a decent and fun job but no chance of moving up to management. One of the easiest fast food jobs in my opinion. For the most part employees worked as a team to get food to customers
good,"It was nice when it was busy , i learned how to deal with customers whether it was a positve or negative situation. I learned how to handle money. The only bad thing was it was very little hours 3 hrs a week"
good,"Job was ok, environment was hectic at times, management could have better. Not a bad place if not looking for full time job unless in management."
good,"Wendys isn't a bad com[any to work for, depending on the managers. Some will over work you and others are more understanding, so there's no way to predict what kind of workplace you'll get. The harder you work the more rewards you'll get within the company, such as promotions and days off when you need them. Very fast paced on Thursdays, Fridays and weekends."
good,it's a nice place to work. I got good work experience from them in the short time i was there. is definitely a good first job.
good,"Work here was just that, work. You showed up in uniform, and conducted your responsibilities. It was productive throughout the days, but hardly any room for advancement for how bad management was."
good,I would not recommend the store I work at anymore to anyone the store I work for has a major issue with communication and not just between the management but also with the crew
good,"i was a crew member at wendy's for 3-5 months, my trainer quit to go to a better job before she finished training me, so i half way knew how to prep the salad, but i did now how to do the front being cashier and server and cleaning dutys changed each day."
good,",....................................................................,......I recomend they are friendly. Stay busy. Understand personal call ins within reason. I enjoyed working for them. They make it not so serious. Management will work with you on mistakes. Try to not embarrassed anyone."
good,Wendy's was a good place to work for someone just starting out. The compensation is not that great and management is ineffective. However that work is not that hard and they offer advancement for those individuals who go the extra mile.
good,"Good job if you're not trying to make a living off of it. Dead end job, no advancement oppurtunities. At least at the Middletown, Ohio location. I love it otherwise!"
good,Very fast paced environment. Employee very nice as well as the supervisors.a nice place to start working. Food very great very good hours. The most part I like about the position I had was the communication with the coustomers.
good,"Clock in at scheduled times, pre food, restock counter, clean designated work area for the day, have a team meeting with all crew members and manger to set the goal for the day, start the day"
good,"it is a typical day at work, easy to do. the management is pretty well. the hardest part of the job was drive thru and the most enjoyable part of the job was making burgers"
good,"I never had to stop and do nothing, I always had a job to do. It was calm most of the time and didn't have to stress about anything. my Co-workers were nice and never had a problem with them"
good,"i worked at a fast food service restaurant, trained staff, dealt with customers. i enjoyed the fast pace and the friendly environment, employee of the month on multiple occasions."
good,Usually walk into an atmosphere where not much work is being done.  I was usually the main one taking initiative when things arent going to well. One thing i can take one that experience is having the correct mindset to take charge when needed.
good,"The company is going through some transition years. It also lost a lot of staff leaving for university which it did not prepare for, even though they had lots of notice. If you can catch on quick with the work, you'll have great hours and life will be easier for you."
good,"fast pace environment, most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with others. My co workers were great none of them were difficult."
good,It is a good place to learn and improvise your skills like labour and cooking and speed. The management is really sweet and helpful. The environment is quite helpful and coperative.
good,"The job was overall ok, it would be good for someone that is just needing a temporary job until something better comes along. They need to work on communicating better so people up from aren't waiting for their food for 10-15 minutes during lunch rush."
good,"Lonjg hours dirty work not much pay. Demanding job weird people not flexible, not caring for personal life fun job good food easy job team work everyday"
good,Usually had a morning shift so I was able to get out at a decent time and still finish what I need to do for the day. Everyone worked as a team and it made the time go by faster.
good,"Busy during lunch rush and chill during dinner hours. I learned how to be patient with customers and coworkers and how to multitask by taking orders and giving customers their correct order. Management was rocky from the start, first general manager was understanding when there was a problem. The second manager was nice as a person, but as a boss she was something else. I loved the co-workers and they were so easy to work with and ejoyable. Hardest part of the job was keeping customers happy. Enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers and food."
good,Great place to work with fun staff  just need to make sure you are filling orders and punching in orders correctly. Customer service is very important.  Always smile even if you are down or sick
good,Management was inconsistent and very unorganized. Lots of non stop working and short breaks. Management was unorganized. Co workers most of the time argued over rush hours of customers.
good,"learned different recipes, different job positions, management wasn't as cracked up as to be, co-workers were amazing and very helpful, the hardest part about the job was the sandwiches."
good,"In general the work was good, but this particular Wendy's the management did not see eye to eye with corporate and did not communicate well.  "
good,This workplace was set up directly for team work. There was no way to work on your own in this setting. It was a very fast paced workplace. You dealt with numerous people a day.
good,Well when you get there it might be busy and so you gone to be a little late clocking in witch sucks even if its 2 min but you go to the station they put you at management can be kind at times but put the nail down when its needed which is understandable
good,"Is a great place for a new job, it helps you grow in a laboral aspect as well as an interpersonal one . Is a delicious place to eat with family and friends. "
good,"Une certaine liberté pour accomplir les tâches selon le besoin réel du moment..  Choix entre regarnir tablettes ou faire l'entretien de la salle à manger ou prendre la température des aliments."
good,Weak management team leads to disorganized and unproductive crew and an uncomfortable and stressful atmosphere. Upper management needs to do a better job of vetting lower management and hiring at the crew level needs to be based on more than the simple act of putting in an application.
good,"Working for wendys was an okay experience. The coworkers were very friendly, management was not so good. Hardest part was dealing with the angry customers. Most enjoyable was getting to know customers"
good,"take order and get cash from customers "
good,"This place is all about Customer service. The customer is always right. I moved up very quickly at this job. I went from being a cashier to Shift Captain, with in a month."
good,Wendys was overall obviously a VERY fast paced place  .. I was usually sandwich maker and to me giving someone a NICELY made burger was better than rushing giving them a sh*tty burger .. But to Wendys its the total opposite they would rather you half a** make a sandwich as long as u make it fast .. Most people in our Wendys came back and we had to do it over again ..the pay was horrible u deal with thousands of customers a day making thousands of burgers and make 8.40 an hour .. Not worth the trouble. Management was the best though.
good,"the most enjoyable part of pruitt health was the patients. some where mean, but most were nice. just to assit the elderly was fun enough. just to watch them take there last days easy."
good,"Awful benefits horrible salaries, horrible schedules Awful management unorganized Business horrible hours no room for advancement no bonuses no raises either"
good,"The work is moderately tedious with little help. As a beginner, i honestly had no adequate training, so my work ethic was a bit slower than the others who had been there longer. The managers were okay but not great. it was about the same with the co-workers."
good,The longest Ive ever stayed on a job. I really enjoyed all of the things I learned on the job. Sometimes the hours can be too much and the set of people you work with might be lazy. The job is truly what you make it from the beginning when you get hired
good,just not the right fit anymore the crew worked hard and the crew was very customer orientated and did everything in their power to help them and supervisors did not care and help those in need of help
good,"A typical workday includes me working on one of three stations; Fries, Grill, or Register. I usually worked 5-6 days a week for up to 10 hours. The management was all over the place, we had some shift leaders who were on top of everything and others who just worried about getting to the end of the day."
good,"Wendys is pretty lit but I'd like to work with better people."
good,"3 hour shifts"
good,was an easy job but some of the managers acted more like children then managers and always was rpoblems at the job from people gossing.
good,It was fun because of my fellow employees. Other than that it was stressful because of my overbearing boss. He was too noisy and wanted to know too much about my business out side of my job it was strange.
good,"I was hired to Close . So I use to come in Help Others serving hot & Ready food , also working in the back Drive-threw (washing dishes)."
good,"although the food is quite well there Wendy's need more friendly people. the environment is not only fast pace but also nerve wrecking. the ""new technology"" always gets shut down out of nowhere and the customer's are barely satisfied."
good,"Typical work day was easy. Management wasn't the nicest or the most helpful, usually if you were new and didn't know how to do something, they basically treated you like you were stupid. Coworkers were very friendly and a close-nit group."
good,Wendys is a good starter job for anyone looking to get their foot in the door. I wouldn't recommend staying there for a long time though. But the food is good!
good,"Long hours with not enough pay, you have no real life outside of work and if in management it comes home with you. The hours are horrible, and the job is totally not worth the pay to deal with the environment and upper management, not sure of the new ones but the lack of care was there previously with the constant changes and unannounced procedure updates."
good,"If you are the type of person to lash out on anyone who looks at you the wrong way this is not the job for you. ""The customer is always right"", even if they are dead wrong. At times when it is very busy it can get stressful but you just have to do the best you can even if you aren't getting the help you need and try to keep a smile on your face. At the end of the day what the customer truly remembers is the service they got. They are going to remember the kind girl in drive thru who made sure they got what they needed."
good,"Great Job, Great Crew, Very Flexible. Low Pay and few advancements. I worked there for three years and I loved the people there and the job itself. It was stressful and chaotic at times, but we learned good team work skills. It was easy to take time off or to get shifts covered. In the three years I worked there I only got one 25 cent raise."
good,When I first started this job was more organized and everybody worked together. Now they expect the same results from a previous years with less staff and more product variations.
good,This job was nice considering where I was in life. If I would have been there longer then maybe they would have gotten a higher rating.
good,"Your standard fast food job. As with most of them, it really depends on your managers and coworkers. If they are rude and uncaring, generally your day and possible advancement will be bleak."
good,This Wendy's was not a very good work place. The general manager of the store was very rude and unruly. The way they treated the employees was very unfair.
good,it was a good experience to work at Wendys I got more experience in fast food by learning how to make all the different items they have.
good,"A day of work is mostly fun, exept when the manager doesn't tell you what you are going to be doing for the day and just lets you do what you want, it sounds fun but it get out of control sometimes leaving some people to do more work than others, I learned that everyone is different and you really get to know someone when you are with them 5x a week and more then your own family, my coworkers are my family."
good,"I didn't like the work at Wendy's because making hamburgers is not something that I wanted to do. However, the team works at the restaurant was good and the manager was kind to me."
good,"Employees hardly ever worked or showed up. Most managers were great, others, not so much. No team work AT ALL. Didn't care much about employees or our opinions."
good,"I learned many great work skills such as, time management, how to properly speak to customers, and working in a system. The managers, however, created poor schedules that were often switched without notice. Fast food work often times requires team-like effort from co-workers, this experience has taught me to be able to communicate and work well with others. Working through a lunch or dinner rush hour was often difficult because of the multitasking and fast paced work environment stress. The most enjoyable part of my job at Wendy's was organizing and keep the store clean and sanitized."
good,Wendy's is a very productive workplace with friendly and welcoming employees. I enjoyed my time at Wendy's and learned most of my customer service skills here
good,A typical day working was easy for me because I knew my routine. I learn from working here that you have to have self control and patience. The management was bad here and really dysfunctional. My co workers here were not as friendly all the time for them to be working in the food service field. The most enjoyable thing about working this job was that I could pick up as many hours as I wanted to the whole time I was there.
good,Overall it was a nice friendly place to work at and a good entry level job. The opportunity for leadership positions were always open to anyone. The job taught me how to lead workers.
good,"a typical day at work started slow and calm, lunch rush would come and the managers all of a sudden didn't care about their employees but only about getting the food out."
good,"A typical work day consist of myself coming into work with a driven mind set to accomplish all tasks at hand, have open availability, assist when needed, and provide a great work experience with co workers."
good,"I would work the cash register, take orders, work drive through window and prepare food. Management was poor. They scheduled me when I told them I was unavailable."
good,I did not like working there. I never felt comfortable there. I just did my job and went home. I was never happy to go to work.
good,"A typical day at wendys was a familiar stress, all the coworkers were nice and funny, every time i showed up everyone got exicted to see me jumping and yelling my name and i barely really talked to anyone. the most hard part about the job was that when coworkers did not show up we had to kind of take half of the shift and rotate but all was ok. my most enjoyable part was the  i got to be part of the late night shenanigans when the lobby was closed down and no cars in drive thru we just talk crazy and laugh for days. my one problem that i had with the work place was that the General Manager was a real 'I Don't Care Type Of Person'  if you were to call  in sick he would tell the shift manager to write the person up, that has happened to me twice and that is one of the reason i decided to leave because he was not a fair person."
good,"Typical work days often ranged from moderately difficult to migraine inducing. Aside from the high traffic periods, the hardest part about work days wasn't the work itself but dealing with the occasional difficult customer or co-worker. Every manager I've worked under in my time employed was very pleasant to work with and I consider them good friends. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with coworkers."
good,"I decided to take a job here because a friend of mine had recommended that I apply. I've learned how to cope with customers who were bent out of shape, hungry, and in a impatient mood. My co-workers were quite positive, we've had very few moments where some of us would argue in the heat of the moment.. which is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part were the good days, where everyone would joke around and get along."
good,"Very good Brand."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's consists of: waiting on customers and taking their orders, preparing sandwiches, bagging food in the drive-through, and stocking up the condiments."
good,"Always busy, not organized enough to keep a shift change simple. The people you work with can become like family and some you don't care for. It's what you make of it."
good,A typical day consisted of coming in and being the first line of contact for customers. Taking their order and providing a friendly welcome. I learned to use a point of sale system. The management was okay but at times could be very controlling and not understanding. Most of the Co-workers we're good but there were a few who just didn't seem interested in doing much work. The hardest part of the job was when a rush of customers would come in all at the same time.
good,"it was a cool job to work at and my co-workers was fun and really cool to work around, the mangers was cool to in very understanding"
good,"A typical day is busy answering multi phone calls and doing eligibility  , faxing , filing , scheduling appointments. Making sure eligibility and schedules are filled, Cleaning up office."
good,Wendys was a good place to work at and also a great place to learn many things about the fast food industry. Great co workers and managers who taught me everything i know.
good,"A typical work day or night for Wendy's was pretty laid back and family orientated,The managers taught me a lot very quickly just by me paying attention and listening. My  Management  was good hearted people always greeting me with a smile and talking and showing me the ropes of my job duties. Good people. My coworkers were more like my friends, they were nice people from the start of my employment. The hardest part about the job was the hours and pay. The most enjoyable part was just talking too people getting too know every one."
good,a good place for a student looking for part time work. no advancement to full time unless been there over a year. was a good work experience but not part time.
good,i love to find something that will be an everyday jkob and not be temporary. wendys was a fast paced job that didnt give anything to the employees suc as lunches or anything else
good,"Work in a shift is almost physical, a bit of mental. I learned & accept that co-workers, supervisors also, sometimes do not consider an individual as human. The pressure that a supervisor imposes an employee to be done with all the works, without considering the load, on busy days, on time is so stressful. It is a very good feeling if a supervisor show appreciation on the efficient performance of duty and give a person the chance to learn a different task, aside from what he/she is doing every shift."
good,A work day is typically fast pace. I learned to manage time to get things done effectively. My managers and co-workers were all great and did just about everything possible to meet team goals. The hardest part of the job was just being patient with difficult customers. I enjoyed getting to meet new people and putting a smile on their face.
good,"My experience with Wendy's Fast Food was pretty good over all. Even though the average pay is minimum wage, it still came up as a good pay check even if I had only worked a maximum of 18 hours per week. "
good,"Just as work starts you are required to prepare for the day by cleaning, making sure everything is stocked, and etc. This job is mostly based in costumer service."
good,"a typical day in my past work is ok and also i learned more things about the product like how to make a salad burger etc. but the management there is not ok for me because any of my co-workers is bullying me angry to me. and the hardest part of my past job is how to associate to my co-workers.and the most enjoyable part of my past job is like i said i know how to make a salad,burger and etc. and also how to mingle other people like foreigner ."
good,"Busy job, enjoyable work place, good management but unfortunately no business growth. Need to achieve sales higher than the company expectation."
good,Usually would show up check out positions and who was working and then went did my routine checking product and making sure everything was stocked. I learned that fast food was not what I wanted to do. The managers were friendly and cared. Some co-workers did not care about anything but themselves and others would help you out if you needed it. The hardest part was everything no matter how many showers still smelled like work. The most enjoyable part was making friendships.
good,"make shift plan"
good,I learned many skills such as how to operate a jack hammer and how to lay concrete. I was 19 or 20 when I working there. I wanted to go to school to learn how to become a welder.
good,"My stay here was short and the period of time I was there the store management was going through some behind-the-scenes turmoil. They let their off-the-clock relationships dictate how things worked within their ranks. While the crew was great and a huge familial unit, a bad manager can run a good crew into the ground. I believe that happened here. While I'm sure after my leave this all may have changed, my stay here was neither an overly positive or negative experience. Just something I look back on as a learning experience."
good,"Good part time job for a student, typical day includes positional tasks/cleaning, very busy lunch rush at my location. As it is my first job, I learned a lot about maintaining a job and what it takes to be an appreciated employee. I've met lots of awesome people that I'll be friends with long time, and also some not so great people, which I'm assuming is the same at any job! The hardest part of the job for me would be the whole concept of fast AND neat, one at a time is a piece of cake, but not so much both during a rush. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with, being around an awesome crew makes the day go by much more enjoyably and smoothly."
good,"This Job was for the most part easy, sometimes difficult to keep up with considering the rush at times. But altogether easy. Management is not bad and the co-workers are nice. The hardest part of the job is having to stay on your feet for hours on end. But the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers smile and knowing you did a good job."
good,"This store is a small business with few employee.  I like work for few    "
good,first job i had. it was ok. i liked the people there. didn't like the job so much always smelled like grease. i worked the cash register
good,"There's little to no benefits and higher management don't often treat you as a person. Fast food jobs are somewhat easy, but dealing with customers can be taxing. Though you need to always be moving and on your feet."
good,"The hardest part of the job is managing the random rushes that flood  the store all at once. At first its hard to remain calm under pressure in trying to complete the orders in a timely fashion, and multi tasking; the till and kitchen. But gradually you find ways to communicate better in order not to cause a slack within the team."
good,Great first job. Show up clean and get ready for the rest of the day. Hardest part is the stress level of a rush. Best part is getting to know the customers and meeting awesome co workers
good,You had to be quick on your toes to get the lines moving. Learned a lot about customer service. Did not have a single issue with management.
good,"Flexible hours,  Too many Chiefs and not enough Indians working there.  Inappropriate actions at this place.  Management need cameras in this place to see what is going on in this Restaurant!"
good,"At the time, I was the sandwich maker so I learn how to make the different type of burgers and meals. I was eventually promoted to also work the grill and stove."
good,"Almost always busy, but on the down time we were always cleaning. Management was unbearable at times, as their frustration was taken out on the employees."
good,"A typical day of work at Wendy's wasn't very typical at all. I define typical as showing up and doing the same thing everyday. However, at Wendy's you could prep food one day and be the cashier the next. You could have a good day or a bad day, depending on one's own stress level. What I learned while working at Wendy's was customer service, safety management, food preparation and Management skills. For the most part, the management at Wendy's were all amazing. There were a few that you may not see eye-to-eye with, but overall they were pretty amazing. The co-workers on the other hand were a different story. I often found myself assigned to do one position and ended up having to do multiple. Some co-workers at times, would just not want to work and they would mess around all day rather than help the store run smoothly. The hardest part of that job was having to deal with people that didn't respect the position they were in. Another hard part was being told I was in line for a promotion only to find out that the new GM didn't approve of my promotion. The most enjoyable part of working at Wendy's was hands down the friends I made. I went in everyday with the attitude of ""Go in, do my part, help those in need and then go home"". Never did I think I would have made lifelong friends in the process."
good,"Some are nice, some are rude, but overall its a fast food job cannot really complain on conditions. By that if you are just going to work fast food, then just work fast food."
good,"Working at wendy's can either be fun, or the be complete opposite. And for me, it depends on the managers you're with. You will have some that are very friendly and are willing to work with you should things come up. Or you can end up with someone who does absolutely nothing, and still blames you for something you didn't do."
good,"Wendy's is extremely flexible when it comes to scheduling. At my store, if you knew an event was coming and you didn't want to work that day all you had to do was request it. The management team is okay. The workers are chatty and ignorant. This is a nice, temporary job. At first it's fun but as time passes the work along with the people become redundant."
good,This was my first fast food job and it was not as hard as people make it seem. It takes a while to get familiar with all the products and how to make the sandwiches but once you get the hang of it it's easy. The crew I worked with was fun but was totally unorganized. People basically made their own schedules showing up and leaving when they wanted. It did make the job hard which is why I left but was still a fun place to work when there was no drama.
good,overall this place is good to work because they always give me flexible hours.i can take off when needed they always care about employees. I have two kids they are very understanding about that.
good,"Food Prep "
good,a typical day working at Wendy's for me consist of cleaning while maintaining a sufficient  amount of meat on the grill. I learned how to cook the hamburgers and make some of the sandwiches. management was decent but could make improvement.
good,Had a hard time communicating with the management about schedule and trying to get it changed. I enjoyed seeing some of the same customers each day
good,"come in in uniform ready to work."
good,"Typical work days were a joke they say I work from this time to this time then make me stay 4 hours longer I was ok with it til it was a daily thing, It was a great learning experiment I did like working there it was fast and fun, my management was a joke they got new ones now so i cant really say youll have the same issues but they wouldnt care about the book unless the head people were there its was a joke I would try doing it the right way then told not to do it that way, my coworkers where like normal coworkers we all worked hard and the best we could it was fun to help each other and work together, the hardest part of the job... thats hard its self it was pretty easy well at the beginning i would say doing fries was hard they were heavy and the oil was hot, the most enjoyable part would be when I got everything right and done on the right time and I loved when I was told how good I was that day or how I could have done batter"
good,"three managers through out they day, one manager per shift who ran they shift all alone very hard work with no help had to deal with customer complaints and run a store sometimes with only two people due to call offs ect."
good,"On a typical day at Wendy's it can get a little busy but that's a good thing employees, managers we all get along as long as we work as a team the objective will be done. the hardest part of the job is making sure everything's perfect now we all make mistake's but hey we are humans its ok at time that's why we learn from it. my enjoyable moments are when we all come ready for the same mission which is do our job and let everything go smoothly and get through the beautiful day."
good,My over all time at this company was enjoyable ; Do to I got what  needed  far as 40 plus work hours and friendly expressive  co- workers . More so good management in that year my life was going well and on track. Now I am looking to grow in a newer with my cooking skills.
good,"Okay place to work for a little while. Managers seem to be a bit lazy. Not much of a say with scheduling. Can get busy with not many workers, so shorthanded."
good,"Not a very close working environment, felt like everything had to be done on your own if you wanted it to get done fast and the right way."
good,"My time at Wendy's was incredibly short. I only had the opportunity to come in maybe 8 times or so, before getting laid off/not getting a call back from my manager about my schedule. A typical workday there is like any other work day at another fast food business, you get assigned a position for the day, and if you have extra time, you help everyone else out. My job was to take money from the customers at the first window in the drive thru, and give change. It was easy, but a little mind numbing. The hardest part of the job was the fact that I didn't always have something to do. Alot of the time, you do end up just standing there, because you finish literally everything there is to do, and it wasn't a busy place. My co workers were worse than expected, well, i shouldn't put it that way. But, atleast 80% of my coworkers didn't know english at the location I worked at. In all honesty, I felt a little alienated, I was literally one of the only people on my shift that knew very little or no spanish, and the people speaking it showed no courtesy or anything. I know it sounds like I'm complaining, but I really am ashamed of the fact that I couldn't even talk to most of my co-workers."
good,This job has a faced pace environment. I learned to utilize staff and product. This job was not very enjoyable. It was more like a high school environment with a lot of drama.
good,I loved my job at wendys because I got to work with numbers. I counted and did the paper work made truck orders and also done the schedule for my crew. keep my store clean and had no violations on my health department check. the hardest part was when we got a new district manager. my co workers and management was fairly good.
good,"Good job to get a foot in the door for Management."
good,A typical day at Wendy's is cleaning my area in the morning. I love meeting new peoples and making conversation. My mangers are super nice and willing to work with you if you don't understand something.
good,"A typical day at work begins with getting to work by 7am and waiting for a manager to get there to let you into the store.  Depending on when the manager got there determined when you could start work. there were then, at most, three hours to stock every fridge, clean all the fryers, clean all the grills, mop and sweep all the floors, make 4 pots of chili, take out the trash, and scrub the drive through.  My coworkers were either very good at any position they were at, or were very slow and just learning the position, there was no in-between.  The hardest part of the day was when the manager let people off early just to save on hours, left 4 people to run the kitchen, and had manager meetings during the busiest part of the day, the lunch rush.  It was my duty to then take customers orders, work with the sandwich maker to get the food bagged up, and hand the customer back their change all while being quick and friendly to the customers at the ordering screen."
good,"A typical day at work would involve clocking in at work and being assigned to my cash draw. Once assigned I began fulfilling all our costumers wants and needs, making sure they're appreciated for coming to our store and leave with smiles. If the lobby,where costumers eat, isn't full or if there is costumers i then have to restock and clean the lobby. At 10 o'clock i close the store and begin moping, restocking, cleaning restrooms, and etc. Management at the store is not so good depending on which manager is on staff. The co-workers our all nice. The hardest part of the job is making sure you fulfill all orders correctly, there should be no mistakes. The most enjoyable about the job is seeing that a costumer is happy."
good,"Great team to work with, very pleasant environment. You go in to work, make everyone orders as best and quickly as possible for customer's experience and satisfaction. The hardest part would be when you receive a cluster big of orders at once."
good,"a typical day would be takig control of the grill, sweeping , moping, filtering the fryer grease, degreasing the floors, and cleaning both grills."
good,"A lot of kneeling and cleaning is required for this job. This job also requires handling cash and loyalty as most jobs do. The stress level is very high working at a fast food restaurant. I'm very friendly and have good relationships with all my co-workers/managers. So i would say you would definitely need to leave your emotions at the door and work as a team; which most employees do not follow. The hardest part of the job is the competitions among the other stores in PEI because the managers want their store to be the best. Therefore they push you to work hard, fast, and accurate all at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job is to connect with my costumers and always seeing them come back."
good,"Working multiple positions, late hours, low pay, no benefits, unprofessional co-workers where the best part of the job."
good,"Not a bad place to work but it isn't a great place to work either. Not clean, Co-workers aren't as capable as one would expect,Hardest part was dealing with the attitudes of the coworkers. Easiest part was the job itself."
good,"I honestly do not like working at Wendy's anymore. I loved it as a teenager but the more older I get, I realize that it is not the work environment that I want."
good,Friendly customers. OK management  could be better. most of the coworkers were friendly and hard working. No aspects of the job were necessarily hard to complete.
good,It was a fun place to work for me because as a kid I had no worries or anything. The people were friendly and I enjoyed the customers most of the times.
good,"I had fun interacting with customers and co-workers and found the day went by quickly."
good,"Just Know When You Come To Work At Wendy's We Do Not Cut Corners To Get The Job Done Right The First Time! A typical day at Wendy's is like any other day. Making the customers and staff feel welcome to be at Wendy's. Satisfactory guarantee when you leave."
good,Theres different positions that you can be assigned to for the day. Yo get trained for all of them when you start working. It is a must to provide the best quality food in a very short amount of time
good,"A typical day at work consisted of keeping my work area clean and stocked, and making sure the customers were satisfied. I learned how to interact with customers much easier and how to work quick but accurate. Management was a little unorganized. Co-workers all worked together to get orders done. The job overall was nothing hard what so ever. Most enjoyable part was putting a smile on the customers face."
good,"A typical day at work for me was to handle the front cash register and to make sure the entire front area and behind the register was spotless, the dining room and bathrooms included.  The hardest part of the job was figuring out each button and making sure not to mess up any of the customers' orders, especially during lunch hour which is the busiest time of the day."
good,"At Wendy's we received a few regular customers when I started working there, when customer complaints happened we managed the situations very well. I learned how to prepare food within a specific amount of time at a fast paced level. The co-workers are respectful and hard working. The hardest part of the job was mopping due to un-level floor surfacing. The easiest part of the job was communicating with our customers and taking their orders."
good,its nice to work there because you get to meet some very nice customers
good,"This company is a great company to work for. The food is always top of the line for fast food when it comes to being fresh and tasting good. The co-workers for the most part are fun, loving people to be around, although the management could be way better."
good,"A typical day at Wendys consisted of food preparation, completing customer orders, and making the customers feel appreciated."
good,"A typical day at work would be be : "
good,"Very busy restaurant. U never have nothing to do. Fun to work there. Good food to serve costumers ,also fun to make there day."
good,"Wendy's is a good starter job for someone trying to learn the ropes in customer and food service, but not something you would want to do for the rest of your life. Depending on where you work will depend on your experience. My Wendy's was located in a difficult area, and provided many stressful situations in the general feel of safety. I enjoyed the time with my co-workers and management, but over all, I never felt safe."
good,the food was always fresh and the customers were always the same. it was great for kids. since it was next to the school the store helped them a lot with the fund raisers
good,"Will not work around a school schedule, you have to work around their schedule"
good,The company is somewhere you start as a crew member and can move up to gain some experience to bring elsewhere.
good,It was a nice place to work but i wood never stay for a life job if i could help it. It help me know the work place and get a grip on how the work place works behind the seance .
good,"A typical day at work involves opening/closing the restaurant (a process which typically takes about two hours). The environment is extremely stressful and fast-paced, to the point employees were often explicitly forbidden from taking bathroom breaks during peak hours. Management can be flexible and fun to work with, however are faced with tremendous pressure to cut costs and improve performance, often at the cost of employee well-being. Co-workers are sure to be varied in skills and personality, ranging from young students to elderly men and women. The hardest part of the job can be making sure customers are happy and satisfied with the product. This said, when the customers are happy, it can be a rewarding experience."
good,"It's was fine. This job gave me alot of experience.It's a really fast plays ,and really stressful, but it's halp me allot"
good,"You don't do anything fancy. Cook the patties, make the sandwiches or work the cash register. I learned time management skills and how to work fast and efficiently. Management where nice but expected quality work. The hardest part of the job was the lunch and dinner rushes. i enjoyed the people that worked there the most."
good,"A typical day at work entails working in different areas of the store. I spend the majority of my day either taking order on front counter, taking orders on drive, or collecting money for drive. On occasion, I have gotten to work the grill. Through out the majority of time the one thing that I have learned how to analyze people much better than I was able to before. Working in fast food has also taught me that if you work hard and persevere that you will ultimately reach your goals."
good,The management training team was really well rounded. However there was no chance of any further advancement.
good,"Working the front counter taking orders from the diner"
good,"Very busy, fast-paced, workplace. There was really never a chance to take a break."
good,Helping to prepare food and cashier services. Typical Fast food restaurant.
good,"Typically opening crew arrives around 7:30 am. Opener 3 (Prep person) is required to prepare all of the needed condiments for the sandwich station, salad ingredients, and any additional requirements for current ""Limited time offers"", before the store opens at 10 am. After open, crew members work operational positions - such as drive-thru, front cash, or sandwiches - until approximately 2 pm. At this time the prep person is pulled off the service line to rebuild the condiment needs for dinner, rebuild salads, and chop lettuce for the next days business."
good,"I always got scheduled outside of my suggested hours."
good,"If it wasnt for the constant struggle between franchisers, and corporate wendys could be so much better."
good,My days at work go by fast and i enjoy working with my co-workers
good,"A typical day involved making sandwiches, cooking hamburger patties, cooking fries, and serving customers. Manager were nice."
good,"As a shift supervisor I hold responsibility of closing the store at night. Included in an average day is ensuring stocking has been completed, goals are met when it comes to time, as well as leaving the store clean and ready for opening."
good,"A typical day at work was getting all the prep for the day together, setting up the sandwich stations. Also stocking up product for the day where needed. Ive learned how to have work in a fast pace but still keep cleaniness. Learned how to always keep a professinal additude with the customers. Hardest part of my job was to run two to three different stations all at once. The enjoyable part of my job was knowing I was feeding people that were hungry."
good,"es una buena empresa tuve la oportunidad de hacer diferentes cursos sobre manejo de personal, atencion al cliente, seguridad de los aliemntos.. "
good,"The managemtn division above me was way to hard on everybody. She only thought about herself, so I left the position"
good,"Typical fast food job. Not a dream job by any means but it's easy work. "
good,I worked a lot during my last year in high school an average student is supposed to work 20 hours and I was working 40-45 a week. I wouldn't get off until one or two in the morning and the food industry just isn't for me.
good,I really did like my managers at the time. really good work environment everyone got along.
good,I was a little over worked but I continued to work hard even though i felt that way.
good,"At the particular Wendy's in which I worked there was a number of underage workers which were at some points difficult to keep focused. I learned great customer skills, enjoyed entering in all the financial information, including helping other managers find and fix mistakes in the computer. I also learned how to adapt my manager skills to deal best with the different type of personalities people exhibited. The most enjoyable part of the job besides the paperwork was dealing with the customers, along with the fact that I was constantly learning new things and helping the General manager. Most of my co-workers were amazing, which brings me to the hardest part of the job another manager who displayed improper work behavior on a daily bases (verbally abusive to the other employees to the point where service suffered because everyone was to scared to say anything about her)."
good,"it was in ok job for the time being co-worker ok management fine, umm it was job"
good,"I had a great experience working at Wendy's, it was a great way for me to have some income while still in high school and I learned a lot"
good,"Fast paced during rush, slow during normal days at Woodstock but at Shallowford it was a constant non stop rush all day everyday. Work fast with no mistakes. Closing is the hardest part. Opening is the best enjoyable day. My management was strict but hard working, makes for a great teacher. Co-woker's flucuated."
good,"The job was enjoyable, just no raise and I worked there a year and two months."
good,"There are good and bad days just like any other work place.  However, they go through store managers every 6 months.  Offer good benefits and good starting pay for the crew.  They do not offer advancement for their current managers, they hire outside people instead of promoting."
good,collect orders collect money give change and give orders and make orders if needed
good,"clock in and get what needs to be done stock up everything "
good,Wendy's was an alright first time job. Fast food was never a career option so I did everything possible to excel so I could  find better.
good,"never run correctly. when ideas were mentioned it was always a no."
good,a typical day at work i will go in have a huddle with my crew and make sure everyone is on top of there game. then i will carfully watch and make sure that everyone is following procedure my co- workers are always happy when i come into work. the hardest part is the cutting of hours we have had and my favorite part is when we get busy and the time goes by so fast.
good,Wend'ys is a good starting job for a lot of young people but after a little while working there you start to notice the drag and why its better for younger people who are still in high school.
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity to work for Wendy's. However, I am just not getting a steady schedule and do not currently make enough."
good,"Wendy's was an excellent place to interact with different customers and meet new people. Excellent customer service is something I excelled at when working there. I learned working their was although a customer may approach the counter with an attitude, I had the opportunity to change their day around with a smile and great service. "
good,"Go in count your till, assist the customers in ordering their food, if they were dining in making sure they enjoyed their meals and our services. I learned patience. The manager was very sarcastic and will down talk her employees. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the dining room area in a timely matter."
good,"Wendy's was one of my first jobs ever. It was a challenge for me as I am a reserved individual. Liked the work, didn't care too much for the people or drama. After a few months I ended up quitting due to too much racial slurs, drama, and rude behavior. Not to mention I had all that to handle at school. (still in high school at the time)"
good,"Once you get in you can stay in, but you cannot expect good pay at any point. Usually you can talk your way into having hours that work, but they would schedule me for 10 hour shifts with no breaks. For a fast food job it is good, but it is a fast food job."
good,"-Long hours "
good,"I am very happy with Michaels,,, I would stay if I could keep my hours,, my new management is not making this possible,, I cannot work 4 hour shifts when I live so far away from work,, gas is just to expensive and without a full time job it is not worth staying."
good,well sometimes it depends some days are really slow and others is really busy and can have a rush from 9pm to 12 am. The management is good but I think it would need a little work. some of my coworkers do help when we have a rush others not so much. and the hardest part of the job is when we have a rush at closing time and we have only from 2 to 3 people.
good,"I believe the only reason I stayed was thanks to my fellow co-worker. But I also set an example to make sure that they would follow it. Though management above me was hard to deal with, and plenty of time I had to cover their lack of work. I didn't mind because my former employees (my A-Team) worked right along side me, and I worked along side them"
good,"This job was okay, I mean the managers weren't the best, but they aren't the worst.  I feel like they could change the managers around and put more of a stronger management team together.  My coworkers were nice.  The work is not hard, some coworkers just need to understand and learn what the word JOB means.  The hours were okay, but lazy coworkers should not have better hours than the workers who actually did their job."
good,"A day at work I came into the store prepared for open by getting the staff assigned to where they were working (Ex. Grill, Cashier, Front counter). Got the Tills set up for myself and the cashier. Prepared the store for close at night, after the store was clean, employees went home, I counted the tills and safe, entered the nightly paperwork, submitted the deposit to the bank. Management was lacking above me , employees didn't always fallow all of the rules and wouldn't get called on it. I was not in a high enough position to write employees up for violating rules, only able to tell my manager, who would only enforce the rule if it'd became and issue."
good,"Its very fast paced and management let you do your own thing. I learned that not everyone is a people person but you just have to  try to handle them the best you can. Management was very unorganized, hardly ever noticed. The hardest part would have to be trying to stay organized when your manager walks out. The most enjoyable part would have to be the people I worked with. They made shifts go by quickly."
good,This is a great job if you would like to have extra money in your pockets. Not to hard.
good,"made hamburger cleaned floors"
good,"the GM is awful, barely knows how to run the place"
good,"Prepping Salads, Working The Grill & Fries,, It Was Certainly Hot . All We Needed To Make Things Work Was Team Work, Most Cases We All Worked Together Well . Fast Food Is Not Something I'd Like To Get Back Into Because Its Usually Part Time Meaning You Will Not Get Many Hours . Also You work With Lots Of Teenagers . It Is Enjoyable To See Customers Walk Away Satisfied ."
good,"Fast food jobs have a reputation of being intrinsically horrible.  It was my experience that it's the customers who make it so (ex: spitting on me, calling me stupid and other, less-appropriate things, and flat-out mocking me).  The hours really suck if you're not at the top for the 9-5 positions."
good,"My typical day at work, clock in get on bagging/fry station then when on break either counter or drive-thru.  I've learned to deal with money as I dealt with customers.  I've managed to be a good worker & help others as much as I could.  My co-workers were okay.  The hardest part of my job was when being alone to do multiple things at once.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working on a flexible schedule."
good,"Not a bad gig if you are a cashier "
good,"I supervised and made sure everyone was ON TIME, with opening the store before 10:30. "
good,As a young man it showed me how to work with others and gave me a great since of responsibility moving forward in life. I mostly enjoyed just having a job and working with others with the same attitude .Hardest part was leaveing and losing touch with my crew
good,They never taught me anything that I wanted to be taught. They had kept me in the same position and when I wanted to learn something new it was always a problem. They co-workers was pretty nice but the managers was not.
good,I do not take pride in this job. It is good for a starter but not for long term success. I am a well ethical co worker/employee. Reliable and resourceful. Ive learned to always keep an eye on your goals even though where you are might not be exactly where you want to be. I ve learned to deal with MANY different attitudes and personalities. Ive come to enjoy the company of my fellow co workers. I enjoy clocking out mostly. There isnt anything hard about it.
good,Ive learned how to work as a team with other employees and have fun at the same time. How to run a register and handle some customer issues. Keeping a neat and clean appearance and working environment. Also how to make sure everything is at the right temperature and appearance for customers.
good,"company you work hard for and put time in all for only a ten cent raise, wasted my time & deff was not worth it"
good,"a typical day at work consists of: Dropping chicken, learning how to work with different people and how to get them to work together in a fashion that is productive to the company, speaking to a customer, learning new tactics and sandwich combinations daily."
good,"It was an okay job. Not a whole lot of room for advancement. Managers were nice. A very hectic, fast paced job at times."
good,not a good career well managed and good stater job very well ran comapny
good,Worked long hours amd had short breaks. Manager are ok but are not team players.
good,I did enjoy wendys but i wish that they would be a bit more cleaner.I did all the cleaning I could but it was never enough.
good,There isn't much to say about it except that it is a fast food job. That sums it up for you right there. It is great for people getting their first jobs.
good,My typical day at work was assisting customers. I learned how to adapt to working with many different customers. My coworkers were easy to get along with and we work as a team. The management was great. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
good,"Okay environment to work in"
good,"easier work/life balance, will work with you to a point, not a whole lot of flexibility, hated all the drama, I wondered who was the main manager in charge when the gm was there."
good,A typical day of work changes from day to day. I am in various positions every day. I enjoy my coworkers and my my absolute favorite part is working with customers. Another nice thing about the job is there is always something to do and I am able to stay busy throughout my whole shift which makes the the day go by so much faster.
good,"Wendy's is a great place to work at, if you don't have rude management because that makes thing alot more stressful than it already is."
good,Being able to move up is the best part. The discounted food is also swell.
good,I enjoyed the customers a lot. I also enjoyed working with the people I worked with. I didn't like the supervisor. He was only there one day a week and was always putting myself and my other co-workers down even when they were doing the job as they were trained to do it.
good,"Working at wendys was a greta expierence ,most of the people was fun and great to work with."
good,a typical day at wendys is stressful and there dose not seem to be much communication between managers and managers and employees.
good,"employee schedules / daily site meetings / daily tool / equipment inventory-inspection-tags / log books"
good,"A typical day at work for me is working front register. I've been told I am really bubbly and nice, which makes me perfect for working with some of our most valuable customers. I learned the key factors to building a close, strong realtionship with both my customers as well as fellow employees, and built a strong bond and friendship between all my managers. I also learned how to work in a fast and slow paced environment and how to maximize my time on duty. My management is very nice and lenient, which makes the day sail by and easy to resolve any issues that may arise. My coworkers and I are extremely close. A few have even made point to seek me outside of work to spend quality time or vent about life's frustrations. The hardest part of the job is the end of the day, when we close, for I can't greet any more customers with a huge smile and friendly face. The second hardest would be dealing with an angry customer if the order was somehow messed up. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting customers and hearing about their day, as well as taking their orders, big or small."
good,"I did somewhat enjoy working there, but the supervisors got mad at me easily for mistakes that I was making because I was still new. When you work less than 5 hours, you only get a 10 minute break and if you are even a minute late back you are yelled at. They expected me to know how to do things after only being shown once. I did however enjoy my coworkers; they were nice for the most part, and would sometimes help when I needed it. What I hated was whenever I had to close the dining room, they had me do it by myself after I only closed with others once then got mad because I took a while to do what should apparently only take a half hour. The tasks were: to restock the condiments/ remove the ketchup, vacuum/ mop, bathrooms, etc. And when they fired me, the reason that they gave was that ""I was not a good fit for the job, as it takes a specific type of person to work there"", and they did it in front of my coworkers, in the middle of the work day. I would recommend not even bothering trying to work for them."
good,The managers were very strict and sometimes rude. But this is one of the cleanest restaurants ever.
good,"A typical day at work started at 5 a.m. and didn't end until 5 p.m. or later.  I constantly had to put up with employees coming to work late or not coming in at all.  Several mornings, I had to open the store by myself because the employees didn't come in.  It was very frustrating working there - the employees were more concerned with gossiping or being on their cellphones than taking care of the customers and didn't care how they conducted themselves or what they said in front of our customers.  It didn't help having managers who didn't care. As a result, our sales went down.  I actually had several customers tell me that they wouldn't come to the restaurant if I wasn't there and I'm not saying this to be bragging.  I really enjoyed the job in the beginning, but the last three years made me reach the point where I didn't want to be there anymore, and it was due to the management (no support) and employees working there.  I put in 12+ hours a day, and my relationship with my partner ended because of all of the hours I worked."
good,Fast pace environment but it helped the time fly. The employees did not really mind helping newcomers.
good,Working in  Wendy's I was able to gain a few friends within the staff of the organization and also gain knowledge of food handling. Also working in this organization I learned that cleanliness and perfect service is of most importance next the organization of shipment of the product being sold. I was really able to see my work satisfy the costumer. Knowing that I did my job right helped someone else have a better day that makes everything ok.
good,"I was to do a lot through my day there, take care of customers, clean, stock, handle money, cook and etc. It taught me that nothing goes how it seems, there are stressful days and there are good days. The management was bad however, worked 9 hours straight and no breaks, they would yell and blame what happened on employees."
good,I always enjoyed going into work but just some things aren't being run like they should be.
good,I would go to work and open the line and get the food prepped and work the line while open for service. Maintain ticket times and food safety regulations. Maintain clean work area while taking orders in drive thru. There was really a hard part of the job it was pretty basic and easy to do. I loved working along side a group of like minded people eager to serve the customers.
good,"I had A lovely experience working at the Wendy's in Welch, Wv, however they could certainly benefit from honest management and less drama!"
good,"I worked here for about 3 years. Mind you, I was 16 when I started. The management is wonderful and wants you to come to work with a good attitude and have a fun time. No one ever wants to work fast food....it's hot, miserable and the customers are NEVER happy. But at wendys, the work place was always happy and I was always in a good mood when I was there. Although they don't pay the best, remember....you are making fast food. It's not a hard thing to do. What's hard, is finding a place that you honestly enjoy to work at."
good,"It is a growing and productive place to work. Easy to get along with all employees and managers.A typical day at work will start out as cutting and chopping lettuce to make salads.Make salads and put them up in the salad cooler. Clean the Kings Cutlet, the sink area where I cut the lettuce,sweep and mop the area, than go on break. After break I will warm junior buns and put them on line as well premium buns. Prepare every order right as it is ordered until it is time for me to get off.  In between preparing orders I keep my station stock with condiments and other supplies that will be needed to make sandwiches, salads, and baked potatoes.  "
good,"Ive been working for wendys for the past 6 years and have not gotten any benefits nor raises besides the ones that were made by the government. The place just got new owners, fired my other bosses that I got a long with really well made wendys into a family, and it just has changed a lot. It is a better place cleanliness and customer wise but it has been very stressfull. I have pulled through as hard as I can, I just feel they don't see my full potential. They haven't even considered promotion for me and they just don't over all treat the staff very well. So im kind of over this job and am looking for another."
good,take costumer order bagging their food and greet them as they walk in the door and keep the area clean. It was ok..
good,made food and took orders from customers as a crew worker. when i was a assistant manager i opened and closed the store ordered food through distribution center. also had to do daily deposits and count the drawer 3 times a day. also got certified as a sparkle restaurant for 5 years.
good,The hardest part is being on your feet from 5pm-2am and only for minimum wage. For the most part it was an okay job with an okay pay. 
good,"Wendy's was my first job as a teenager. It was an easy job to get and then to keep because people were always quitting or getting fired. If you were the least bit dedicated or responsible you were guaranteed a position indefinitely. I learned on the job and that proved to be a valuable skill, however that was because proper training wasn't always an option. If they were short-staffed they would throw me into a position that needed filled with little to no training, often during a busy period of the day. This was stressful and led to mistakes and customer complaints. We were asked to come in for extra hours to clean before an inspection, which I always volunteered for. The cleaning would have to be rigorous, though, because regular maintenance of the store was rarely done. Some of the cleaning was pretty disgusting and had it not been for my apron and boxes of rubber gloves I don't think I would have stuck around for it. The managers were hypocrites who would smoke in the back office or steal food and then yell at the employees for doing the same. Having been offered a position as a manager I knew that they were underpaid, so I understand the discontent. However they were poor leaders and the store suffered because of that."
good,"If you are into fast food restaurants , Wendy's is the place to go."
good,This was an average fast food company. We work hard for no advancement.
good,Not a place really to want to work at. The management really was poor.
good,"i had to clean up, clean up, and clean some more...Why am i writing a review about them for my resume???"
good,"This job was very busy mainly because it's a fast food restaurant. To work in that environment was great. We get a discount on food, the hours we're pretty good. The staff was also great to work with and also very fun."
good,"I managed the cash register, cleaned the lobby, stocked up the front area as well as the lobby. I also cooked fries, made shakes and salads "
good,Place is a fun place to work but when it gets challenging it's not worth for what is being paid. Great job security hours are very flexible!
good,It was an ok job just wasnt enough pay to do most of the duties that are required.
good,"Coming to work at Wendy's was like being a marathon runner. Show up for work, take the shift from the previous Mgr. and start running with. Very high volume and fast pace. And Wendy's guests are demanding. This was probably the most challenging job I've ever had."
good,"A typical day at work for me was simple. I completed all my tasks and duties some days would take longer than others because they would add on more things for me to do."
good,I would come in and sign on to my register and begin taking orders. I learned a little more about customer satisfaction and how to be helpful and increase profits. My co-workers weren't very helpful most times because of being understaffed. The hardest part of the job was having to make up for what others weren't doing. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and being able to help them have a good experince at my Wendy's. 
good,Although I have enjoyed many aspects of Wendy's I would like to move into a customer service position with a professional environment with a stable schedule.
good,"	Manage team of  5-10 crew members on a daily basis to strive and exceed all goals."
good,"The job itself was a good job for a fast food place. The only thing that made work a bad day was when we had gotten the new GM. When he started he wanted to run Wendys like he was working at his old store. He was very disrespectful to all of the crew. I had left that job because for the amount of time I worked there they had said they would hire me at a certain pay and did not. I brought it to their attention, they had said they were going to raise it and never did. They also were cutting back my hours."
good,"This is a good in-between jobs place to work. Not that it is bad in anyway, work is work, but as far as thinking long-term for family oriented goals some better compensation is needed."
good,Co workers are  great and easy to get along with. Customers not so great.
good,"the typical work day would be as one signs into work u begin your designated task immediately. "
good,"Great Job for Students. Fast Pace, easy learning environment, closes at a decent hour of the night "
good,"On a normal day I take orders from the customer and I smile constantly. I have learned that making contact with the customer is key! Managment is a joke! I love the people that I work with, well most of them. The hardest part of the job would have to be closing. I love the part of the job where I get to interact with the customer and kind of find out how their day is going."
good,you will be working at a fast food place. the hours were all right but could be better
good,You get to meet all kinds of people.
good,"A typical work day consists of meeting all of your customers needs while completing the tasks delegated by your superior or manager. Depending on your position they may involve dining room maintenance (front counter register operator), stocking and dishwashing (drive thru cashier/operator), equipment and fry maintenance (grill operator), salad prep and condiment station setup (sandwich maker), or cash management and task delegation while including some minor paperwork(management team.) One thing I learned at Wendy's is the importance of the customer's perspective with or without actually interacting with you. All it takes sometimes is one customer to see a member of your team acting like a jerk to convince them that no one working in your restaurant has or ever will care about the service they provide to their guests. This kind of reaction can LITERALLY clear a lunch hour. So always remember to be friendly and polite. Your work ethic is a reflection of how much you care about doing a great job, and in the long run of how much you care about your future being involved within a company. So don't go running around acting like an idiot just because you see your coworkers doing it. Have some self respect and never hesitate to be constantly aware this is your well being at stake. Honestly, the hardest part of working at Wendy's for me was the constant rat race of maintaining a good pace lower than the drive thru time. That, and maintaining patience with customers who may act rude. However, at the same time one of the things I loved the most was the customer service. It really makes"
good,i would work ten hour a day and drive 40 miles ther and home but i liked my work the crew when sent to a new store where just set in ther way and didny want you to tell them anything which made it hared for me to do my job and one day i got feed up ang quit i didnt think about what i was doing and regreet its but its too late know guess we learn form our mistakes.
good,I learned that working in both industries is challeging and each is stressful but in different ways.
good,"Not a bad place to work at. fast working place , keeps you busy . time managment ."
good,"My co-workers made my job harder than what it was. Seeing that the company was private owned is what i believe made the work experience terrible. We were short of staff, all the workers were family so they felt inclined to believe they did not have to work. I learned more safety procedures, how to help profit the company, while increasing my customer service skills. Management was horrible. They were never in position to oversee what the employees were doing wrong and i was tought the correct way of working by another employee who was not a trainer."
good,Great place to start working to gain a sense of responsibility. Very unique working experience dealing with all sorts of customers. The hardest part would be pleasing customers with a limited number of workers
good,The customers make my night. Everything about the job is easy. I am not challenged everyday.
good,i worked here almost three years and it is an okay place to work but management can be rude to you and you do not get recognized for the hard work you do .
good,"Dont get me wrong, Wendys is a nice place to work, but I worked there for a year, never received my W-2 form for 2011, and was kept at 7.25 an hour, never had a performance eval that was detailed in the orientation. For the amount of effort which had to be exerted towards working here at times, Wendys could put more effort into satisfying employees as well as the customers. I know people who worked there over 5 years near my same pay. Lastly, the Wendys I worked at seemed to focus more on hiring more people and less on using the resources they already have. Too many people too few hours too assign them."
good,fast food.
good,"The peple there didnt act like they wanted to be there. Everyone was just rude and hateful and i wish to not work there again,"
good,"Working at Wendy's was extremely hard because they did not want to work around my school schedule given that I was in high school at the time. I had to fight to get my hours to even being below 30 hours a week during the school year. I appreciate that working at Wendy's helped me with time management, working more efficiently and getting tasks done ina quick efficiently."
good,"A typical day at work was about 5-6 hours. Managers yelled, rather than communicate calmly. Co-workers were great. Things would get a little tense during the very busy parts of the day, but it was pretty much one big family. The restaurant is very young minded. No one else wants to work there but young kids who need a first time job. That's their problem. The hardest part of the job was staying on your feet for hours at a time. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers. Some people are just so nice."
good,"unfair never wanted to give vacation in 4 years there. the coworkers in the management dept were unfair ,the rest of the staff were fun to work with."
good,made sandwiches maintenance cleaning did alot about nasty floors
good,I loved this job. I love fast paced environments and made a lot of friends along the way. I was trained properly on everything!
good,"Its okay, not the worst, but defiantly not the best. Its pay well, if you are able to get a nice amount of hours. A typical day at work, might be really busy or might be really slow, its never really in between. The managers are pretty cool, real understandable. The co-workers are okay, I guess it just depends in each person because I have some pretty rude co-workers. The hardest part of the job will probably be remember everything on the menu, and being able to answer questions about the food. The most enjoyable part of the job will defiantly have to be pay day."
good,worked in drive thru. the co workers were great to work with.
good,"Started Work at 5 PM. Counted my Money. Made sure the tables were cleaned, started taking food orders. My day ended at 1am, made sure dinning area was cleaned, counted money and went home. Co- workers were fine to work with, manager was fine to work with. The hardest part of my job was when I had to work drive-thru, I had a hard time multi-tasking."
good,"I worked here while in high school and I really dont remember much about it, being as though this was over 13 years ago"
good,i go to work give 100 % helping where it was needed wheather it was customer service helping new employees or doing what managers needed most of the time without being asked
good,"Run register, do dishes, the managers were easy to get along with"
good,"managed up to eight employees, made sure money was put into safe through out day. I treated customers like family."
good,easy to work.
good,Low Wages and Hard Work. Poor Managers who dont know what to do. Dealing with complaing customers and their issues while trying to help others get in and out asap
good,"This was my first job I had so far, and I've stayed with this employer for almost 6 years. The reason why i chose to not leave this job was because I've enjoy working with everybody and I love what I do everyday even though there's some days that doesn't go right. I've learned so much from this job on team work! Especially when there's alot of customer. My boss and the supervisor always depend on me on certain things they want to be done. It's hard work, but if I know how to manage my time then I will be done by the end of the day. I get along well with all of my co worker, and I believe that to be able to have a successful work place is for everybody to get along. The hardest part of the job is working on a shift that are short handed, because there would be extra work on busy days. Other then that there's nothing so hard after all. It really depend on the person if they're willing to be committed in a job even if it's just a fast food job, because it is a JOB. The most enjoyable part of the job is finishing my duties by the end of the day."
good,"Partial, compamny wasa a great start up job. Good peers and Managers were fair."
good,The people I worked with were awesome. I would recommend this job to younger people that dont mind working hard.
good,I open and clean all the equipment to get it ready for the busy day ahead. On any given day you are moved around so you should always bee on your toes.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's I worked with very friendly coworkers, the job was not very stressful but it was very busy. Everyone shifted to assist which made the job easier."
good,"I had opportunities to learn new things on a daily basis. I learned scheduling, inventory, daily financial balances/deposits. I particularly enjoyed training new employees and the hours were flexible for my family/home life."
good,Work is always stressful when one is working for a fast food restruant it will always be fast pace and demanding and stressful.
good,"A typical day at Wendys is fast paced but never challenging. Working fast and with people is my thing so I felt right at home. Management did prove to be an issue, with one person telling me one thing and something else from the next. My co-workers were friendly and very nice, no complaints at all. The hardest part of the job was getting the many types of sandwiches down correctly. The part about the job I liked the most were my co-workers. They made me feel right at home!"
good,"A typical day at Kroger was fast paced but never challenging. Working fast and with people is my thing so I felt right at home. Management did prove to be an issue, with one person telling me one thing and something else from the next. My co-workers were friendly and very nice, no complaints at all. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management about my work schedule. The part about the job I liked the most were my co-workers. They made me feel right at home!"
good,"Working at Wendy’s was an experience. Before working in food services I didn’t expect much from it, overall it became pretty fast paced which was a great thing."
good,I was going to make a documentary about my work with a friend of mine showing my everyday life at wendy just to found out there really is no change just a typical day. Manager give all they have to put in labor at wendys but staff seem to bore at time. To me developing people skills was a key component of a job. Hard times only came when we got busy and you are use for things you can do with your eyes close. My job would be enjoyable only if we all knew TEAM WORK!!!!
good,"Wendy's is a good job if you're are someone who needs some extra cash or a college student if you don't expect to become a manager or higher. You deal with different types of customers and it can be hectic if the shift is busy. So long as everyone is working together, everything can go great but there is always an employee who wants to do things differently. The hardest part of the job is being a crew member working multiple stations such as both operating the grill and setting up the fry station if it is a busy shift. The most enjoyable part is the experience you gain after performing a difficult task."
good,"My experience at this job, you had to learn to be a team player. Customer service was a must and I had to learn how to prepare the sandwiches according to the menu. Mostly I had to prepare the sandwiches how the customer wanted it. I learn to be good team player and work with others on a daily basis. The management was okay. My co-workers were good people to work with sometimes I had to assist them and they helped me when I had a lot of customers to prepare orders for. The hardest part of the job was to keep smiling when you really did not want to. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the customers were happy with their orders."
good,Great place to work while attending college. Managment is great. Customers are wonderful.
good,"A typical day at work while at Wendys consisted of me doing every job in the store. I would cook, clean the bathrooms and restaraunt area, do drive through and front cashier. This job kept me on my feet at all times. I learned that I would liek to work at a place that has me doing a steady job and not every single position in the store. The management here was rather odd. They would let the workers do whatever they liked and would just go back in their quarters and relax. I did not enjoy this job."
good,"I liked working here because it was always a challenge. The hardest part of the job was having to calm down irate customers, however I did calm them down every time. I would make sandwiches and manage the crew. I also rang up people's orders."
good,"having a job you learn , how to greet people , good customer service and more . some times the mangers are rude or just not having their days, but you have to just keep moving and keep working . the most enjoyable thing to me is when you get a happy customer , and sometimes they would joke around."
good,not my favorite. everyone argued.employees fought all the time. bad hours.
good,The prodictivity was high and it was fun to challenge yourself daily. The crew worked great together but the manager was less than .oticeable when the employees needed a pat on the back.
good,i have learn to work with the cusmoters in a friendly matter im a manager at wendy's the most enjoyable thing i love about my job is making the cusmoters happy at all times
good,"Many people consider fast food restaurant jobs to be easy, until they find themselves in one."
good,Here I began to know and learn what customer service is and how to give a good or great experience to the customer
good,"didn""t work there long but would be a good starting job. short breaks, short lunches, fast paced, great customer service, some rude comments from management"
good,A typical day at work:
good,"The typical day at Wendy's consist of coming to work, doing inventory of all the found and account for all the money in the registers. During closing, we clean the restaurant and prepare things for the morning shift."
good,Nice and friendly environment with joyful co-workers.
good,A typical work day is coming in greeting customers and make sure they get their food quick and their order is complete and accurate. The job is not hard. The most enjoyable part is when you are bust and their is no down time. Co-workers and management are one in the same and that's about all I can say to describe them.
good,A typical day at work consisted of morning food preparations and the afternoon rush. I worked 7 am to 2pm. I learned that timing is an essential of being a successful employee within a fast paced job. The management was not the greatest and most of my coworkers were rude to me because I was the new kid on the block so to speak. The hardest part of the job was the afternoon lunch rush because it was very easy to get behind yourself. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to interact with the customers.
good,the management felt it was okay to share personal information about other employees with co-workers
good,"I am thrown from position to position. I learned to have a good work ethic, but the stress tore me apart. Working eight to nine hours a days, I received 30 minute break, but most of the time, i would have to run back and cram something down my mouth between orders. The hardest part of the job is standing in the same place for hours without a lunch break or a bathroom break. The stress just tore me apart. My favorite part of the job is meeting some awesome people."
good,"It was hard for me to work there because i was in 10th grade when i started there. I was good at my job and was working 40 hours a week and going to school it was impossible to keep up with every thing that i need to do. I tried to cut back my hours , but the manage there at the time wouldnt go for it so i just quit."
good,Working here wasn't bad. However the turnover rate was huge.
good,"The schedule was never available when I needed it, it was a alright job beside the schedule would not work there because not enough people or people didn’t show up"
good,I am so happy that I get to do this. it was a very fun job just you don't get paid anything and its awful. anyways I hated being in there and i would smell super gross.
good,More breaks for the closers 8-9hr shifts no break I mines well go work in the warehouse get paid more and breaks ...............................................
good,No comments just need to improve on Management and Benefits for Starting Worker and better training and more Paid better Schedule and more punctuality on their shif always Calling Off
good,"I would open up and load all the ice coolers, restock the cups, sauces and kid's meal bags."
good,This was my first job when I turned 16 and I had left each summer for my other job for the Boy  Scouts of America. in 2018 we had gotten new owners who were not supportive and fully against the idea of working for the Boy Scouts of America so I had quit and have not gone back.
good,It wasn't that bad it just seemed they hired a lot of young people and some of the people I worked after would leave a mess for the next shift to clean
good,"A fairly decent job; however, in most states you will be paid $7.25 an hour with zero chance of a raise or advancement. Only reason I quit! I trained my managers only to never be compensated with a raise or promotion."
good,Management was somewhat unprofessional at times  I enjoyed working with my coworkers. We would always life each other’s spirits and enjoy our time working together.
good,Being laid off from current position and even with the culture not being as family friendly as it used to be I would still consider coming back to work from them.
good,"It was my first job, it was only a part time minimum wage job in fast food. I worked harder and did more then the managers while yet they got paid more and took all the credit for good timers and clean store. It taught me that I have a high work ethic and like to get the job done."
good,"Prepared nuggets, fries, made sandwiches, kept kitchen area clean, fixed orders, cleaned inside of store. Never got a break though. Wish I got more hours."
good,"The staff treats each other like they’re one big happy family. Of course there’s some days where some people are off, but for the most part, they’re all almost always in a good mood and are very positive."
good,So the crew is mainly friendly but most of the managers walk around not doing anything and also most in my experience were very disrespectful and combative they speak to you like you're a child curse at you and nit-pick with you to the point ive seen several coworkers quit becasue of such behaviors
good,I havent worked here for too long but was moved up to management rather quickly due to a few changes going on. it's fast food so you really can't expect much. It's hard work for low pay. The owners are absolutely fantastic and the nicest people you will ever meet. The employees are super nice if not a little much some times. The one i work at is clean and constantly changing with new stuff being added all the time to the mnue.
good,"it was small working space, and training was slacked off"
good,"I became really good at this job, it made it tolerable working for long periods of time, as I normally did. I met some amazing people. Corporate sucks, but that is general for all of the food industry. I stayed for a while, but eventually, it was time to move on."
good,This place can be good to work for if only managers were all in together and even the DM. Lack of communication is a lose of a good employee who has done a lot for the company no matter what.
good,I didnt like the job for me Im not into fast food restaurant so i was not my best at the job but i tried my best to do what I have to do there. I’ve learned that we have to be on point with what we have to do.
good,"A typical day at work was fast-paced, usually with plenty of tasks to be busy with. The workplace was typically never boring, which is good for those who don't enjoy standing and having nothing to do."
good,The employees are great but once you become supervisor there's no pay raises unless you want to become full-time. There were some days where it was extremely busy with nothing to do and others where customers continually kept coming.
good,it was a good experience you learn alot about costumer service and how to treat people and deal with difficult situations and now that I have learned such it would be nice to work in a different enviornment
good,"They stay busy. I cleaned tables, cleaned bathrooms, and I washed dishes. Management was distressful. The hardest part of the job was also pleasing management. Getting my first paycheck was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"While at wendy's i was a cashier ,attending people in the lobby it was a pretty simple job and i would say the hardest part was the night shifts and closing the lobby"
good,"There have comments going around at my current place of employment and some feel less than appreciated by our supervisors myself included,  there isn’t a sense of any job security"
good,This job is for people that are just starting out. Not for someone that has already had a first job. I advice people that have a stable life to work at Wendy's. If you are a student in High school and your school is unorganized Wendy's is not the place for you.
good,Some locations are enjoyable while others can be very stressful. Having repeat customers makes the job worth while. Night shifts are long on slow nights.
good,"Typical tasks varied every day.  Register or Drive through, cleaning the dining room tables, to cooking fries or burgers. Salary in NC is minimum wage to start with.  It's great for ages 16-25ish.  You will advance quite fast!"
good,"I liked working for Wendy's but it wasnt enough hours for me, I needed more hours because I needed the money,I have 4 kids I'm Raising by myself.i did get along with the other workers easily."
good,"A LOT of favoritism goes on there. The less work someone does, the better they are treated. You work your butt off while others get to goof off and not do anything including management."
good,"I learned many things in Wendy's, as I wanted to take experience of group work and food line. Wendy's taught me team work and management; I have managed whole store during my shift. So, if anybody want to take food service experience and want to learn basics of management it will be a good start."
good,"It was my first job when I was 16. It paid minimum wage but the hours were pretty good and consistent if you were a good worker. I would recommend getting on day shift if you can. Night shift can really suck because you have to close down the store every night. And if you happen to get a rush, it’s harder than in the day because they don’t feel the need to schedule as many employees at night."
good,Great benefits...  Bonuses and 401K ae great perks.Not for a full-time mom. 10-12/13 hour workdays and phone calls constantly into night and days off.
good,It is a good place. But during a rush it can get a bit crazy. The people can be nice and helpful. It gives you the freedom to work alone if you wish or with others.
good,When I first started working here it was with the promise of being trained to do everything. Then I eventually got stuck at drive thru or doing the jobs and prep work that nobody wanted. I eventually walked out when I had enough of the racist comments from a shift leader.
good,"Work was mainly busy, especially for lunch and dinner rush. Good managers and coworkers make all the difference. its best to build friendships with others."
good,as Wendys did have its up and downs from good to bad managements. it also had its good and bad for the employees. a good learning process to increase someones customer service skills and multitasking as well. fun and exciting to not so well. overall still a good small job to get.
good,you do have a lot of preps to do especially for dinner and lunch rush and you have to stay on top of the orders that come in during that time at rush.
good,because of the nature of the business you are expected to work with and serve people of all walks of life and difficulties of their own. Really teaches you patience.
good,"I enjoyed working with everyone there, however, I could not stand the upper management, i.e. the RM and owner, whenever they were there they would allow no talking, and if we were slow at any point they would tell us off."
good,Working at Wendy’s taught me to perfect my tome management and multitasking skills. It was stressful at times but the support of all the other workers was uplifting
good,the work place was ok not bad but i always got chewed out and yelled at for doing my job right they also didn't notify me when i was starting at all no phone call or email.
good,A typical day at work is stressful. I clock in and get right into position and let the rush begin. I learned it's better to keep a positive attitude no matter how trying the day will be. The hardest part of the job is doing three to four things at once and rushing around. What I most enjoy about the job is the people and how we were all like a family.
good,a typical day is stressful because in my work we never have enough workers for everything to move smoothly. also everyone at my job is hostile and in panic. i learned how to function properly under a lot of pressure and multiple people talking to me at once.
good,It’s a good place to work out. Sometimes we get rude customers and nice customers. It’s clean also and it’s a place to come to for teamwork. The mangers here are g
good,Day would start off slow then become more busy throughout the day. Some days would become extremely faced paced. The team would have to work together in order to have succeed.
good,"You learn how to talk to people and also teaches you to be more patient. I had a great time with co-workers and managers were back and forth with good and bad managers. Overall, its a starting job and would not want to work there my whole life."
good,Its alright for temporary but nothing permanent especially if you have Bill's and don't wanna deal with high school drama and not want to have to do everything and still get told you didn't do anything.
good,"I worked there as a teenager, and while there were things I did not like at the time, I now realize it was an ideal job for someone my age.  I worked there three years ago, the only thing I did not like was they only put me on the schedule two days per week ."
good,I did mostly everything when it came to customer service and the experience was ok but due to me having to quit and pursue a different career which was ups
good,"Everyday we would open the store to get ready for each day. Duties included: cleaning everything, stocking cooling units with product (hamburger, French fries, chicken and prepped items such as ketchup mustard, vegetables and mayonnaise.) We cut fresh vegetables, and made fresh salads, while firing up the fryers and grill along with filling the ice machine, and making sure the soda machine was functioning properly. We made fresh coffee, and made sure that the frosty machines were ready even in the mornings!                                                                                            I learned everything I could about the fast food industry. This includes everything that goes with food safety, how to take orders, run the cash register while taking orders, and hand out the correct orders in a prompt and timely matter.                                                                                                We had regular customers that came in everyday who claimed that they could not live without a mouth watering Wendy's burger, or a fresh salad or an ice cold frosty. I enjoyed our regular customers because we got to know each other, and we would talk about anything from current news to sports, and entertainment. I enjoyed the sports conversations the most!            The hardest part of working at Wendy's was putting the ordered items away on truck days. Items included: (35-45 pound meat boxes, 40 pound fresh cut fries boxes, 40-45 pound lettuce boxes, 50 pound frosty mix boxes etc.…)                                                                         "
good,"I will always have the skills I gained personally while at Wendy’s which I’m grateful for. These skills will never go away, it was tough but it made me stronger as an employee in general."
good,Only worked weekends and for a while wasn't scheduled then when asked manager shrugged about it and gave me 3 days again. Made friends but didnt make enough money to do pay any real bills.
good,"This was my first job ever, I was exited to work here to get any amount of experience that I could. I rather enjoyed the crew I was a member of and easily learned how to do every position in under a year."
good,on a typical work day i would come in and clock in and start my shift. the first thing i did was clean the outside parking lot come in take out all the trash in the building.around lunch i would help out on food.
good,"It was relaxed at times, while also very rushed and fast-paced at times. My coworkers were all very laid-back and friendly and sociable. It wasn't the most serious workplace"
good,Wendy's is a great job to learn different thing. I get alone well with the other crew members and we always got the job done no matter what. We work as a solid team together.
good,"It was a good company,  but the store I worked in had a bad pool of workers. It was a viscous cycle. Quit, and come back, quit, and come back, and they allowed it. So you would get rid of a bad seed, then a month later, they were hired back, many if them took advantage of this."
good,"My reason for enjoying this job only included the amount of hours they were willing to give me. Adding shifts, and picking up overtime wasn't a problem for me and I enjoyed seeing that on a check. I did however have small problems with managers sometimes because they wanted to micro manage. Once given a task, as an adult; I feel as if i dont need someone watching over my shoulder, but someone t just show me a couple times, and have faith that ill get the job done."
good,"We were under manned most days I was there, I was never able to get home at the time I was told that we closed, and my schedule was changing rapidly every week."
good,The store I worked at had poor management skills. Usually the employees would run the store while the manager sat in the office. The cleanliness of the store was also lacking.
good,"The work place was a different experience for me working in fast food, even though I have worked in fast food before. Working at Wendy's in a different city, was very different for me. But i eventually got use to it, the customers were more rude than often, but i knew how to deal with the situation accordant."
good,"A lot of management was very unfriendly and harsh. It was a fun place to work, however. Most of the other people were friendly. The late closes made it hard to balance school and work."
good,"Workers are placed where management believes is necessary, but new workers were put on register and weren't able to move to other positions easily. Management was inappropriately involved in workers personal lives."
good,I honestly did enjoy the fast past environment. It made the day go by faster and was more enjoyable but in the end I wasn’t compensated enough and wasn’t given enough hours.
good,Somehow I managed to stay there for almost 6 years. Upper management isn't great and they care more about money than getting more help and employees. Not great at all.
good,As long as you work with people you get along with the job is great. Management was always on top of things and working together like a team was amazing.
good,Its an okay job. Better suited for teens that doesn't have any real responsibilities. For adults try to work opening shifts and try to get as many hours as possible.
good,"I worked at Wendy’s for 2 years. Within the 2 years I worked my way up to management. I was in training for up to 1 year before receiving the position. Unfortunately, due to unfairness and bad management I resigned."
good,"There are always going to be ups and downs when it comes to fast food. Wendy's did a pretty good job at hiring management and keeping them, but had some turnover, which will always happen."
good,"It was an okay job for my first one ever, but fast food wasn’t for me. I liked the staff and the job was very simple. I would like to have had more opportunities for raises because of my hard work, but this is why I left as well."
good,"While I worked at Wendy's the company experienced several issues with its staff, but these were quickly dealt with. However, as a result of these problems being smoothed out my opportunity for advancement within the company was taken from me."
good,Company very well constructed and put together. I learned a lot and even improved to becoming a manger this company will help you excel your career and outlooks.
good,Needs to be more organized and make you feel safe. There was a lot of things that weren't organized and I needed to know more often about my shifts and when I was scheduled to work.
good,"This wasn't the worst place to work. Very, very fast paced. You need to have fast hands and be quick on your feet while having a bubbly happy attitude at the same time. You need to be accurate and fast to ensure warm food to customers. If you're nice and inviting to everybody then it helps the customers to have a nice meal. The people I worked with were usually very funny and nice."
good,"Working at Wendy's is a great experience for high school students, they offer low weekly working hours that works well for those that are still in school."
good,"Good hours and fair pay. Fast paced environment, managers are ok sometimes don’t help or listen to crew members. 50% off discount for lunch break. Flexible hours."
good,"like... eh. It wasn't awful, some of the workers were mean to me, some of 'em were nice. Sometimes I left smelling like frier oil. But a paycheck's a paycheck."
good,"A typical closing shift for me involves me working in a hot environment surrounded by people on all sides, from my team to my guests. This can lead to stress. If it is busy, it wears me out quickly."
good,The company policy is realy strict on food safety and sanitary so every crew members have to make sure they have gone through proper procedure before getting to work.
good,wendys is a cool place to work at the manager are nice but when it comes to nice customer service they push you to make sure the customer is happy....
good,"At first the job was good then it got progressively worse as time went on, less crew(3 would leave and only 2 would show up forcing a person to work two separate jobs)"
good,Fast paced business that helps to serve the community around the business to provide with a great dining experience. Crew is able to grow and move up within the company.
good,I would not work there no more Assistant managers disrespectful. Favoritism there co workers picking on each other. Great pay though at nights. Great customers.
good,"They start everyone out at $9.00 an hr no matter if you have experience or not. It’s a good place for a first job or a temporary job but definitely not long term. There is a lot of drama. Mainly on day shift. It’s like a high school. The professionalism is almost non- existent. The staff for night shift isn’t even a staff. They have to work almost every night because Wendys can’t keep employees or the employees hired change the availability to day shift only. Recognition isn’t a thing. Benefits... what benefits? Other than discounts there isn’t any really good benefits unless you’re a manger and even then they aren’t that great. Advancement is a very, very long process. Constant threats of being wrote up and fired. Almost all of the management let the postion go to their head. I have be yelled at before for no reason on multiple occasions. Not very understanding, especially to the night shift if they can’t come in to work. Also the phone is rarely answered if it is even hooked up. Like I said in the title, this job is best for a first job or as a temporary job."
good,I can work 80 hours for two weeks and only get paid around 600 after taxes and I don’t think that is very fair. Also they want me to much more than I get paid for.
good,"Great place for a first job, but  better opportunities. Wendy’s really helped with flexibility for schools all throughout the weeks. Reason why I was current are Wendy’s. Although good job."
good,"A typical workday at work consist of a lot of heat in the kitchen. There's always a lot of moving.I really didn't learn much. But management was never on the same page as the crew. We did always have even culture in the workplace. "
good,It was a very busy job to maintain but the management lacked on training me they assumed I would be able to get it all by the second day... they started giving me good hours then gave me almost nothing.
good,It’s a fun job with nice people and crew.  Most customers are nice but some are really mean and rude. Nice diversity but some managers gives me anxiety.
good,"I have worked at multiple locations. Some ups and downs; overall what you would expect from a fast food job. The hardest part of the job was meeting the expectations of the managers, some would hold them too high."
good,"Lot of turn over with associates.  General manager hires a lot of high school kids and they consistently are late or call out for the day which leaves everyone short handed"
good,It’s an okay place to work and your coworkers are pretty nice all things considered but the management is a be mean. Some managers treat the workplace likes it highschool and gossip and say insulting things behind your back
good,"My overall experience  with Wendys isn’t bad. If I were a high school student  with no bills or children it would be the perfect job, but unfortunately I’m not ."
good,it was a great company to work for but recently the management that hired me had to quit to focus on personal things in life and new management is horrible. childish and extremely unprofessional.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, was some of the people where very nice and talkative. And I most enjoyed the busy days, never lasted long enough for me though."
good,The management was hard to work with but it was a job and so I stayed until I could find another job. I did find another job and then I moved on to find other opportunities.
good,Not enough staff feels like the company doesn't care about employees I just feel like I have no control over the team I run since I am only a crew leader and the only crew leader on nights so i work 6 days out the week but on a plus when my team comes together we are unstoppable there maybe flaws but i still love my team that is the only reason i have not gave up hope and i love seeing the normal customers who come in you really get to know them personally and now they apart of the family
good,Great people wonderful customers  people are really amazing about helloing you and making sure you are being trained properly and to the fullest extent that we can
good,"It is a very easy place to work at, not stressful at all. I would recommend this job to younger kids, or people looking for a quick and easy second job."
good,When I get to work I wash my hands and look to see what we need before we get a rush. Prep anything and stock up the line. Made sandwiches and if we are slow I will take customer's orders and cash them out. Management was very understanding and work around your work schedule. The hardest part of this job is picking co workers slack and difficult customer's. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing how fast I can make a sandwich and race with co workers.
good,Wendy’s was my first job working in the restaurant industry. It was fast paced with lines sometimes stretching out the door during rush hour so I learned to adapt quickly. The staff was friendly and helpful which made going to work pleasant!
good,i enjoyed going to work every time i worked but a little bit after it got different cause i had lots of stuff going on at the moment and i told them what was going on and they let me go cause of it.
good,"You get a better understanding of how  the how business works and how to be a leader, all right this thing wants me to say a whole bunch of stuff about Wendy's however I don't have that much to say about the place.you start your shift you see who you have scheduled you position your people you set goals for the day see if you got the proper amount of product then you get ready for you Peak point make sure you cash flow is good customer satisfied and you should pass over the store in good condition or better condition in which you received it and that's your day at Wendy's it's going to be inconveniences highs and lows but as a manager you should be able to troubleshoot and work through it."
good,"straight forward easy job, cook food, make area clean, work cash register, make sure everything is stocked and ready for the next day. once a week help with shipment"
good,Worked here for about 3 years. started as just a new hire cashier and worked my may up to shift supervisor. pay really sucked at the time and i got screwed over with it when new year minimum wages kicked it. I was a manager making $8.79 an hour back in 2012 and new hires were starting at 8.50
good,It will be what you make of what you can withstand. There will be many frustrating days but if you’re mind is focused and you have a plan you will be fine. It’s defi not a job for someone of little patience
good,Good place to work just not enough money. The manager is great the team is great. I just wish we could've been paid just a little more for our work because we deserve it.
good,Working at Wendy’s for me was temporary I didn’t see yoself moving up in the business. It was just a place to go and make money to provide for my family.
good,"typical day working for Wendy's was; greet guests, take guests orders, prepare guests food and drink orders,assist some guests to their table, maintain cleanliness."
good,"If you are young and want to experience in the workforce in the first place, this is it. Also it's good job for you if you still go to school, but not recommend for everyday life."
good,"A typical day at work consist of hard work. I was there for 3 years and they do have favorites,i'd like to think I was one of them but the managers are careless the district manager is careless, employees smoke weed on the job. Crew members ate food in front of customers. The hardest part of the job was being in positions I wasn't trained for and working multiple positions because people weren't in their station, the pay is horrible.They let employees come in late."
good,Nice environment. Faced paced most of the time. Breaks could've been taken a lot more than given. Bad scheduling. Lots of employees didn't like to show up to work
good,It was one of my first jobs I just didn’t get enough hours. It was one of the first fast food places I worked at. Your work at a fast pace and make sure your getting orders out
good,It wasn't enough money for me but overall cool laid back place to work. The people was nice who worked with me I had no problem with my cousin workers just not enough money
good,"Its hard to review a company that completely depends on what type of manager you have/the location. However, either way, wendys is a perfect first job to know the basics of what a job demands of you. Not impossible to have a good time if you go in with a positive attitude."
good,The hardest part would be dealing with rude customers simply because they weren't understanding. I also loved working with the employees because they were sweet and understanding.
good,It is a good job if you are going to school or if you are under 21 with not so many responsibilities. Unless you want to try to be a manager then it is a good pay. For regular employees is not a good salary to raise a family.
good,Fun place to wrk. Can advance quickly if work habits are good. Very flexible with crew hours and all management. Great family culture. Upper management seems tough but only cause they want to see the best out of their employees
good,"Wendy's was a fast paced work environment which was perfect for me, as I am a very task oriented person. The company was good at creating an atmosphere of teamwork. I learned how to enhance my customer service skills while maintaining a high level of multi-tasking ability."
good,"Management was accommodating as far as my work schedule, however there were never enough employees to assist with the flow of customers.  Managers fighting one another.  Managers berating employees in front of other employees and customers."
good,Wendy's is a very fast paced company that strives on order accuracy and freshness of product. But how ever are not very fair on how much they pay and the hours given to employees in order live in this economy.
good,"Okay start off pay, but bad environment to be working at because of how messy it can get, some employers will mess around if doesn't get busy. It is fun to be workimg there with people."
good,The management was poor and unprofessional. First off the GM at Wendy's on 222 N Wasatch Colorado Springs Co gives drugs to his employees and falsely states and fires an employee after speaking with that employee in person the same day.
good,"Working at Wendy's isn't much different than working at other fast-food places. It really depends on your management. My first manager really worked with my status as a student worker, and I wasn't stressed out most of the time because she was really flexible with my schedule. My most recent manager was very passive aggressive and wasn't flexible with student workers."
good,"I enjoy the coworkers I work with. They're fun and very friendly, but the management tend to show favoritism in which I dislike. I do appreciate their flexibility with hours, but as a college student the pay isn't enough."
good,A typical day at work for me was to come in build the burgers and when there's no customers go and wash dish and full up the food containers. I'll sweep here and there and clean the bathroom as well.
good,Requests weren't followed. Poor management. Never a set store manager. Always labor issues. Schedule wouldn't be done until last minute. Just a very unprofessional company.
good,have had 30 plus years here mostly good  it is now time to consider other options  looking for something closer to home  tired of the 100 miles per day drive
good,"Too fast paced, not enough help, very stressful,  to much to do for 1 person & to much to do for  $8hr. , employees need to be paid more for this type of job because once they are there for a few weeks they end up quitting because of the heavy & fast paced work load."
good,It´s usually a long day and sometimes it goes by extremely fast.if i could control the way things were i would. It need better management and better control of people and what they do.
good,good job for people who needs a part time job fro extea cash or students learning responsibilty and some independence. job is fast paced and can become stressful on some days
good,Wendys is a good to work im just not gettin paid enough.. i been workin there for almost 3yrs & only had 1 raise.. im onr of their best employees they have.
good,"title says it all, it was a fun place to work, but you dont get paid more than $8/hour and most shifts werent 8 hours requiring you to pick up extra days"
good,"The mornings and weekends were very busy days at work, especially Sunday's afternoon, i learned more customer sevice skills and how to take orders. Washing all the dishes at night was a challenge only because sometimes you would have to start when you're not closed yet so you would be ruuning back and fourth leaving in way past twelve. The work enviroment was pretty decent, managers could've been more heplful."
good,"As a whole, Wendy's was not the worst place to work. However, a lack of communication and working together as a team often created a toxic work environment. Employees were often left to fend for themselves as most of the managers at my location refused to help when they were needed the most. There were also several issues with the restaurant itself, such as an infestation at one point. It was a nice first job, but I would not recommend it to anyone if asked."
good,"There's ups and downs with this job, when it gets stressful and busy you just have to breath and do what you can do. My coworkers and managers were all very helpful and outgoing. Each day I was assigned a position on a clipboard and I would follow my routine from there, whether it was working front, back, taking trash out, helping customers, etc."
good,i come to work and the frist thing i see is people on there phone not working it 50% off on food and you can oney get it if you work with in  that hour
good,"Most days at Wendy's are spent either preparing, cooking, and serving food along with making sure customers have an enjoyable experience and making sure the building is kept clean. Management can be nice it just depends really at which location you get placed at. Choosing to work at Wendy's you will have to realize that this is a starting job for a lot of high school students and most of co workers will be said people. This job does offer good opportunities to become a shift lead or even to a manager assuming you can take on the extra responsibilities to an already extremely stressful job."
good,"Its a great job for students or as a first job. Fast paced, but that's fast food.I love working as a team. Advancement is slow, but the management was awesome."
good,Wendy's was my first job and working there was just something I never paid attention too. I had to leave this job because of an experience that I had and got told I was faking about the experience.
good,"Its a little stressful, I don’t think once I leave I wil ever go back manager lies and makes false promises and it get very tiring the hiring manager he is a snake"
good,"Wendy's has always provided a good work / home balance, and great benefits to go along with very good compensation. I learned a lot over my years with Wendy's through great training."
good,"not a very  fun place to work,it is very fast paced during lunch and dinner hours.Learned how to use cookers and things in a resaraunt kitchen, temps on food hold times."
good,"1.its was a friday and i had clocked in i could put my stuff down i had to hope on the grill cause before i came in nothing was set up right"
good,"wasnt to bad working for this company but the pay isnt great, and isnt worth the hours you put in, i definitely wouldnt reccomend this job for anyone with a family to support"
good,The most enjoyable aspect of working at Wendy's was the regular customers. I also enjoyed the environment cultivated my some of my managers who went out of their way to help the crew and make every shift enjoyable.
good,Wendy's is a nice place to work at. It's easy work but it just the people who work there play to much like the high school kids thinks everything a joke. But I loved going to work at Wendy
good,"management was very friendly, as well as most of the staff, a typical day is slow except from 12-2 and 5-7. Hard to find enough to do when slow. The culture was very relaxed and lade back."
good,It was hard to get along with some of the managers. It was quick paced and productive. I felt some coworkers and manager didn’t have quality teamwork.
good,I Learn how drop fries and that basic it on i learn how to  cut up bacon and but i apply for be a grill cook  I was never trained on the grill alt all.
good,"Other than the your work schedule switching from day shift to night shift giving you very little room for any personal time, its a great place to work!"
good,Managers are ok. Kind of fast paced but not too bad. Food is good and you won't get tired of it even after you stop working there. The pay wasn't bad it was just biweekly and the wait was annoying.
good,"As a summer job for a teen it was a pretty decent job, most people didn't hate their lives and management was nice enough to everyone."
good,"At work a typical day would be clock in, count my drawer as fast as I could to get back up front. Cleaning was a big part of what I did working their, getting peoples food already in bags or on trays. Cleaning at night as well with mopping, wiping down windows, and etc. What I had learned while being with them was to always stay busy ever if you were not I would find something.  Management their was for sure questionable, not the best at the time when i was working. Culture in the workplace was not to bad, for sure if something happen that was bad we would get talked to.  Hardest part of my job while i was working their was the night cleaning, which included bleaching floors, wiping down all tables and chairs and etc. Overall the most enjoyable part of my job was to talk to different people who came from all over the world for collage."
good,"You’re day can go from good to bad depending on yourself but also your co-workers . It’s really fast paced and you can get a lot of hours if you want. I was attending school when I first started and the managers were great with working with my schedule. Mornings are slow but during rush hours and late nights , it’s pretty busy and you’ll always have something to do."
good,I wish wendys would hire managers outside of the company. Us as GMs have alot to do and if your short on managers you will never have time to train and do everything that a GM has to do.. if they hired managers outside the company we would be stocked on managers and the GM can finish their work meet their deadlines and focus more on developing employees..
good,"I learned to do everything in the store , from running the cashiers , to the fyer , to the grill using my great customer service. Bad environment tho."
good,"Extensive customer interaction, and cash handling. Very fast paced job which consists of taking orders, cooking, or working drive thru."
good,"My typical day is getting the store ready to serve our guest the best of our abilities. We have some great loyal guest who are like family. Spending a few moments with these guest as well as meeting new guest is the best part of my day. Setting up the plan for the day coaching our employees on our daily goals. Continue to coach thru the day. Making sure the safe and drops are all correct. Manage food, labor, and follow up on our SMG. If we get a compliment celebrate that with the crew that day. If we get a complaint we go over that as well, to find what went wrong and how we are going to avoid it next time. The hardest part of my day is when we get those complaints or if we have a lot of call outs. Because I have to take time away from helping ensure we are not getting more complaints by having to fix these issues. I enjoy supporting my crew and guests."
good,"although the pressure was on to be the fastest , co workers and management were both light hearted and encouraging which made me work harder ,rather then feeling like i just wasnt able to do what i was required."
good,I enjoyed working with the tem I had but management wasn't good at this location. they was barley giving me hours and when I did get hours they would only give me like 30 mins-1 hour.
good,I liked the work environment and it was nice to work there but sometimes others were not nice to each other and people didn’t always do as they were told by the boss.
good,Working there was stressful customers complain how slow people were making their food & about how long they been waiting. Only good thing about working there was that the people there are helpful when it gets busy.
good,"I may enjoy Wendy's food but working there didn't get me barely anything, only gave me three hours, hourly pay was horrible, the boss never got around to teaching me how to grill or drop fries, etc. "
good,Was able to learn how to do things in workplace they were very fast paced and helpful. They were flex able with my schedule also. The team was nice and helpful
good,The job was ok i just didn’t get any hours or enough pay the people at the job was cool the manger. It was a quick working place. You were on your feet all day
good,"A typical day for me is to always keep kitchen sanitized. Employees join in on their duties and we all worked as a team to keep the customers safe. Keeping a smile everyday gave me a piece of mind, and it also enlightened others. No matter where I turned around it was always something to be grateful for working at Wendys, The only problem I had was dealing with pay, It didn't allow me to cover personal expenses."
good,"Liked how it was busy work, and team works together to achieve goals. It doesn't offer a great work life balance to single mothers as you are required to work long days and late hours regularly."
good,Hostile staff members with poor customer service skills. Cooperation skills were good but service time was slower than average. Hardest part of the job was working morning shift and doing tasks that were not in the job description.
good,"L'horaire demander etait jamais respecter,mais sinon c'etait une bonne ambiance"
good,"Always doing something , staying busy helps pass time. Co workers were easy to get along with. Never had any problems with people there , the job itself just was not for me."
good,"I had a love/ hate for the job. It wasn’t always the best but, it wasn’t too bad either. The people I got to know were amazing and the job can be a lot of work."
good,"learned a lot of useful skills needed to survive today work word, some dealing with how to interact with other to, management skill like motivating other"
good,"Its a good enviroment, meh job. The people there are on task and work very well together. The management could be more selective on whom they hire and promote, but overall it is definitely a step above any other fast food job."
good,"Unless you’re ready to work hard, I wouldn’t recommend Wendy’s. The breaks weren’t too great, and were often long overdue, but when you have a drive thru time to keep up, it’s pretty hard for management to make everyone happy. But that’s just foodservice."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wendy’s until it switched owners and management. When everything changed stuff started to go down fast, we were already short workers and they were still laying people off, they weren’t hiring people fast enough and they were straining there current employees."
good,"It's productive at work, learnt how to be first thinker and do things before on time and find the work easy at the moment. The management at work is organised. The culture is friendly."
good,Wendy’s is a face paced food chain. Speed and accuracy is everything. Most people hired to work here lack one or both. Wendy’s could be much better if they hire people who understand what a sense of urgency is
good,"I got stressed out everyday because of my mental disorder, and dealing with stupid customers. But, if you're not like me, and can handle lots of stupid customers. You'll do fine."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of doing way too much work for not enough pay. I learned to never work in a Wendy's again, because the part-time job took everything out of me. The management was cut throat and mean. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the toxic environment. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers."
good,The wendys i work at would benefit if they appreciate your work and not pay so low. Workers slack leaving me with half the work to do.  Reason im looking for a new and better job that will pay me what i work for.
good,"After not receiving my breaks and being forced to work overtime as well as being required to eat lunch less that two hours into my shift ( 7 hours no food, one 15 minute break) I decided to leave this position after working 7 days in a row."
good,Management is a joke. Some of them work you extra for no reason. If the general manager is tough then your shifts are going to be boring and you will be put to work.
good,You're expected to be able to do literally everything in almost all areas of the store for minimum wage. Overnight is definitely not worth it because they only schedule like 4 people at night and they're responsible for cleaning the entire store before closing. Its stressful because the food is never marked and the customer basically has to unwrap their item before knowing what it is so when things are made wrong we're forced to replace it 100% of the time without questioning.
good,"working at wendys has thought me alot how to be pro active , how to talk to your custurmos nicely and how to perform my work duties. its just the hours the give u to work it could be cut down fast"
good,"My normal day would work as back sandwiches for drive thru or as cashier for the in house customers. Most days of the week, cashier is pretty slow but there is so much to do and would recommend that everyone try to stay clear of front cash if possible. There is a lot of cleaning (dining room, bathrooms, trays, cleaning up after customers, etc) and making sure the customers are happy. Back sandwiches are quick and fast paced and my favorite place to be as you just have to memorize the sandwich builds and make it as fast as you can. It's fun until you get an order worth more than $40 of sandwiches then it gets upsetting. The hours are decent most of the time they have you working between 5 to 8 hours a day with at least one or two days a week. You do get called in if they are running low on staff, but don't be afraid to say no if you can't. But don't always say no or you won't make extra money."
good,"This was my second job it’s fast food it’s what you expect, but it’s a job and if you need the money you would do it to , it really not that bad once you get there"
good,The pay isn’t worth the work I leave at about I work at 5pm-12:40am the work isn’t worth the pay and sometimes you must cover other people’s shifts or sometimes people walk out on you and you have to try and do more work than you’re supposed to because people leave and I know how to perform all the task but I haven’t received a raise and someone who can’t do all the task received a raise.
good,Working at Wendy’s in the beginning was fun and enjoyable. Once I was 3 months in I knew I wanted out. Managers there would overstep their boundaries with us which I wasn’t fond off . They shortened hours to where minors could only work 4hours a shift. Besides that it was ok .
good,I enjoyed my job there but the management is horrible and very unprofessional. All the rules they have shouldn't be serious especially if its not concerning the ability to work the job at hand. The unprofessional management will run the best employees off
good,The most enjoyable  part of the job is when the  the customers tell me that I am a good co worker I need a rise and I look it when they leave out with a smile.
good,As a place to work it is as good a place as any. The work is fast paced and can be very demanding. They want you to be able to do everything and to take orders by yourself when it's busy.
good,I loved who I worked with. They made it fun to go to work. The way people think they can treat you just because you are a fast food employee is ridiculous.
good,"For a fast food place, you wouldn't think it is stressful but boy is it! And you never lose the smell of grease.  Ever. I finally threw out a pair of pants that still smelled 6 years later."
good,"a typical day at work, was a fast, steady paced day. I learned communication skills, customer service and how to handle difficult situations. the hardest part of the job was keeping a smile while the customer yells at you."
good,My manager really likes me but it can still be hard to get all the hours I want. I could work for a any other company and get paid exactly the same amount. Decent job to get experience but only for that. Not much room for advancement and the chances of getting a raise are low.
good,Wendys is a good place to work although it keeps you busy. This job comes with working with other employees and requires good communication skills. This job may include providing cleaning services and food preparation.
good,The most enjoyable part of working with Wendy's was probably the discounts and the hospitality of there workers that i worked with. its a very fast paces job.
good,"I arrive at work promptly on time, clock in, and get to work. I work hard and get my work done on time. I wish I could say more but everyday has different problems. But i will say if you show me how to get something done then i will do everything in my power to get it done."
good,The management is poor and requesting days was always hard because when you became a good worker they depend on you more but they don't give you the appreciation or wages you deserve.
good,"More of a training setting for young adults, but it's a face paced environment. The managers of this establishment have good leadership skills, but as we are all human , a brush up on skill building classes could improve all"
good,I learned that this job is mostly for teenagers who are not paying for bills. Do not recommend for adults. Managers have their favorites and expect you to do anything without a please or thank you.
good,"my 6+ months working there, it was just your average fast food restaurant. we were like a mini work family. we always tried and for the most part succeeded in being ahead of the time clock."
good,"Wendy's is okay.  Depending on the manager it can be a fun place to work, while other managers make it miserable. Do not go into management as you get horrible hours, are required to work at least 50+ hours a week"
good,"typical day at work is ok they laugh and joke around but when its time to work its time to work, management is cool to work with but some of them aren't"
good,"Fast paced, challenging, and you can really impact peoples day in a positive way by doing things the way they are supposed to be done and actually trying to.  Goals and standards are set to ensure that quality, consistency and safety are priorities.  If you can get people to follow that it is a recipe for success.  The added bonus is to find those people or be able to train and show them how to be that way and to try and make others day or experience a great or positive one."
good,like any place it has some good points and some ruff points . it was a ok job but employes on average would end up making there job harder than it was.
good,"it is a really good temporary job. I would recommend to maybe a teen, or someone in desperate need. However they par isn't really good and there isn't much opportunity for anvancement."
good,It started off being a good company to work for but when they sold the company it really went down. No respect for there management team they just didn’t care enough
good,"Professional manager, great employees and fast-paced work environment. Learned how to work with customers. Maintained cleanliness, and prepared food regularly."
good,"fast paced environment. Food prep and stocking. Made orders for customers and took the customers order while delivering great customer service. Communication is key in the fast food industry, If something doesnt look right or made wrong speak up about it."
good,the business was run nicely. it was just hard for someone new to run the whole front by themselves. and the area the store is located in is horrible .
good,"first job"
good,This is a good job for starting out. It is very fast paced but you learn a lot through it all. It has good discipline. You learn to meet people's needs.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's was sometimes utterly unacceptable. You clock in sometimes the most positive person, but they still managed to throw negativity around. Some days were great but that wasn't often. Management there blew my mind; its been several managers that behaved worst and got more complaints than crew members put together. Situations aren't handled professionally but often based off favoritism. I don't know if its all fast food, but there who you know and you're friends with mattered a lot."
good,Learn how to work with others have a little fun. But when I need certain days to spend time with family it's was always a problem as my child got older
good,"You work as a cashier, dish-washer, drive-thru, and making the food. This job is quick-paced, but very easy to learn. The management is not very professional. One of the managers was smoking in the kitchen. Very bad hours given. I am referring to the Wendy's on Lincoln Highway East, in Lancaster, PA."
good,"Food Prep and Sanitation"
good,"Overall, the restaurant is a fun and cool place to work at. I really like all the managers and the people I work with. As a college student it is very flexible."
good,A typical day at work is like any other day. I have learned that being in a quick paced work environment is challenging at times. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to associate with my co-workers.
good,"Most of the people were fun to work with an easy to get along with, job tasks for not hard. Management was a bit strict but otherwise ok. Pay was low with very little employee benefit to start."
good,A typical day at Wendy's is fast and friendly. What i have learned working for this establishment is your work hard fast and friendly to keep those smiling faces of the customer coming back for more
good,Despite the low hours and pay the environment is upbeat and everyone gets along for the most part. If the hours weren't so short and the pay wasn't so low I would probably go back
good,"It was a good first job while in school,because the manager would work with our schedule. It was a fun experience, just wish it was a job with better pay and benefits."
good,"Each day was a lot of work, but with a great Management staff and great crew members the day would feel like a fun challenge to meet goals and clean up. The customers were not always friendly, and that makes the job very difficult but still manageable, but customers also find ways of making the job really great as well, like jokes, tips, and having a general understanding of what the crew and management go through at the best or hardest of times."
good,"Wendy's, like all fast food places, is a good place to have your first job. However, it doesn't pay enough. You actually do a lot of work but you don't get paid for the amount you do. A lot of standing, you're constantly in a hot environment, and people are rude."
good,I enjoyed working with my fellow employees. We were able to socialize and still get our stuff done. The only bad thing i have to say is that i worked so much that i never spent time with my son. We switched managers and the manager would never come in and help on her days off but i was required to. I ended up working more hours then my general manager and i had spent only 3 hours with my son that week. I had to quit to be able to have a home life.
good,"A typical work day at Wendy's is busy, but its easy to keep up with once you get the hang of it. I've learned how to manage money, and deal with angry customers. Management could have been better. The hardest part of the job would have to be drive-thru because so many customers come through at a time. The most enjoyable part would have to be interacting with the customers and other staff members."
good,fun place to work just didn't make enough money or get enough hours to cover my transportation expenses no real advancement possibilities no insurance coverage
good,A typical day at Wendy's was fast paced. For a first job i can say it taught me a lot about customer service. The management team back then was very helpful as far as scheduling. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the different attitudes. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,I like wendy's it is a good jobs and I love the customers that come in and are very friendly. They seem very disorganized some days and a lot of drama with the younger people that work there. They do give good service and try their best to get things done fast as possible.
good,Quick paced. Need to move quick when you get busy. Managers can be jerks at times. Disrepectful the two managers. Need to be nicer if they want to keep employees.
good,"The usual day would consist for rush hours of both the dining room and the drive thru. As well as not so busy times."
good,Compensation for my hard work was minimal to naught. The corporation in question did a very poor job in follow up on their workers and facility upkeep.
good,i liked working at wendyd they were friendly and understanding and thoughtful i would love to work at wendys still but i need more hours if  they had atleast 40 hours a week i wouldnt be looking for another job
good,Wendy's was an okay place to work in my opinion. I didn't get to work many shifts and I'm not sure why but the people I worked with were very nice and always ready to help when you needed it
good,"Overall Wendy's was a decent place to work, but the fast pace and the amount of things you had to prepare was super stressful. There's a lot of hard work that has to go into this job and if you're not good with stress this probably isn't the job for you."
good,The work environment is fun. Busy from about 10 am to 2 pm. hardest part of the job is not letting stress get to you so you can effectively serve the customers.
good,"managers always blame their issues to the workers, the pay was poor, the days were not flexible, and they would make the workers do all the work while they sit in the office and eat."
good,Wendys is a great job.  It has the ability to prepare you for almost any other job you may go into later on in life.  It is very fast paced and customer oriented!!  Friendliness and service with a smile are at the top of the list of job expectations.  There is never a dull moment because there is always something to accomplish.
good,pienso que el ambiente laboral es agradable en momentos todo depende de el movimiento de las ventas
good,Management is strict and the work environment gets boring at times as you are unable to talk to your co-workers. The hardest part of the job is working at the grill.
good,It was an okay job but could be stressful and the management picks favorites. It wasn't worth the minimum wage so I left to find a better paying job with more opportunities.
good,"It's a job for people who are trying to maintain themselves while they are in school.It's just like any other fast food job, low pay and a lot of work."
good,I didn't always enjoy working at Wendy's. There were people who were workers and managers that were bullies and made fun of other coworkers just to be mean. The general manager could be rude and didn't always accommodate workers.
good,Wasn't to bad but the management could have been much more considerate for there employes. A typical day we would server nearly 600 people. It was a good first job.
good,"My day began at 7am. There were two other people with me. They did all the prep. I was in charge of getting everything else ready for the day. Such as getting fryers ready, stocking, sanitizing and putting together the ice cream machines. I cleaned the parking lot. Depending on the day and time, I was a line cook, or ran fryers, grill, or other duties. I think that the hardest part of the job was the stress."
good,Fast and Fresh only problems working there was lack of good man power and people that go above and beyond restaurant will only run as well as workers make it
good,"I enjoy working with the staff in this team oriented environment. The job will never get you much compensation, and do not expect to ever make more than a dollar or two over minimum wage. This job is good for when you need something to just pay the bills in-between jobs."
good,friendly clean fast pace to the best of my knowledge there is nothing more for me to say was not there long enough to judge cn not put down no experience if I was not there for no more than a couple of months so y should I hv to sit here n lie I speak from the heart so I hv given my words
good,A typical day at work is about four and a half paid work hours at minimum wage. Super fast paced and most managers are rude. Constantly yelling if you are not doing something even if you are just wiping down already sparkly clean tables.
good,"A typical day is busy in the summer but dragging in the winter. This leaves us with a lot of quickly given cleaning tasks to keep us moving, but were not what we needed. I liked to be moving, but would often get backed up depending on the manager working and how well they worked with the crew. Other employee attitudes definitely made an impact on the working environment, and I often felt that I had to pick people up from their low moods, sometimes multiple times in just a few hours. The hardest part is trying to communicate things between management and the crew. They would change things constantly and would never get it communicated, which would leave employees to get yelled at when they had no idea of the changes occurring."
good,"My employees in Wendy’s became my work family , I enjoyed my time working there I’ve learned a lot working there. Working at Wendy’s made me see how life is as a work instead of a customer. On Fridays Wendy’s is always packed and busy so it’s exhausting and stressful but manageable."
good,"I had an alright time at Wendy's. I kept coming back because they always offered for me to come back each summer since they didn't have to train me, but my managers and coworkers did enjoy working with me. It could be a stressful environment when it was busy like during the lunch and dinner rush, but that is much more determinant on what position you were working. Everyone is trained to be able to work every position, but they preferred to put me on the window working directly with the customers.This is a decent enough summer job for someone in high school, but it doesn't leave room for growth."
good,I didnt really like workimg bere becuase the manger seemed like she was bias.i was trained correctly but was expected to to know everything plus poor time
good,this was an amazing first job it was very goofy and fun but professional although some of the management could use some work this was overall an amazing experience
good,Working here isn't always fast paced it has its moments of rushes but it is a very fast and easy job. Had little cleaning duties it wasn't very hard to work here at all.
good,Working at Wendy’s was very fun especially being a teen . At Wendy’s there is a fast Paste you have to go by to get things done . Taking orders meeting me people i loved it .
good,"In my experience with this company a typical work day would be rather fast paced with things slowing down around 5:00 p.m."
good,"Fun, Different type of customers, tips was great, under trained, seeing kids tell you what type of food they want, management didn't show any care, good"
good,"I liked having a fast paced job, I never got bored. I managed the whole store, learned how to do food orders and scheduling. I learned cash drawers, and procedures."
good,"Not a place for advancing unless you are a manager.  I am not looking to advance my career in food service,  so it is not a place that I will seek employment at again."
good,"I was still in school at the time and it sucked because i got no sleep, could barely finish homework on time and managers have favorites. Everyone got along with each other, just didn't get paid enough to be working that much and late on school nights. Ages below 18 are not suppose to be working that late. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people working with you."
good,"I have taken over a full time position as a grill closer so my typical day at work is cleaning the grills, mopping the floors, doing the dishes, working under a tight time constraint, etc. It is extremely repetitive and can get quite tiring over time but that's the job. The people who work there are the best part, they're all great."
good,Wendy's was by far my worst job. I wouldn't  want anyone I know to work there. Manager was unreasonable and not personable and only cared for herself. Everyone had an attitude and hated working there.
good,"My work experience at Wendy's was just ""OK."" Each day would be the same, as expected; cook, clean serve. The only thing I learned was how to make sandwiches and flip meat patties. The best part of working at Wendy's was the 50% off discount. The hardest part of the job was the people we all had to deal with every day. Very unsatisfied customers and sometimes even rude co-workers."
good,"I appreciate the time served at Wendy's but I'm ready for bigger and better things. I want to be successful in life, so I want to expand my career searches."
good,Great place to work but not enough hours and limited advancement opportunities. Schedule is never the same it always changes so its hard to plan anything because you don't know when you will be working.
good,I was rehired by a woman who was new to management. She was great and i loved working there. it was just no room for growth opportunities at all. I didn't really get a lot of hours either.
good,"A fast paced environment that really is a fun time to work at but only if you have the right team  members. I have worked at many stores for the company i was with and there were good days and bad day."
good,It was not the best. The managers could care less about the overall function of the chain. Employees had to count on eachother for guidance instead of management.
good,Work was sometimes very stressful the pay was horrible because im a very hard worker and just thought I deserved more I always came in when they needed me the managers werent very fair
good,Work was fun when you had the right co-worker because most people really dont care about the store so the clean up was lazy on there part other then that its not to bad if they had better benefits and pay i would defiantly stay and most people sont stay long
good,"I'll miss the people I worked with, but the upper management is seriously out of touch with what makes a great restaurant. Hopefully the current shake up shakes out in a good way, but there's going to have to be a serious culture shift for that to happen."
good,"very nice people to work with, very flexible hours, I've learned about food handling, money management. in my opinion the most enjoyable part of the job was learning all the new things that I didn't know."
good,"I enjoyed working with my voworkers, it was a fun fast food job. working In the winter sucked. They had good training systems in place to help new people."
good,"I was on my feet the whole time and the breaks were few and far between. I'm athletic, but those shoes were painful and they were not lenient with emergencies."
good,"Wendy's was very stressful to work at and I think I got underpaid for how much I was honestly doing there, working a lot of hours, and closing the place a lot.. I think I could've bveen paid more, but good management."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Wendy's but found it difficult to stay motivated upon receiving a promotion without a raise. The work environment is fun and teaches excellent multi-tasking and time management skills, but not the kind of job you want to stay at for too long."
good,"Hard to get employees to cover late night shifts during game days, very stressful when the crowd came from the game and one is the employee that called out.. Lol"
good,I learned management and stress controlling skills along  with team building skills and how to work together without arguing with each other over pointless stuff
good,I learned how to work under-pressure and having short time limits to complete large tasks helped me with time management and how to work effectively in a fast pase enviorment. gave me the skills to criticly think and problem solve also to act quickly  when problems arise.
good,If your serious you cpuld advance fast goid stepping stone for future management career and helps build gooz leadership skills good company to be in good incentive programs
good,"The Wendy's Company is somewhat an enjoyable workplace. The staff there does not do some tasks properly. Some employees even talk about becoming suicidal because of the business. Dishes are never clean, coworkers can do nothing at times."
good,"Though it was busy, we always tried to work together. Managers poorly assisted employees. Customers were happy due to service, but sometimes were not."
good,"It was a fast paced job with many opportunities to learn. It got busy at times, especially during the lunch hours in the drive-thru. I also learned how to be courteous and kind to the customers, while being proficient at a register."
good,"A typical day includes serving customers, keeping everything clean for sanitation levels to be up to par with everything. I have learned a lot from working at Wendy's, such as kitchen cleanliness, food safety procedures, how to cook some foods properly, and the value of a dollar learned from labor work. Management was good, considering that they made sure we were working like we should be, but other than that they can sometimes be careless. The hardest part of the job is learning a new position, which is not hard to do. The most enjoyable part of the job would be to learn how a job is valued, to others it might just be the discount on food you would be able to buy yourself."
good,"Quick moving job at Wendy's Right down the street from Harts-field Jackson airport handled money, provided excellent customer service and doing whatever else tasks required or asked of from boss"
good,"Wendy's is not meant to be a permanent, life long job, but it is good for teenagers and young adults in school. This job teaches you how to manage in a fast pace environment and gain experiences in customer service."
good,"Overall good place to start out a career in the food industry. However, quality standards are lacking in recent years and there isn't much room for career advancement."
good,"Took back to back orders. Whenever the machine would shut down, the managers would be slow to come and put a code or fingerprint in. Customers would leave unhappy. Hardest part was working the drive thru and up front because some workers would call out or jus not show up. Most enjoyable part were my coworkers."
good,"- You HAVE to know how to multitask "
good,"It is a good starting point, but I couldn't see myself making a career out of the fast food business. It is fast-paced, albeit with better quality food than some fast food restaurants. The people who work there are of diverse ethnicities at the location I worked, which led to some challenges in communication, but also a good opportunity to learn from those people."
good,"When I started it was not a very well managed place but they have a few managers in there now that do great"
good,A typical job but did lack a couple things. Poor communication. Lack of training. Its not the best work place but it what was offered. Thats all i can say about it.
good,It's a good part time job if you're in school but not really a job you'd want if you actually have bills to pay and need steady career advancement.Overall the experience was beneficial in gaining a healthy understanding of a work environment.
good,i learned a lot about being apart of a team setting and working alongside others and working in a fast passed environment over all it was a good experience
good,fast paced job but fun environment to work in. slightly easy job but can sometimes be stressful. team members get along great and customers are very understanding and helpful.
good,As a first job Wendy's was a great place to learn about the work force environment. It gave me the change to make the first timer mistakes and learn from them.
good,Losve love the job .Mmmm good place good people good management not bad wages . good fast paced makes the day go by fast .. Couldn't ask for a better company
good,Wendy's is not a job for a provider to make a living. Thou it is good for a young person or second job. There is no room for growth and has no order. I won't miss it.
good,"Day usually comprised of being yelled at by either management, customers, or both. Team members were a hit or miss. You were either best friends of mortal enemies. People continuously called out so you were either short handed, or coming in to fill in because they were short handed. Good summer job or short term employment. Would look elsewhere for a long term career."
good,"-enjoyed working at wendy's because of my co-workers"
good,"I have great flexibility in my hours and the management is great. However, there is little to no room for advancement. Regular managers barely earn more than crew members."
good,"As a crew member to shift manager, you can easily have flexibility with hours and there is room to advance your skills as a leader. The pay is fair and the environment is friendly. The day is fast paced and you have to be constantly on your toes to get the customer line down, the faster and accurate the better. People constantly calling off their shifts was a big problem, making others do the job of two people, yet labor management numbers were still high."
good,This is an up and down working environment either your rushing around at lunch hour or cleaning up after the rush. You meet a lot of people and teaches you how to work and get along with a lot of different people. Customer service is a big key to this job.
good,"Busy job, makes the day go fast. I wouldn’t have left if I made a little bit more. I actually loved the job. It was very laid back on the night shift and during the day it was constantly busy."
good,"I ejoyed the people that I worked with, but it has been so long ago that I'm sure management has changed over the years. If I remember correctly you get one free meal, or maybe 50% off of your meal I cant remember"
good,Staff and management are easy to get along with. scheduling is very flexible. little to no benefits is a downfall. good for students who are still attending school.
good,a typical day at wendy's was sometimes good and sometimes bad. You can have wonderful costumers that so nice and patients and then there are some costumers that will yell at you and are rude.It all depends on who comes in.
good,"Back and forth on Cash Register, Sandwich Station, and Fry Station."
good,I had just started working. It was a new job so that I would have money in my pocket. Sometimes the supervisor could be very rude. the employees were very ghetto.
good,Employees argue with one another.  Gm takes favoritism.  A hand few employees work extremely hard while others get away by slacking.  No strick rules which makes it hard for employees to follow the simple ones.
good,It was my first job so it was okay... the brks was short but it kept change in my pocket. It also taught me new things in those 6months of working there as well.. and how to handle issues correctly
good,The work environment was very clique oriented and I did not enjoy my experience while working there. Management wasn't anything special. I knew people from high school when I worked there.
good,"It'll depend on the location, but in general expect a very mediocre and often frustrating experience. The work isn't hard, just tedious and fast paced."
good,"It was fun , the co-works were Friendly , Stayed Busy You Don’t Get overtime , It was drama free , Go On Break Sometimes when wendys ain’t busy and the manger was cool sometimes"
good,A typical day at Wendy's is productive. The morning shift is usually steady is actually tamable. But mid-day and night shifts are usually the stressful shifts because people change their minds last minute or drives off or we don't have enough product so sell. The managers are cool some become more frustrated faster than others but its understanding I mean it is a fast food restaurant. The hardest part about the job is trying to keep the timer down or not having enough product. The most enjoyable part able the job is when there is enough product everyone is in a good mood and labor is slow.
good,the crew was kool back when i work there in high school i only work short hours during school 3 -4 hours three days out of the week but boy was it fun back then coaches use to come wit the whole track team on sunday man i miss those days
good,it was  a good place to work at pay was good working with new people was nice the hardest thing was nothing because the work there is easy you learn new things.
good,At the Wendy's I was employed to I was put through a lot. The manager wasn't as good nor as helpful as the assistant managers. The other workers were to playful and didn't get the job done. Mainly most of the work was on me.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's, and learned a lot about working with the public. My managers stayed on top of things, and were reasonable about scheduling. I was thoroughly trained, and feel as though I learned a lot throughout my time there about how to talk to costumers, how to take orders, and how to work with others. The Wendy's I worked at was right in the middle of a busy part of town, so we stayed very busy, and were faced with a lot of rush hours, so the job was fast-paced."
good,I worked at a wendy's shortly after moving from another state.    It was honestly a stepping stone job for me as i knew that i couldn't work for minimum wage.   Advancement there was based on your personal effort.   So what you put in is what you got.   In the end though its a minimum wage job and the raises weren't significant enough to keep me.
good,Fun peoplet work with no hard work friendly guest we make worken at Wendy's a walk on the wild side everyday we learn something  new from salad  to a new sandwich
good,Wendy's is a great first job. I worked here for two almost three years while I was in school. It taught me to be confident and helped work on my people skills. Definitely change my whole perspective of fast food workers as well.
good,"A typical day was.......typical"
good,"It was a fun work place, like the people I worked with an the customer that I got to know ....I don't have anything else to talk about the manger was cool when I got the hang of things"
good,Decent job if you just finished high school or looking for some extra money on the side. They dont pay a whole lot and no paid time off is another thing as well.
good,It's an okay place to work. It's really fast placed and that was the good thing about it. I think it had to do with your branch and frinchisee. But overall it's a good place to work.
good,ok not great but get free meal if you get called in the work is noy to hard and you get sick days just gotta stay focused on moving up if thats what you want to do
good,This is a great place to work if you are in school or just graduating. Would not make a career out of this place. Management is nice. They keep the restaurant very clean.
good,The work was okay. It was kind of stressful long hours. But the crew was fun to work with. I liked the hustle and bustle flow of things. It was a clean environment. It was troublesome with the distance of which I had to travel to get there everyday.
good,"I personally after so many years of working for the company, I was not impressed not given fair opprutunity to advance. Owner made promise to promote, but never did. That was the 1st time working for the company, then the 2nd time around was about the same. The management there wanted to promote but not retrain, plus promised 40 hours a week quickly went to 50+ a week. Not a good management team I'd say."
good,Management is horrible no communication with the management team. 10 hour shifts for managers with no breaks and I felt as if the pay was extremely unfair for the work I did
good,"Much of the stress in working here was from hounding by upper management. Frequent visits/calls which upset middle management, which upset employees. A lot of false deadlines manufactured to stress people into working hard."
good,"typical day at work was taking orders helping bag food and serve customers or prepare and help bag orders and clean station "
good,"Honestly, in my opinion, Wendy's is not a bad company to work for, there are just times where things can get a little out of hand. There are also times where everyone is a giant family, and I really like that about their environment."
good,"Working for the Schimdt company was fun and facepaced. On the daily there were many task to preform to keep the work place fun, fast, and lightly stressed."
good,You are left on your own with no help or support. It is frustrating when you are overwhelmed and unable to do your duties the way you feel they should be done.
good,I personally was on lobby too much.I did need better communication.Idid get along fairly well with co-workers. They did not have lockers to put your belongings in.
good,Managers are always cutting you slack regardless if you're working hard. Coworkers were cool if you got to know them. You can't expect much working in a fast food restaurant.
good,"It was one of the least favorite job that I had to work. I enjoy where I work at now, but I need more money and a better opportunity for me and my future."
good,This was my first job and i enjoyed my work i learn to become socialize. Meet the standard in every station and give quality products in our customer.
good,a typical day at work consist of opening the shop around 4/5 in the morning. prepping the average amount of food for the day and to start the computer and register systems. you have to interact with customers on a daily basis and take orders. the hardest part of the job is knowing ill have insufficient hours for the week to provide for myself no matter how hard or efficient I work.
good,Working at Wendy's was my first job and I learned how to handle food and provide excellent customer service. I learned how to quickly give change to customers and train hired employees.
good,"Work days were long shifts and breaks were hit or miss depending on the business or staff that day, certain managers had no motivation for work and expected the crew to do it all, it was a good experience for a first job that showed me what I wanted in a job (hard working, positive co-workers, clean stations, etc.) vs. what I don't want (poor attitude individuals, inconsistent and unreliable scheduling and co-workers, etc.)."
good,The job is good . The team made me feel comfortable & we all work togeather . We had a very diverse team and it is a safe working place . I learned a lot of new things .
good,It's okay. But I personally do way to much work for them to be paying me minimum wage. I literally run the store but applied for grill cook. I came with experience but paid as newbie. The managers all run the store differently and it interferes with my routine of coming to work. I'm not complaining but personally I think the store needs and upgrade top to bottom. It wasn't until I started working there the store got clean... Just saying.
good,Could hAve been cleaner but over all it was a good place to worked. Easy to learn the job. I enjoyed most the people who worked there the manager was great. I recommend working there.
good,"A typical day at work consists of filling orders to the back, handling cash or cards, making drinks, filling nugget and fry cartons, operating the deep fryer, pressure cooker, assembling salads, changing frosty machine, counting register, working drive through, exchanging money, cleaning floor-room, cleaning dirty trays, docks/supplies etc."
good,Wendy's is a very easy job. If you like high paced than it is a good job for you. The management is not the greatest depending on who you work with. The most enjoyable thing about working there is the people you meet.
good,It was ok looking at the salaries reported I was under paid and worked very hard as a general manager. Its an ok company though Sea World was free ha!
good,The people sucked to be around even at work. Always being put down and just horrible work place. The new hires would just be thrown right in management sucked and no one really liked working there
good,It a work place that you have a good an bad day. They are concerned with how your doing personally. It is a fast paced work place that tea he's you your skills that need working on for you to get better. It like the more you work hard the more faster an easier it can get.
good,A typical work day would be Having to take orders either through the drive thru or the front counter. Having to prep food in the morning and cleaning the restaurant in the morning of the start of the shift or late night when closing. I learned how to use fryers and how to use kitchen appliances.I also learned how to use the cash register when taking costumers orders or money. The management is very poor and unorganized at times. The work place culture is very uptembo and fast. The hardest part of the job is having to be able to multitask. The most enjoyable thing about this job is having free food and working with some good fellow employee's.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, but upper management tends to dump the majority of the work on the lower management, and they in turn get burnt out trying to constantly fix the issues that occur. I love my regular customers, but it's not worth the stress!!"
good,"Wendy's is the only fast-food workplace I have ever worked, but I have been there for about 4 years and counting and although at times it is rough and stressful. I consider it one of the best. The overall food is good and the people are fun, it definitely makes the day go by faster. I've grew over the years of working there. I have learned self control and optimism. It's important to be able to multi-task and learn quick in the fast food workplace. Guests like when they can tell you exactly what they want and the workers know exactly how to transfer their order to get what they desired. So it can be stressful for not only the guest but the employee as well. Sometimes we are short handed and you have to do more than one thing, it gets very tiring."
good,"I like the pay system with the debit card and the half price on anything is also a nice benefit, but if you are new and not working a manger role you will get significantly less hours than you asked for."
good,When I first started management sucked but as time progress we were given new management which improved the store and working conditions but overall this company does not take care of there employees great starting job for teenagers though
good,"Wendy's offers flexible hours including morning, day, and night shifts. A typical day would include serving customers, several cleaning tasks and working at fast-paces to keep up with the fast food requirements. If working at the company long enough you can move up into shift management. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with the high demand of customers. However overall, if you are trained properly, it is easy to learn different positions and work efficiently there."
good,"Depending on the store you work at, the management is often questionable. We are almost always understaffed or have poorly trained workers. Usually your shift supervisor will assign you a position for the time being (you will probably be moved around.) Also, Just because you are assigned to one position does not mean you can't help out your coworkers. This often happens and makes the work load significantly heavier for the other workers. Again depending on where you are working your coworkers will be the most enjoyable part about this job. Also not all Wendy's store are up-to-date on improvements; such as equipment and design."
good,"Many employees wouldn't show up on their shift, so it would become very backed up very daily.  I was asked to stay longer than my shift was because of people leaving early. Hardest part of the job was when one of the managers would let a worker leave early, then when it got really busy I was the only one working front counter with angry customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning different positions."
good,Every busy and don't really use team work. Some days are every stressful. Wait times are long because of no team work or organization in the store. Needs more work on team work.
good,Wendy's is a good place to start but I need a change. 32 years is a long time in the fast-food chain. Don't get me wrong there were some nice customer s .I myself just needed a change.
good,"Working in fast food was perhaps the most demanding experience of my life. The inconsistent pace and unpleasant atmosphere made the day feel a lot longer than it was. Difficult to work with coworkers make the lunch rush especially stressful, despite the job itself being simple enough. Being able to help provide quality food was still satisfying on a good day, but tough pacing and troublesome coworkers make it a bit inaccessible."
good,"Fast food is a hard job , yea there is harder but dealing with hungry people while u might not be having a good day can stress you out it wasn't all bad tho"
good,"Company sucks but workers are amazing. Too little pay for amount of  work. upper management  forces you to work in unsafe conditions. if coworkers werent there, wouldve left months ago"
good,"A typical day at Wendy's starts with coming in with clean shave and presentable( cleaned ) uniform, then you clock in and instantly start working where you are assigned for the day, greeting everyone with a smile and hospitality. The hardest about Wendy's is closing the store most likely. The second part of being the hardest is the rush at random times throughout the day, while keeping the smile, fresh food, posture, and food coming out quickly."
good,"I feel like working for Wendy's I was overworked and under payed!! I did the work of three people"
good,"The particular Wendy's I worked at no longer exists, it was replaced by a Starbucks. The computers were extremely outdated, as well as the cleaning supplies. I've seen better computers at other Wendy's restaurants, so my experience might not have been typical. It was a minimum wage cashier job, where I also had to prepare some minor food items and clean the restaurant before closing up. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. "
good,"Prepped food for opening, ran cash in drive thru and at front counter. Swept and mopped floors for closing did dishes. Hardest part of job was getting up early to be in."
good,my overall review of wendys was it was okay only thing i was disatified with was that i wasnt being allowed to expand my abilities switch up positions each day as a crew member like i was there
good,"Its a fast food job so you cannot expect much. No raises, ever. No room for advancement. stuck at minimum wage with very poor hours. But like i said. just like any other fast food job"
good,"Your constantly in motion either you are cooking, taking orders, or helping drive thru move as fast as possible with no mistakes. I learned everything there was to know so that I was able to be strong in an area that the crew was weak in that day. Hardest part was keeping up on which order was which and dealing with the customers. Easiest part was making the food."
good,"working to satisfy collage students witch are the customers. Very involved with the university. Serving customers by taking orders, making orders, bagging up orders, and as well as handing orders out."
good,Fast paced environment management was ok. pay was not. you learned all areas of the restaurant. I liked the people i worked with. I guess that what it comes down to.
good,"Its nice having a chance to learn about the fast food environment and seeing how things work. I meet a lot of interesting people here. My favorite part about the job is definitely the fifty percent discount I get on food. But my least favorite part is how immature, impatient, and downright ignorant people can be sometimes. As a part of the Wendys corporation, our job is to put the customers first. Its pretty sad when even the managers are downright rude to people for ordering slow or even just asking for too much food. And they can treat new employees really mean, just to put it mildly. Along with the fact that there's almost no room for advancement. People work here for 10 years and never become a manager. I've learned a lot from my time here and I don't regret it, but I would like to move on to a different business where I can find better opportunities."
good,"The days I'm working is easy because all i do is take orders, run the orders, clean the trays, tables, and sweep the floor. It's a fun job when your co-workers are there to help you whenever you need the help and are willing to answer questions you have."
good,Had the opportunity to be a part of a company who provided services to customers and kept them intrigued by the menu served. Countless days were spent with long hours on the grill with minimal interaction with customers but the occasional smile.
good,This was my first job i had ever had. The manager wasn't very nice to the employee's who didn't speak spanish. She started cutting hours to those employee's.
good,It wasn't to bad. Its fast food so there isn't much of rising in the chain. It was a good learning experience of customer satisfaction. Had to move fast pace is some cases
good,Working for Wendy's was not the funnest opportunity given. I found joy relating with customers when I had the free time. The roles and responsibilities do not change much. It made some days really repetitive.
good,dealing with hormonal teens was not something I wanted to do right out of college. the pay did not equate to the amount of work that they expected from you
good,I like working at wendys but they let me go as soon as a got sick and I was pregnant and no workers compensation and it wasn't a good work environment
good,"nice staff and customers, even though it is a fast paced fast food restaurant. there is still a sense of clam. nothing to overwhelming. probably the best fast food job Ive had."
good,Wendy's was a very good place for me to start working. It was my first job full time that I had. I started my senior year in high school. I drove there after school and went home around midnight and sometimes worked weekends. It taught me organization management discipline and to prioritize.
good,It was a great learning experience in the field of fast food working. I enjoyed the job it sometimes turned into too much to do. And they would keep me super late on school nights.
good,"The pay is horrible, and should be revised. The company usually has many hours to give each week. Its definitely hard work and days can be very long. If you don't have many bills this is a good job to have."
good,I already had a job when i start and they were willing to work around my other schedule. they would send you home easy when work was slow with was nice since i already had a second job but i could understand how people lived with this as their only job. they give one free meal every shift of any comb
good,Unprofessional the management didnt know how to do there jobs. Hire people willing to do the right job professionally and leave there personal lives out the door.
good,while I worked for wendys I received little to no hours. maybe 10 hours a week at the most. I was barely on the schedule and quickly became frustrated.
good,"I worked for Wendy's for quite some time. I went to high school and worked at nights and weekends. I would take orders, take care of the customer, and prepare the guests orders. The customer comes first!"
good,"My management team is a very big let down however, before giving my 2 weeks in, a really bright assistant manager showed up and seemed to actually know what he was doing. It's a decent place to start working however, if there are tons of high-school students, work ethic management may be difficult."
good,"Busy"
good,Working in multiple positions available in the restaurant. Good for entry level work as a young person. Good place to have to help build a good resume.
good,I like working for wendys. im currently there i wish i could progress but i dont think wendys is a permanant place to stay at.  I can't pay my rent on this salary.
good,They gave a lot of work for little pay. Management would always have something to say about what you were doing. They didn't give anyone a chance to try to do anything before jumping in and saying get busy.
good,"A typical day would be where there were only a few workers at each station. However, I am very good at multitasking when the lines are long. I am friendly and many of my customers always leave a positive feedback about me. At work, you'll have to make sure your station is clean, re-stock items like ketch-up, napkins, and so forth. As a cashier, I take orders down and greet the customers. The hardest part of the job is when I have to be a cashier, make coffee, bag items, cook items such as fries and nuggets all at once because we were tight on staff so often. The management wasn't so bad because he or she would help us get some of the things done. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting customers and talking with them about our sale items."
good,"Wendys is great as a starting job, some managers are decent. Advancement doesn't happen often and pay is low since it is a fast food job. I would definitely recommend this to a young person as a first job."
good,I prepared food for all the workers to be able to give the customers everything they needed to have a good experience with the restarunt they made sure we got our breaks on time and a discount on the food I had a very good boss that would always do their best to make sure the day went smouth
good,"Wendy's used to be a great place to work for. Now greed is commonplace. This greed led to unrealistic goals which eventually led to bad morale on the managers then made its way to the crew members, then the customers got bad customer service in result.I work with great coworkers but upper management makes it very difficult to enjoy working there."
good,"It was enough of a job to get me through but there's nothing about it that's particularly surprising or special. It was fast paced, good staff, hard work, what else can I say?"
good,"Busy all day long. I love to hear Truck drivers tell their stories about the highway. The only thing I dislike about the job is when the manager who schedule to work graveyard shift call out and I always end up working it. I get the same pay cause I'm a salary manager. This place really took advantage of my stupidity cause I was way underpaid.  Which lead me to appreciate them for teaching me a lesson of life, that everybody isn't always honest."
good,"It's a good job to start off at if you're a teen still in school, or just graduated, but its not a job suitable to live off. It's fast food, so expect  to be a part timer. You can't really go over a certain amount of hours because most of everyone is part time unless you're a manger."
good,This is a great job for anyone who doesnt mind varying shifts and enjoys working in the food industry. I thought this job taught me a lot and gave me a good start in the management field.
good,"First, it is necessary for Employees to be dressed in the proper uniforms and shoes when they go on shift (shoes are very important, If there is a grease spill then someone could get hurt). Once the crew member is ready for the day, they go about preparing the food for the lunch rush. That could be anything from chopping the lettuce for the salads to making sure that the sandwich station is stocked. It largely depends on what was left-over to do from the day before. When the first wave comes, everyone needs to be at their stations and working hard and fast to ensure that the line is kept moving both inside the restaurant and in the drive-through. Teamwork is the first thing that you learn to priorities while working at Wendy's, as everyone's job is the key to having a functioning restaurant. Through my experience of the workplace, it can be very tense during the peak hours, yet the slower times can be a bit dull. It is hard to find something to do, but usually there is always something that needs to be done if you are willing to look hard enough."
good,Management wasn't the best...Store wasn't clean sometimes. People didn't do their job right. I didn't enjoy working there. People were not treat with respect a lot of the time.
good,the whole management staff is bogus none of them really care about the employees and some show favoritism a few of them talk down to the employees and take their position to the head
good,"- Be at work on-time."
good,"Not the best place I've ever worked, but I've definitely worked at worse too. Overall a very mediocre job without a whole lot of room to move up or get promoted."
good,"A typical day at work was making the food. Flipping burgers, frying fries or nuggets, at the cash register (window or front) and cleaning. Very busy environment, have to keep up with the work."
good,"If you are in managing your working 10 hours days, 5 days a week.  Culture can be up or down depending on staff and customer pay is not good for how much you have to deal with"
good,"Half of my coworkers were friendly and nice, 3/4 of the managers sneaky and unprofessional. Decent pay though and good hours, Sometimes free lunch on a good day."
good,"Fast working job, mandatory to multi task. Clean working area. Nice appearance and good greeting to costumers. Zero tolerance for late or no show workers."
good,"The HR was great, but the managers were unprofessional. Outside drama was brought into work, causing issues among employees and managers. The older employees were very friendly and made sure to include new workers and provide help whenever needed."
good,"I collected money in exchange for food, made sure customers were satisfied. I also made sure the restaurant was cleaned at the end of the night.I like to take on new task, I'm a very fast learner"
good,Management is very bossy i have been an employee of wendys for 4 years and have not recieved a raise. My hours are very shorten unless help is needed. Looking for a company i can give my best to
good,"A typical day at Wendy's was making burgers or taking orders. This job was the most stressful. Although I worked good under stress, it was always something to do. I honestly didn't like it because it was fast food. You had to work in a very, very high pace. I loved the job experience though. I was able to gain customer service and work under stress a lot."
good,It was my first job I  was excited and every position I did was great for me. I got to do something and when my co-workers needed help I was there because I knew what to do in that position.
good,"Wendy's was my first job. I stayed for about 6 months and honestly can't really complain too much. I mean, what do you really expect out of a fast food job? It's going to be stressful and you're not going to get a lot of money, but it really isn't that bad. Most generally you can overcome the obstacles you have to deal with and get though your job. I don't think it could have been more of a fun job though, looking back on it. Can sort of goof off a lil as long as you're not doing anything dumb. I laughed a bunch during my shifts. Co-workers become your family sort of cause you're all going though the same struggle. Etc."
good,"I Personally Dislike Wendy's Because They Never Paid Me I Worked For free ,I Never Got My Work Number , But It's A Great Team Building Experience ,Great Start In The Work Life"
good,"Wendys...where do I start? It's fast food. The environment is fast paced,  and is easier if you know how to multitask well. Management is luck of the draw; the main reason I quit Wendy's was that they switched my General manager to someone with rocks for brains. Lord forbid you try to get HR to fix anything, either."
good,"A typical day was extremely hectic."
good,"I worked here the summer I turned 16. It was a great summer job. I did have to work late nights which threw off my sleep schedule. I tried working here during school, but they had me work too much too late. I got strep a couple of time from overworking myself."
good,Overall not a bad employer. Staff had interaction with management and District Managers to help train staff and to keep the open door policy. Management is a little different for each location and different management styles.
good,"-Worked in the drive thru, there were a lot of rude customers"
good,"Job doesn't pay much, but if your needing a job while going to school this is a good place to start looking. Very flexible work schedule, and if you need your schedule changed for any reason, they are willing to figure something out, as long as you give a heads up notice on it."
good,"Overall the crew itself wasn't so bad. Very fast paced, keeps you on your toes. Management could definitely improve. Favoritism was a major part in why I myself left."
good,If your a high school student just looking to get your foot in the door this is for you. I you are in college and looking for advancement this is not for you.
good,"They were very flexible with my school and theatre schedule. I did not enjoy working there as much as I have at other jobs, but it was still a good place to work at. It was fairly busy during the day and sometimes at night. I enjoyed making friends with my regular customers, but I got tired of working around so much grease."
good,New store at a new location. Was able to attend school and work at night. Front Cashier associate. Requires great customer service. ..................
good,"They're management was lousy and you could tell they were always struggling to put meals together. I was very disatisfied the most with management. Once they switched management the manger wouldn't give me the same amount of hours as the other one did, and I always struggled to get my well deserved hours."
good,Wendys is a good place to work for. I have worked for them for 15 years. It's upbeat and things are always changing. It has been a very good place to learn. I have learned allot from the company and am ready to move on.
good,I didn't get enough hours working there the gave me very poor hours and management sucked i wouldn't refer somebody to work here at all. They were poorly run.
good,"Bad work environment, inconsistent schedules. Sub par management. Short breaks, no healthcare benefits, Little to no chance of promotions. Low salary."
good,One of the first jobs i had was a greatbplace to learn from and gain good work experience helped learn second languange. Also did events in the community as well
good,Fun job i am a people person and i love to interact with people. I learned how to have more patience with people in the environment that i worked in and generally how to put up with fast food production.
good,This position can teach many skills that one can have with them the rest of there life.  Coordination and speech quality as well as book keeping skills.
good,"As the company was understaffed at the time I was not given adequate training and was therefore uncomfortable working there.  However, the staff was friendly and helpful when they were able to help me.  The hardest part of the job was when you messed up an order and had to throw out the whole sandwich, and we have starving people on the streets.  It was hard because you had to start all over and you were behind.  If you are unable to handle stress and deadlines this is not the job for you."
good,"Wendy's is a an overall good workplace, it has nice employees and laid back managers as long as youre doing your job, but the grease everywhere and the constant smell of food isnt pleasant after you work there long enough."
good,"Overall, the culture is warm and friendly but it is relatively old-fashioned. That said, they are in the process of becoming more progressive and are trying to focus more on the development of their employees."
good,They  treat the crew like they are disposable. An that they can treat u any way they want. An it is not very professional in the workplace everyone tells everybodies business. That includes the managers
good,"It's a good job for those in highschool trying to make some money to fool around with, but anything more isn't worth it, the pay isn't enough, to really support yourself, if you happen to work in a region where locals tend to have an additude be prepared to force a smile and take an insult, if your working nights be prepared to deal with numerous drug addicts and alcoholics"
good,"Boring job, management can be moody. Doesn't like when you request off. Good hours. Minimum wage pay. Can be extremely busy most of the day. Sometimes understaffed."
good,Daily I would find it so hard to have motivation to go to work. I personally think there was way too much drama there. I didn't wish to work there anymore but because me and my father were the only ones bringing in income to the house i couldn't quit for a while.
good,"managers where not great people to get along with. coworkers where all right. fast peace work is what i like. last night shifts with good pay was great, an took on a lot of responsibility an in mouths become supervisor."
good,A great place to work if you want to build up your work experience also take on more responsibility lets just put it this way its a great place and a good chance at doing something productive in your life.
good,You have to be willing to work with food and nasty clients. never know if they will change the hours and/or take away hours depending on sales. But its a great job for first experience.
good,it was a good first job the money wasn't good i only did 8 an hour and i did a lot for them they played a lot and the place was always dirty the people there werent very producted
good,work hard for you to enable to get the people's trust. always smile and be kind to everyone especially to your coworkers. Everyone helps each other. Team work!
good,Working at Wendy's wasnt my best job. I barely got any hours and when i did get scheduled it would come at a time where i would be very busy outside of work with my family at the last minute.
good,when i first started working for Wendy's it was so fun but as the months go by it seemed that i started not to like the job so much anymore.
good,It was an incredibly fast-paced job though i could not stand most of the management and their strategies. there were multiple times where I thought if I were running things there would be more efficient flow of customers.
good,"I had to quit because the late nights I would be closing and it took about 2 hours to do so. The latest I had to leave was about three am, but i had school the next day, so I had to wake up at six in the morning."
good,Nothing to hard about it. You will get rude customers but you must have to know how to deal with the situation. They give you okay hours. All about team work.
good,Not anyone worked together as one to complete the orders and there were individuals who would do whatever they wanted. other than that it was a good job.
good,I continuously found managers to be dishonest and very disrespectful. They often broke many policies that the company was so proud of. I hated working for this company and plan on never returning.
good,"Wendy's overall is a pretty fun place to work as long as you have the right manager and team. Most Wendy's are very clean and sanitary but some of them are just a graveyard of old food. Customers are pretty cool and the registers are easy as pie to use, it even shows you pictures."
good,"Good place to start a job in customer service field. Very flexible wit shifth scheduling to meet your needs. Easy training, fast paced work environment. Friendly co-workers"
good,Lots of working and training with people no time for family but the money is good. Mostly everyone works as a team. Just not much vacation or family time
good,The management was alright.They had a lot of high school kids there and only thing they was doing was playing around.The hard part was when the food wasn't right they got on me because i was the cashier.
good,You'll meet a lot of good people working here. They invest minimally in their employees so don't expect competitive pay or benefits. It's easy to advance through at least low level management but you'll get more for your effort almost anywhere else. They do work around schedules so I can recommend this job as a secondary job for a few extra dollars.
good,Definitely a good work environment for someone just starting out. I would recommended this job for a someone in high school. The pay definitely wasn't enough.
good,"Fast food sucks, but if you need a job with flexible hours that isn't demanding this is a good one. 'Management is okay I witnessed theft from managers on multiple occasions that was ignored by the gm."
good,"It's ok wish we had more people and better mangers, great crew friendly crew and coustmers. Look forward to coming to work and coming back the next day."
good,This is a fun and nice place to work. It's great for an starting position. The staff is ok and management is cool. The hours are great and convenient for me.
good,I've worked here off and on for a few years. The people are great but it is a non stop soap opera. the management will do anything to make sure that you are happy.
good,Wendys is a great place to work when you need a job while your in school but now im graduated i would like to move up and make a little more money and also not be dealing with fast food anymore.
good,"A typical day a Wendy`s was always fast paced and busy."
good,I enjoy working but I was out for about a week and a half and got yelled at for it because I was in the hospital due to personal reasons it was fun working there I got along with the other employees just didn't pay well and the general manager was really strict
good,Management never followed scheduled. I always got off 2 or 3 hrs late. Coworkers are easy to get to get along with. My overall work experience was great.
good,A fast paced and challenging restaurant where there is always opportunities to learn and develop personally.  The hardest part of the job is balancing management responsibilities while short staffed requiring the manager to be locked into a position.  The most enjoyable part of the job is coaching a developing good work ethics in young crew members.
good,J'ai aimé travailler chez Wendy's parce que les gens la bas ils sont gentille
good,It's a great environment. I think it's really easy to make great friends you can get along with anybody there. I have been for years and have always enjoyed my team
good,When I worked for this company about half the managers would be able to change any employees bad mood into a good one.  When I left only one manager would even try.
good,I liked working there but it was hectic all the time like there was no order I would be able to get some work done but a lot of it I had to wait on other people to do there jobs before I could get mime done
good,Typical was fast paced. Learned to cook and fry on massive scale. Manager (D.M.) is very strict. Co-workers have their days. Hardest part is opening. Most enjoyable part is while on break everything is half off.
good,a typical day at work is easy and okay for me because I stay to myself and do what I'm suppose to do and go home at the end of my shift
good,"A typical day at work was usually the same, serving customers either with front cash or drive-through, and mainly closing at night. I learned speed, and multitasking. Management is a bit harsh and always seemed to pick on me for never meeting their standards, even though I was pushing my limits. Most of my co-workers were very introverted, but there were a few I got along with well. Hardest part of my job was dealing with all the bad things I was told about myself. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing all the amazing types of people that came in."
good,"I started here as a sandwich maker, to cook. Ten to a supervisory position , and from there onto assistant manager. No two days were ever the sae. I learned bout labour cost, food cost  , payable taxes , WCB, and so much more"
good,"I liked my job because I could always look forward to a paycheck, but the store it's self was very drama filled, not a fun place to work no one was really professional. Thankful for my opportunity in advancing to a new position but I'm glad to be no longer be apart of the staff"
good,"good place to work, good bennies, a bit hectic at times. always something different to work on, from cooking equipment to refrigeration to plumbing to rooftop units. never boring"
good,I work in a fast food restaurant and I am constantly taking orders. I help with taking people's orders and get their orders out fast. The hardest part of my job is that there is sometimes a communication problem between the customer and the order taker. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing regular customers and talking to them.
good,The only real problem I have with working here is the lack of steady hours. Shifts would be all over the place and my body had a really hard time adjusting.
good,"When I worked at Wendy's we were with each other more than our families and it brought us to our Wendy's family. You work together, challenge each other, and also learn from each other. Learn how to multitask and handle fast-paced environments."
good,They only had me work so many days out of the week and I only worked for about 2-3 hours. The coworkers and managers didn't do a lot of work but only played and lolly gagged around the entire time.
good,"Opening hours, clean environment. Nice staff. Fast pace. Clean environment. Friendly people,good food.Great discounts.Hardest part was the constant business. Enjoyed co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in and being greeted by my co-workers, and clocking in on-time. Then I would continuously start my shift with all my co-workers and managers that are working with me. I didn't necessarily fit in when I was working with this company, only because they barely knew me, and they barely ever gave me hours. I only got hours on Saturday's and Sunday's for maybe the last 6 weeks that I worked there. And before that, it was almost every day of the week."
good,"A typical day at work for me was to go in and see smile faces on everyone, the customers most of the time were happy. I learned that no matter what the customer is always right at Wendys. The management and the co-workers were very friendly and great people to be around. There wasnt really a hard part about it, the Wendys team in Barrie helped each other out with everything, they're a great team. The most enjoyable part of my job was making sure the customers got what they needed, and made sure they were happy and would want to come back again."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's consisted of cleaning, cooking, and preparing food in a friendly, clean, and fresh food environment. Making relationships with customers would cause them to always come back to see you, and get a meal."
good,"Typical day would be a few customers coming in here and there. Sometimes you get crazy ones that endanger the safety of the place. "
good,Overseeing restaurant and having total store awareness. Nice place to work and meet people. Co workers are very easy to get along with. Can be very challenging at times when you are short staffed. Ongoing training and cross-training of employees/managers are needed  on a daily basis .
good,"Extremely busy, often understaffed. Learned register operation and customer communication. Management changes often. Coworkers, when trained properly, are great. Hardest part is being understaffed and broken equipment not being repaired in a timely manner. Most enjoyable would be the friendly customers and hard working crew members."
good,it was my first job it was okay they only thing I didn't agree on is the manager getting in my personal life after hours the co-workers are good the most enjoyable this at that job is I like working the cash register
good,"I loved the people I worked with.  I love interacting with customers on a regular basis.  I like to make people smile and I tend to go out of my way to help people get what they need.  The work was very taxing for a minimum wage position, and advancement within the company seemed almost unattainable.  Low-level management seemed generally unsatisfied with how much they were paid for the amount of work they were required to do."
good,It helped expand my customer serivces skills. But it didn't give me enuff hours to work or days. But other than that the job was ok.
good,I believe Wendys was a good job. It was fun and i had a good time every shift i was on. Sometimes me and the manager did not get along but we talked it out at the end of the day.
good,I got a good experience . Its a good pay . You work under pressure constantly which does help you to bulid yhat skill 100% . Fantastic to work as a team.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Wendys. It was fun and my co-workers were like my family. They were always so welcoming and caring. We always tried our best to keep smiles and positivity on our faces and actions. We were always courteous to our customers and greeted them with a nice hello, how are you doing? and what can i get for you today? We had several regular customers that i became very familiar with over time. The most enjoyable part of the job would probably be when we closed down for the night and cleaned the store. We could relax and have fun on a professional level. We would joke around and talk. We wouldn't have to rush or wear our headsets. Management was sometimes hard to deal with but i loved my managers because they were very professional especially under so much stress. They were very efficient and quick. I learned a lot while working for this company. One of the most important things i learned while working here is that the customers is always right. No matter what you should try to make your customer as happy as possible so they will come back and so that they will tell their friends to come and visit. It wasn't just about getting a customers money it was about establishing a relationship with the customers. Also trying to get them to return time and time again."
good,Wendy's is a fast-food restaurant but they focus on mainly the quality of the food rather than the time the food is being served. Employees are fun to work with because they come from different culture and you learn new things from each other.
good,not much to say about them except i loved the customers and the employees. It was fast food and there were many challenges but you get through them with a positive attitude and determination to get through your day only focusing on the customers happiness because at the end of the day the customers are the only ones that matter.
good,"Usually spend the shift working to make sure the store is running and making a profit, in whatever way needed, whether it is running the grill or the register. I learned a lot about customer service, and how to manage money. My coworkers are pretty nice, no complaints. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy, and we fall behind, trying to keep up with the demand. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it slows down and we have time to be thorough and stock up/clean."
good,I wouldn't work there again but the time was great while I was there only problem there was too much drama. i quit when i went to school
good,"I used to work there for how many years but the store manager there is not respectful to her employees. She don't know the meaning of respect. She keep on embarrasing her managers in front of the crew which is not right. She wants the manager to work everything such as mopping floors at night, do extra cleaning while the crew will just do standing. This is not a healthy environment here because there is a ""BLAME GAME"" here that can contribute to turn down your confidence and self-esteem."
good,Workplace was good with most crew working together and getting along. Issues between some crew and managers. Not hard to catch on to the work and learned to work in a fast paced environment.
good,"the day was nice. I learned how to take orders it the drive-thu window."
good,"every morning someone will come in to prepare the store for the day. once getting the store together, most manager's will add more work for the worker to do before 10am.. Once you don't have the time to do that, they want you to rush to get online to work. By that time everyone is back up, and no help at times. About management, depends on who is working sometimes don't do the job right or just don't help at all. If they do help, its always a rush to help the frontline or the window. The hardest part of the job is when you help one person and that person sometimes will help. Most of the co-workers are helpful when it comes to teamwork. The enjoyable about the job is when the customer is happy and will come back."
good,its a job that was having problems and management wasnt very good. didnt run very well. manager didnt schudle right. co-works complain as well as management. i enjoyed working with and meeting new people.
good,it was a nice job and i learned alot freom working there. and also they taught me a lot about working in fast food. they were nice people an they treated me very nice.
good,"I work well with other co-workers. Great team leader. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer happy."
good,It was pretty good for a first job.  It usually wasn't that bad but it could get bad.  Some were lazy and it can get on your nerves
good,Worked for a franchised partner.   good ole boy management style vs people fairness leading.  Do as I say or else. work work work and work.
good,"I didn't have a pleasant time at Wendy's because my manager wasn't understanding and patient with new employees. Wendy's employer and employees, took their jobs seriously and they had great team work."
good,Very productive but we were always short staffed which required me to take on several roles at once. Closings were long and unnecessarily delayed. Constantly sending home different workers to cut labor costs.
good,"A typical workday at Wendy's would be working the first window, taking the customers money, and washing the dishes. I eventually moved to the front line and drive-thru. "
good,A typical workday was sometime busy and sometimes slow but often times just really busy just because it was fast food. The hardest part about this was managing rush hour and being able to slow yourself down to handle it all.
good,"A long, greasy day frying up fries and nuggets and flipping burgers off the clam shell cooker. I acquired most of my customer communication skills from this job, as most people can get pretty irate over either me, the sandwich prep or the customer forgot what they wanted on their sandwich. Management was on point, at ease but on point, no friendship. The co-workers all had a reason to be, no one could just stop without either prior heads up or without messing the work flow. Cleaning all the equipment at the end of the night was pretty rough, but working the cash register and drive thru was pretty simple."
good,Manager was very rude however other co-workers were quite the opposite. Was mostly an enjoyable work enviornment. Hours were decent and the customers are always wonderful.
good,"A typical day would be me being on the cash register and cleaning the dishes. Other times, I would get buns and bacon. Management was nice and they understood that I was new to everything but at times, they would make it seem that cleaning specific cookware is common knowledge such as the pressure cooker. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with the drive thru especially during the last hour of my shift where there would be a large rush and the dishes would pile up. The most enjoyable part was that I had some friends here and there I knew from school."
good,"Fast paced, love meeting and interacting with different people. Love to be a leader, awesome people person! Try to make my shift enjoyable to everyone but maintain my leadership. I try and get along with everyone."
good,"A lot of the workers didn't do their job right, people were slow and sometimes mean. I didn't enjoy working there very much, it was fine for being in high school and needing some extra money but that was about it."
good,Being in a new town I would say that Wendys was a good place to start. Nice group of people to work with and understanding managers that work with your schedule.
good,"working there was okay, in the sense that I liked interacting with the customers and some of the co-workers.  but management was lacking on there people skills."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wendys house childcare, It was a warm comfortable family home where the children found that wendys house was like their second home."
good,"At Wendys I was a shift coordinator who supervised and ran variety of shifts from opens to close.  My day at work would be the usually organizing of the shift from placement of the team members to preparing products to serve.  As well as running the floor during the shift helping in areas needed like drive thru, front counter, food preparation and prep.  I learned a lot each and every day due to things always changing.  My management staff for the most part were on the same page as others and sometimes bumped head.  The team members were good, we had many different types such as students to full time regular staff and they all had different personalities.  The hardest part of the job was that the shifts were all over the place.  I truely enjoyed the customers and servicing them."
good,"I attended work every scheduled day, and worked many days not scheduled. In the middle of the worst snow season in 25 years, I fell to sickness and because i didn't walk sick a mile through 2 and a half feet of snow was fired.:)"
good,making customers satisfy . doing whats best for the restaurant to grow more with our co-workers . needs more inprovement on serious manageing .
good,Wendys was an enjoyable place to work. The people were nice and they would teach you how to do the cooking or how to make the burgers in the best way possible
good,overall review management was poor but good work place fun good employees only down fall is they have no standard or set shifts
good,"Food well cooked and hot. Restaurant is clean. Management and staff are fine, Experience in the establishment is good enough."
good,Over all the work place environment was shallow and tedious:( the employees were not team players. The boss over all was great ! really listened to the opinions of all the workers.
good,"Wendy's was a typical entry level job experience for me. I was rewarded for hard work, and offered promotion opportunities."
good,"I served customers, used the cash register, and did general housekeeping duties. I wasn't there long enough to really catch on  to the operating procedures of the establishment."
good,It is a good starter job but in the long run you wouldn't go anywhere in the company without school that they didnt work with employees to obtain.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's really wasn't the most inviting place to go to. Everyone I worked with seemed to be tired of their working conditions and I was too, but through all the hours given I learned a lot. This was my first job ever so I learned how to work as a cashier, how to give people great customer service, and perform at an elite level. The managers that taught were productive, but they were real abrasive. My coworkers and I got along just fine and we all had a common goal and that was to be the best we can be for the customers. The hardest part of my job was cleaning the bathrooms; The bathroom quality was terrible and it got worse throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of my working experience there was working at the cash register making people's days better."
good,Typical day at work long hard hours not enough workers.I learned to be a example to speak louder and not let people walk all over me. Had a family and good friends. Enjoyed working with my co workers.
good,"It's a fun place to work with and getting to know new customers and employees. I enjoy working in multi tasking, it's gets exciting and moving around the store. The most important thing about this job is to greet every customers and making sure that they are satisfies of what they ordered and walk out happy."
good,"There was a lot of things to do each day, it was good learning as i go just was kind of hard when product has to be restocked. At least I got along with my co workers."
good,"Very organized place to work in, respected managers.  Drama started to happen and everyone was getting in trouble so I quit."
good,"Great managers who support your learning and love to make sure you understand your duties. Constant work, no down time excluding mandatory breaks, wonderful place to work if you need to keep busy 100% of the time"
good,Wendy's was a very fast paced work environment. It was my first customer service job so I learned a lot of new things. The management wasn't always very organized but my co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job had to be learning to be very fast and multitasking at all times.
good,"The typical day as part of the crew entailed making sure that the inside and outside of the restaurant was prepared for customers, and organized to run a busy station during rush periods at the beginning of the day.  At the end of the day, the crew were responsible for cleaning all stations for the next business day, as well as keeping certain ingredients prepared in cooling for their need."
good,"Wendy's was a great first job. They taught me time management, dedication, and adaptability. They have generally good management, and room for you to grow. What I didn't like about Wendy's was the pay. I had been there for at least 3 years and never got a raise, but for a student or first time job, this is a good place to start."
good,"Working at Wendys helped me refresh a few things about myself. I quickly learned several positions in shorts amount of time, and was willing to learn more. Co-workers were very humorous and fun to be around. They taught me a lot  and showed me a lot. My manager was a wonderful person with a outstanding personality. She always put herself in my shoes when it was a problem to understand it reasonably, and rarely got angry. Those unique characteristics of her helped me be a better worker."
good,"While this job doesn't give you much ""home-life"", it's still a paycheck. A rather small one at that. It's almost enough to live off of if you're single without kids. I found it almost impossible to live on my own without assistance. I was working full-time hours, sometimes more than that, while making the very minimum wages."
good,"employees treated like garbage, smallest break space cause it isnt a room its just a whole in the wall with a microwave and i feel like my meal should be free if not atleast my discount should work more than once and everyday not just the day i work and once that day that is not the way to treat the people that slave everyday"
good,I had a lot of fun working there they would make sure that every one is comfortable and they make it a fun experience and place to work
good,"I clean dishes, I make food to order, keep things moving.  I have learned the computer system the different order requirements.  My co workers unfortunatly some are young in management position and i do not think they are ready for that, bu overall it is good."
good,operated cash register that everyone is different helpful co-workers not enough time to spend with customers the enjoyable part knowing you helped a customer
good,Good part-time job and some friendly staff members. Management was not willing to give employees a fair chance to move up
good,"It was okay. I learned a lot from all the different people i worked with, & it also taught me responsibility. Hardest part of the job was the costumers. The most enjoyable part was all the down-time."
good,"A typical day at work will be productive for me of course i always did my job & more just so i could get through my day."
good,if you like fast food then its a great place to work and good pay if in management its kind of like babysitting because of all the young crew memebers very fast pace also
good,being a manager at this store did not allow me time for my family. when I was home I was being called back to the store to cover shifts. at the most their are usually only a handful of people working at any given time
good,"Open the store up and stock shelves. working lunch rush is hard but, if you work as a team, it goes by really fast. they teach you how to run the cash regester, take orders, and per par the food."
good,Good food in a clean place. Enjoyed making people feel welcome. Work can be back breaking and hectic. Only management level gets decent pay.
good,Rushes were hectic but taught me patients. Customers were generally friendly. Management could have been better. Coworkers were helpful during training. Schedule was not always workable.
good,"A basic fast food job. As a crew member, I was expected to prepare food accurately and quickly to customer orders. A task which I prided myself on my accuracy and speaking with customers to ensure I was getting it right on the first try. "
good,My place is quite near in Wendy's and its easy for me to arrived on time without tardiness. Most of my co-workers are Asians (Filipino and Chinese). I had no problem signing me in any working shift because i had a flexible time but I'm being scheduled in 5pm-1am shift at closing. I learned most if to maintain cleanliness in the kitchen and most important is frequent hand washing to prevent spread of infection. Presence of mind and initiative is a great aspect in working on fast food industry. My co-workers helped me learned all the routines inside the kitchen. The hardest part of the job is cleaning all the burners and oven at the same time by yourself but I adjust all of that and learned the easy way. The enjoyable part is mingle with co-worker off works to know them better and have a fun team work with them.
good,I work at the most six hours a day I would mostly either work fries or front counter. We have no air so it always felt like a long and hot day of work
good,"Overall Working at Wendy's is a good experience taught me how to multitask at various positions inside the store, to be faster, and to provide quality service to the customers. Thank you Wendy's for giving me an opportunity to learn, earn, support my family and making me happy."
good,Wendy's is a good place to get a start in the business of learning how to manage people and operate in a fast past high volume business arena.
good,Working in a Wendy's isn't very enjoyable after an extended period of time. The work isn't necessarily hard but it can be extremely stressful and closing can be even more so because the time you're able to get out is severely influenced by how busy you've been and how on top of all of the cleaning tasks you and your coworkers are during the workday. Some days you get out of work an hour after you're supposed to be off.
good,A Typical day at work can be good for me even if im having a bad day I still make the best of it. the most enjoyable part of my job is when we will taste the food first
good,"a typical day at work was draining, working fast food you deal with some mean managers and bossy co workers, some work spaces were unsanitary, making customers happy sometimes couldn't happen"
good,"Constantly having to pick up others slack. Management played favorites, the smell was horrible, safety rules were constantly ignored"
good,"On a typical day we get close to 600 customers in a 3 hour period during rush and lots of them have multi-orders of 3 or more. Often times we get orders for as many as 80 sandwiches in one order in the drive through. I learned from this job pretty much every position you can learn as a team member at Wendy's and mastered it. I've also learned how to handle difficult customers, and to not simmer to long on a rude customer. My coworkers are just like any other place, they have there fair share of drama, however they are also some of the best people I've ever met. The hardest part of my job was taking orders on the headset while trying to make drinks during rush, however once you get a flow it gets easier. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I make a customers day."
good,"Wendy's is a place where everything gets done at a set time. there is no horse playing, there is only time to do your job. good place to work."
good,"100-200 Customers daily ranging pleasant to rude. Great team environment for most coworkers, some being a cog in the machine. Management is laughable at best, with head management focused on money instead of the people. Hardest part is getting the machine to function with certain coworkers/managers but the most enjoyable part is making someone's day."
good,"Solid place to work, most managers are helpful and give you good criticism when you do something wrong, but some aren't so helpful. You need to learn to work quickly and efficiently or else this job will get very hard, very fast. No problem with any co-workers, all are helpful and hard working."
good,"The hardest part of the job is demanding schedule trying to find the balance is everyone's struggle in this company. Being open on holidays cost the company more then it makes them money but just know you will miss out on some very important memories. Corporate has lost the passion for the uplift-ment of its store level employees. The work is hard and fast paced, the crew is crazy and fun, the customers are demanding but all of that helps you grow."
good,"A typical day at work for me was to clock in and take over a position. From there I was either running a cash register, making sandwiches, or running the grill. What I learned at this job will help me fort eh rest of my life. I learned how to better my customer service skills, I learned many communication skills, and my team working skills were heightened ten fold. While working here I got really close with most of my managers. The managers were very nice but I did have some problems with the work ethic of some of the mangers. My co-workers were like no other. I had a great time working with everyone there. The hardest part of the job was calming down customers that were mad about the food or service they were provided. The most enjoyable part was defiantly the people I worked with."
good,"Responsible for getting all stations up and working and operating large volume cooking equipment such as grills, deep fryers, and griddles. I also was responsible for verifying that prepared food meets requirements for quality and quantity.  "
good,I actually enjoyed working here because it kept me busy. Everything was fine about the job however I grew out of fast food working. I wanted to move on else where!
good,"Prepared items according to written or verbal orders, working on several different orders simultaneously."
good,"A typical day at work would be to come at 4pm and take orders at the drive thru window, make the drinks, collect money at the cash register, and hand out the order. On top of that i have a responsibility to make prep for the next days shift such as catsup bottles etc, as well i wash all the dishes and clean up the sink area at the end of the night. I leave around 1am. I learned a lot from people working there. I learned to how to help the company make more profit by up-selling, as well to handle customers who are unsatisfied. I have a huge personality and that is why over a few months i have my regular customers who i have learned their orders off my memory, they come in every few days."
good,i came in and enjoyed working with others and cook and prepared food. the hardest part is cooking the fries.I learned how to prepare different items make different sandwiches and salads. The other thing that tend to get difficult is during lunch hours you have to get the customers in and out because its not consider fast food for no reason.
good,"Let me just say, Wendy's has not been very good to me. I am currently a shift supervisor and run the entire store by myself for 9-10 hours a day. All I get paid for meeting goals and keeping the store  from crumbling is a measly $9.25 an hour. There is very little room for growth and raises are an extreme, extreme rarity. My entire crew works way harder than most minimum wage workers... and in my opinion this ""entry level"" position should not be minimum wage. "
good,"When I first got into the rock rest lodge I knew nothing about the food industry.I had good co worker that taught me a lot about the food industry and gave me key attribute to contribute back to the restaurant. I learned how to operate a food slicer, a flat top, a grill and a fryer. I also ran the cash register and provided customer service. After 1 year and 4 months I grew tired of the overwhelming stress environment. I applied to  college and got into the X ray medical tech program at Heritage College.  A typical day involved preparing food and cooking food if I opened during the day. And providing customer service, cashiering, running orders and cooking food during the night shift.  Management was a service I didn't have experience in but I enjoyed my managers, with that being said I don't feel it was my place to express my opinion on how my managers should do their job since that was their domain. Specifically My second kitchen manager was a great boss. My co workers when i first got started were a big help in teaching e to run a kitchen. After about 6 months we went through a management change and went through a variety of employees. My co workers were helpful and also encouraging when i needed it. Some didn't have the capability of working in a kitchen but I never discouraged them or made them shy  away. I also had co workers that took advantage and worked in the back washing dishes while I was preparing food for several tickets so I took on a big part of the load from the kitchen. We got better bread to make our meals appear much better. The hardest part of the food industry"
good,"Good job for starting out, or if need a second job for extra money. Able to meet people from all walks of life and interact with them. Must have excellent customer service to work the front."
good,Work was okay. Had some okay co-workers. Loved the customers. Did not like cleaning up. Got along great with everyone. I learned to always show kindness to other people.
good,"Depending on what was available I would either prep food, work on the fryer, or work customer service for in-house guests or drive-thru. I learned to work in a fast paced environment as well as a variety of different skills in a restaurant setting. Hardest part of the job was to be able to work multiple positions at the same time when it was busy. Most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to engage with many different people."
good,"a normal day at work would include keeping the service time down reaching our goal in our extra cleaning and making sure each and every customer was happy and satisfied. i have learned team work, and how to work in a fast paced environment. management was always very on top of things and always there if you needed help or had troubles understanding anything as well as making sure you are keeping up with your responsibility. the hardest part was heavy lifting at the end of the night cleaning up at close. Most enjoyable was being apart of a team it never felt like i was ever alone we all helped eachother and worked together to make our daily goals."
good,"take customers orders, make food, clean loby. al the managers and the employees got along great. we enjoy working with them."
good,"Selling shoes to different types shoppers inside a mall. I worked at the shoe that only sold men shoes. But also sold socks, sandals, and other men accessories."
good,"I enjoyed my job enough, it was like another job I had been involved with, but there were other issues involved. There was  a conflict of interest between the manager and my caseworkers."
good,A typical day at Wendy's can be good or bad depending on the management but overall I really appreciated this job. I was for 5 years so I have dependability and patience.
good,got up early every morning to open the store and then made sure the store ran efficiently and the customers were satisfied with their orders.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's, I start every shift by checking a chart that lists the jobs everyone would be doing for that shift.  I properly prepare for each job, whether I'm helping coordinate(bagging food/fixing beverages) cashier, taking orders, etc.  Depending on how busy we are, I spent my spare time stocking, cleaning the dinning room, or lending an extra hand to my coworkers.  Closer to the end of my shift, I would try to complete all my ""side work"" quickly as possible and ensure everything is in order for the morning/night shift. Management could have used some improvement.  There were a couple of the managers that couldn't complete the task at hand, which is leading the store.  I had built numerous friendships within the workplace.  Everyone was great to be around and easy to get along with.  The hardest part of working at Wendy's, was the 25 minute drive to Advance, North Carolina.  However, those were my decisions to accept employment with that particular store.  Ultimately, I enjoyed being a crew member at Wendy's and its a great job for us teenagers."
good,fun place to work at it did require an abundance of patience also we had to be on top of our game at all times because the customers at this facility are mostly regulars i had a great team of workers and we worked hard for the quality i enjoyed the challenge the most
good,A typical work day was very busy. I learned how to operate cash registers and prepare food. My co-workers were very friendly and energetic. The hardest part of the job was staying ahead when we got busy with little help. The most enjoyable part was greeting and meeting new faces.
good,"After almost 20 years of dedicated service to this company, I was laid off during a store tear down and remodel and told I would have to reapply to my former position. This was after the inception of Affordable Health Care Act which caused me to loose almost 20 hours a week work (the company didn't want to pay insurance for it's employees)!  I watched 3 employees with a total of over 60 years experience with the company loose their jobs due to this remodel and each of us were told we would have to reapply for our jobs.  Well when it came time to reapply for these positions they chose to hire young people at minimum wage.  So Wendy's DOES NOT CARE ABOUT JOB DEDICATION or THE WELFARE OF IT'S EMPLOYEES!"
good,"managers and co-workers were great to work with. Making sandwiches were hard to make, but running the register was the easy part."
good,"Working at Wendy's taught me food preparation, customer service and communication skills as it was my first job. Management was fairly organized and responsible. My co-workers were respectful and enjoyable to work with!"
good,I worked at Wendy's for about a month. I worked in the drive thru window as cashier. It is a very fast paced environment. What i didn't like was that i was stuck in a corner most of the time. The lunch breaks you have to purchase your own lunch it isn't provided.
good,"Typical work day was fine for the most part ,it gave me something to do .I learned that not everyone is going to show you the same amount of respect you show them or you think you deserve. The management at the first two stores I worked at were good for the most part ,however at the last store I worked at It was very difficult for me .They used me being a minor as an excuse as to why I wasn't treated the way other workers were which I believed wasn't fair because I worked the hardest being the youngest one there. My co-workers I spoke to some but not all, it was more business for me .The hardest part of the job was having rush hour and being the only cashier in the dining room. The most enjoyable part was being appreciated by the customers they made me feel glad to work there almost like they accepted me and my work ethics."
good,"I worked there for nine years and was very proud of our team effort. Made some good friends as well after a busy day. We use to get surprize inspections and quality control often. The owner would go to the drive through and was always happy to see the sandwich was done right with the mustard as a ""W"" on top. This company believes in quality that every thing is done just right.The hardest part of the job was keeping the drive thru times. If a customer sits at the menu too long we got the flack for it."
good,wendys was a good job while i was in highschool it was very fun i always tried to put a smile on the customers faces.........................
good,Easy schedules and great team members made the day go by quickly. A fast paced environment focused on good customer service and a friendly culture.
good,I was on the night crew/closing crew so it was difficult to close! You would go home smelling like grease and food it was bad! The pay was minimum wage but it tought had work and listening skills.
good,"A typical day at work is nice and smooth depending on how busy we are. what i have learned while working here is great customer service skills the management team is okay which could be better if they worked as as team. My co-workers are very nice and loving people to be around. there's not really a hard part about this job, the most enjoyable part of the job is getting complements from the customers."
good,Wendy's is a great place to begin working as a part-time student however there is some problems with the working conditions. The Pay is reasonable but working conditions are harsh however it is a great place to start because you can learn about how to value money and work hard for it.
good,"high volume"
good,"At this job, I would change from time to time from grilling, to fry stations, to making sandwiches, and assisted with cleaning, and helping customers. I learned valuable teamwork, and how to keep patience in hectic situations, as well as cooking skills, and efficiency. My coworkers were mostly kind and hard working people, with the exception of a few, but I developed some sort of professional relationship with many of them. The hardest part of the job was working through rushes, and dealing with the managers. I feel this place had poor management, but I would follow direction. The most enjoyable part of this job were the coworkers that I had to work with."
good,"Was regularly scheduled for 50+ hours, and the line of cars in the drive through was endless. would go to work at 4 in the afternoon and leave at 2 AM. "
good,I was a closer so cleaning was very important and difficult to do with those type of floors. Didn't like having deadlines with cleaning. There was a language barrier with employees and management as well.
good,A typical workday is very fast paced. Always busy. My coworkers are always the best part of the job. They are easy to get along with and make the job exciting. At this job I have learned more about food safety.
good,"Staff is Friendly and I have made good friends along the way, but i want to get out of fast food work. typical day at work includes preparing back up food to store in the fridge, making sandwiches during the rushes and cleaning up the store, and maintaining the store. Hardest part of the job is staying up til 4am cleaning up the store on night shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is consistent enjoyable work where the whole staff is working hard, but at the same time able to have fun and socialize."
good,"They are a company who holds true to the values that Dave Thomas entrusted to his employees many years ago. They are a company focused on quality and cleanliness more than any other company I've ever worked for or have known of."""
good,"Worked on multiple positions and trained all new employees that were hired. "
good,"I think working at wendys would be a great learning experience for young adults for an after school job ,I would recommend it anyone who likes to work with food ."
good,"I liked working there it was a great first Job."
good,had fun while at the same time getting work done. managers are nice and fun and help out alot.
good,A typical day would be making the orders in a timely fashion once they are called in
good,"Open store 5am for employyes to start to prep food. Do paper work til 7am. Check on prep. Usually make the chili or assist on front line set up.  At time do vegetable cut ups or bacon.  Open store. In charge all moneys in store correct.  Do deposits.  Open store.  Coach and manage store of all employees.  Cook, wait on customers, clean."
good,"Restore frozen to be ready to be cooked."
good,"Come to work,clock in, wash hands, prepare for whichever station was assigned. Be polite and courteous to all customers. Be informative. Management was usually right on the floor with us helping and coordinating. The hardest part of the job was making sure there was enough food ready for all the orders during the busiest hours. The most enjoyable was staying busy during the whole shift."
good,Always a different day and something to learn. the crew was great and I loved working in a great enviorment.
good,the co worker is what made this job fun. the management couldve been a little bit better
good,very busy fast paced working place. coworkers were fun. I learned a lot about reality and learned what making money is about.
good,a typical day at work fairly easy going. The biggest thing I learned is that communication is a big key to any business. The management there is decent. Co-workers there are helpful and hard working. The hardest part of the job is closing on the weekend those are the busiest days.
good,"It was a good working environment,however there was too much required for one station. Many times we were one person short, so it made it very difficult to work."
good,My typical day was never the same being i learned every position possible for a crew member. I learned a lot of multitasking and controls for various machinery. I also learned how to converse with co-workers that aren't fluent English speakers. As for management not much i can say because I had about five or more different managers. Pretty much some you liked and some you couldn't stand due to their own different quirks. I can say though each manager had different closing techniques and if you used the wrong one with the wrong manager you would get reprimanded which i found very unfair. I say this because I personally feel a business should be uniformed meaning all procedures are same just in case you were to be transferred to a different store or something of that sorts
good,"Handling cash and counting down tills, making sure food is out fast and is fresh. I learned office skills and team management skills. Hardest part was controlling waste product and predicting rush hours. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with the crew since everyone was great and got along so well and making sure customers get the ultimate experience: a fresh meal every time, and friendly service."
good,"Management was not great, they were unorganized and did not stop the co-workers from stealing even when they knew who did it. Other than management being terrible, it was a fun place too work the customers were friendly, the night crew co-workers were awesome. & we got our work done on time every night."
good,Working at Wendy's is great. Its a fast pace environment. The regular customers know you and become a part of your life. I had only been working there for two months when my managers told me they wanted to start training me for shift manager. Its a strict job but has great learning opportunities.
good,"A day at work for me, would be to clock in at 5:00 pm. The first task I would complete would be to take out any trash and leftover boxes, that were placed at the back door. Once that was done, I was then in charge of mopping and decking the cooler room, freezer room, and the entire kitchen of the restaurant. After that, I would take up grill position and cook patties until 7:30. At that time, I would begin to sweep the front counter area and perform cleaning duties off the check list, while still keeping patties on the grill. Once the dining room was closed I was in charge of decking and moping the entire dining room, hallways, and both restroom. Only then would I go back to making patties until it was time to close. During close, my job was to clean off the meat grill area, and dispose of all trash in the restaurant."
good,A typical day at work i would describe as very busy and loud until a hour before closing time. I learned you have to have patience when dealing with customers. The managers in the store for the most part are nice and serious about there jobs. The hardest part about this job will be taking out the trash. The best part about the job would have to be the employees who make everything work.
good,It was good for the time I was there.  Making sure that the opening and closing operations went smoothly making sure that the customer was taken care of and fixing and mistakes that came up.  Paper work and making sure that deposits were made.
good,I always had a good experience working at wendy's. I met a lot of people and developed friendships with them. the hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers that aren't happy with their visit(s). the most enjoyable part of the job would of had to been our rewards. we would get rewards for getting good numbers in the drive-thru.
good,"this job only require you to answer the headset within 4-5 seconds of hearing a beep sound ,making sure you are listing to every order ,there can be no mess up on orders or that would slow the drive thru all the way down ,I open in the morning and did prep for our desserts and salads from   6am-8am this location serve breakfast and lunch ,"
good,"Working at Wendy's is pretty much what one would expect when working at a fast food restaurant: long hours, hard work, low pay, and rude customers. However, at least at the Wendy's where I worked, the management helped to make up for it. Most of the managers I worked under in my almost 3 years of employment were friendly and  understanding if we fell a bit behind on our cleaning duties if things had been busy."
good,"punch in through the front cash register and start the day with taking orders and then making sure i am stocked for lunch rush and dinner rush, learn to make sandwiches and drinks, etc, learn the register on drive thru line and bagging for the drive thru line, i would go back and forth to front counter and dinning room to clean and make sure everything was satisfactory to customers and get them refills or offer to take their trays."
good,"Crew members don't really help out, only when there is a lunch or dinner rush. Otherwise there's usually one or two people doing the work while the others hang out in the back room."
good,"* Fast paste, working hard at the objective"
good,I would get to work and have an assigned job that would change daily.Often times i was at the cash register but i also got to spend days learning the fryer and the grill. When i was at cash register i got the chance to interact with customers and learn about the point of sale system. The part i enjoyed most was the customer service.
good,had a bad experience working here the company didn't treat me fairly
good,"My day at work is stressful but successful. I go in, get the job finished with nothing left behind. I have learned so much in the recent 3 years that I have been at Wendy's. I have learned to work with others, gain great ethics, and to be responsible. The management was alright. I loved the assistant managers there. they have helped me overcome the obstacles I had to encounter. My co-workers where great, we all get along like one big family. The hardest part of the job, is having to run and be fast. You have to get orders out with a smile and not show how stressed, or tired you are. You have to let costumers know that your job is important. Be sure you let the costumers know they are always welcomed back. The most enjoyable part of the job, is talking to costumers. Seeing the smiling faces as they walk, or drive away. Seeing how big of a difference you can make just being polite to them!"
good,enjoyed meeting an building relationships with my crew an my lovely customers. I leaned how to lead a group of people to specific goals on a daily basis.
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part but some of the managers could be difficult and treat some workers unfairly
good,"Working in fast food has its ups and downs. Although it works well with students and their schedules, it can be difficult with impatient customers and stressed management."
good,"worked here two years, harsh work environment, never guaranteed to be friendly with other co workers. and pay sucked"
good,A typical workday was exhausting especially because i work day was exhausting. Management was not what I believe is management quality. The hardest part of the job was not being told the correct way   of doing something but getting punishment for doing it wrong when I wasn't taught correctly to begin with.
good,"Easy work that occasionally got hectic, co-workers were fun and made work enjoyable. Hardest part was to cook - had to balance between cooking burgers as well as five other kinds of foods."
good,"A typical day at work at Wendy's is to be very puntual and responsible with your things to do.  I have learned to work under presure, good human relations and how to get things done at a fast past to please the customers needs.  My co-workers are very profesional and hard workers.  The hardest part of the job is when there are a lot of customers in the drive through and front.  Rush is something common at a fast food, but not imposible to accomplish the companies standards.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to have that one on one dialoge with the customors.  I love to comunicate with others."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is helping serve the customers
good,When beginning my work there things were great. Then my time started to change from the agreed days and started interfering with my school and studies. It started to become very unorganized.
good,"Prepared sandwiches, drive-thru cashier, front line cashier, closing store"
good,"the fist few years working at Wendy's was great. But more recently we have hired on people that don't do the best work and management will not take action to fix the problem. Plus, if you are not the managers friend and don't suck up to her, you will say a crew member, even if you earn a management position."
good,"average pay, average job. Good you're having difficulties getting a first job or any job."
good,"Maintain a clean work space per OSHA standards, utilize computer systems for automated order taking, handle currency and credit transactions quickly and accurately, communicate clearly and positively with customers, co-workers, and management."
good,its a great place to work you get alot of hours and you have a oppurtunity to change your schedule for school
good,"i show up, i stock/clean and take orders. i get told what to do by coworkers and i do what they said/ask of me. after the first 2 months not really learn much at all working there just (their code), because its a set in stone schedule. hardest part of the job is to keep my cool when being singled out by coworkers or customers. i enjoy meeting nice customers, that dont mind having conversation."
good,"Come in make sure all employees are in proper uniform then get everyone in position. Talk about how you'll meet a certain goal that day and daily rules for the day. Had to learn how to properly manage the team and make sure the shift flows smoothly. As a manager I have to make sure paper work gets done every certain hour to send off to the higher manager. The co-workers are very hardworking and hope and reliable even the new ones. However the hardest part of the job for me is the paper work because it's so much to do, but it gets better everyday. Most of all the crew is the most enjoyable part of the job because we all know when it's time to work we work and when it's time to have fun we do so."
good,Helping customers with what they want. explain what new sandwhiches were on display or promoting the monthly speacils.
good,"the company is good when you first get hired as a manager, but when you are not a brown-noser then you get the unwanted  schedules. people don't like you because of it. overall, a terrible place to work unless your a brown-noser."
good,good place to start. good people. most jobs are easy .hrs are flexible.
good,It had its good and bad days. The management there wasn't that great but we had outstanding customer service.
good,"Wendys is a great place to work at, as long as you work hard and fast."
good,i learned how to make new things and prep some items.  was able to communicate with different people at the cash register.  was able to see smiling faces as they recieved there order.
good,"A typical day would be clocking in on time, and you must have the proper and tidy uniform on, you must make sure your uniform is clean and immediately wash hands before going into the kitchen. find out where you shall be stationed (grill, drive-thru, etc.) and get to work. everything had to be clean and stocked throughout the day until closing. bathrooms and lobby had to be cleaned and stocked at closing. dishes had to be done and stations needed to be closed down. Then clock out."
good,"A typical day would start with reviewing class 1 calls. If there were several, I would take care of them & contract some out. After the class 1 calls, would work on class 2 & 3 calls. I am the only Tech for 32 stores, so I had to use contract services. I dispatched the calls. The hardest part of the job was being a solo tech."
good,i do not mind working fast foods because i'm able to move fast and mutilate task very easy. the pay rate was very low for me
good,Pay was minimum but I met a lot of people and had some fun times at work.
good,Great starter job. With flexible hours. Fast paced environment. Learn many skills
good,"Fast Paced, always something going on. You have to be sure you and your team are working together or the whole thing will just fail."
good,I loved working at Wendys! The atmosphere was amazing. The customers always kept a smile on my face and most of the employees became my friends outside of work.
good,its fun but you work to much and get payed so little i learned alot almost became a supervisor but was lied to  some good coworkers but i used to work sooo much for nothing basically
good,"Morning maintenance, food prepping and cooking, taking orders, greeting people and shift leader was fun.  Some co-workers did not want to work and left work for others to do, most managers just sat in the back and did not really help us get the store ready to open."
good,"When I first started working there, it was very overwhelming. I was trained on the fries first. Thank god I had experience doing the same thing at Pizza Pizza. But it was very overwhelming because I started work aroung Halloween time and that specific restaurant gets FREAKING busy during halloween due to a theme park RIGHT BESIDE! Also, one supervisor was criticizing my work and it was a disaster for the first two months. But as the store got less busy, I had the opportunity to try different positions (fries, grill, dishwashing, drive thru cash collecting, and garbages). It became less annoying and it got easier to bear. The store manager is VERY nice, but watch out for the supervisors. They can be a pain in the rear end, especially is you mess up and you don't realize it. "
good,Overall working at Wendy's for my first job was wonderful! It was a great place to start out.
good,It was your typical fast food job. Lots of work for little pay and recognition. The people were cool though and they worked with my schedule which was a plus
good,"I was accustom to all positions the job offered. We would have to deal with hundreds of customers a day that would be the hardest part cause  a lot rush and patients is needed with the customers, and another was coming home smelling like fast food. The co-workers was fun and friendly to work with"
good,It's an extremely busy restaurant so we are constantly running. The foods good and fresh the crew members are nice upbeat people
good,"THis store was a lesson learned. A lot of drama that is not appropriate for the work place. NOt very positive vibes. When prolems accured if a manager was not able to assist you, kind of left to figure it out on your own."
good,"i learned how to open the store, also how to make sandwiches register operator maintain the dining room and worked drive thru"
good,my day started of by greeting coworkers and management i learned to better customer services skills
good,"A typical day at Wendy's consisted of cleaning. Learning new safety requirements. The hardest part of the job was working the drive through, because you had to work at a faster pace. My co-workers were hard working and friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers."
good,"•	Responsible for running the day to day operations of the Store."
good,"-when i get in there in the morning i clean the fryers ans take out the garbage from the night before."
good,We were always busy had a great group of people to work with . In Truro we always were busy learning the set up of the menu  just learning to keep with the busy rush time so the customers were always happy with their order.
good,"was always on time, learned about money management and responsibility"
good,"Training was not complete because of desperate need to get people working.  The managers are stressed out, so the employees feel it.  My coworkers are really nice and the customers are fine.  I don't completely hate this job and will keep it until I find another one, then be respectful enough to give a 2 week notice."
good,Enjoyed working for this company. Management was helpfull.
good,"In a typical day at Wendy's i would work from 7am to 4pm. My day usually consists of preparation for the day, making sure the store is up and running, taking customers orders, helping solve problems for customers. I am also one of the crew members that helps train new employees."
good,"Good place to work, great advancement opportunities. I enjoy being able to learn and operate multiple positions."
good,"Wendy's is a very busy and can be stress full at times as well as demanding on workers. "
good,"Customer Service, Cash Handling, Sales, Bagging the food, Prepping the foods"
good,"A typical day on the job is predictable. Unless someone asks for time off, the schedule is the same each week. I applied as a cashier but ended up starting off as a sandwich maker. Being a good sandwich maker required speed and an eye for detail because sometimes the order is changed at the last minute. Being a drive thru cashier required taking on tasks not usually associated with handling money, such as washing dishes. The management was firm but not heartless. Their primary focus was on serving customers as quickly, accurately and friendly as possible. The crew members got along well with each other and for the most part fulfilled the requirements of their position in the restaurant. The job itself was not hard but it was very fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with employees who took their job seriously enough to provide quality food and service."
good,"This location can be moderately to extremely busy.  The guest come from all walk of life.  Customers served includ retirees, stay at home parents, blue and white collar workers as well travelers. The management and crew are reflective of the customer base.  The toughest part of this job is the long work day without breaks.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers and my fellow employees."
good,i learned alot about t.v and the behind schenes of prodution
good,A typical day at work was working on the front counter taking peoples orders and getting their food ready. I learned how to work with customers and how to please them by getting their order correct.
good,Come in to work and just get straight to work. Always had something to do. Work areas was very small. Co-workers was fun to be around. Management wast all that great.hardest peast of the job was trying to change grease in the fryer in a small work area when everybody is trying to work.
good,"I would clean the tables, mop the floor, vacuum the floors and serve the customers with a smile. They would tell me about their day and I would explain mine. I learned that balancing my school and work life was difficult but I have found the perfect fit and way to do so. My co-workers were friendly and reliable and much fun to talk to on slow days. The hardest part about my job are the lunch time rushes but they got the day going pretty quickly, and the most enjoyable part of the job was joking around with everyone."
good,"I would either work the lunch or dinner hours. Both of those times lasted about four hours. I would clock in and see if we were prepared to be swamped. We would frequently accumulate a full line and I was expected to be able to make a sandwich in 7-20 seconds. At the end of my shift I had to restock for dinner hours, do some dishes, and then I could leave."
good,"I was a drive-thru attendant my cay starts at 4pm with just coming in punching in and going to my supervisor and getting my till and counting it and relieving my co-worker from the drive thru and start taking orders and the customers money and give them they food. I have learned that u have to know how to multi-task and be quick and the customer is always right. Management was the best easy to get along with and loved her job. My co-workers we're all much younger than me but they had much respect and we made it work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the public  the most enjoyable part was to just learning to be nice to people even when they are not being nice to you.,"
good,It's a great company to start of your career.Great for people in high school that's looking for new career.A great place to move up in and build your career.
good,"First starting this job was great.  When working here i learned customer service.  Co-workers there were great an pleasant to work with. Management at the time was some what alright as far as customer support, but as respect for the employes was lacking.  The hardest part of this job was listening to the management down talk to its employees an taking the verbal abuse.  On the up side the most enjoyable part was the friends i made for life."
good,"When I was first hired, I was making minimum wage for Florida in 2011 which was fine as I was getting 40+ hours a week and had no real rent besides giving my mom $100 for our apartment. I wasn't taking a semester so school was not an issue. Now in 2013 wage is up but hours are low I know barely get over 25+ a week if I'm lucky. I've been there for two years and I'm still making minimum wage, I know multiple positions but that is not acknowledged by the management as I've been on front counter for 8 months now, new members are hardly trained right yet they are getting plenty of hours for the poor jobs that they do no offense to them.  Management varies as there are good people and bad people. A typical day at work involves getting swamped and backed up at shift change because the previous shift is allowed to leave, this being the whole crew basically with 3 or 4 people left behind until the next shift gets there an hour later (poor scheduling) And when it is time to close the lobby you are held up because you can not even mop up sections of the floor if there is anyone inside the store and then you are berated for not finishing on time and told you are slow and need to hurry up by management. There is nothing hard about the job except it is more stressful than it should be. The most enjoyable part is when I get great customers who have no attitudes and understand and can see whats going on in the store and don't give me a hard time for it and thank me for my service. "
good,"the casiers were rude right along with the customers, I still feel to this day that the only hard worker at wendys is the grill operator."
good,I enjoyed working here because of  the friendly staff and management. 
good, 
good,I was able to learn many things from this job. I had not been in fast food industry since my teenage years and accepted the management position to transition from my previous job. Unfortunately as a single mother of two the hours of the evening shift and the absence of my children made this job not a match for my life. 
good,This was my first job and their was only some minor things I didn't like about working there.
good,it was ok i had fun some time but i did not like how the management
good,lack of command and just too hood. I will never work for wendy's again
good,"I liked running the drive-thru. I worked the front front window, taking orders and handing dout orders. I operated the back window where they recieve cash. But I liked eing at the front."
good,customer service skills. Not enough hours to maintain life living
good,It was fun working there all the people are really nice. I learned alot of new things there. The customers were the most enjoyable part of the job. Got to meet a bunch of new people.
good,"A typical work day was operating the cash register, cooking the meat and serving the guest their meal in a timely manner. I learned how to operate and count down the registers, work at a extremely fast pace while still providing excellent customer service."
good,"The only big problem with fast food restaurants is the drama between employees but in my opinion its great work if you like doing different things daily. You could be stocking, washing dishes, making, food...etc I enjoy having a little change in the work I do. The difficult parts of the job are usually dealing with angry customers but this is never to be taken personal. Also there were a lot of tough cleaning jobs that including cleaning grease and carbon build ups."
