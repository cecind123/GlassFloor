rating,review
bad,"They dont give out too many hours due to them not wanting to pay at least minimumwage. they over work their employees at times,since thay are diffferent language they will talk down on their workers in their language."
bad,KBR is focused on how much you can do for them. Even though they hire you there comes a time when they don’t need you so they let you go with no reason no explanation just walk you out the door.
bad,"Don’t hire people over 50 , age discriminaton for years. One year they took away holidays to pay the share holders. Not a good company to work for. Boys club"
bad,"Its a shocking company to work for. Management dont care about staff, they dont know what confidentiality is any problem you went to them about within hours the problem was known by everyone personal or not."
bad,communication was non existent Team leads are rude and abusive shop supervisors are rude and abusive most all of the other techs acted like 3rd graders tried harder trying to get out of work than just doing there job it took forever to get parts
bad,From the start my supervisor and lead did not like me and they did their best to make me quit. I would never recommend this company to work for unless your into highschool drama.
bad,"Not safe job if you were working in area where its not safe and war going on,You will have to performance your duties no mater what circumstances you will be under."
bad,"i am not surprized that KBR does not exsit anymore, they are an aweful company who gives no respect to anyone. if the were still around, I would never work for them again"
bad,This by far the worst place I've ever worked. Staff are treated like children. Work place bullying is not treated seriously by managers and HR are a massive joke. Staff turn over is high and the job is very stressful with no support from management
bad,"just an awful place to work, right wing managers and the shifts are dire. so stressful. the night shifts are great though you can just chill out and take like 8 calls a night."
bad,upper management is good but on the floor or ship management is terrible. they have bad attitudes and do not care about any one. in fact they strive and look forward to see you fail. they are horrible people and they have a high turn over rate because they will do nothing about the jerks that are running every one off.
bad,"Management has no respect for employees. There was an unexpected snowstorm and we did not paid for that day. Employees are always getting flexed for no reason. This was a temporary job, so everyone was always looking for steady and permenant positions elsewhere, and when you would call in to have the day off or report in late, you were penalized. If the work is temporary they have to know that people are looking for another job. They claimed they needed an excuse to be off at least 3 weeks in advance, so that they can call someone in to work in your place. The time that I worked there I never seen them call in a replacement for an individual."
bad,KBR was the first company to give me the opportunity to work when I left the Army.They provided training and guidance for my advancement.Safety was paramount and I was given the opportunity to work as a safety proctor and safety in training.
bad,"The company is restricted by budget. The discussions go on but nothing happens because there is no budget. They do not fulfil offer letter promises."
bad,Worked with a great group of people who were committed to producing a outstanding product for the company. Management was very open to new ideas and valued every employees input.
bad,Job was contract and had no security in keeping your job. When it was over they stopped you and walked you out of the building. No notice of this. One day you have a job next day you don't.
bad,"Bad safety culture,  you are just a number and as soon as they no longer want or need you they find a way to try and discredit anything you do.  If have a medical problem or disability never let them know they will get rid of you sooner."
bad,Company was poorly organized as well as poorly managed which led to its downfall as a company. Never quoted jobs correctly which led to loss of money and time for other jobs.
bad,"KBR has great advancements for MEN. Women are only allowed to ""clean the floors or do office work."" The money is in the field. They make double what women do in most cases. Women are allowed to become certified for a job through their ""in house"" testing and certifications but are still only offered Janitorial or Office positions with completion of these tasks.It's hard work, the pay is average, but they do offer excellent benefits. If you're a man, go for it. If you're a woman, my advice is to stay far away. Also, the men are very degrading and sexist. This is viewed as acceptable on the work site."
bad,"Awesome place to work at, they care about the person technical development and people are very friendly to work with. They enjoy different offices with different work environment which one can shift between them if work load allowed."
bad,"the company in the present position does not take care of there "
bad,KBR is a very tricky company and have some of the worst management I have ever dealt with. They have bosses who cant even read drawings and try to tell the employees it looks wrong. When they come to a job site they try to take it over.
bad,"Boring place for work, no benefits nearby Qatar border, no food provided, no job guaranty, long work time period, not good salary, overall not good,"
bad,Need a change at the helm to preserve the integrity of this company.
bad,Enjoying working for this company; A very organized work environment with management support and plenty of materials to do the job.
bad,"This company has been run the same since it was Allstates design and development company.  You will sign an agreement form not to seek lawsuit against the company.  The Italian men run the company the Italian women run the administration.  The black men can climb only up to mid management, black women and the rest of the mix of diversity is either contract or limited climability up the ladder.  Rudeness,  arrogance,  short tempers and cussing throughout the daily office and northeast dumbness prevail.  They get you in, give you work,  when they done with you get a layoff.  Same thing each year like 2008 layoff.  Name change to absorb bad reputation.  Kbr Houston hardly talks about the Delaware office.  Newark de employs 4 states of people in this lil office at university plaza.  Some temps get high pay some don't.  Your overall skills don't mean much and isn't needed to do the project work. If you kiss butt,  it won't amount to much despite many do.  You will work for aholes but as contractor.  Remember this is a job and nothing more at this kbr office site."
bad,Same old thing that gets KBR run off all their job sites----The buddy system in management.   Pushing for footage and not quality.   Safety is thrown right out the door  as long as the pipe is lashed and they get  their footage.  No one has had any kind of formal pipe welding school or pipefitter apprenticeship training. Ignorance is bliss in West Palm Beach.  The most dangerous ones to work with have been doing their trade wrong for 15 plus years and don't have a clue  From GF to Worker totally uneducated and inexperience.
bad,"this company is the worst company out there, i do believe if satan himself could make a business this would be it"
bad,"-Organize all procurement activities relating to request for proposals, sealed bids, and price quotes."
bad,We would always work group and their was always good communication. I learned how to work with safety. Their was really good communication between me and my co-workers. The hardest part of the job in when we would have to work in uncomfortable places. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the job we had to do was done correctly.
bad,"KBR, low standards and very low morale all around 12hr everyday all week. Poor leaving conditions and low overall standard"
bad,not to much to say.i learned that some company is about the money and not its people.
bad,as I told I have been fire firefighter since 2005 and I work in company as a fire fighter .
bad,i think kbr is unfair in its mangement i learn to watch my back for working with them
bad,"I learn how to make keys, learn how to scan quillex, print, inventory, archiving, and i have also maximo traning class..."
bad,"Lack of communication, poor management not an ideal job. Not enough staff, poor morale. They could do better and treat there staff better. Turnaround is high which says a lot!"
bad,Questionable environment to work. Depending on the discipline or your specialty.  Lots old mentality folks do a lot politics to preserve their work security.  It's a tricky situation to find yourself.
bad,Management works secretively on contracts without letting employees know what is going on.  Was told when hired it was a 3 year contract only later to find out it was 1.
bad,"The management are no help"
bad,"No benefits at all and the pay is about $6/hr under what I was earning 9 years ago.. You can buy health insurance with a $10,000 deductible ($810/month for me and my daughter). If you want paid time off, you can give them part of your paycheck and they will give it back to you when you take time off. No paid holidays. Overtime kicks in at 40 hours. All contact with the office is through email. They are on time with the paycheck though."
bad,Hiring wage did not coincide with experience or education.  It then took almost a full year to be hired on permanently.  Because of this was forced to purchase outside healthcare.
bad,"Do not care about their staff. No staff development or opportunities for training etc. Long hours worked, no appreciation for your effort. Would not recommend."
bad,"I've worked for several companies in my career, most of them very good. I would give this outfit negative stars if I could. They lie, cheat and steal from their employees and customers. Leaving there was the best decision I've ever made."
bad,"Unsafe, disorganized, totally dilapidated, brutal, dangerous, everything is broken"
bad,"The hardest part of the job was wearing a nomex in the summer in southeast texas with 100% humidity. However the crew members made it not so bad. The most enjoyable part of the job was the crew members and paychecks. Management was terrible. We would work 10-12 hours a day because of a lack of planning by our ""wonderful"" management team. Basically management cost us our contract that KBR kept for 22 years at lanxess. "
bad,"Hideous tyrant Manager"
bad,"I worked in Bethesda Maryland for no less than 50 hours per week. Most people I worked with everyday were very nice professional people. My immediate manager was great. I was promoted 6 times and voted MVP twice. The only problem I ever had that was the General Manager. He was a Baptist preacher from Texas who could not accept ""most"" employees. I never imagined that no matter how well I did my job would not matter. Yet, what I learned inspired me to return to college and earn several degrees. I just hope I have the opportunity to be only judged on my professionalism. I'm sure there are better places to work."
bad,"management more interested in profits than doing the right thing. Sites are staffed with buddies, not professionals. Basically construction hacks. Just ask around."
bad,"worked overseas, away from family. only got an opportunity to see family ever 3-4 month for two weeks. free meals. no retirement plan. only 10 days paid vacation"
bad,"There is a true lack of leadership in this company. It is everyone for themselves. Management rules through intimidation. This used to be a good company, but no longer."
bad,"Best not to say,  where I worked there were more supervisors than technicians.  "
bad,"It was a military atmosphere with a drill Sargent for a supervisor"
bad,They let me go because I had court and couldnt make it to work.  They should have been understanding.. It was either lose my job or go to jail.  How could i help that.
bad,"Working in the corporate finance group you learn quickly that senior management and the executive do not believe in ""work-life balance"" even though they promote a 9/80 work schedule. Employees that have provided measurable value to the company are treated poorly when new senior/executive management is brought in."
bad,"Between KBR and Hp/dxc/Perspecta, most of their time was spent trying to pay us less than what the contract said they had to. Dept of labor was involved and still is.  Complete mess."
bad,"Work day was between 10 and 14 hours "
bad,My review summary explains it well enough. It is best to keep my experience private. Disparaging any company's reputation is not my forte.
bad,"All foreman are lazy, lack leadership skills, and clueless on how to talk to employees.  Work first and outside life/ family is last type of mentality.  Have seen numerous employees retire there and not 1 management employee said a word to them, let alone give at least a thank you card.  Plan on figuring issues out for yourself, and finding spare parts on your own, as there are no leaders to help or guide ( they are to busy scrolling through FB or texting women behind their wives backs on their cell phones), only coworkers that may or may not have done work before. And remember,  KBR gets paid for bodys being there, regardless if anything is actually done, so plan on 12 hour days during summer, 6 or 7 days a week, and blacked out from using vacation."
bad,"KBR is experiencing some terrible growing pains right now.  Years ago it was a very progressive and supportive place to work, but with the downturn of the industry it suffered terribly.  Unfortunate.  Lay Offs, reduction in benefits, not supportive of staff."
bad,"Not really the place you move up quickly, more like move up and get stuck.  Need retirement benefits not just 401K.  Could really use some good managers."
bad,Job was very hard to do honestly. They had a saying- this is the procedure and this is how we do things. really dishonest job. very bureaucratic. I got laid off after working there for three years. The job did pay very well though
bad,"Operate all heavy equipment in a safe and efficient way according to all relevant legislation,"
bad,I worked there for three years and then new management came in and wanted family to work and let good people go. I am a hard worker and I feel as though I was done wrong by this company.
bad,"My work day started at 5:30am, quite time can get a lot done before the rest of the crew gets there"
bad,"Never work here, never pay on time....great people though. But KBR got kicked off the site at surmount 1, lots of people out of work"
bad,"Worked for them in Iraq, Dji Had a great time with locals and some employees, many slots were filled with boots on the ground not skills Nepatisum was rampid. KBR (Kenfolk Brothers Relitives) "
bad,"Management style as old as the company. Caveman management from top to bottom: ""Me Boss, You Employee, We No Like People Who Think, We No Like Progress""."
bad,"I worked for KBR as a contractor in Iraq during OIF. Corruption was rampant. Employees were not allowed to turn in accurate figures. Employees stole, did not perform their job duties, and committed crimes. Turning these employees in and blowing the whistle is not without its dangers. Employees threatened to put me on the streets of Baghdad."
bad,Management at this company is acting pretty incompetent and are killing the company.  It's not a bad place to work as long as things are busy but it's pretty terrible otherwise.
bad,"you work with different cultures and that's wonderful in trying to learn and understand each other. Bad part, you are on you feet for most of the 12hr shifts. Extreme temperatures and some unfavorable conditions."
bad,KBR is the worst political ethical company I have ever worked for.  There is a reason why the offshore oil and gas division has not won a project in 5 years here in the GoM.  Three individuals have made it point to loose projects based on attitude toward the clients
bad,"KBR today is not like the KBR a few years ago. The new management is from the UK and this company does not take care of the employees. The benefits have gone down, the job security is not there at all as it used to be. "
bad,Management is weak and does not accept change which leaves people that get hired with several years of experience cannot utilize their talent. The company sells a 9/80 work schedule upon hire which gets nixed every time a project falls behind the timeline which appears to be frequent. There are no training plans nor is there room for growth. Working after hours is classified as volunteer work. The culture of the employees is negative. I would not suggest working at this company.
bad,Was fun for a long time till new management took over company is falling apart the money isnt worth the stress that comes with it. I dont recommend working hear now there not employee loyal use you up an spit you out.
bad,Great co-workers; management was horrible; ladies in department disrepected; always talking about politics and guns; harrassing environment; everyone walked on eggshells trying to please VP of department. Management in this group needs to be replaced immediately.
bad,I was medically treating subcontractors and military personnel from all over the world.  It was exciting to treat patients with language/cultural differences.  Unfortunately management would constantly send emails if you medically treat these patients discipline up to termination. Most emails were Discipline up to termination.  I do not play by the fear factor.  I had patients that needed to be taken care of until they were seen by the BAS.  I argued about the Ethics and how the subcontractors were working for KBR and didnt have anyone that could treat the issues.
bad,I have been working overseas for over 5 years in different projects.  the challenge of a START UP project has been great you work hard and lots of hours and meet different people.
bad,Kbr is a good company to work for id work kbr for ever if the money was right
bad,I am working on KBR Afghanistan  from 5 years as a warehouse supervisor. I am enjoying working with all the members of the staff here with good knowledge and experience. Management is excellent. I like to work here with our one idea. no body will force to work with stress. While working here we will makes jokes and we also follow the good aspects. we always follow Manual handling correctly (TILE).
bad,"Was one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. The way management treated people was terrible. This may have been an isolated experience, hoping other KBR jobs might be better."
bad,I hates this place. They treated you horrible all the time. And didn't appreciate the time and effort put fourth into your work. But it paid decent. And you can make alot of money
bad,"I do not appreciate how I was sent home forced to take maternity leave & was led to believe I would still have my job as an Electrician Helper after I had my daughter, but I was terminated & insurance was cut off a couple days before I had my babygirl, shortly after I got released from the doctor I reached back out to the company about coming back to work and I left messages and no one contacted me back."
bad,"The job and environment were good, pay was great and I would have liked to continue working there but as with a LOT of companies around the area, who you know or who you are related to,  is what makes advancements possible around here"
bad,"This company went out of business for cooking the financial books. It was a great company to work for while it lasted, but it was done after the senior leadership team got caught."
bad,Company with integrity focus on employee advancement and knowledge enhancement. Good working environment with generous terms and conditions. Flexible company to work for a family orientated person. *****
bad,"Learnt how to manage and supervise the work"
bad,I do like my job a lot and I do take it seriously. I think sometimes I might be too passionate about it. I learned to be more patient and to develop good work relationships with my international co-workers. The hardest part of this job will be the work we do in harsh environment and try to cope with it. The best part of it is to see the end results of your work and everybody involved being satisfied. 
bad,"This would be a great company and great job for people only if the kept them employed on the NGEN contract. Slow the work down so people can work year round. Not 6 or 9 months, all year."
bad,"every morning, I'm at the service of the customers for arrival and .departures military.I'm learning a lot of things with the different people. the management is my priority above all, for my co-workers we gives a background for realize a good result by day and communication is very important for us. The hardest part of my job is when i have a lot of the arrival without reservation and the most enjoyeable part of the job is is when the customers that I Assistant be happy."
bad,Does not care about its employees but claims that it does. Low wages and high expectations of its employees. Expect you to  work while on vacation. Bad.
bad,"KBR provided personnel to man the LOGCAP Contract during the Iraqi War. Many (as much as 60%) of the personnel manning the contract were unqualified to be there but were hired as ""cannon fodder"" to fulfill the contract obligation to the Client (Federal Government). Consequently this placed an inordinate work load on those of us who knew how to perform the duties we were hired for. The experience was life changing in mostly positive ways."
bad,"if you are not part of the click, you are not getting the job. the company lacks loyalty to its employees.  management lives under the same mindset, employees where not killed by the grace of god."
bad,"After working the centre in swindon for 2 years I can say that the management are biased. They do not develop people and ignore glaring issues. "
bad,"Management Poor. All about who you know, not based on performance.  No paid holidays.  Benefits are one of the worse in the industry. People are not their greatest asset.  Wanted employees to donate their PTO to support Harvey.  This is the true KBR, Inc."
bad,the company was poorly managed. they did not follow the safety rules or guidelines.I myself did not care for this job that much.
bad,My job with KBR was in Iraq. It was a living hell. Interesting country though. I wouldn't recomend any one take a job like this. ever!
bad,"What is stated one day doesn’t apply the next."
bad,KBR doesn't focus on the mission only making sure Texas A&M buds get the high positions. Procurement runs project management and they do not follow COBC but expects everyone else to adhere to the rules.
bad,My day always started with timekeeping and payroll.  I learned how to balance several different sites and all the employees at all the sites.  Management was lacking experience and knowledge of the facilities. Workplace culture was good.  Working with alot of different cultures. Hardest part of job was the constant moving around from site to site and moving downtown and having to pay to park. What I liked most about the job was the employees and constant flow of work I was needed to do.
bad,"Too bureaucratic. Too many fat cat middle managers. CEO seemed to have lost vision. Ceo was a VP at earlier company, saw an opportunity to ride the wave back up and make money for himself coz the earlier ceo bill utt screwed up and took the stock down. Unluckily for the new ceo the market conditions degraded and could never ride up."
bad,"Provided design calculations, Estimates and analysis for different type of RCC and Steel foundation structures."
bad,"My last three months with KBR Wabi were very interesting to say the least.  The AMR Project I was on was poorly run with inexperienced supervision and emotional upper management.  In my 3 months on this project I seen multiple firings and dismissals happening for no good reason.  I seen a man fired in the toolcrib for no valid reason so a position could be opened up for the general managers son.  Family members were being promoted with no previous supervision experience.  People were given titles and roles just for a pay increase and there was no sense of direction at all.  I would not recommend working for this particular division of KBR to anyone.  The pay was ok and the benefits, but that was CLAC handling that aspect.  On the bright side the workers on the ground were fantastic and I met some great people.    "
bad,"It was a good experience and certainly a memorable one. Good people inbetween horrible people but the overall end of the day outcome was more then worth while. Everyone has their own opinion of KBR and alot of negative ones on top of it but if you are a cup half full individual like me you will find the light at the end of the tunnel and be thankful you made it. In such a complex atmosphere you will find several alpha types in one location creating a ""who's in charge"" situation and then you sit back and enjoy the show. In between all of that alot of good work was being done and missions where being exectuted regularly. As shakey as it seemed they still got it done and the team of people I had working for me I would hire again."
bad,15 plus year manager with no evidence to lead. No training. No ability to source new employees. Would give verbal communication so if something went wrong no paper trail to him. No hands on experience of work. No related degree.
bad,"cleaned up hazardous waste, packaged, bind drums, load drums, clean glass lined vessels, wear acid suits for most jobs, wash cloths, hand out cloths,."
bad,"Las tareas son con respecto a la programación de entregas, aprendí a que con esfuerzo logras reconocimiento de otras oficinas sin reconocimiento de tu lugar de trabajo."
bad,Short time I was there changed managers 3 times.  Last manager was from the Corporate office and was very apparent he did not want to be in the field.  Would blatantly ignore most of the people that were underneath him.
bad,"Even though the pay is average, it is very difficult to accomplish anything.  The progress is very slow.  It seems like no one cares if the work gets done."
bad,"It was a combat zone-- deal with all the problems or don't go. Pay was good, food was OK. Solders where very GREAT. Most people were from low income areas and stayed so long they got promoted and didn't know what to do. Could not fix a truck, couldn't hardly change oil correctly."
bad,"Unless you are Senior/Executive Management, work life balance was a myth. Often asked to work far more hours than the typical 40 hour work week, and with the downturn and subsequent layoffs in O&G in recent years, workloads quickly skyrocketed without commensurate increase in salary, and on top of that, benefits were steadily taken away one by one. Additionally, layoffs were done without much consideration for the skills and know-how being lost and consequently the lack of experience available to be sold to clients, but rather the only factor looked at when determining layoffs were salaries, which hurt sales in the meantime."
bad,"This is not a Good company to work for! Bad management, they like always have you second guessing your self. They love to make problems not fix problems. I wish you all the best if you work for KBR, don't say I did not warn you"
bad,"KBR is a huge company, but the right hand doesn't know what the left hands doing. The management has spent so much time giving Kin,  Brother-inlaws,and Relatives positions that most are not qualified instead of moving people up that earns it. Most projects are family or close kin...  No one is ever mining the store... And at the end of the projects when it's time to do punch out and turn it over to the costumer...the good ole boys leave the mess for others to take the blame and there off to repeat the process....NO INTEGREITY!!!      NO PLANNING!!!!"
bad,This place was okay but not a company that I'd want to stay with long term mainly due to pay wages. Perhaps they're the direction to go if you don't mind going overseas and making tax-free money.
bad,"In Djibouti project that I worked with, they are not basing promotion on performances, they promote employee only if they are close to top management."
bad,I was told I would be full time but was laid off once job got done I worked over time and night shift even worked Christmas day for the Mill itself every body said they liked my work and said I had a home with this company and still got laid off
bad,"This company expects you to perform duties above your pay grade as well as no room for growth unless you are a certain discipline. KBR at one time took away all of our holidays as well as PTO, which was in the contract. They eventually gave it back but we had to fight for it."
bad,"a lot of wasted money and no one had a clue what was going on, lots of favoritism, safety man was a joke and both boss men should have been fired, worst workers were always praised."
bad,I'm current military and after training they wouldn't give me my job back after telling them I'd only be gone for a few months. I called them 3 weeks before I left training telling them I'd like to return and they told me no they didn't have a job for me
bad,Minimal opportunities for advancement. Persistent layoffs since 2015. Good work/life balance but no job security whatsoever. Very politically charged environment. It's all about who you know and not about your work ethic or contributions to company.
bad,"KBR - we were located in a war zone next to the Air Force runway. Always in the bunker, could always smell the sulpher from the homemade bombs. Loved the people and the Military folks that I worked with."
bad,There has been a perceptible shift in management style at KBR in the last two years or so. The culture is now one of perpetual crisis due to inadequate resourcing to save on costs - with an expectation that employees will work additional unpaid hours each week.
bad,good place for people to get experience. long weekends unless working ot. ot is scarce. no room for advancement once you get to a certain point........
bad,"KBR is basically going through a reorganization.  This past year they sold off divisions and all but completely closed others.  Most positions are job based and as soon as a project is over and there is not another position available immediately they lay you off.  I watched this happen to people with 40 years with the company and 2  months.   Managers always say they did not pick who gets laid off so there must be some mystical program in HR that makes all of the decisions or most likely our managers were a bunch of liars.  "
bad,The company is moving in a different direction and away from its core principles . Many good people who do not have any direction or  prospect to move up in the company.
bad,"As the Theater Archive & Storage Manager, for the northern section of Afghanistan with fifteen US FOB’S under my authority for the DOD and DOJ,  my duties were to support the LOGCAP III Project with the following: was to direct all facets of training operations and logistics, devising and executing a strategic long-term action plan for the archiving and dispatch to long-term storage in the U.S. of all Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) records received from the entire Afghanistan and Iraq Theater of Operations, Presented formal classroom training on archival processes to administrative staff. Developed and enforced strict performance standards and ensured compliance with all policies, procedures and regulations and address all problems and stakeholder concerns as they arose."
bad,i was work in lap as super vizor lap tech nation and operation in the plant
bad,"My Review would be to Biased , as as far personel Expats that working for company medium to poor ,quality. This depends greatly on area group working with, In Europe local national workers due good to excellent ,The expat or -management self centered and scared for own jobs would cut anyones throat . KBR thru poor bidding bought last contract which in turn was at employees expense . Even So charge top dollar for poor equipment then hide behind regulations and inflated costs , Management have tendancies to blame local nationals for anything that goes wrong . they the upper management just made to many mistakes and relieing on change orders and equipment breakdowns the Army personel incharge of overseeing these contracts are aware of"
bad,"A fairly bog standard corporate company to work for, perhaps dipping just slightly below market average."
bad,"HR Manager demonstrates favoritism between FN and EXPATS, lack of communication with team. Will at times acknowledge the positives and provide positive feedback."
bad,There has been a significant leadership gap developed over the past 2 years that has degraded morality and created a toxic work environment. Not sure company will maintain contract over next 6 months.
bad,"12 people in a tent. Disgusting people. Full of very low standard and uneducated people. living conditions were sub par. 6 months of work, less than 20 days vacation. An absolute circus."
bad,"I began here as a temporary employee and in the interim it was a good gig.  Short term I thought 6mths - a year, 2 years later they still haven't taken me on full time and I do not have healthcare because to get healthcare as a contractor would take literally my entire check and then the benefits still suck $8000 deductible and $8000 out of pocket 70/30 split.  I have children with out healthcare and I work for a billion dollar company meanwhile other departments are hiring permanent employees, just not my department HUH!!! why pay for the cow when you can get the milk for free.  They also respect tenure over performance.  In other words I have people who have been here for 10years asking me how to do stuff, but I am a contractor.  I am in the process of looking for a job."
bad,"This seemed to be the typical boys club. Very cold place to work, there didn't seem to be a sense of comfort. There seemed to be a lot of eggshells walked on by management down . It is good I left when I did as that was the start of the end of KBR  in Canada."
bad,"Discovered that succession planning is lacking for advancement for long-term employees,  but found workday pleasant because of the hard working employees."
bad,"Overall the company was decent as far as big companies go.  It wasn't until Wyle was bought by KBR that things went south.  The first thing to go was the training budget.  Then it was lots of little things that stifled creativity.  The company is big on outsourcing their developers to India, despite customer complaints to the contrary.  I noticed that developers would leave, but their positions never got filled.  Then the layoffs started happening.  In my department alone 15 layoffs happened a week before I left.  Overall I'm very unsure of the health of the parent company and decided to make a job change."
bad,I have worked for KBR for 10 years. They like to hire from outside the company. The benefits and pay are getting worse every year. Time to start looking.....
bad,"Kbr, lost 150mil, in 2016."
bad,During my time with KBR the supervision changed hands almost monthly. This makes it very difficult to know who your direction is supposed to come from.
bad,I had site managers who bullied me and gave me a hard time because I wouldn't sleep with him--soon hopped to a different site because I was in the losing end.  Rampant nepotism and sleeping the way to the top for contracts in Iraq back in 2005-2006.  Left me pretty traumatized working here.  I would never recommend....unless they have turned around since then.
bad,I am unable to provide an accurate and up to date opinion of this company as it has been a long time since I have been employed by this company.  Apologies.
bad,This is a big company and it makes it really difficult to climb the ladder. Managers have bad attitude. Gossip and drama makes it a terrible place to work.
bad,pls see previous summary. I have never had to fill this out before. I would not recommend Indeed . this process is too long.
bad,KBR hires alot on who you know instead of what you know and they like to travel and bring in same people . They're very clickish. They don't take very good care of their female employees! The 1800 hotline is joke  just like on site HR!
bad,"Very bad management, with too many people from overseas? Do not employ to many from Queensland. I was bullied and neglected."
bad,Employee friendly company. Management use to take long time on decisions. Pressure filled environment. Supportive co workers.
bad,"typical day at work ok company"
bad,Morale is very low on this contract...It's coming alone slowly but surly. Management can start to do their best to be more involved with the workers within this company contract.

bad,You work in a war zone it is not fun.You will work 15hrs a day 7day a week for 4 mo.
bad,"Very helpfull crew, always eager to teach me something new."
bad,I have worked for many electrical contractors during my 30 plus years and KBR stands out as one of the worst----not the worst. I traveled to five different FOBS(Forward operating bases) and for the most part MANAGEMENT SUCKED. At times they treated me like a 10 year old kid with their childish double standard rules. There is not enought room to elaborate but to sumarize my review by saying i hope i never have to have KBR sign a paycheck for me.
bad,"muita cobrança por parte da diretoria, por ser uma empresa terceira: não nos davam opções de crescimento"
bad,"Monitor cago for the military, as invenotry and filling out shipping forms. Tracked cargo systems, and did daily reports"
bad,I like to work in office dealing with microsoft office and pdf proficianal I like team work as boss and as co-worker I don't have problem to work eavery day 12 hour a day
bad,overtime not paid work for nothing never see management tools always go missing never replaced overworked and underpaid. stuck in this job with no progression available
bad,Work there only if there is nothing else.they will knock you down to size and if lucky may rebuild you.....but most of the time they just break you down.it is a paycheck and THEY DO WORK SAFELY
bad,"They will give you FRC coveralls for the job, some of the management is great most of it is not it's fast paced most of the time and the times that it is slow paced you still have to stay busy and find something to do."
bad,Awesome crew and very professional and knowledgeable. Corporate management lacking.  Errors in payroll (at Christmas) several times leaving no pay (made up) errors in tax accounting made the time spent there very frustrating
bad,Waste of two years - KBR acquired GVA to positioned themselves in the global offshore oil and gas market.  Very poor management and failed concepts led to KBR shutting down GVA
bad,"Better to be permanent staff than contractor, unless you are at the top end of the contractor salary bracket, or have specific work times within T's & C's."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job would probably be the co-workers. Its not a miserable place because you are bored and just tired and ready to go home. The people makes the day go by faster and you also have a productive day.
bad,I got hurt during a specific job we were doing and didn't feel the pain in my lower back till the following day. When I told my supervisor they sent me to the Plant Manager where he laid me off because he kept insisting that I was making everything up even though I insisted that I was ok to work and that my back was just a little sore.
bad,Prospects severely affected by the drop in oil price. Good talented people. World class organisation. Good systems and procedures. Good attitude to environment and safety. Work procedures.
bad,"I had high hopes when i started with this company nearly four years ago, and in that time i have seen half our number reduced due to cut back with in the company we are running on the bare minimum staff and still the powers that be are looking for ways to slice its security budget. I have lived in fear of redundancy since day one, Not a very happy working environment for me or my colleagues."
bad,This was a very fast paced job in Iraq. It was a contract job. I repaired generators and other equipment that was destroyed by war. My boss was very nice. It was a very stressful atmosphere to work in being in Iraq during the war.It was nice to meet different cultures.
bad,"If you don't have a best friend high up at the company, they won't keep you employed."
bad,job was ok other than being told you will never move up in the company as a civil worker management needs to make changes and be more positive
bad,"i got to see alot of things working for kbr. have been around the world but to get a gdd start you either need luck, war, or a good education because its not easy getting ahead with the"
bad,Too much stress on management to get the job done quickly..but get it done safely. Hard to balance the two in a refinery setting. Focused on how many jobs get done in a day rather than just making sure the job was done correctly & safely.
bad,"no corporate structure or help from Management team, a lot of promises without delivery, put a lot of stress on site workers and site management, site was interactive and dedicated."
bad,"Sole medical provider in a remote embassy in southern Iraq.  Hot, dusty, dry days with extremely restricted activities.  War time situation with daily rocket and small arms activity around the compound.  Some days I would see no patients and others I would be overwhelmed with either illnesses or injuries.  No support at the location.  Supplies scarce and irregular resupply by air.  "
bad,"They were new in construction, and they didn't have real leadership. so they brought me him to help them grow. we went from doing projects of $35,000 to $ 200,00 and we were still growing. management was not focus to the future"
bad,Great place to work before reorganization.Management kept friends instead of loyal hard working employee's after the reorganization.
bad,"KBR has the worst payroll department I have ever see. The ""System"" mades a ""lot"" of mistakes with your work hours, getting a pay stub is as hard as finding true love in Fort Mac.  Nobody wants to take ownership for missing hours, Specially HR,  KBR process payroll in DUBAI not in Canada and uses a computer system that saves the company lots money by not paying employees their correct wages. "
bad,"was part of merger, not much to say, health benefits are very high delectable but they do offer HSA, 401k match was average, PTO was standard, but they just started offering paid holidays in 2018, before that you had to use your PTO"
bad,"KBR was once a company full of life long careers of more than 30 years. The recent CEO has attempted to create a lean and focused core, but has striped the company of it's valuable employees with lay offs. No raises and promotions in the last two years for those who remain, and many hard working employees have been replaced by cheaper outsourced workers in Chennai, India this year. Meanwhile, this CEO continues to enjoy multi-million dollar bonuses while the stocks continue to fall."
bad,"KBR is a company that cares about the job getting done first and not the safety of the worker. They say one thing but do another, for example the project I worked on was scheduled for five day but we worked six. They extra day wasn't a problem until the job went along then they started to make us work seven days but many workers didn't wont to work seven straight days. So they started threating  people jobs, say that if they didn't wont to work seven days straight that they were going to firer they. A typical day at work would be to get there at 6:30am and they wanted you in you work area working at 6:60am when you not supposed to be at work until 6:30. Then you would work straight to lunch which was 12:00-12:30. Soon as 12:30 hit they wanted you straight back to work. If you was 5 minutes late going back to work they would write you up. Though there were many thing to no like about KBR, I thought it was a great place and job for young adult s to learn a trade. I started off as a Pipefitting Helper 1 and soon became a Helper 2 including all my fitting tools. By they time I got laid-off for reduction of force I can truly say that I know how to fit pipe and feeling comfortable doing it on my own.  That was my most enjoyable part of the job"
bad,Trabaje en un ambiene de familiaridad
bad,"I made good money, but knew it was a job without a future. We worked 12 hour days, seven days a week. You got a two week vacation every four months. I would do it again, but only for the money."
bad,It was a good place to work until DuPont re allocated the paint division and several of us got laid off including several people from DuPont itself. Overall it was a good place to work up until the end.
bad,"Interesting and challenging work.  Global international and domestic project assignments, in various industries.  Longevity and recognition in this industry space."
bad,Great fast paced company. You're able to learn a lot for them if you set your mind to it. Great pay and really friendly environment. Get to meat people from all over the world
bad,"In the early years when I worked for KBR quality was good, in the later years it became all about profit and the quality suffered for it. I left for Fluor Corporation."
bad,"A typical work day consist of approximately 12 hrs all though we are only allowed to clock 9.5."
bad,Very busy and fast paced. I have worked in different departments which has been a good learning experience.
bad,If you get on the right job you can make some good money. All temporary construction though
bad,"I worked in a war zone in Iraq, could of been worse. I meet a lot of great people from all over the world."
bad,Days are extremely hot in the summer. Co-workers are great. Management is mediocre.
bad,I was laid off after a very short time of working there.  Not due to anything other than a financial decision.  I was given 3 days notice and this was only so that I could complete the project I was working on.  It's unfortunate that the people that actually work in the office have no control over these situations. They're good people but the global company as a whole does not care at all about the people they employ. Their motto is Courage to Care. Their reputation does not reflect this.
bad,"Mucho aprendizaje en KBR, adquirí nuevas habilidades y desarrolle aun más las aprendidas."
bad,"It was an easy job. The only bad part was they didn't train in their company procedures very well. They kept promising classes and work shops. They told me it was a 5 yr job when I hired on. But after a yr. I received an rof because another one of their jobs ended, and they gave their friends my job.our boss was a little absent minded. Some of the other cwi's didn't do their jobs. But because they were friends, they got away with it. Then everyone else had to jump in and do all the work at the last minute.  I prefered staying caught up."
bad,•	Demonstrate active and visible leadership through effective consultation and coordination to achieve strategic objectives
bad,Typical day at work:- very busy
bad,"I didn't mind worker for this company. They only reason why I enjoyed the company is because I had a great boss otherwise they treated you as a number. They tried to enforce FR coveralls in a mod yard when it was +35 out. There was no reason to be wearing the FR coveralls but yet they made everyone wear them."
good,"The work is not hard when everyone pulls there weight. At the job that I am on is in Hodge La. (paper mill). First pay check of the job all my hours were not there shorted me 450.00 bucks. The general foreman has just became general foreman and the foreman we have now is his buddy that has no idea on what he is doing. He literally told me that he has been selling travel trailers for the last 16 years. I mean really fokes please give us a leader that can at least know how read a tape measure that's how green this man really is. And he wants respect? The line we are running is over the paper machine the temp is at 140 degrees about 60 feet in the air, no breaks except designated times (really were is the safety at this job) the plant has not had an upgrade in 75 years. so its rusty the wiring is bare in many places and the pipe is extremely bad. So if you go please watch out for your self because no one else will good luck."
good,The current status of industry has caused several ripples within management that has caused some questionable decisions to be made. Making everyone feel very uncomfortable to make proper and logical decisions.
good,"Office Manager is VERY cranky at all times...only sees her side of things and does not take suggestions to im prove office...making office moral very low.."
good,My typical work starts at 6:00 am work starts at 7:00 am I like to take time to see everyone on my crew before work starts to make sure every one is fit to work had enough sleep didn't drink to much or not sick things we need to be aware of to maintain a safe work day.I have learned to deal with many cultures on a crew and learn the culture of the people I work with. The hardest part of my job at times is trying to deal with my forman he drinks quite a bit and seems to have a lot of family and girlfriend issues that seem to bleed over on the crew. But when all is well we all seem to one big happy family
good,"I had an unfavorable experience with KBR. In my opinion they're ""Company over Employees"" mindset showed itself daily within the company.  Employee moral was always low."
good,"Falta de ambiente laboral, inclusion de empleados, cero actividades, dificultad de crecimiento en la empresa."
good,"Upper management in Khobar- Disorganized, depending upon the old less knowledgeable employees. "
good,It is a fast paced environment where people rarely slow down enough to worry about their ergonomic health or overall well being.  Everyone is pretty stressed all the time.
good,12 hr days/7days a wk/LOGCAP III military support/war zone/lots of minor construction/working with local national personnel
good,"I love doing my job. Hard pressed for a wide range of needs, I am quite resourceful. Long 12 hr days for 7 days a week were taxing to say the least. Operations at forward operating bases in a war zone entailed infrequent attacks by rockets and mortar fire. Sirens, howitzer fire, the staccato of machine guns from security forces all added to a difficult work environment. Having necessary stock inventory readily available is an integral part of providing customer support in a timely manner. I found this 3rd contract services work in Iraq quite different from previous deployments. Actions performed by upper level managers were disastrous to employees in the field."
good,Monday- Friday set schedule you do the same thing every day sometime you’ll get overtime and may have to work on a Saturday not really any hard work or heavy lifting
good,Wish the Sydney office all the success for the future and was great working with them and the culture of the local team was great. Good place for a young engineer looking for experience.
good,Employee morrall down constantly due to upper management. The quality of tools being used were very unsafe and outdated. New safety man ever so often would incorporate more and more safety guidelines which hindered production.
good,Poor planning on management part as far as using the man hour were they were not supposed to be causing you to be behind and have no material that is all
good,"Loved working at TI great company to contact for. TI great personal and I always enjoyed walking into their buildings because their engineers and service techs would always ask me to take a look and if I have time to do this or that for them."
good,The company is ok to work for but management lack managerial skills. The pay is not the greatest either and the location is not very convenient either.
good,"I worked for the military, With a fast paced environment."
good,"No progression within company"
good,This was definitely one of those jobs that you had to know somebody to get anywhere. Doing this kind of work overseas definitely made you enjoy being home more.
good,"I have been on several kbr jobs ,& all these jobs go back to management,supervisors can make or break the job,"
good,"One of the lowest paying job overseas. Work long hours, very low quality of employees and management did not care about the welfare of some of the employees in his/her branch. The hardest about the job, was location. The enjoyable going on R & R. In an environment such as Camp Taji, it is not how professional and how knowledgeable one is on the the job, but who you know that get the promation."
good,i find my self working hard for the wrong people im am an a1 roofer with the skill and experence to prove it!
good,"I joined KBR at the bottom to get work and thinking that I would be able to prove myself and advance in the company. After I arrived in Iraq and served out my ""probation period"" I was informed that ALL Labor Foremen were ""frozen to that position due to too many open Labor Formemen positions. I was unable to move from this position from that day forward. When the with draw was in effect - we were simply asked where we wanted our plane ticket to and ""Thank you for your service"""
good,I was hired on a pipeline project the last time I worked for them and they never pipelined before. I put on a pipeline school and they did it with hand welders instead of rigs
good,"There was a time in the not so distant past where people were proud to work for this company, and the pride reflected in its product.  We were global leaders in construction, people willingly put in the hours to maintain that standard and were rewarded with great things."
good,"Ok Place to work, Mostly contract job,"
good,Nothing left in the USA for construction. Spent years with company no respect for responsible people. CEO in England a VP in Houston that respects no one.
good,the culture has changed over the years and the environmental / moral all taken an all time low.  There people there fear for their jobs / their lively hood.
good,"Went to work had safety meeting for the entire crew. Did my job duties which is welding, just went to work on welding whatever needed to be weld."
good,"KBR was fun until i got laid off after i was told id be able to keep my job, its kinda breath taking becaause i survied 3 lay offs and was told im secruer"
good,Basically everyday starting my shift i open up the trailers whenever i get a order i pull out the boxes and stock themm outside in the pallet and sometimes trucks come in full of metal materials and insulation so i unload them and store them inside the trailer.
good,I would show up to work on time and everyday. I learned more about piping. I worked well with my co workers. I did think the management could have communicated with employees more. I would be told something in morning meeting on how to do a job and what to do. Half way through the job management would come tell us to do the job another way. There was a lot of wasted supplies and time which made the job go over budget causing many people to be laid off sooner than job was suppose to be. The most enjoyable part was being able to learn new jobs and my co workers was very enjoyable to work with.
good,no communication from upper management down poorly managed and poorly organized.if your in the click and like BS this is the place for you!
good,"Not really a good place to work at.  They used to have company-sponsored lunches at an all-hands meeting, free giveaways, etc.  That ceased to exist.  Their local advancement is not one for the records.  If you want to move away, you might find a job.  But locally here in JAX, no advancement.  And, sometime the management is in the ""good ole boys"" mentality.  Do one thing that puts you on management's radar, and your sunk.  They'll keep you on the radar until you do something that's not right (or questionable), and they'll find a way to get rid of you.  The pay basically sucks.  No annual raises, no bonuses, etc.  And, they think, by giving you a card to the local company store, that's a good reward.  To get a mug, or maybe even a pad with a pen?  You won't make a decent amount of money here.  If the money is what drives you, keep looking.  They promise raises, but none comes.  And, they'll work you to the bones.  A lot of work, with no bonuses or raises.  If you plan on using KBR as a stop-off point to another job, it's fine.  Other than that, keep looking."
good,"El horario era bueno, viernes salida a las 2pm y descanso sabado y domingo. Lo malo era que no hay posibilidades de subir de puesto y por lo tanto no hay superación dentro de la empresa."
good,"KBR is constantly getting new work, which keeps their understaffed procurement department very busy working long hours.  Your value to the company is metrics based"
good,Great team of people to work with in the office but no bonuses and very limited progression.
good,"A typical work week at KBR consisted of working a total of about 4 to 7 hours out of the 40 hours I was there.  I learned a great deal about rigging and heavy crane lifts, and also the OSHA regulations for slings in this craft.  I felt about 20 percent of the management was very good and, the other 80 were very poor due to the fact that no matter what happened the culture in this workplace was not about what you know and how hard you worked but who you know.  The hardest part about the job was making it through a work week when out of 40 hours of the week you only worked 4 to 7 hours.  The most enjoyable thing about this job was that I could come home to my family every night."
good,"The company is the lowest paying of all the contract jobs out there. You can do the same job with another company making twice the amount. If you are looking for good compensation, look elsewhere."
good,The thing I liked the most about working here is the pay and the benefits.  The thing I disliked was the strictness of the schedule and the poor management
good,Need to look into resume completely before hiring hands.  Most don't know what their doing just because their related to supervision. Will cause more accidents!
good,"Management was ok when there was no infighting. Management did not give required training to do task safely so personnel were injured."
good,Choose not to provide any details.  This is company - personal confidential details and are not relevant to any applications or job searches present or future.
good,"Great company to work for but unfortunately going thru bad times due to oil prices. Company had good benefits but now paid holidays, only 2 weeks of vacation."
good,A typical day consists of conducting safety briefings and establishing fire crew assignments. Building inspections and pre-fire plan drawings.
good,"Project Principal Time Keeper/Support and back-up Admin. Manager: Provide technical support for the Project Control function of estimating, planning scheduling, cost management, progress and performance analysis and reporting, as required to meet project scope and job requirements.  Timekeeper, receive timesheets, validate, process payroll, hiring and terminating, setting up new WO# in the payroll system.  Provide a wide variety of basic administrative and secretarial support for Engineering and Construction."
good,good learning experience but after our gf left we had no management they put someone up that had no clue on how to treat people and be a leader
good,"I enjoyed my position here, I had the opportunity to teach my skills as well as learn other applications."
good,"Typical day at work is checking out vehicle and equipment, maintain cleanliness, training, and paperwork. I have learned that the job is not secured and management does not inform their employees. Co-workers are easy to work with. The hardest part of my job is not knowing what would happen to our job security. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with."
good,"keeps you busy! pay was good, concerned bout your saftey but no job security, worked around very hot steam and around chemicals, worked along with and around some good people and some not so very nice, pay day was always a good day, long hours and working hard and a supervisor being overbearing made for long days"
good,"management is not always honest at present site, co-worker are good"
good,"Ok place to work, pay could be more for the work you do. Working hours is ok, management is decent. They seem to have their favorites, promoting some while looking over others. I really wasn't too fund of working around chemicals too much."
good,"Did a lot of different types of welding and learned from it., also learned how to fabricate hand rails, cat walks, safety structures.  Installed various safety structures throughout N. Fl. The hardest part of the job was taking the time to make the safety structures user friendly, as in smoothing out the handrails, fabricating stable and wide steps for constant use.  The best part is seeing the finished product!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people around me. However we experienced multiple layoffs and they always occurred around the Holidays.
good,"I handled various job duties and learned various tools in order to complete each task "
good,KBR has provided many opportunities for me and I enjoy working with them as a company. They have a great group of people representing the company which work very hard.
good,Praca nie najgorsza ale zarobki bardzo słabe . Pakiet socjalny nienajlepszy .
good,Start right away to get contractors permits signed and have them get to work at their projects asap with safety first in mind. Make sure that all equipment is in place and that the contractor is able to start their jobs on time. The hardest part of the day is to make sure that everyone who starts the job leaves the job in a safe manner and to make sure there are no hazardous conditions.
good,"When I was employed by this company I had a good salary, work was steady, had good management until the end when I decided to change careers due to being physically threatened by a supervisor."
good,The job was great at time's and sometimes it wasn't so good.people working in different work areas so different team competing with other teams. But the pay was great for the time away from home.
good,"KBR is a well established Company. I have had multi tasking work experience since I employed in this company."
good,I worked over seas with KBR as a contractor for log cap 4 as a carpenter foreman at FOB Prosperity . The contract was cut short a lot of contractors were sent home .
good,"Kbr has pros and cons like any other company. "
good,Not a bad gig. Seven days a week  minimum of 12 hours a day. Kind of run like the military but makes complete sense. Pretty neat if you don't have family and looking to travel.
good,"Empresa desmotivante, s gestores não sabe se comunicar com o funcionário."
good,"a very delicate work area,we been working in a war zone area but we just work inside the base camp.I think the company give us a very low salary compared to what we must  receive."
good,The work isn't very challenging and the managers just care that you show up to do your job. Not much opportunity for growth and employees were nice enough.
good,"For the 32 years I worked with KBR, I enjoyed the people I worked around. I had opportunities to broaden my knowledge and skills with many challenges."
good,As i worked as IT Admin... supporting to the customer enquiry isuses..Working with colleagues... and hardest part is to understand the slung of 23 different nationalities.
good,"Very good technology and engineers, passable middle managers and CEO, and very weak sales force will result in declining revenue. A great takeover target!"
good,Work environment is positive. Safety of yours and others are a priority on a day to day basis. Plant area aware everyone on proper procedure for exiting plant area in case of emergency.
good,management constantly displayed a lack of professionalism
good,I wasn't impressesed by my experience with KBR. Management seemed to promote based on the buddy system and not on individual merit or loyalty. Tools were routinely checked out without proper inspection. Too much focus on micro-management and not enough on the issues that mattared until it was too late.
good,"All in all the people at KBR were great although there were a few that were not it was still a good company to work for however when they are done with you or your temporary assignement is up, they treat you like a common criminal."
good,Did a daily activity log of what the day would consist of safety and work summary. Safety is a huge factor when working in these conditions. Management was not to bad a lot management was one sided didn't care to hear about a maybe faster and safer way to complete task. It was a one sided a lot of times. Every Part of the job was difficult. but a lot of lifting and carrying working in heights. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co workers who enjoyed the same values and goals as I did. We worked through many situations and it made it worth while working with the company.
good,"The pay is good. The advancment is non-excetant and managment never gets out of there offices to see how the operation works. They have some really good people that work for them. Contract work is not very secure work. I like the on-line training they offer, very informable. Good code of ethics and safety program."
good,The pay was good days long . All coworkers are all pretty good people like most jobs are.
good,"Everything was great with this company, Everything but the supevision..... They honestly had no clue!"
good,"They hire alot friends, friends of friends and family of their employees. Not necessarily based on their qualifications. My electrical team was not part of this. I had a great team, as electrical is an advanced skill. The employees working in support positions have a ""use KBR"" mentality and it shows in the performance and productivity. They do not fire their friends and family and becomes a vicious cycle. The upper level management does not care about employees. It is a negative atmosphere. The employee turn around rate is astonishing. As the intelligent and highly qualified personel move on KBR tends to quickly fill the gap with any ""boots on the ground"" and the progression is set back. I did make excellent pay but it was ""danger pay"" and during those days in Iraq it was extremely difficult within the center of the war in Baghdad. There is a lot of waste within the company as they just did not have the qualified people monitoring this. This is one reason KBR has such a bad reputation within the overseas contracting world. OVERALL- It is not a company you would wish to work long term. It is a get in, make your money and then get out atmosphere and if you are like me wanting to acocomplish success you will find challenges that start at the poor upper level and trickle down through."
good,"The days are varied and challenging, jobs tasked are interesting and challenging, but the company is a good place to work at, the only issue is lack of progression potential."
good,"Construction job, all employment is temporary; worked there 27 years, never officially 'full time'. Unionized job, pay was good, benefits received through union, pension also through union."
good,"This position would have been great if Foremen's would take women SERIOUS in the field of Pipe Fabrication. What I witnessed while working here, KBR is very cliquish."
good,"I worked from the bottom of Project and i have proud to say i achived something in my life ... Like i Have a i build Great Ability"
good,"Working with KBR in the Middle East required some adjustments for me. I worked twenty plus years in a professional environment where the employees were required to maintain a professional image at all times, in area of performance, and etiquette. This was not the culture at KBR in Iraq.  Jobs were assigned to individuals based on relationships, this practice diminished KBR overall effectiveness when it came down to performance and employee morale. So, I rate the management with a medium score. However, this was in Iraq, there could have been unforeseen reason for this practice, but as a manager with years of experience there was no long term benefit to KBR."
good,KBR does not care for their employees. They are looking out for themselves. Do not support their employees. They do not care that you are away from your families especially at holidays. They want you there working all the time. No vacation time or holiday pay for employees.
good,Provide supervision routine maintenance work for the plant along with challenges the come up for emergency jobs. At times i was in charge of 10+ people on the maintenance crew. Make sure all crews had proper permits to complete jobs.
good,I have learned that no matter how hard you work it doesn't matter because seniority always wins no matter what. If you were at the lowest paid you are targeted at all times. You have to be in their circle to keep your job.
good,CRC held me in Houston for 1 month and a half without pay instead of contacting country manager responsible for the contract I was assigned. The Equipment was not assigned yet so alot of time was spent sitting through meeting with no progress made
good,"Due to the recent downturn the industry has taken, KBR has had to cut down tremendously. Therefore, this has affected the company culture, morale, and career advancement opportunities."
good,This job was very political. You really had to know someone to keep from worrying about being fired or laid off early.  The environment was very stressful.
good,i had great time here meeting new people. Iwish we all moved from job to job great people to be around. KBR has no work coming in so job securty sucks
good,"enjoy with work 10 hours as menu.kbr more than 10 years caters for british embassy. good management  and work place.i learned lots thing from kbr and took certificate for  food safety,health safety,kitchen equipment,workplace skills and more"
good,Very difficult MRP system and management review cycle.  Very competitive atmosphere with weak management.  Hardest part of the job being the complicated reporting method.
good,My overall experience with the company was pleasant. I enjoyed my time spent there. I met nice amount of friends  during my stint with the company and they treated me like family.
good,"I did enjoy going to work everyday, knowing that I had a future.  but the last few years, it's been a very stressful place to work, not knowing if anyone had a job."
good,"i didn't spend much time working for this company but it seemed to have pretty good supervison and good work, but then again I wasn't there very long ."
good,"It was a good job in a stable chemical plant, changes starting happening a few years back and the job started to decline, moral is as bad as I have ever seen in a place, those guys haven't seen a raise in 7 years while every other type job the wages are rising, not many of the same people that have been their for 10 plus years are their anymore"
good,"Was a great company before SB took over as CEO. "
good,KBR offered great opportunity to grow before the economy made a turn for the worse. Great Benefits and most of the other staff were great to work with
good,"I work for seven years, one year at the office at Delaware and 6 years at a site at Dupont Manatí P.R. They never had a Human Resources expert dedicated to site committing big mistakes. once they cancel the contract with Dupont they never offer a relocation  opportunity at  the exit interview we had a contract prepared by KBR which did not allow us to return to work at KBR or its subsidiaries which is not fair for an employee with excellent assessments."
good,"I've been working for the company for 20+ years only to see that we can all be fired, any time, any occasion. So much for loyalty."
good,"Had a great boss and coworkers in my department were very knowledgeable, cooperative and helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job was the opportunity to deal with people from several countries."
good,"KBR was a decent place to work and great if you are disabled or prefer lots of office work.  The opportunities to work in the field are highly limited; however, the additional per diem is great if you are lucky enough to get one of the few field opportunities they provide.  The culture claims to promote work-life balance, but if the backlog gets low due to poor economic conditions or poor effort by the salesteam, everyone is expected to work overtime, sometimes for free, to meet project demands.  Management oftentimes seems out of touch with project and employee needs.  A typical day consists of showing up to the office, bantering with coworkers a little, then doing the same thing you probably have done for the last 2-3 years - sometimes longer.  I learned that advancement is entirely up to the individual to pursue and even large companies will not do anything to observe employees and determine who and when different people should be promoted, given more responsibility, or fired.  Co-workers are generally very nice.  The engineering arm is quite diverse, but the construction and executive arms are by far white males in all managerial and supervisory positions.  The hardest part of the job was giving and receiving feedback, particularly in regard to performance reviews.  Either the feedback was too politically correct and not useful or it was too critical and taken personally.  It was also hard to work for years and never see the fruit of your labor (the final constructed project) as much of KBR's work is FEED or bid related and does not become EPC work.  Further, the EPC projects"
good,"the inspector was a real pain to work with wanted things done that were very unnecessary , seem to be clicked up people were cool free coffee was nice and the cafe starbucks included."
good,"The work environment was based on who knew who and thats how you got ahead in the company. Very unprofessional."
good,Competitive pay rates compared to other companies but management on certain projects will not fight to raise wages when they cannot get qualified people and will work the ones they have in to the ground. Management does not care about its employees. Safety on some projects is said and expected but rarely seen in the field.
good,"The job was interesting because we were working in R&D and creating new and exciting technology.  It was constant learning because everything we were doing was new technology and our job was to push the limits and test units.  The job was often challenging for the very same reason.  The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with, we had a very small group and we were very close."
good,"The job was pretty standard. Did have any real challenges or ways to move up with the company."
good,"we are over worked"
good,"A typical day at work at KBR is usually 10 to 12 hours, starting at 6:00am, working Monday thru Saturday. The phones ringing non-stop, Calling and scheduling New Hires to come in on Mondays or Wednesdays which are Orientation days. Our employees come in and out of our office throughout the day with HR issues or to make any changes on their W4's, payroll, address, or just Jobsite issues."
good,This is a paramilitary company/organization that favors those with prior military service.  Most co-workers are professional.  Great training opportunities. Most enjoyable part was helping to enforce the US immigration laws.
good,"Always providing support to the Recruiters . I leanred to deal with different types of attitude since I worked with a lot of recruiters.  With management, I learned to always do my job right and I wouldn't have any problems with my managers/supervisors. Always treat co-workers the way same way you want them to treat you.  So I didn't have any problems with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was having patiences when we were hiring a lot of candidates and working so many works, just because everyone was tired.  The most enjoyable part of my job was treating my co-workers like family...and knowing that no matter what, we can always count on each other. Team work was the best in my group.."
good,KBR has its pro's and con's like any large company can have. I enjoyed working with my co-workers very much. We always worked as a teem. Know one was expected to work on a project by themselves. Every day we had a meeting first thing to discuss our job for the day and who we would be working with. If anyone had a question or a concern it was discussed before we started work. One of the hardest parts about the job was not knowing if you had to work over until the last minute of the end of the shift.
good,Hot and steamy work enviorment.  Good mannagement to work for.  Good fellow coworkers.  tolerating the heat.  Long work Hrs.
good,"very typical day while less sale is there ....& learned all the thing,s that manager need , management  are very good,"
good,every company has its ups and downs. I do what Im supposed to and not worry about the politics.
good,Great co-workers and some lasting friendships made. No advancement available due to the the Company needs as far as Admin staff are concerned.
good,"Yes you may have the most amazing pay cheque ever but the atmosphere and the organization in this work field is just horrible. The camp is nice but the people leading the project are not qualified to make things move and go on. In a 10 hour day you work 5 hours. Because of the contractor (syncrude) that is so much conserned about security, you cant do your job normaly. Be careful everything you do is watched...even if it doesnt seem like it. Be careful people seem nice but they will be the first to make you looze your job..."
good,"Compliance and monitoring production. I learned that regardless of how well you like a position to always save your money. I enjoyed the people, travel, and diversity. I would do it again."
good,One can feel honored to work for this company.
good,i like working in chemical plants and bp is a good one. there are so many different processes. only bad thing about my work experience there is that kbr supervision is not as proffesional as what it should be. a electrician is the superintendant and has no idea about pipe or other crafts besides electrical so therefore the jobs doesnt get planned out like they should by supervision. it was too hard to get what we needed to work with. i loved working maintenance and i worked with some great people.
good,KBR is an excellent company with a great opportunity for growth. I've gained an extraordinary amount of knowledge in a short time and look for to future growth.
good,Job was not as advertised. Recruiter stated two weeks of 7-12s . I worked 4-8s two days off and 6-12s with 3 checks.
good,Responsible for accurate interpretation and compliance of all KBR timekeeping policies and procedures as applies to the LOGCAP Project.
good,The job objective was very simple and to the point
good,"KBR is a good company, very organized with a lot of rules but, for your own good. Management is like management everywhere you have the good and the bad. No hard part about the job, I guess i say that because i catch on quick."
good,If your main goal is stability you cant do much better. Along with a9/80 schedule make this job much more apealing.
good,The company did not look far enough into the future to see that there would be no work for many of the new engineers they hired last summer. Now they are laying them off.
good,"After M.W. Kellogg merged with Brown And Root, to form KBR, the company policies went down the tubes.  For example, I was expected to fly to Indonesia on a business trip and we flew economy class whereas before with Kellogg, I would have flown business class.  A 25+ hour flight in coach is not a way to travel when the company expects you to go to work the next day after arrival."
good,"I did a lot of traveling for KBR. I trained the new hires when needed. I worked with the different admins through out the U.S. I maintained weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly Audit Reports on all Projects. I enjoyed what I did. I stayed very busy, most of the people I worked with were very enjoyable to be with. "
good,"KBR was my first contract and we were treated fairly and the leave time was also very good. The only negative was when it was close to the contract ending, you didn't know where you stood and it caused undo stress."
good,great place to learn and grow in the I. T. realm. forged a lot of long lasting relationships with great people across the globe.  the overall experience was like non other. It changed my life for the better.
good,i had a good time working there.every morning we had the safety meeting. talked about the basic safety hazards of the work area. after the meeting we went to crew meeting and were assigned are daily job. everyone was about the safety around the job
good,"KBR management asked unreasonable time frames for implementing corp.policy and training sessions."
good,"Unexpected things would break down repeatedly, coworkers were hardworking and good people. Relatives were given significant management jobs,although good people, sadly were not qualified to give out job assignments."
good,"At the time I left KBR, my position was changing and my role or position was not defined.  I had the opportunity to learn many different positions and was told that I had met expectations and or exceeded them.  I would be glad to go back to KBR if the opportunity comes up."
good,"I had the chance to work for the company in the good and bad times: it was a great place to develop your career, but right now EPC contracts are difficult to win and local managers are focusing on communication programmes rather than training their younger personnel to develop their technical skills."
good,Work place culture is friendly
good,Petrochemical EPC side of business is depressed. KBR is attempted to stay competitive in a limited market. many very talented staff have been forced to leave or seek other company positions.
good,Productivity was always accomplished within time frame needed for job assignments. Teamwork was always needed to accomplish tasks.We were able to do overtime as well.
good,"New management, losing focus... took away paid time off accruals, but reinstated.  Have to use PTO for public holidays... other than this it was a great place to work."
good,It is a good job. But that's it. Its a job. Not a place you can retire. Unless you are moved to upper mangament. Then you can stay forever. Layoff a lot.
good,"Your foreman will be underskilled, but the brother of the super. everyone is related to someone. Isnt quite fair. But, money is good if you can get in. They say that there is always money to be made in confusion, well there is plenty of that at KBR."
good,"without a viable charge code your job and hours were gone.  They were only keeping younger employees, especially if you are female.  Male employees are given more opportunities to stay until retirement."
good,The Foreman's cared about you and took a effort to get to know you. They paired you to people you worked well with and was always focusing on your well being. The only issues were with superintendents that seemed to care only about their bonuses and not your well being.
good,"The management they don't care about your rights, culture, and feelings, my co workers are all good we are here no choice most of the workers are all want leave and find a new job."
good,"There is a lack of clear direction from executive management. The solid legacies of M.W. Kellogg and Brown & Root are no longer enough to stand on. KBR is struggling ""to deliver"" the same level of service. Management is out of touch, and they don't seem to care what's going on at the project level. Benefits have been cut recently too. I hope KBR can turn things around because there are some really spectacular individuals here, but I haven't seen any changes recently that make a difference - just flippant noise from executive management."
good,"O.K. Environment - More career advancement "
good,"over all condition are good, not enough interaction with upper management, little concern with personnel on the floor, safety is good, training is good, personnel are treated very poorly, management hires on personnel issues not on skills, there is no career path for none staff memebers"
good,"Company did a poor job of bidding our contract. Engineering was extremely slow. Management did not adequately communicate with middle management. Management did not work well with sub-contractors. Problems retaining craftspersons."
good,"- 8 hours work for 5 days, Saturdays & Sundays are holidays"
good,"Received in all inbound parts to RDC, and staged in shipping lanes once completed. Ran a receiving department of 3 Americans and 15 Afghan Local Nationals."
good,Hardest part of the job is the swapping from nights to days and vise versa after only after 2-3 days of working one shift. management for warehouse seems incompetent.
good,"overall it was consistent, and good pay for the area, but the general insurance is ridiculously priced, eye care is better then the health insurance... just like most companies it seems anymore, that the company does not care about employees at all or very little.. acknowledgements for continued safety record lessened year by year"
good,"Start working about 5 am every day   enjoy working in sap "
good,"Work day is typical. Management is workable. Co-workers work as team players. Supervisors are willing to help workers, and are very good at doing their job."
good,"KBR is a hard working company. Majority of it's employee's are hard working American's. The did hire from Europe to work along American. Everything followed strict govt. guide lines. You worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. The hardest part of the job was telling customers we can't build new construction, that they will have to have the unit Engineers submit the Scope of Work to the Base Contracting Office. KBR turned to O & M only during my time with them. The good parts were being to keep all facilities working so that War Fighters and Contractors had a safe place to live and work"
good,"enjoy controlling equipment remotely air volumes, dampers motors air handler pumps room and zone temperatures turning on chillers adjusting cooling fan speeds to acquire proper temperature to decrease load on chillers"
good,"Liaising with customers is a different experience everyday, you learn to engage with people from all walks of life, management team has a felixible approach to work, co-workers are helpful and professional, the hardest part can sometimes be working across different time zones, but at the end achieving the right result is very satisfying"
good,"A typical day at work"
good,Unsafe work practices at this company. Love the team I work with just don't agree with management a lot of times. Production is a must but at what cost.
good,KBR employees some of the most dedicated employees I have ever worked with.  Compensation and benefits are acceptable.  Management has a hard time making sure employees transfer between projects which creates an unstable atmosphere.
good,"Good company to work for, I would definitely work for KBR again. Long hours over 12 hours a day 7 days a week. R&R's every 4 months."
good,"Very biased management and excessive favoritism"
good,"Losing jobs, contracts and money all over the place.  If you really want to work here I'd wait for a year or two.  Rudderless ship on a rough and windy ocean. Plenty of people fired, laid off, canned, resigned (pick one they all happened) MGMT at high levels in USA and CAN is incompetent. Right hand does not even recognize the left hand!  Why do all the people who steer companies need the biggest mental enemas?? Work somewhere else!"
good,for the first time doing contract work overseas. I was really satisfied with the job training and chances to learn and receive outstanding awards for the jobs in the logistic areas.
good,"KBR actuallypaid good for your position.  they also hired managers tha tseem to know what they were doing, unlike Dyncorp."
good,"A very safe company to work for, just not the benefits I am looking for in my future."
good,"I have been working for kbr for 3 year totally, they took over in december 2012 here at Dupont Sabine River Works. Really cant complaine to much about the company besides wish we had better benifits and pay."
good,"La parte que mas me gusto de KBR fue adquirir conocimientos contables en ingles, me acostumbre a llevar todos los papelees de trabajo en ingles y mejore mi nivel."
good,This rating is based on my experince with the company while being station in Iraq. I spent 3 years total in iraq working for KBR and it taught me alot.
good,This job was adequate at the beginning but they started to add more technicians than necessary to this area causing conflicts and decrease in pay. I would only look at this as a part-time job and nothing else why you consider finding a better part-time or full-time position somewhere else.
good,"Flexible work hours and decent pay."
good,"good company, I just had a bad suitation with my superviser"
good,"Everyday I begin with starting the appropriate paperwork. "
good,"Decent place to work, could be a better place to work if they payed better, or allowed for more overtime. Management is decent could use improvement on allowing people to move up."
good,"The company has alot of rules that you must follow, but overall it was a good company to work for.  Not getting paid while on leave was points against them."
good,"Work environment is good, the managers are very helpful and all provide the required training to their employees. I have worked with KBR over 12 years and have had the opportunity to work in several locations across the world."
good,Overall a good company. Opportunities for advancement and additional training goals.   Communication with employers and also a lot of support.  Team Management.
good,"This company is a good company to work but, I was feel like in other worker more, they don't make any recognition, o sees sorting good about your job. thats not nice"
good,"Rain, sleet or snow we were out to greet and direct everyone to their destination as well as patrol the property.  I enjoyed the onsite gym and my schedule the most."
good,KBR is a good employer and one of the largest EPC companies in Houston.  KBR has excellent tools for Engineers and Designers to perform their work.  The people are friendly too.
good,"working over seas is difficult and being away from friends and family is vary hard. Liked helping military, but very dangerous and did not want to be away. no advancement opportunities available."
good,"Working As a Airfield Lighting Electrician, that was great experience for me. Working in hazardous environment and warzone, but never get frustrated for job what I was doing. Coworker was very helpful."
good,"Workplace culture is great and growthful, and ability to use your stop work authority on a daily bases also they keep you informed with the weekly mass meeting and training opportunities."
good,"KBR (and by extension KBRwyle) is a company with a quality pedigree. I came into a position at the company that reflected much of what I was doing at my previous job but at a much faster pace, heavier workload, and greater demand, especially considering that we have to support multiple sites nationwide. Though I've adapted during my time here it's honestly become a little much. Our supervisors are located in Texas and, though they do their best to provide leadership remotely, we're almost entirely left to fend for ourselves. I rely on the experience of others who have only been there slightly longer than I have and even then we're flying by the seat of our collective pants. If you can handle the pressure than, by all means, apply here. If not then I suggest that you consider all of your options."
good,Great job site very safety oriented so work was slow had to wear earplugs and ear muffs when grinding would get fired if caught using cool down tents in 105 degree weather
good,"Company should adhere to more of what our craft employees in the field are saying...."
good,I was hired in the Administration department and I did not like when they moved me to a field. They certified me in hole/firewatch for the field.  The first day the sent me up 150 feet in the air on a tower to watch a crew working inside.  I didn't know I was scared of heights until then.  I am a lot better with heights now.
good,"I mainly worked projects in the field and it was very fast paced. I really enjoy the project work, traveling to different sites and states, and meeting all different types of people."
good,"Sometimes you worked really hard and sometime you had laid back days.bBut the pay stayed the same for 5 years,Thats what made it easy for me to leave."
good,KBR did not have strong IT management.  technology lay back and did not promote individual to do their work. workplace culture is not working friendly and individual focused.
good,"This company gave me a chance to come to work an learn an make myself a better person job wise an get to enjoy the job they have taught me to do, I would never look back only forward an that is all because of kbr."
good,"We produced a variety of fungicides for numerous of clients in the agriculture industry.Quality and safety was the backbone of the companies success.Every shift began with an orientation in which daily task and safety precautions were discussed.During shift communication was important,management was taking seriously the culture in the environment was always getting the job done.One of the hardest things at the job was working the long hours.I really learned a lot  and it help me out while going to school."
good,KBR Government is an exciting fast paced company to work for.  They are involved in pursuing large specialty projects for the military worldwide and have detailed procedures and processes in place that must be adhered too as the pursuit goes through the system.
good,it's not a bad place to work but hard to get on with them if you don't know someone that can get you in the door but the work is good and safe that's  a good thing in a job
good,"Typical big company. Not bad, just average. The managers I reported to were fair but seemed to receive a lot of pressure from corporate and have a lot of reporting they were responsible for."
good,Working in a war zone was challenging as well as stressful. The pay checks were the only thing that keeps you going when you work 7/12s for 11 months straight.
good,Working for a major company is great at times. Wonderful pay and benefits. Stressful and frustrating. Meet and manages many people from many walks of life.
good,"An ok place to work if you do not have a family. The pay is good, but requires extended time away. Overall would recommend to anyone willing to go overseas."
good,I liked working with KBR met a lot of good people. Constant work learned a lot from my superintendent amd foreman. For a short time became a foreman for a couple of months. It was a great experience with that job.
good,"It was a great experience, Lots of activities happening at the same time and this required  a lot of coordination to make things happen, we depended a lot on good weather and made the most of the good days. Other trades were good to deal with."
good,Very relaxed job other than not knowing if you were getting laid off without a notice at anytime. Management had no integrity. Benefits were good. Overall good place.
good,KBR believes in life balance and treats all employees as individuals.  Safety and job satisfaction are number one priority.  Company provided benefits are an extra bonus.
good,"KBR is a good place to work."
good,"KBR is a place that requires an engineer to rework their work multiple times due to project deadlines.  The job can be frustrating at times however the frustration at the office is well balanced with family life as they work the 9-80 schedule.  Every other Friday is a great treat for a stressful week period.  I enjoyed my time there but after many years of service, opportunity to advance was limited, ""pigeon-holing"" became an issue, and the company began to lean out due to the economic times."
good,"Modular construction consisting of various types of materials. Good mix of structural and mechanical inspections. Walk downs and deficiency lists, consumable controls are good."
good,excellent management workplace most enjoyable hardest part is driving in traffic road consttruction and parking in privilege garage or pay high daily rate
good,worked in Iraq in a war zone and was subject to extremely hazordous conditions. A war zone is a war zone and it is dangerous. Was shot at seen many people injured and I will never be the same.
good,I was  a sub contractor of KBR. Didn't deal with them much. But the housing and food was ok while working for them. They were the company to work for.
good,KBR is a great company to start your career off at. Wonderful company culture and opportunities to progress quickly. The people you meet at this organization is what I enjoy best. There is a wealth of knowledge floating around in the office.
good,KBR was not good to work for. They micromanaged employees. Wanted to much control of employees even in their personal lives. They did not look out for employees.
good,"We were bought out from Honeywell nothing really changed. Insurance is a High deductible."
good,"I was an Independent contractor in Iraq in 2003-2004 during the heat of the Gulf War."
good,Kellogg employees on this site are not kept in the loop of Kellogg activities. The site does not get the support of the home office in a project controls roll.
good,excellent company but has too many vice presidents in hierarchy structure. not structured for rapid advancement in management positions. positions held too long by same personnel.
good,"I'm not able to write a proper review for I worked at KBR a short period of time."
good,Good people to work with and good work culture. Senior management out of touch with workers. Sen ior management care only for themselves
good,Great job  great pay poor communication very high about safety but they don't keep their word with you tell you one thing and do another it wouldve been better if they hadn't lied to me and there is no job security its more of who you know to keep your job it's more like a buddy system
good,Good company to work for. I have worked for kbr multie times and have to admit that some jobs are better than others depending on upper level supervision.
good,"This deployment to Iraq under the circumstances was understandably dangerous and I volunteered three times for contract to deploy there."
good,When this company was in its prime I was very lucky to have the journeyman and the vast variety of versatility to learn from for my trade. there were very many different types of skill to attain.
good,"Challenging environment overseas, great to work with the military in supporting their mission in Iraq. It gave a great sense of giving back to the troops."
good,its a great place to work at but the work load is very much compared to other companies around the globe. I would suggest a new person to work there.
good,"Repairing pumps , reactor seals, Gear boxes, Precision shaft alignments, conveyors , packaging equipment , Valves, Hydraulics , pneumatic controls, new equipment installation as well as maintenance"
good,"Interesting large projects, good salaries, acceptable workload, one free Friday per month, good software packages. Promoted 4 times in 8 years"
good,The company's environment was very professional and the managers were concerned with producing top quality management control products.  And we were responsible with interfacing directly with the client.
good,"We have safety meetings, but, it is a farce.  Being expedient while on a job contract is important. However, when you hurry a job too much you put safety at risk."
good,I like KBR and the environment was easy and fun.  The bosses were easy to talk to when we had a complaint.  Some co-workers were not east to get along with but we made it work.
good,"KBR is a good company to work for. They are working on challenging projects in both UAE and Qatar. "
good,"They changed their rules a lot which is OK I guess. Adapt to your surroundings right? I had a lot of trouble getting scaffolding, parts, crane work, approved engineering changes. Everybody waiting on somebody else. They abused their cobra pipe program to the point of crashing, scratching for hours."
good,KBR is a company with slow growth until you are aggressive fighter to prove your caliber and take risk to prove yourself.
good,"10 hour days, 6 days a week. Pay was great and coworkers were awesome. Easy work but the days went by fast because you stay busy."
good,"Raise, place, and unite iron or steel girders, columns, and other structural members to form completed structures or structural frameworks. May erect metal storage tanks and assemble prefabricated metal buildings."
good,KBR is a good place to get some good pulp and paper industry experience wile working with some very knowledgeable people.
good,Their were people their that didn't do their job most of the time they were in the Boss office telling all the great things they did but really they would walk around and do nothing.
good,Needed better management in the safety department.  Good job site and other management was awesome to work with.    The crew was good to work with.
good,"My work day is filled with processing various tasks simultaneously. I have a wide variety of responsibilities which ensures no one day is routine. I believe I have mastered the ability to prioritize my responsibilities which helps me to manage my day productively. I support two Vice President's, an Assistant General Counsel, and a Senior Counsel which makes some days more hectic than others depending on their needs for that particular day, but I enjoy my work the busier it gets, and I am able to handle whatever is thrown my way. I have the luxury of being able to stay and finish a task if need be with no pressure of time table."
good,"One of the better contractors for overseas employment."
good,"I normally used to drive to a place close to the company location "
good,"good benefits, awesome management, enjoyable peers, lots of room for learning and advancements. The most  difficult part of the job was probably when the job came to an end. Truly a nice place to work"
good,"Had many responsibilities, warehouse, rigging, fitting, cutting pipe, hydro."
good,"- Typical work day includes working side by side with co-workers to assist users and get daily tasks done."
good,I have been with KBR since the 80's and have found that through dedication and hard work you can advance within the company.
good,"Hauled materials, supplies, water, fuel and equipment throughout Iraq in support of Army operations."
good,"Decent Pay, good hours and steady work. The most enjoyable part about the job was going home to family after a good days work"
good,best part of job was working with interesting and helpful people. worst part of job was 110 mile/2-3hr. commute each way back and forth to work. management was fair and helpful and caused no real problems.
good,"There was a good manage team, very enjoyable workplace too."
good,I received a commendation for 5+ years service with KBR. Worked with good workers and got along well with them.  the hardest part of the job is the heat
good,"i worked for 12 hours a day night and day shift, i have learned so many things especially handling different people with different cultures, as far as management is concerned i was able to do my part duties and obligations as transport supervisor, i have good relationship to my co-workers, the hardest part of the job is when i was about to explain things to my workers that they dont understand because of they dont understand english well, i enjoyed doing my job because everyday i took it as a challenge......"
good,"My position works off monthly and yearly processes it's maintly a project oriented position."
good,"The people that I worked with was the most enjoyable. When I was in payroll, Having all to balance out was a good feeling, even better feeling was the end of the week when you saw what you were working for. Hardest part of the job was when someone left the team to move on. We were like family there but of course a business to run. When my job was done at the end of the day as I was getting ready to leave, I had a sense of completeness. There was to many to come and go. Big turn over rate."
good,"Muy relax, (solo oficina) café gratis."
good,"Work was overall simple and very repetitious.We had a simple routine and nothing to be ignored. Once the routine was in place, boredom within the ranks took place. "
good,Things were well organized.Shifts were good and hours are very flexaible.
good,"No hike in the salary."
good,"working as maintenance in a refinery is always a pressure specially in a refinery,but because of this pressure i learned to handle & do my job fast without sacrificing the quality of my work & my safety as well as my co workers."
good,"Big push, Difficult management, low pay, poor weather at times, etc. Great people, low security requirements, exceptional Craftspeople."
good,"A typical day begins with roll accountability duty roster ,and old and new business for the day  then training assignments time and place is set for some time that day . After that all personnel assigned to the apparatus start equipment  inventory and serviceability  allowing time for a very thorough inspection of all apparatus and equipment ."

good,Communication fair with bilingual co-workers. Plant Operations very productive.
good,"its a good job. I advanced quickly into start-up,  where i can benefit the company better with my ability and qualifications."
good,Very safety minded company.  Management is easy to work with.
good,"My review is that this company is the buddy system. It's the only way to get hired and/or promotes. Good pay, gone 1 yr overseas."
good,"Best schedule to work, being off every other Friday! "
good,"Does not have employees best interest in consideration very manipulating company,"
good,"It was great experience for me, because I was able to work overseas working side by with the military. And was able to travel around the world. I was the only female working in the warehouse doing the inventory."
good,"Good company, good co-workers, I enjoyed working with this company and would like to work for them again."
good,Its not a bad job at times it was boring and the work done was outside work which wasnt bad at all  
good,The most enjoyable & learning  part of work. working as a team with a plan & get more appreciation for management.
good,I oversaw the daily activities of the Facilities Maintenance group with very little help from upper management. I did however; gain a better knowledge and appreciation for safety.
good,Working with engineering and construction to establish a plan or schedule for existing or up coming work.
good,"Hire and lay off frequently, KBR's contractor at Eastman Chemical Plant in Longview TX, seems to be very unsure of the information given to their contractors."
good,"KBR is a good company to work for, provided you are in a business unit that is in a growth area, or you have a unique set of skills and talents that can be sold as services."
good,Massive assests.
good,KBR was a good company to work for on the program I worked on. I was getting paid well for being a Network Technician Lv II.
good,"KBR was an experience that I enjoy very much can't really speak on everything ,it was in a war zone so I witness good and bad.."
good,"Start off day with our TSTI (Total Safety Task Instruction)meeting, after that we will go out to our equipment and do our regular pre-trip inspection on equipment. enjoyable part of the job is operating equipment.Hardest part of job is that you are not at home with the family."
good,Working in KBR company quit pleasure each & every aspect then good things to learn & good conversation day by day with the multiple people constantly i really enjoying
good,Issue equipment to soldiers/do inventory daily
good,DIfficult to advance in my career.
good,Routine and non-routine days while working with civilian and non-civilian colleagues. I learned to drink water and duck and cover.
good,"Began working for Kellog, Brown and Root (KBR) in 2004 as the Deputy Director of Logistics at Regional Headquaters Camp Victory, Bagdad Iraq"
good,"I worked 12 hours a day, 7 days a week and the work was self-paced but detailed and consisted of monthly inventory inspections and audits. Management cared about your safety and provided training in all phases of your employment. The environment was challenging but the company provided services to make assignment as comfortable as possible."
good,they were ok to their workers. they got alot to give and its laid back sometimes
good,"Management Non-attentive, rarely listen to their lower-level employees who as a whole have a better idea of what's going on than they do. "
good,"The warehouse I worked in has a lot of temps, so during any given day you never know who will show up. The work amount changes and is never constant. The management is generally very friendly and understanding/flexible."
good,From 2017-2019 I worked out in Djibouti Africa. My supervisor was very manipulative and treated me bad. All of the employees in the office had terrible attitudes. I felt that the employees were bullies an I also felt that a few employees were racist towards me.
good,"I have learned a great deal about my position through making mistakes. I have had very little direction, my responsibilities and supervisors expectations were not clearly identified and I have had little to very little mentoring as a brand new CM. "
good,"Typical work day has a meeting or two planned, standard work load is pre-determined by contract requirements"
good,"This particular job site had poor management. Favouritism. Long hours, next to none family time. Some of the co-workers were rude and unprofessional. The end."
good,"KBR internationally didn't support training programs at all for professionals, but overall my experience was good with the company except for this major deficit with respect to training."
good,The last KBR job was real good for the first 15 months then I was moved to another job site under a manager that did nothing but criticize ever thing You said or done
good,"Safety meetings once a week, safety was very important part of your job.  Run reports and headed to field to do all regular pumper duties. Management was good and I really enjoyed all the aspects of my job.  Learned lots and was proud of what I accomplished.  Then I moved into office and was in administration.  Worked in excel and run reports, filed sundries with the State of Wyoming and BLM."
good,I worked on an army base. My job was to support the military. That part of it was great. The thing that took away was the clique mentality that kept manifesting with the other contractors.
good,"I am an experienced engineer and was a salaried employee.  Work at times was stressful.  I did not like the extra layers of reviews that made work unproductive.  KBR did help out with short term disability when I was out with a sudden illness.  Unfortunately work in my office got slow and since everyone has to be billable to a client, I was laid off."
good,"A nice company to work for. Great company for providing service for military and operations. Met a lot of great people that still stay in touch, more family than anything"
good,The project was a plus for knowledge. The different people on the crews were the best to work with. The foremen were great at their jobs the qc personnel maintained high quality marks.
good,"I liked my Supervisor and I met some pretty awesome people and the benefits, but that is about all the nice things I can say about working there.  The environment was very controlling.  Too many peopled gossiping about others and unfortunately they have people in positions that should not be in them until after extensive training.  I guess another good thing I could say is, they offer advancement to personnel working out in the field.  I only worked for this Company once.  They are a Subcontract Company so it was only a temporary job.  Maybe all projects are not like the one I was on."
good,KBR is a leader in providing services in places many companies would not consider. in this case Afghanistan. The money was good but the hours and risks were adjusted to compensate. The holidays off were also adjusted to compensate for long hours and time spent away from home.
good,"worked 90 to 120 hours per week on open end contract driving all"
good,It's a great place to work if you just want the paychecks and have a 9am to 5pm schedule. If you are ambitious and like fast paced corporate culture it's not a place to be.
good,"Good levels of strategic management internally. "
good,"KBR was a very diverse atmosphere, working with many cultures and the military was an eye-opening experience.  It was a education as well as a job, that I learned much from."
good,the work environment are great to work with because we have many projects to experience but there is a strong focus on safety to insure everyone returns home safely to their families.
good,Just like any other oil field company. It's not what you know it's who you know. Too many white hats who didn't earn their position. Brown nosing to be supervisor and then expect their hands to kiss their behind. It's a 50/50 shot of getting a good supervisor.
good,Caring team mates.  Company going through changes that is impacting overall business for the company.  Oil and gas had a tremendous impact on companies stability.
good,Was a real eye opener in trying out new systems on management supervising the contractors on site.  Took awhile for the system to work and to progress with the new age of how the future projects will be handled.
good,"Good day at work. "
good,"Working with KBR, while sometimes stressful, is a highly rewarding experience.  Management sometimes seems a bit lost, but the men in the field more than make up for the occasional lack of communication.  A typical day consists of a morning meeting to plan the tasks for the day, then figuring out the safest way to accomplish the required tasks.  The most difficult part of any day is hitting some sort of obstacle that prevents the completion of a task, such as lack of materials, or someone being unsure of the safety regulations relating to the task at hand.  The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the co-workers.  Most of the people I personally worked with were hard working, and kept a good sense of humor about what was going on around us.  I learned a lot about being a pipefitter while working with KBR."
good,You work 3 straight months every day and then get a month off.  Some do 4 months straight.  No way to live life or hold a family but great way to stack up cash fast.
good,"I was inspecting materials unloading and loading trucks and trailers ,organizing warehouse,going through paper work,tracking heat numbers materials."
good,The employees at KBR are very willing and able but are hindered by poor senior managers that demoralizes them. The major advantage was to be able to continue working on PDMS package to advance my experience. Hardest part of the job was to give weekly reports to top management...
good,"It was a great place to work, too bad that they ran out of work to do."
good,"clocked in ,filled out safety report,dropped off at assigned buildings,cleaned offices,conference rooms and restrooms"
good,Work was very systematic and creative. Good communication process. Internal and external audits conducted was good. There was job satisfaction and JD's were followed well. Appraisals were conducted good.
good,No real loyalty shown to the employee. Company memos will simultaneously announce zero funding for holiday parties and across the board zero merit raises while boasting about consecutive quarters of profitability.
good,Generally good for working. People are professional and treat others as professional. Compensation is not bad and services are provided equally to all employees.
good,Good shop personal got work done timely and correct and easy going fun group. Office personal could use some better organizing skills but very nice people
good,"The typical work day seems to be  do more with less."
good,"Decent company to work for. Benefits and pay could be better and employers know it. Going through restructure and job loss is all around. Typical day is busy while wearing many hats. Management listens and understands employee concerns and works to correct as much as they can with the red tape they face."
good,"Fast paced working environment across global offices."
good,"For the most part I think KBR is okay. The office i'm in is understaffed, creating a lot of stress. I've been consistently working 60 to 75 hours a week for months."
good,A good company with decent benefits that offers challenging positions with access to a world of opportunities.
good,"12 hours a day everyday"
good,I identify and propose solutions that are effective in addressing day-to- day issues and discuss those with my supervisor routinely.
good,"I worked 6 days a week, 10-12 hrs. On call 24/7, rotating night on calls."
good,There is no room for advancement. Co-workers are great and I have learned a lot of new skills
good,"Hours were long, high pressure, very active and busy. Knowledgeable about the area and was well prepared. Good rapport with counterparts and US Military"
good,"the workers are great, every day you get to learn something new. everyone is there to help you."
good,I did receive advancement during my time at KBR but it was through a single manager who saw my potential.  KBR was not my favorite company due primarily to my first three supervisors.  My last two supervisors were exceptional.
good,Managment wants work work.. but safety comes first and managment should let safety do their jobs instead of trying to butt heads with us all of the time.. that delays work
good,"Lots of politics, good ethical behaviour of staff, highly competitive environment, No concept of time, high HSSE awareness, Good location, Good canteen,"
good,"safe work environment with other people and people around you, they got friendly foreman's who would help you what you are looking for. KBR gave out free lunches time to time."
good,"Not impressed much with the majority of the management, but the project in its self was good.  Management over admin was very unprofessional. Disappointed to say the least."
good,Good work life balance. Benefits improving. Good Entry level positions but pay can be improved significantly. Some growth ability but not major. Overall good
good,"This is a good overseas company.  They pay well and there is always room to grow.  You work 84 hours a week, but depending on the location and staff, this can be a fun experience."
good,"KBR had good Employee Engagement, which made the working life of employee relaxing, because there used to fun-filled days every month, a break from your regular work, which would refresh our mind, and make a good start to the work."
good,"When I signed on, the people I worked with were great and still are but when KBR got bought out and another company started taking over, a lot of people lost heir jobs. They had no projects under the new company so they had to start cutting overhead, including myself."
good,"Usually would help set up welders and their work areas and if you were able to set the work area in a timely manner, some of the welders would teach the different meaning of the welds and how to make them. Management would check on a regular basis to see if we were all upkeep on safety equipment and the workers was always intrigue to teach you new studies physically and mentally. Hardest part about learning everything was in a short period of time. The most enjoyable part was being allowed to perform some of the job task for practice and training."
good,"Each day has a different set of tasks depending on the aircraft to be handled or paperwork to be prepped and checked."
good,"KBR technology and resources are not up to date. The productivity of work is harder to manage if you do not have updated resources to assist you with balancing your day to day work.  Diverse backgrounds, all cultures."
good,Great team! Hard workers that put aside personal situation to make sure team was successful.
good,Management not very supportive.  Management seemed to be more concerned with self preservation.
good,"I work in a new branch office and my experience has been unsatisfactory overall. KBR is such a huge company, that communication between my new branch office and corporate headquarters was minimal. I think the office felt pretty insignificant and overlooked. Benefits are good; 9/80 schedule, paid transit, good health insurance (vision and dental included).  "
good,The company delivered all that they promised. They promised hard work and long hours for decent pay. Good pay was based on hours worked per week and not the hourly pay.
good,I truely enjoy work for KBR it had allow me to move up and share my experience in the work place.
good,Learned US and UK procurement processes. Co-workers have excellent work experience and have a lot of knowledge in KBR Greenford office.
good,"Velký tlak na výsledky, využil jsem svých zkušeností a kontaktů z předchozího působení v UOP Honeywell a pomohl KBR rozvíjet se v CEE regionu."
good,It was hard work and long days and one weekend off a month to come see family. Challenging workdays they kept me busy. Big jobs with lots of workers to keep safe.
good,"A typical day at work on the last project would include the following,"
good,"The work is fast paced (which I loved). I learned a great deal about KBR's philosophy of Systems Turnover from a great Department Manager.  I've worked for KBR on multiple projects and have experienced amazing managers and as well as horrible managers  (This is the case for any company, so you just have to roll with it and do your job).  The culture is a mixture of hard working and dedicated people working towards the same end result as well as lazy people who are there to socialize and draw a check (which is something only management can change, so you just roll with it). "
good,"Es buena empresa, se respeta los horarios de salida, se trabaja solo 45 hrs por semana de lunes a viernes, los viernes salen a las 2pm, ofrecen seguros de gastos médicos mayores y menores, seguro social, servicio dental básico, dan aguinaldo conforme a la ley, dan  muy poco de utilidades, los proyectos normalmente están bien administrados en tiempos de ejecución buen ambiente de trabajo, lo único malo es la estabilidad laboral, si no tienes planta te pueden dar un contrato incluso de un solo mes."
good,"Good place to work, co-workers were some of the best.  Most enjoyable part of the job were the people.  Technical expertise was some of the best in the business.  From staff to disciplines.  Learned a tremendous amount about EPC work.  What are the pit falls and what makes for an excellent project.  Surrounded by good people leads to a successful project."
good,"Good company, great benefits, great location. A lot of potential to be great. Wish them the best of luck."
good,I realy like working kbr also I have fun and indpend who you working for
good,Educational and great experince for overseas work.Good people to work with knowledgeable frontline supervisorss
good,some of the hardest worker that I've been around. Constant schedule changes but crews handled well. Difficult work enviroment.
good,"Company's policy is no work no pay, meaning no day off, no holidays."
good,I would like it if they would hire me for more jobs. They career center needs to have more jobs locally. Help guys who have worked for the company get work when they apply for work.
good,"-what i learn- healthy and safety of workers."
good,"The only job I worked with KBR on was fort Hills, was a good construction job, workers were good atmosphere was excellent. We were busy most days working on pipe installation"
good,Enjoyable place to work.  As long as you got your job done they did not hassle you much.  They were open to new ideas and let me revamp and improve the Cost and Accounting practices in place.  Regret leaving.
good,A good company to work for with great benefits and very well paying jobs with room for advancement. Lots of hours and great supervisors that help to maintain your family life.
good,Kbr is a very well run company and its a very productive workplace. Starting from the project manager to the formans they all treat you with respect and professionalism.
good,Good work life balance and employee development. My position was transferred to the Houston office and I am currently relocated to the Washington DC metro area.
good,"this was a very demanding job in a hostile environment ."
good,I had good luck here and they pay very well . There is also room for advancement yearly raise too .Overall a positive experience
good,Translate between American supervisors and Hungarian contractors and laborers.
good,Working overseas was a new experience for me but I really enjoyed it over there had a chance to see the world and I love it management was very good the hardest part about over there was the rocks but you can get use to that I had wonderful co-workers and I learn alot for been there.
good,"it was a great honour for me to work with orientated workers. it was so much fun. I got the chance to meet and work with people around the world whom I learned many things about their culture as well as exchanging notions related to work.KBR management in Camp Lemonier was strick. respect, listen and help each other."
good,"I enjoyed working for KBR as a contractor, unfortunately due to the economic downturn is was only for a year and a half."
good,very friendly environment. received a lot of my knowledge through them. enjoyed working for them and would again if they could bring the pay scale up to the industry.
good,If you like long hours and break your back kind of job this is for you. Company says they care about there employees and safety but when it comes down to it they don't.
good,"well managed, family oriented environment, loyalty is a thing that still exists with these people, close knit co workers, laid back, not tense, very educational if your willing to learn"
good,Paga bien buenos seitis buenas personas para trabajar
good,"the plant i worked in wasn't the cleanest but i like to get dirty."
good,"Day at work: "
good,"you did what ever the job required,welding piping fitting,millwright rigging,  very versital work"
good,"I work well with others ,and I took my day's off as scheduled by the customer, we had to fill out a plan of action every morning after the safety meeting"
good,I would do it again.  The most exhilarating time in my life. I learned a great deal about what the soldiers have to endure.  I learned how fortunate we are being Americans.
good,it a good company but the work atmosphere and the supervision lacks. supervision needed more experience in the field before taking a leadership role.
good,"Great Environment "
good,"This was a good company to work for aside from it's inconvenient location of being in downtown Houston, Tx. KBR did not have enough project work to keep me busy for long but I enjoyed working for the comapny because their projects were managed well and ran smoothly. They workded together as a team and the working environment provided enough privacy for me to be the most focused and most productive on the work that was given to me."
good,Not to bad of a job if you like to work 70 hrs a week and out in the elements.
good,A dangerous job performed in a hostile environment but at the end of every day I/we knew we gave it our very best.
good,"I was a Project Hire I really can't really give a proper Review. I was hired to get the Base back on Line, once that was accomplished I was terminated"
good,"Working for KBR was a great experience but working in Iraq at the beginning of the Iraq war was very dangerous, hot, stressful, long working hours and poor living conditions in the beginning, it improved."
good,"It was a very productive job every day."
good,working as a senior electrical technician for maintenance related activity. maintenance job is everyday challenging job.
good,Not much to say on this. Company that we where contracted to do construction for made the project very difficult to complete. 
good,Company faces constant challenges and would arrive at much more success with more training for managers.
good,"I loved this job, very good project manager with approachable management team."
good,"I loved working with KBR overseas...great people for the most part and the TTM drivers, well, we were all family when it comes down to it,  regardless of whos crew you were on."
good,It is good company but management will be ruin its credibility because some of them is useless and impudent but the payment is good foe life balancing and advancement.
good,"This is a good company to work for ,I have enjoyed working with them ,They have many perks for working with this company and I will work with them at any time."
good,"The company does not have enough engineering projects to support its employees."
good,KBR has a matrix type of management for engineering meaning that the engineers will have a Department Manager that they report to in their particular department and they will also have Project Managers that they will have to report to on the particular project that they are working on.  The enjoyable part of working for KBR is finishing a project and seeing that it performs as intended.
good,"Would like to keep working with KBR, but currently there are no positions available. I have learned a lot at this job. I want to continue in this same career path so hopefully KBR can pick up some work and I can get hired on the next project."
good,Decent company to be employed by. Family ties in most cases. 12 hour shifts in Western Iraq. Pay was great. Didn't like the  monthly pay schedule.  Unsure of where HR Manager stood on promoting employees forward.
good,"Within the 41 years with this company I have been blessed with the best of the managers as each one I have worked for has helped groom me for bigger and better job opportunities.  The employees I have worked with were truly good individuals and all had but one goal and that was to complete the task at hand in a timely and cost effective manner. "
good,"I would go back overseas, you have to be very strong person and being gone and in a war zone is not for many people. I have many skills and able to handle such condictions."
good,"This is a very dry work place environment. Management has the ""Good Ol Boy"" culture many have been with the company for 20 - 30 years and dont like change.  "
good,Good company to work with. Had good Co workers and job environment was good.
good,"Great co-workers coupled with a great location to work but unfortunately bad leaders and managers."
good,"Working in Iraq is certainly not for everyone. However, individuals that stay aligned with their goals and do what’s required of them will do well.  Some areas of management lack leadership experience; promotions are a matter of the best liked instead of the best leader. Things have improved over the years but the problem of experienced leaders holding senior leadership positions still exists.  The greatest learning experience one would gain is working alongside people from all places of the world.  This is truly a diverse organization unlike no other. There is much to be gained working alongside employees from other countries and diverse backgrounds.  Regardless of the money some do not perform well in adverse environment.  "
good,Its been a good job but like any job in construction its coming to a end
good,"Allright place to work. Stay busy every day. All co-workers are good to work with. Hardest part is that you stay outside all day. For work and lunch. Hot, cold, rain, or shine."
good,Great pay. All benefits but not so great health insurance. Long term work almost impossible unless you’re in the gang. HR and recruiting are biased when hiring
good,This was a good job to work on. Had some very good people on this project.Had employee's that were very good in there craft. The safety on this project was very good.
good,I think there is poor leadership in my department. The foreman's are rude and cut throat. They don't really know how to lead the team well. They show a lot of favoritism and exclude some of us from advancement of our licenses. I think if I went to another base or department it would be better. As a whole I think it's a good company
good,"great place to learn a skill. I went from being a helper to a full fledged pipefitter in a year and a half. Had an amazing boss, but work slowed down and the lay offs came."
good,My last 4 plus years was with kbr and I look forward to the next job with kbr I meet a lot of great people while working for them I also train a few guysout there at work
good,"Corporate management couldn't be any worse, leaving middle and lower front line supervisors trying to make gold out of hay. And the worker is the one that gets hurt in the end."
good,"A typical day at work would be getting in early, checking my mail and getting on with whatever task was in hand, either setting up my work or carrying on with an ongoing job."
good,"Really enjoyed my time at KBR, got to go place's that i would not of gone to.  Flexible with your working time, as long as you do your hours.   Also did 9 day fortnight."
good,"I enjoyed the company as a whole, but had the worst crew that I had ever worked with. That made it stressful. I was the only woman and they treated me horrible. I know my job and was very confident in my abilities, but my crew was all about helping each other and not helping me when I needed it. Instead I was made out to be a whiner if I asked for help."
good,"this was the first time working on a construction site.  I would do it again.  work, for the most part, was enjoyable. and enjoyed working with many types of skill levels and management."
good,Over all a good company need to cut out hiring relatives and giving them quicker promotions because they are family or buddies
good,"first thing there is a lot of family and friends working for KBR."
good,Management at times was hard to understand the reasoning for their what they were trying to accomplish. 95 % of the fellow employees were from good the great to work with the balance what you would find in many workplace environments
good,site management is lacking in people skills and experiance  in related fields kind of aimless.no drive to excel in the industry
good,"Normal working shifts were 12 hour days/7 days a week working and living in conditions that were very challenging"
good,We typically worked 12 hour days. We generally had a long hot days.
good,"Always being asked our opinion but never made changes."
good,"Have a safety meeting before work is started then start daily stretches to warm you up for a workday"
good,"Working in Iraq, military lifestyle work environment.  Bombs, morters, gunfire were daily.  Harsh environment."
good,At a point in working there I was thought to have a brain tumor. I missed work because of all the tests that had to be done and had notes for each absence but was still terminated for it.
good,"This was a good learning experience. When it comes to winning contracts, safty is number one. Being safe is the key to remember, weather you like the job and the people or those that are in leadership positions, when it come to your job be safe no matter what you do, or any one tells you."
good,Everyday is a new challenge but it's important to stay focus on your job task
good,"So, glade KBR gave me the chance to contribute to my country and service members down range."
good,"Any day of the week is very busy, I have learned to take the good with the bad and just keep moving forwar. Are management team is the best in the bunisses, co-workers help with anything at all times. The hardest part of the job is scheduleing everything in a timely manner. Safety is my most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"The pay is substandard. The HR department is excellent. Site managers are often former labor foreman, (that should speak for itself). The safety rules and regulations make it VERY difficultt to do some jobs, ie.""When working off a ladder, one must have 3 points of contact, two feet and one hand."" Have you ever tried to hang a light fixture with ONE hand? The obvious answer is to use scaffolding, BUT there is none or it wll not fit in all spaces!"
good,"Busy mornings, meetings and follow ups. Learned the overall functions of procurement and contract management."
good,Muchas oportunidades de trabajo buen salarios largos contratos y poca descriminaciones
good,KBR was a great place to work for and would still be there until they downsized and I was laid off April 2019. the work environment was relaxed and the number of people made it easy to comprehend the work and work at a productive and safe place.
good,"Changed out 12,700/13,800, switchgear and High and Low voltage MCC's. it was a major electrical project. Safety was first.... We worked around their process schedule."
good,"Good Company with global presence. HR Policies are good and good learning experience. Falls in fortune 500 companies. Has good reputation all over the world. Has its presence in ME, India, England, North America, Australia, etc."
good,Kbr kept me working for over ten years although not a lot of work on the books now. Lot of excellent professionals. The benifts used to be better scale of pay is average advancement in some crafts are slow but if you got it you got it. Training program is great.
good,"Company pays good and once there is a opportunity to work with them again I will defiantly go back again."
good,"The work is hard, but ultimately it is also rewarding.  The people at KBR are what make it truly worthwhile, and their overtime policy was the best I have ever encountered."
good,"I enjoyed my time at KBR and enjoyed the clients I served and the banks I worked with.  "
good,I worked well with my crew and did well with management. I was a working foreman and helped anyone that needed it. I am very good at communicating what needed to be done. I made sure everyone was doing their job.

Truck check off morning meetings and then come skills and drills and training for the day.I have learned how the oversea firefighting works how to operate better with limited resources and manpower. My coworkers here are great we live with each other everyday the station is our home so we are more then coworkers we are the closest family for our duration of the contract. The hardest part about this job is being so far away from the ones you love most you FAMILY. I enjoy everything about the job because i'm a firefighter deep down inside.

I really enjoy the fact I get to help soldiers on the battle field."
good,"Working for this company as a contractor for more than three years has been great for me; although I didn't have benefits.

Unfortunately like within any structures, disciplines or business there will be “stumbling blocks” within the HSE field. How you handle these situations and go forward is what defines you, how you learn and improve yourself."
good,",I was able to meet many soldiers as a civilian contractor working overseas in Iraq.

good,"I spend most days running tubing for reactors and HPLC pumps on skids, I've learned certain processes for the instruments I have installed. The lab owners I work under are easy going people, my chain of command is alright (some nicer than others). Hardest thing I've had to do so far is learn to identify and understand the instrument legend here isn't the same as out in the ""Real World"" .The location itself is a great workplace, as anywhere else there is some drama within every contractor company. Working in a lab has been very fun and beneficial for my talent and knowledge in instrument fitting to grow. I have worked out in the elements and now indoors, both are OK with me."

As with all companies, there were many dedicated folks who completed their missions under the most trying conditions. And of course there were those who were just doing their time. In my experience, advancement came to those who knew someone more often than to those who understood their job and did it well. Considering we were in a war zone, KBR did a great job at taking care of their employees, especially with medical support. I am glad to have worked for KBR in support of our troops."

good,KBR seems to be emerging from a rough few years for the industry.   Company lost a lot of employees through layoffs and retirement.  The people who remain are a talented bunch.
good,"I enjoyed my time with KBR, but the term kinfolk, brothers, and relatives are true. Many people are promoted with no job experience just because of who their family members are, and when it comes time for layoffs they will not honor your previous evaluation even if it is from 2 days before. Other than the severe nepotism, it was a terrific job."
good,"I liked working with kbr for multiple reasons they took all the steps to keep a good work flow, as well as a no one gets hurt work place. Very diverse with thier employees . Overall great company"
good,"I had worked for Kellogg before its merger with B&R and started my career at B&R as a design trainee, so I was very loyal to both.  I looke forward to a new and dynamic company when the two companies' merger created KBR."

As a Novice technician. great place to experience new things and a great place of learning. though we never tried to open a genset because of the limited contract that we had, i still enjoy working with the people around me and the management who's very accommodating to the people like me who is just starting in the field."
good,"Typical day at work is working with people of various cultures."
good,work day depends on group you are in or Client that you are working for.  co-workers are good people.  Management seems to think they know more then clients and results show that the clients disagree..

good,Working in a contingency environment presents specific challenges that can only be encountered in a war zone. The danger is always present and the 12 hour days take their toll but seeing the fruition of your work supporting the troops is rewarding. The biggest challenge is being separated from friends and family back home.
good,"For Mexico, KBR has one of the best workhours in the business, also is one of few places where overtime work is paid as it is supposed to be. Here there are many great written procedures to follow."

good,A typical day at work includes staying busy at all times. There is always something to do. I learned how to properly prep shower pans and am now able to teach others. My co-workers are easy to work with and provide assistance to me when I need it. The hardest part of the job is working in the heat. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing the work everyday and making a living for my family.
good,"No job security. Once you complete a project, you are on your own to apply for a new one before your benefits expire."
good,Efficient in work place . Work accordance with company policies and procedures.
good,"I learned a lot about dealing with different contractors and different personality types while working with KBR.  I typically dealt with contractors, making sure that they received the material that they needed in the field at the time that they needed it.

good,Working abroad for KBR was a great experience. I was afforded opportunities to learn different skills that may not have been accessible state-side.
good,I loved how the company provided you with a way to test your skills. They also provided after work training so you may increase your pay scale.
good,On the logcap project it is hard being away from family and friends. the shifts were 12 hours long but the work wasnt too difficult. The hardest part is when you have a convenient store clerk come to the company and stay long enough to get a management job. They tend to force the 7/11 management skills onto regular employees with a college degree or veterans like myself.
good,KBR work environment is absolutely great! The people that I have encountered through the years have contributed to my growth as a person professionally and personally.
good,"KBR was a great place to work. There was plenty of opportunity for advancement. They were flexible with work schedules. In general, it was a very professional environment. The upper management was genuinely concerned with the well being of their employees."

good,"I never actually worked at KBR, I was hired by KBR for a 3 month contract and stayed for almost 13 years. I loved my job and looked forward to going to work every day."
good,"I recently joined Indeed and I am very happy. For the first time in my career I feel that I am at the right place and all the hard work has paid off. I work with a very friendly and collaborative team. My manager is very helpful and eager to guide me. The perks are amazing and I get to save money that way. The position makes it available for me to learn much more, increase my current skills and obtain new ones."
good,"I have a lot of opportunities to learn new skills."
good,"If you understand that you'll be handling hardware, you will do fine.  Handling software requires a clearance.  There were also lots of mundane tasks you needed to perform around the workplace that was not pleasant to do."
good,At the time the joint venture was well run and organised.  As the joint venture is unlikely to rekindle it is not work mentioned this comment in any review.
good,"When I was there, the pay was great. The biggest drawback was being away from the family. I had a good manager, treated me fairly and the job itself was pretty easy. There some that werent happy being there but loves the pay. Which didnt make sense to me. There is room for advancement and make six figures. My time with KBR overall is one that I will never forget."
good,"I have been with KBR over 65 years, I like working for them for the most part but the last couple of jobs the Management was not the same. They looked the wrong way on a lot of things that were costly. I still like KBR but am prepared to work for other contractors am not as devoted to them as I was."
good,"Upper management is fairly non-existent so PM's are pretty much left to do what they like on remote projects. Although they are making great strides, still a fairly inclusive place to work."
good,"KBR is the best PMC i have worked ever with. Great entry level position with stability, structure and guidance from management. Not to mention the positive work-life balance and fun young culture that goes with the company."
good,General foreman and general foremen were always very fair and gave me an opportunity to learn on the job. Good atmosphere in the shop and people to work with
good,Large Industrial Projects.  Very challenging and interesting.  Had experience in their primary industry so was comfortable with working environment.  Enjoyable!
good,"Laborer was responsible for removing debris, tearing down fixtures, etc. Management was very professional and direct. The population and culture was thousands of people working on site. Hardest part of the job was when the weather changed making it hard to complete task. Pipe fitting was also a part of my work. With careful instruction I was able to provide great services."
good,"Met great people. Management was fair and friendly. Always provided necessary tool, supplies, and information to do the job. Very focused on safety. One of the best."

good,"I enjoyed Working with KBR."

good,"The job is good it keeps me busy, i've learned new skills, management is okay, workplace culture is different to the UK. Meeting new people is the enjoyable part of my job"
good,"Top Tier Engineering Company. Hard working teams, that can step up for the challenge. Management need to spend time & money by further training this hard working teams to next levels."
good,"Unfortunately, this shouldn't be a tap on the back but compared to other companies, KBR had all their tools and material to perform the job. You are set up to succeed and that is what I liked about this company,"
good,"KBR was like any other plant job I have done. Good hours and salary, plenty of overtime. early mornings, shutdowns, good management and foreman are easy to talk to."
good,"A typical day in Iraq was as follows: Wake up, work, eat, sleep, repeat.  What I learned most there is that I could still use my skillset to perform tasks and exceed expectations. Due to the conditions there, for the most part, management did not have the appropriate skills to manage effectively. You, therefore, had to adapt your own skillset to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was try to predict when and where you were going to be mortared."
good,"Great company with mid to high advancement potential. "
good,"Worked overseas in Iraq,I loved the job I had,learned a lot met lots of people from various backgrounds and countries.Work environment could be all over the place,very stressful and at times very dangerous. This was a contract position,some people had a terrible time,some not so much,really depended on your luck in being placed in a good work site(management)."
good,Good ace to work.  They were very polite kept me working  I would work there again the culture wS great safer place to work management saS good wages were good
good,"kbr is a good company to work for the wages are amazing and the employees are treated very well. Only down fall of the great money is the traveling and being away from home most of the time, the company does always try accommodate everyone while being away from home."
good,"KBR wabi ltd is a good company to work for, they treat the employees good and they also make sure they have the best available lodging for the employees on jobs.

good,"i learned a lot about rebuilding pumps, dial indicators and laser alignment, conveyors, dryers, and several other types of rotating equipment. it was a good job there just wasnt much room to grow."
good,If you're looking to earn a good some of money then working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country you may want to consider specially if you can get a job at a company like KBR-AMCDE.
good,"A typical work day would be starting with a safety meeting for the whole company to remind them of any safety hazards rather it be a change in areas from work done, weather conditions, getting complacent, anything that could happen from the job getting done that day."
good,"Great place to work. I worked on some very diverse, challenging and interesting Projects. KBR gave me the opportunity to work in some great locations."
good,"La empresa tiene niveles de sueldo altos, muy buenas prestaciones y paga tiempo extra, pero si no se tiene un contrato de planta no se tiene seguridad en el trabajo, en ocasiones te hacen contratos hasta de 2 semanas por la misma inseguridad."
good,"A good company to work for if your into the refinery type of work. But overall I've enjoyed working for them. KBR will compensate you for your potential and productivity.I worked with them at EXXON/MOBIL in BaytownTx, we were constructing another plant that makes the fuel for the turbines."
good,"From organization charts to technical help to acronyms, information was not only available but easy to find. Assembled a good team. Lots of experience with mega projects."
good,The job is good and the hours are good. The bad thing is there is obviously no job security but that's due to the nature of the job. The work experience was very valuable and can help you advance towards your next job.
good,Great place to work.  You feel like you are part of a family.  The stress is lower here than at other engineering firms.  I learned a lot.  Management is okay.  My co-workers are great!  My job is really good.  The social feeling of being a part of something special.
good,"Good company that provides exceptional compensation for services provided.  Benefits are exceptional, job security and advancement are always present.  The work environment was friendly"
good,Drove Heavy Trucks around Iraq in military convoys from base to base under hostile gun fire. Job was extremely dangerous but was working with other good drivers. Management was lacking. The hardest part of the job was being able to drive under hostile fire which not everyone can do and being away from family and friends. The best part of the job was the $$$ and being able to travel to close countries in the far east.
good,"During my tenure, I have learnt to be a competent SAP user and other sub systems required in the Project. I had an excellent relationship with my direct reports and I would say we were the dream team and I would work with them again in a heartbeat. "
good,OK Temp agency. Benefits are not the worst I have seen. Was asked by KBR to rejoin the company but through their temp agency.
good,"a lot of good people trying to do things right the first time ,,, a strong safety culture, the work is good, here Koch has done a good job working with us"
good,"a typical day for me was a long one usually. I have learned so much from KBR about how the oil industry works along with various machines and tools i never even knew existed. Management was pretty decent except for some who would give people they liked better work for the day depending on how much they liked them. but otherwise really great management. the hardest part of the job was being outside in 100 degree weather wearing full coveralls, hard hat and gloves all day on some days. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers which made the days enjoyable and go by faster."

good,Great company for a new grad like me to learn and transition into the full-time work life culture. Fun networking environment and opportunities with the young professionals organization. Work flow is steady depending on department.
good,Challenging work environment. More Possibilities to explore knowledge. Less stability. More employees are hired as secondment from job agencies.
good,"I think this company is good, culture is great but advancement is not encouraged. I have worked there for over a year. People are great here and help when you are in need. The office in downtown is a good location. Company is going through a BIG restructuring which will show its effects in the coming years, hopefully for the better."
good,Nice People to work with.  Very helpful. Very nice work culture.  Flexible work hours.  Great benefits. Not much training provided.
good,"Work starts at 8am and its all work work till lunch time. A great team with relentless effort whenever i need assistance.

Technical support is very good as well as personal services offered."
good,Had a blast working with the team I had and supporting the big wigs on their offsite meetings.  Lots of restaurants in the area and everything was within walking distance.  Job function was mostly backups and shipping it off to the Houston site.
good,Schedule is great. Co-workers are very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is the skills you acquire from other workers. The hardest part would be areas you are required to work in (Dupont Delisle plant in particular). Can't complain too much about KBR. Good company and are always keeping safety above all other principles. 
good,This is a great company with good benefits and opportunities within for advancement.
good,I enjoyed my time working for KBR - I was in Iraq so the work/life balance was non existent but the people I worked with and met on a daily basis will always be a milestone of my life.

good,A typical day at work was challenging and full of fun. What ever I have learnt is because of their University which help you solve and figure out all the problems that comes across. They had a good management and my co-workers always worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was meeting the month end Schedule and my most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet those Schedules and in time producing the reports that the management wanted to see.
good,Even tho I'd work twelve hours seven days a week. I got to interact with different cultural people from all over the world.
good,"I have worked for KBR Pty Ltd for approximately 8 years and have seen the company go through a large variety of organizational changes including possibly the most significant, its separation from Halliburton. I have also seen the company make a number of structural changes in its response and recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)."
good,In a very hostile environment like vbc I was able to find good friends who stick through thick and thin that made me to work regularly(12/7) with joy and perseverance.
good,"I started when it was CAS, Inc and have went through the several buyouts to where we are today.  Its definitely not CAS anymore but it happens with growing pains.  I learn something new almost everyday.  And I keep in mind that we are helping the warfighter keep us safe."
good,While working as a journeyman electrician the scope of my job was ACL oversight typically doing electrical inspections before QC final walk through by doing these inspections I was able to pick up new skills (eye for detail)that I could not get by actually doing the job and seeing quality installation in the end was thebest
good,KBR (UK) run operations in the austere environment of Afghanistan. Being away from home is tough enough and working under KBR can be very tough at times. They have good practices all round with Equality and Diversity throughout. Long shifts can lead to feeling unappreciated but in the end a good company to work for.
good,"Supervising jobs Safe and on time."
good,Acceptable benefits during my employment through when I left but I was told many benefits were cut while company workload was very low for several years after I left KBR.
good,"Buena empresa para iniciar a laborar, ofrece buenas prestaciones."
good,Work tasks were often very vague which resulted in playing the guessing the game when providing data. Management was quick to burn you if you mess us. Felt like I had to watch my back in fear of getting fired.
good,"Kbr was a great company to work for ! Competitive wages and 401k options. Trained you well on safety, and craft. Only issue I had was with site DuPont it was closing down and work was extremely slow and there was no over time."

good,"KBRwyle is a great place to work. They have allowed many of the employees to improve their skills while working at KBR. At KBR, you get to work next to many different people from different branches of the military. It's a great place to work but the pay is good for a college student/ retirement, not a career."
good,"I had two titles while at KBR. Initially I was a Journeyman electrician. We worked 12 hour days with too few tools and often General Foreman and Foremen of lesser experience. Our working partners however, made the job as enjoyable as it could be under the conditions. As the Electrical SME while in Quality Control, I was able to gain experience and training with inspections of not only my electrical assignments but cross-training in Fuels, HR, Water, Food Prep, Fire Control and Transportation. "
good,"Well satisfied with working for company. They are for the working man with good advancement.Always oportunity to advance. Good benefits. We had good equipment to work with. They appreciate work ethics and the full safety of their employees. Employees are rewarded when good job performance is completed. Most companies move on to next project, as to where we were told ""good job"". Time off or days off were valued and allowed if need be. I enjoyed my job and worked as much as possible. There was always work and allowment to work with others.I enjoyed my experience there and the opportunity to advance myself and get any certifications that I could get. Over all, it was a learning experience."
good,They need to get more awards to keep their core group employed.  The skill and organizational maturity that differentiates them from their competition is what needs to be highlighted to the customer as providing value to the projects.
good,Typical day is meeting with government customers and making their job easier by giving solutions to the problem. Hardest part of the job is that it is contract work.  The culture is like most office cultures.  Management does not micro-manage.  They like you to think on your own but still provide help if needed.
good,"each and every day it was as fun as it was learnable"
good,KBR works to place me in a job that meets my capabilities and salary requirements.  There are opportunities for placement in different locations and different job descriptions in engineering.

good,"I worked with KBR in Iraq. We worked 12 hr days,  7 days a week. "
good,"I worked with KBR in Iraq in support of OEF/OIF.  KBR did a fantastic job providing for both the troops and their workers.  Living quarters were good, food outstanding, and overall, considering it was in Iraq, not a bad experience at all.  Safety was paramount in everything KBR did."
good,Change of contract and rolled over with them.  I enjoy working and normally volunteer to much to help others.  I really enjoyed working for KBR.  Got to go to Houston for training.

good,"Great pay, great benefits, I guess the experience all depends on which job site and crew that you end up on. As a direct supervisor, I learned that having an HR office on site makes grown ""men"" turn into the biggest crybabies. I have seen good supervisors get fired because apprentices were lazy and plotted against anyone that made them work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the entitled unlicensed apprentices that threaten your job."

I have learned how to create a less stressful environment, during challenging assignments and create a good cohesive team with open communication as the base.  I was very thankful that all of the managers that I was under, all were knowledgeable and willing to train anyone who asked for assistance.  All of my coworkers are a great help to one another and are willing to assist when new challenges occur.

good,KBR was a joint partner on this 60 Billion plus LNG project.  I found the co-workers to be knowledgeable and great to work with.

good,"KBR in Iraq- Long hours, extreme weather conditions, dangerous environment and thoughts of being away from home months at a time linger in your mind. You don't really think about it, you just try and be proactive instead of reactive. You have to have the cockroach mentality of adjustment to environment, circumstances, and situations. A good approach isn't so much thinking but more instinctive but not complacent."

good,"On a normal day, I'd grab parts for the engineers. Then, once they're done, I'd return them to stock. Also, I'd recieve mail from USPS, Fed Ex, and UPS and deliver the mail to person it's for. Once a job is ready for the customer, I'd pack the job and prepare for it to be shipped to that customer on the following Monday.

The company supplies its employees with everything needed to complete any task that may arise in order to complete the job. KBR also takes employee safety very seriously, which is vital on a construction worksite and means a great deal to me personally. The offer classes and educational opportunities for all of their employees who wish to advance in their craft. Overall, the workplace culture was very inviting, my coworkers were willing to give insight when necessary to educate and make the completion of a task easier/safer. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the elements of mother nature. After all, my time with the company was spent during the winter months where temperatures were often 20 degrees or below with a wind-chill that sometimes dropped below zero. What I enjoyed most about my job with KBR was what I was able to take away from the expansion project. I learned how to read and interpret isometric drawing and blueprints. How to navigate through the jobsite with coordinates and elevation benchmarks. I enjoyed my time spent in Enid, Oklahoma and am proud to say I contributed to the construction of the Enid Expansion Project."

From time to time management gave a persona that they were more in it for themselves instead of the employee. It's a great cultural place to work due to the ever so growing changes within the company's global background. The hardest part was leaving the family to go on a contracting bid for a whole year.

good,For 20 years was a great company to work for. We had job security and never had to worry about our next job. KBR was a people company and took care of their employees. Now it has changed to where a person like myself with 35 years + service gets no more consideration that a person with no KBR  experience off the street gets. I can say overall I have had a great career at KBR and would like to end my career at what I call home KBR.

A typical day of work included heavy clerical/computer entry work that included establishment and maintenance of engineering documents and records.

Felt though there could have been more training and courses offered,so there would have been room for advancement or transer to other departments."
good,"KBR is a great company to work for. There are a few issues that most supervisors have to deal with but job security always wins the battle. KBR has been known to be kicked out of projects and leave their people jobless but fortunate for me, that hasn't happened to me. Benefits are available but not the best. But overall, my moral stays positive,,,as its does ay any job that I supervise. Even though KBR isn't a great paying company, people stay with the company because of their job security."

good,Every morning we started off with stretches which got us warmed up for our day.Then our foreman would brief us on the tasks for the day and send us in partners to conduct tasks. Throughout the day he would check on us and discuss our progress and make sure we were on the right track. My coworkers were very helpful on my first day and taught me how to do my job properly and efficiently. I'd say the hardest part of the job lifting the heavier materials but I always had the help of my coworkers if something was ever to heavy. The funnest part of the job for me was working in the scaffold yard and learning all the different pieces.
good,"As a sub contractor I have mostly good things to say about KBR. They are an excellent company to work for. A very large company; but they seemed to truly care about their employees.

The job could be stressful at times, but then again what would you expect working in a war zone. However there were days when I would absolutely forget that I was even in a foreign country. The most fun thing would definitely have to be dealing with the different personalities and backgrounds of the individuals that you come across. All in all it was an awesome experience that I wouldn't trade for anything in the world, even though I witnessed my fair share of mortar fire."

The management always make sure you do your job right and you deliver to the customer which in this case the US army. We all have our own sections and jobs assigned to us so all employees have created a way to work with each section. The hardest part of the job is that our warehouse is in an open field and Kuwait temperatures can be so unforgiving but we manged to find a way to work in this condition.

good,A typical day would be processing employees for the chartered flights going to and out of Iraq or Afghanistan. Doing reports for all other departments in all other areas of the theater. Checking the flights for the next schedule. Answering communications thought the net and fixing transportation for in and out-bound employees. The management basically trusted us to do our job and keeps track on our reports and communications. Everybody in the department knows their job so we all work together and we all have the same goal to do the job right and avoid any delays since time is very important. the hardest part of the job is staying outside where temperatures could reach up to 48degrees being in the Middle East. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting a lot of people and knowing ones experience.

good,"KBR was a fun company to work for. From the constant changing environment to the people you work with. You don't often get bored. The 'good ol' boy system' and hiring 'friends of so-and-so' is problematic at times, but over all it's not bad. They have gone down on their 'abilities' as a company, but I still like the team I worked for."
