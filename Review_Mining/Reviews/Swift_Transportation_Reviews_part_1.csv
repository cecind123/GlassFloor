rating,review
bad,"No i shouldn't have but i gave swift lease a try and it was probably they worst decision i could've ever made in my entire life. I knew better but i had to see if people was blowin smoke and sure enough thiers no comprehending how terrible this is. Cant make no money cant take the truck your leasing to another company.  Swift control everything, your loads and your lease truck .  Its like leasing a car from a dealership and the dealership tells you where you can not drive the vehicle you spending your money on.."
bad,"Absolute disregard for employees"
bad,Swift is not the place to expect to be well trained.  They still hold you responsible to know that which they failed to train you on. I have already told you enough.
bad,Your pay all over the place and you be sitting out for days at a time when they don’t have load for you. No home time. Got home for two days and your pay will drop a lot
bad,"This job isnt for everybody but when you make excellent money it's worth dealing with the hard life of this job. Excellent money is a understand statement at swift and its not worth the headace or the trouble to continue with them, thier pay scale isn't compatible which is truly a minimum wage job hands down. Its like being a police officer making 8 bucks an hour or a doctor making 9 bucks an hour i wouldn't be surprised if everybody quit"
bad,"Don't bother standing up for yourself, doing well, etc... Don't waste your motivation on this company... They have loads, but don't take the job unless you care not for yourself."
bad,"they continued to find reasons to berate and ""suspend"" drivers. they do not attempt to help their drivers be successful team members. my dm was horrible at being helpful"
bad,The money doesn't justify for the sacrifices that must be made.When your away from your family for weeks and months and your pay check relatively low in the ballpark of  a fast food establishment. Definitely not the place to be successful.   finding a trucking job that pays by the hour which you go home each and every day you're Winning.
bad,"No training—-Resolve customer complaints via phone, email, mail, or social media."
bad,I thought truck drivers made good money maybe im at the wrong company. It's a lot of jobs thay pays 400$ i never thought this type of job pays that. Factor in the weeks of training cdl licenses its so much going on with this job you cant do nothing with this little money but waste your life.
bad,"Unfortunately the drivers are treated poorly, we’re just a number. Very high turnover rate. They do maintain the equipment however. If you have a repair issue, they normally fix it quickly."
bad,"All you are is a number to swift, no one cares what is going on in your life. It all boils down to the money, they will do whatever it takes to move freight and make money, even if it harms the drivers by lack of home time and lost wages by waiting for loads. Good place to start and get a cdl, nothing good beyond that."
bad,Swift is doing everything they can to force lease drivers owner operators to quit. Im not sure why swift dont end thier owner operator leasing program.  Owner operators net pay is the act same as company drivers net pay which is PEANUTS$ get away from this company it will ruin your life. A real owner operator company will never pay u 1.00 a mile its unconstitutional.
bad,"Face it one dollar a mile for an owner operator with eight cents on empty miles is clearly not a real owner operator operations.  When its all said an done the net pay will equal the same net pay as a company driver and as you know company drivers get PEANUT$.  It's a good tool to gain owner operator learning then take that to a real owner operator company where you earn a minimum of 2,000$ - 6,000$ a week take home. When the take home pay is good it keeps you in good operations to build good capital and you can put yourself on a payroll its impossible to do that working for Swift Transportation. I leased for three month at swift and i moved on to a excellent paying company."
bad,"If you work for this company, you will never want to drive for anyone. They make it so had to make a living. They do not care about your family, or home time. The only thing they care about is the truck and the load. Do you self a favor and stay away."
bad,Word of advice. If your leasing a swift truck and it break down the best thing you can do is packup your gear and head home because its over for you. Chances are you dont make enough money to cover repair cost and while its in the shop for how ever long you still gotta make the payments so your best bet is make sure you got away home because your run with swift owner operator division is over.  You got a much greater opportunity at Prime UPS FedEx and other companies that respect the nature  of the business they want do you dirty like swift will...
bad,"Making bad decisions is a part of life and working for a meat market trucking company will teach you why you shouldn't work for them.  It's a waste of your time with absolutely nothing in return.  Beware drivers Beware.  Lease owner op drivers get the worst treatment beyond recognition. Miss a weekly truck payment and swift will take thier equipment back , knowing its impossible for you to pay it if swift not giving you loads that covers the payment. Thier is no honor what so ever inhumanity back stabbing to the lowest denominator company. Driver leaders dont no the difference between a pig and a bird good luck asking them for help. Dysfunctional and cruel company to work for."
bad,I scan the bill of ladens at the time of completing the trips. They dont pay me for the trip until 2 weeks later. I been here 6 years never had this issue and its every pay. Some weeks i dont get paid because of this games payroll is playing with my money and im sick of it. I dont like jumping from job to job but in this case its necessary.
bad,"Because all the good loads go to leasers and team drivers, as a company driver, your the bottom feeder. They say you'll receive detention pay for downtime while waiting to be loaded or unloaded. I worked there over three years, not once did I receive detention pay. They want you to communicate via the Qualcom..If you need a question answered quickly..good luck...they ignore you."
bad,Went home did 34 hour reset returned back on the road worked 4 days my check was 157$ ? ? ? Before i went home my check pervious  week was 375$ !!!  I dont understand this at all its not making sense to me. I reach out to driver leader to ask questions about this and her response was it's nothing i can do about it. DONT COME TO TRUCKING ESPECIALLY SWIFT TRANSPORTION THEY WILL TREAT YOU WORST THAN TRASH. YOU CAN COME FIND OUT ON YOUR OWN I GUARANTEE YOU YOU WANT LAST A MONTH.
bad,Was assigned for a driving route. Within a month that route was closed down and instead of once a week went to assigned as home monthly (if I was lucky enough) you upset the wrong person they give you the worst routes or the shortest so you go from 400-500 miles a night if you're running decently to 150 if you are lucky. Absolutely horrible. It may be a training company but dont work thereof you absolutely dont have to.
bad,It was horrible I hated it they treat you like dirr it was the worst experience I have ever had I would not recommend this company to anyone hometime was non. Existent
bad,Best advice don’t never become a truck Driver that is not good for your health and there is no money at all. As a person this is a worse choice i did in my life .
bad,"34 hour restart between every load. No miles, maybe 1500 to 2000 miles a week knowing I can run 3000+ solo Near impossible to get home when you need to and they couldn't care less about a family emergency."
bad,You couldn't drive the truck. The quallcom did. if you went too slow you got in trouble. If you went too fast you got in trouble. When you had trouble no one could help then you got in trouble with the driver/manager. It just seemed to could never do anything right and they would send you out when the weather was calling for ice and hazardous conditions and if you had an incident they would repromand you.
bad,Horrible place to work no time home and always standing by for the next job and not getting paid for it huge waste of time at your expense timefire don't care about you neither do the trainers all they care about is making money when you driving
bad,Worst company for a driver . Lying dispatchers no home time . Will work you to death and constantly micromanage you all the time. DON'T WORK FOR SWIFT EVER!!!!!!!
bad,Place is a real dump. Work there now wouldnt recommend it to anyone to work there not even part time or for a quick job. Management sucks. Lost my guaranteed quarterly pay raise. Losing people left and right. It was a waist of my time.
bad,There mentor training program is a joke..Very unprofessional.. And even dangerous..The Mentors even keep running even though the truck is unsafe for what ever reason..Just because there on a timed schedule..And they just keep rolling to make the all mighty dollar..Should be safety first..No matter what! Not very professional roll models for there students
bad,"Dont ever lease a truck from swift.  You will not make money. Do the math!  They have some of the worst freight to haul and rusty old trailers. The truck payments is over 2500$ a month. Swift restricted drivers from using thier lease equipment to work outside jobs.. Keep in mind, if swift dont have no work , they will not allow you to find no work. If that's not misclassification you tell me what it is."
bad,"I went to their academy and got my license with them, worked for about a month then went on to better places. I suggest PRIME inc. in Missouri if you are trying to get your cdl and get on with a company. PRIME is much shorter course and more hands on training, plus higher pay for new drivers. And there place they have to stay is way better, its like a private hotel, and they have way better freshly cooked meals."
bad,"there are plenty of companies outthere that are better suited for truck work."
bad,"Im a local driver over work for what we do. Pallet runs are thrown in the loop with traffic. Running all over the place. Given one day notice for mandatory ot."
bad,"Arrogant managers, forced dispatch. And a culture of do as i say or else. As long as you are willing to shut up and do as you are told than you are fine. Question anything and you get black listed and eventually fired. And trashed to any potential new employers."
bad,"id have to say Swift is a joke for CDL drivers to work for, they want you to drive there freight for them for almost free. good stepping stone to get your career started, but staying with swift for a career would be bad."
bad,"No pay at all, no miles , and need to always pay attention to your paycheck  cuz they always screwing up with your pay, I wouldn't recommend it to some one that has experience alredy."
bad,Avoid Greer SC!!!!! Almost died with a mentor driving!!!!! Avoid this company at all cost!!!! You WILL regret it!!!! All the mentors are alcoholic hood rats!!! Driver leaders DO NOT care about you or your family!!!!
bad,I registered for the benefit program family plan And I'm depending on swift to apply loads so I can make payments but freight has been low just to many drivers not enough work no practical miles which I'm losing money not making money period.This place isnt Owner Op friendly.. This company need to down size but it seem like the drivers are doing it themselves by quitting.
bad,"They are unorganized, and no communication skills what so ever.  They send you out in unsafe trucks. when you have an issue. e.g. truck fumes or Freon leaks that make you sick. The supervisors want you to go to the nearest hospital and another driver takes over your truck and route and abandons you at the hospital. you have to find your own way home.  They they wont pay for your hospital bill after the supervisor tells you that you need to get checked immediately or you can no longer work for the company."
bad,Was hired at one pay rate and had to take off for a few weeks because of medical reasons and while I was off I got informed that they were doing away with my pay rate and cut my pay by 15 cents per mile. Found out that they did this to everyone without notice. Their insurance is a joke. I paid 200 a week and not once did the insurance cover anything even after I meet my deductible
bad,What makes this job unpleasant is missing my children while I'm away earning scraps. I had to rethink why am I'm here helping this company make billions and I cant send money home to feed my family.  This is border line slavery.  Less than minimum wage take home pay.  This is FACTS!  I'll rather take my chances driving for Uber.  Impossible truly Impossible to provide for a family work here at swift.  Lease drivers owner op be at the terminal outraged about how low thier paychecks are. Every terminal I been to has a lot of empty company trucks and its getting worst.
bad,I made 500 a week while I was with my driver trainer. When I got my own truck ii averaged 173 a week. Boy they came up with some doozes. My last settlement I grossed 1495 for the week but my take home was 468 lol I lost my mind. Some weeks I wouldn't even get a check. Fair is fair I don't put no lies on nobody. If you need to get your cdl they will pay for it but you have to work a year so you Dont have to pay it back
bad,"Throw in the a towel! I'm surprised people still working for swift. Dont be a sucker for the false advertising. Jobs that advertise are the lowest paying jobs. I been struggling at swift since the merge with Knight. They chopped the dedicated rates and veterans drivers quit cause of it. Rookie drivers are forced to work those accounts for less but other companies created an opportunity to take some of thier contract action away and welcoming swift owner operators to join thier fleet with 3 times the rates offered , gotta love AMERICA."
bad,We are made to lie to new hires to get them in and when you call to find out what went wrong we stop picking out the phone. keep the voicemail full so you can not leave a message. I would not let my worst enemy work here
bad,Stuck in a truck to help the company make thier money. Its like having thanksgiving dinner the drivers sit next to the dogs on the floor waiting for crumbs to fall  from the table.
bad,After spending five weeks OTR I was allowed three days at home. They say one day off for every week I'm out which total to five days. They said I can spend those five days at home but I must return thier equipment before I go home or I can take the equipment home if I'm thier three days. I agreed the three days. After home time my next two paychecks were under two hundred dollars. It made me so upset. I reached out to my driver leader looking for answers. She explained that going home reduces my paycheck. I told her I was thier three days the same is if she dont work the weekends but her paycheck is the same with the luxury of going home everyday. She said this how trucking works I told her I understand but two hundred dollar paychecks makes no sense that's 50$ a day. I don't like working here anymore .
bad,When I started a year ago I thought oh my this is the most unorganized place I have ever worked for . I like my boss . Then things changed . I got new manager she didn’t like me from day one . A lot favoritisms. Some people never go to work nothing done.
bad,Terrible place to work the field foreman was a joke if you knew more than him he did everything in his power to get rid of you they gave you junk equipment to work with never had the parts you needed no one knew how to buck rivet a roof or side panel on so they used tar tape to repair the problem what a joke and they have the nerve to call themselves mechanics
bad,Swift will give anyone a chance to drive for them if you meet the basic requirements which is a good thing when you need a job but the pay might not fit your needs or lifestyle. You work 7 days by the miles and dont go home everyday. Factor in your state minimum wage times 40 hrs plus time in a half for 30 hrs. At 8.55 hrs plus 12 hrs = 700$ roughly.  Now look at the mileage pay. 2000 miles at 40cpm is 800$.  Rule of thumb before you decide to work here. Working at your nearest grocery store isnt so bad compared to a dangerous job that pays the same.
bad,"Thier isnt a fair wage for lease owner operators the fuel surcharge is 90% of your total income which is insane. "
bad,I once saw a squirrel on the side of the road and once on the side of a tree. I decided it was best to chase them both because i needed a minimum of fifty characters here to move on.
bad,"Poor pay, bad management, low miles and makes false promises. Bad dispatch, won't get you home when scheduled to be, poor equipment especially trailers."
bad,"Dont lease with this one here you will not succeed chances are you going into debt. I made more money as a company driver.   This company will depress you deeply into crashing thier equipment just for some relief.  The fuel surcharge is a JOKE!  The CPM is a BIGGER JOKE!  ZIPCODE TO ZIPCODE pay is the worst of it all. Thier isnt no money here dont come here stay"
bad,complete waste of my time going to work for such a horrible company hope it burns to the ground the driver managers dont know there head from a hole in the ground
bad,waiting for two long to get a load the lift me for 3 day watting for a load more the 3 times socks. In dispatch the now the you wetting for loads in the still make you wetting to punish you I never work for this company in my whole life.
bad,Pretty much any mega carrier is going to be a crapfest. If you expect otherwise you are only deluding yourself. We go to them to get into the industry and get some viable OTR experience before moving on to better things.
bad,"Go with another company. Worst experience of my life in a job. Was constantly harassed by office staff, had truck vandalized by other drivers, HR didn’t return my calls or voicemails. They only pay a percentage of total miles and are being sued for it. Office staff are rude and confrontational and make mistakes often. Was lied to over the phone by a staffer on the Walmart account, instead of checking the phone they put me on detention and instantly took her word despite me having seniority"
bad,It all about making money you don’t matter when you have family issues that you need to deal with they take miles from you as punishment when you return to work even if you give them two weeks notice
bad,"I've been there a week,  2 mentors working on third or a new place of employment.You can't get in contact with anyone in home office.The dispatchers are rude and inconsiderate at Brundidge,  Al terminal. The recruiter disappears after your hired. You try voice your concerns, no one can get back to you. Been calling 2 days to driver services,  no answer. Its just very messy and unorganized."
bad,"I was stranded in a city 1500 miles away from home and told my dispatcher I had to get back home for an emergency. I dropped my load on a Friday and couldn’t get another load out because everyone at dispatch went home for the weekend. I was frustrated with my dispatcher and we got into a verbal argument. I told them I was planning on parting ways. Instead of letting me drive to my home terminal with thousands of dollars worth of my stuff, they offered to buy me a bus ticket home for me but not my passenger who is my fiancé. We ended up taking a train home and I lost my tools and electronics and clothes. Do not drive for this company"
bad,"Swift is slipping hard. You dont matter to them. They can get a brand new mouth breathing steering wheel holder to fill your seat within a day of you leaving. If you think your experience and clean record will keep you safe, you got another thing coming. Your mental and physical health is not important to them, only the bottom line is important. God help you if your health affects the profits they could be making off you, you will be out in the cold fast. If you want to run 7 days per week nonstop for 25-35cpm, then by all means apply."
bad,"I actually can't think of one good thing when it came to working here. Expect to work long hours, for the worst pay on the market. Expect to be constantly put down by management and anyone that's not a driver themselves. The other drivers are also over worked, under paid, and are frankly as miserable as you are. The bathrooms & showers at ANY terminal are appalling, you'll feel like you're gonna get some kind of disease just looking in them. The work puts you in VERY dangerous predicaments with their on board navigation system being outdated and in poor working condition. Stick to an updated map or buy your own trucking gps. They will try and deceive you out of your home-time and even try to have you take loads while returning home. Did I mention the pay? When I say you will receive the worst pay on the market, for the most amount of work on the market, I mean it. Heed my words when I say, avoid working here at all costs."
bad,"I always wondered why Swift was the laughing stock in the trucking industry. Something told me to not even waste my time working here. Expect long hours with low pay here. Expect to make $400 on average at this company. The company I’m at now I make 6 times that Within a week. No truck driver should bring home a minimum of $1000 a week. Management sucks, they expect you to do favors for them , but when it comes to you needing a favor they don’t keep their word."
bad,"They micro manage so much it makes you sick!"
bad,Swift is ok. Got home through the week on the dedicated account I was on. Home every weekend. Poor leadership on that account is ultimately what pushed me away.
bad,As the title says put your time in and get out for the fact that they will jerk you around and leave you stranded in places and not get you loads when they are suppose to
bad,Not professional enough didn’t want to get me home when I needed to be home pay wasn’t good enough to gone grime my family you get three days off once a month to spend with your family this company wasn’t worth it AT ALL
bad,"All liars as follows:"
bad,"Dont bother working here if you aren't part of the mormon cult. Everyone is a weirdo who is literally part of the same family, all of management is weird beady eyed mormons who will backstab you the minute they get the chance."
bad,"Pay always short"
bad,"There a racist company and if you try pointing it out they try to fire you. They don't care about you at all. They acted like your going to make all this money but you don't. plus they try and make it I'm possible to to get hired on. They own there in insurance so they can hire and fire based on that alone."
bad,this job is good enough for a driver that is starting in the industry. As soon as you get 1 year of experience find a company that will treat you better and has better benefits.
bad,Did not like working OTR with swift I'm not sure if all big companies are like this one but swift is bad they took out a lot of money each check for the schooling! I would drive around 2200 to 3000 miles a week and my check was like 250 to 450 and i was on a exempt tax program..  Another thing was my trips were only 50 to 1000 miles long I never got any trips longer than a 1000 miles the whole 15 months I worked there.  And a lot of live loads!  And they only pay zip code to zip code!  And my manager Was always quick to get me off the phone never picked up  It just seems like they don't care about the driver at all you're a dime-a-dozen to them There's a reason why they accept everybody over there no standards because they treat their employees like GARBAGE.  Everybody I went to school with has left there was like 37 of us.
bad,NO time for family had to work long hour on salary manager never cared always held your job in front of you and never allowed for explanations or training in short
bad,I had to leave. Couldn't afford the health insurance. Benefits are a joke. I had to leave. No miles and now I have to write something just to get a reach characters.
bad,The trucking industry is not paying what it used to pay. If you want to stay broke then come on out hear. If you are married you will not be for long. These trucking company’s should be paying know less then $1500 a week but you will never see that at any trucking company it is all lies. When you hear some truck driver saying he’s making good money trusts me he dose not know what good money is and most likely he came from subway restaurant. Most drivers don’t say out hear but 6 to 12 months then they go back home and get the warehouse job that they should have taken first. You will spend your whole paycheck just to eat and live from pay check to paycheck you might as well do that with your wife at home so you can be there for your kids! You have been warned.
bad,"I realize it's mostly a training company so that probably has a lot to do with the low pay and low job security, there's a million drivers out there waiting to be hired."
bad,"As a newbie driver, did not receive proper training, assigned mentor was only interested in making miles (driving) getting truck repaired and preparing to leave the company"
bad,I worked at this miserable company for a year. The pay was so low that I couldn’t even afford health insurance. I don’t have kids and I’m not in any relationships. So I stayed out on the road for months at a time and still couldn’t squeeze enough money out of these people. THEY DONT HAVE THE MILES!!!!!
bad,"There is a lack of communication, as well as there are a lot of favoritism and discrimination they don’t seem to see about your needs until you threaten to quit or just walk away from their truck. "
bad,The freight has been awful not enough to go around. I'm spending countless hours in the truck without a load and I'm not getting paid while I'm away from home. I'm not getting per diem money I go days without food and a shower. The living conditions in this truck is mentally frustrating .This company dosent care about drivers. They cheating me out my money and the miles I drive.  I haven't been home in 4 weeks my total earns was 1300$. This is worst than McDonald's its less than minimum wage. Working for swift was a bad mistake. I left a  factory job earning 500$ a week.
bad,"Please look elsewhere for work, if you were in the same situation i was in when i worked at swift. Please try to make the best of a bad situation and move on after your one year is up."
bad,"If you are in the IT field stay away from Swift, it is the worst place I have ever worked in the last 20 years. The it department is run by people with no IT experience what so ever. The management believes in keeping there employees down and will not give raises to meet industry standards. You start out great but once you are in, Swift management will do everything to keep you down. Avoid Swift like it was the plague, this is not a good place to work."
bad,If you would like to be treated like a piece of meat this is the place for you. No one  cares about you. It's what you got in the box. Must get that load there. There is way to much BS here. The pay is low home time is low.
bad,"Not a good company to work for at any stage of your career.  Driver managers keep you out 3-5 weeks at a time, and if you find yourself in a bind, chances are you will not get assistance, or, if you do receive assistance, it will be hours before you can get the assistance, if they even answer the phone, which is not likely on weekends."
bad,"If you work here you are not making money "
bad,"Everything you have ever heard bad about swift is true and then some. I was there for over 8 months and it never got any better. My only pro is the terminal I was working out of was an old central trucking terminal and most of the staff stayed on when swift bought them out, great group of people. The problem was with swift."
bad,"I would recommend anyone starting out as a CDL driver, drive over the road for at least a year to get proper experience and then move on.  These companies actually expect that most drivers will do this and they actually build that expectation into their business model."
bad,"Good place to start your career but really bad if you're still here after a year. Swift is an example of a big company out of control. It taught me that OTR is not a job but a mindset and way of life. Trainers are surely, I was constantly threatened that he would throw me out if he wanted to. I always kept my wallet on me just in case he left me behind. I found that I sat at terminals more than I drove. I made no money at Swift because whatever I made got spent on food at truck stops. Basically it was modern day slavery."
bad,"management is terrible. the company is run by people who want to lower driver pay so they can increase management pay, but managers do near nothing. no one communicates. I turned a truck into the shop that just needed a head light replaced and 3 days later was assigned the truck and it hadn't moved or been repaired from when i turned it in previous. when I asked for a headlight so i could do it myself I was told they don't have one. Their OTR division is exponentially worse. Expect to never see your family and make very little money while they constantly blame customers for wasting all of your DOT hours."
bad,"12-14 hr day was normal"
bad,"The lazy management is clueless to trucker's work/life balance. They take off days and expect truckers to stand by and respond to their calls 24 hours/7 days a week but when truckers need their response at the critical time, they are never available. There is nepotism and cronyism among the management so no matter how underqualified they are and how many mistakes they make, they will continue to work for the company forever with poor management, lack of professional communication and lack of computer and high tech skills. "
bad,"The only thing positive about Swift is the equipment.  It is not worth it tho due to the size of the company and poor, poor, poor communication.  I could give example after example;  they are too numerous to mention.  Among the top mishaps by Swift would be not knowing if a trailer is empty or not when they dispatch you to pick up a broken trailer and bring in to repair (assumed empty otherwise it needs to be hauled to the location where the merchandise is to be delivered)  Another good one is sitting on dead time because there is a mistake on the trailer number of the empty to hook up to and then just saying ""just get one""  I already had one and lost two hours.  It is a pretty simple thing to do to just drop a loaded trailer and pick up any empty one.  They are all the same;  trailer number is of no consequence.  But know, repeatedly you have to sit around and wait to hours or more for them to locate you a proper empty to pick up that has been there for days and is about 100 feet away.  "
bad,I felt as if the dispatcher don't work with you like there suppose to.It's as if the driver has to figure it out on there on.But they did give me my start.
bad,Swift will take advantage of you and your job skills and will not fairly compensate you. They will make you promises based on achievement and not follow thru once those achievements are met. Management dictates the Company's direction and will chastise you when their expectations are not met. I would not recommend this company to anyone. They will limit your ability to take vacation time and will not compensate you for it.
bad,"If you want a good secure permanent job look elsewhere , what you will get is a headache from this guy ."
bad,Enough said up top this company is one of the worst trucking companies that there is out there. The biggest check I took home was 350 . What a joke this place is
bad,Recruiters lie to get you to accept job offer. They somehow don't pay you for your first day of orientation. They don't screen their trainers. Dispatch played favorites with their team members.
bad,"Swift, was there when I needed them. It’s a nice place to start your trucking career, it’s not very demanding or aggressive, you can take it at your own pace. The pay could be better, but most companies can pay more. I don’t really have to much bad to say about Swift. I’ll leave that for everyone else to do."
bad,The days were hot and sweet. I had to secure the school chassis and cords to take from one state to another. The management was good and we all worked as a team.
bad,DO NOT WORK FOR BIG COMPANIES SUCH AS SWIFT. They have the worst dispatchers / brokers the industry can find. Go elsewhere and places where you will be treated like a human. Not just a number.
bad,"I will never agree for anyone to go to swift as a job for hire, they have the worst trucks and swift favors the trainers whom lye about the clock in order to keep rookies on board to help hours in drive time."
bad,Terrible place to work for managers and planners are horrible at their jobs. I hated being there every single day I hated going into work to the point I would do anything not work.
bad,GET YOUR CDL WITH THEM AND LEAVE THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THERE DRIVERS everything is about money with them and some of the Dm DONT care about getting you home it will always be something
bad,"they changed my position to a temporary position without me knowing, when I heard of the gentleman coming back that was in my position because he was getting out of the military I was told by 3 different managers that I had nothing to worry about because they were not going to put him back in my position, my last inquiry was within 30 days of me being told my position had ended.  I accepted the full time position and moved 3 states away only to be thrown out, literally I was told my position had been eliminated and I was to leave, I knew no one else in Texas."
bad,Relatives and friends will get priority for promotions.  Tasks and responsibilities are constantly increasing with no additional compensation. Very little appreciation if any at all. Everyone including their Exec Vice President with 35 years of service
bad,Swift has its ups and downs got some good drivers and some bad horrible trucks most smell not properly taken care of if your lucky try to get a kenworth or a newer truck that hasn't been ran crazy
bad,"I didn't get home for more than 3 months,stuck sevral time no loads.Poor equipment,62 miles an hour. not paid for down timeor no dispatch. forced dispatch.NO HOME TIME"
bad,"Inconsistent on many levels within the company, as a driver with this company I felt very unappreciated. Management is very unprofessional, and there is a major lack in communication  with drivers and dl's."
bad,Swift is a terrible company to work for.  The show too much favaratisum to some drives. The driver managers and dispatchers treat drivers like garbage.
bad,I was a professional driver for this company and the dispatch and driver managers were less than helpful unless you were in CONSTANT contact with them.  The job provided less autonomy than advertised due to the need to keep on the dispatch and dm's to be able to get miles to get paid.
bad,"Swift is a $5B a year company that has been in business for 50+ years. It has grown significantly from humble beginnings."
bad,"A good job if your desperate to get into the transportation industry and no other company is willing to hire you! Overall... a terrible place to work, they care nothing for their employees safety or well being."
bad,the job is for a young person and not married or even a married person that can take his spose with him on his or her trips then you both can travel and see the world and work at same time
bad,"Swift Transportation, at the Brundidge, Alabama terminal,  doesn't wish to retain new employees or old employees either. They wish to feed their driver jobs with rotating drivers who come in and leave so they never pay full price or good money for a quality driver. Trucks are continually wrecked and or damaged. Current Terminal leader makes her own rules and fails to follow Swift Transportation policy as she makes her own rules up as she goes. Even other terminals local to this one pays better than Brundidge does and you work harder to earn your money. It's a place to get your foot in the door but not to stay."
bad,I wouldn't recommend swift to anyone. I had equipment that never worked properly. I never had miles. I had a team that would back us up. Unless you work in the office you're kind of out of luck.
bad,did not treat me fair when it came to the driving.yes they sent me to cdl school but never really gave me a chance to show and prove my self behind the wheel
bad,"always kept you on the road , even thou you wanted home time they just said one more delivery ,and the another and so fourth , so I got tired of it and left the company .for good ."
bad,"A load is dispatched and I has to drive to pick up the load. I learned how to fill out log books, I also learned how to be more focused on the road. The most enjoyable part was being able to see the country."
bad,Bad company to work for. They earnd bad reputation in the trucking industry. All that lying to drivers. I have tried to be the best but it didnt work .
bad,"I would not recommend to experienced drivers, this is a great place to start out. Good pay for beginners. Good benefits. Also will help you obtain your CDL"
bad,"Our experience with Swift in 6 months has been sadly horrendous..first off planners do not calculate your 10 hours in sleeper mode when they shove priority loads that do not carry any extra pay..Be prepared to get an $800 paycheck one week and a $400 the next because the paperwork you're sending through ingage is not handled properly and you're paying for lumper fees out of your check not as an owner but a Company driver.."
bad,Truck driving is already grueling but Swift never gets your pay right and the drivers will get upset if you complain about not getting paid as if they expect a driver to drive for free.
bad,"they did not pay me for a lot of ex runs that were put on me, they lied about dedicated run, and a lot of there customers of there's me like dirt, there trucks were dirty and smelled bad also"
bad,"I leased a truck with Swift, went through several dispatchers and accounts.  In the end all the time I ended up sitting instead of driving under a load cost me my home.  My lease with Swift cost me my home."
bad,Bad training.  Your driver trainer was more then likely a recent grad that took the roll of becoming a driver trainer to make more money they dont' stick you with a experienced driver.  Trainer is to busy sleeping and trying to get the load where it is to go instead of being upfront with you like they is suppose too.
bad,"worked for this company for a year, really miserable, told them i had to be at home for 2 days every 2 weeks for visitation with my children, they would strand me 4 states away and tell me ""this is your 2 days off"""
bad,"Over the past 9 year there have been two ""across the board pay increases"" for all drivers accept the account I am on. We get our half a cent longevity."
bad,"They promise you the moon and stars, but don't deliver. Guaranteed 2500 miles/week with pay advancement every 90 days. Never saw over 1100 miles/week. Was constantly sent into Canada and forgot about. After the 3 time spending 4 days stuck in Canada, I found another job."
bad,"I was willing to go the mile, but i felt no one had my back, willing to learn adapt and overcome but felt like i was just a number to them this made a lacking environment for me to further my career, limitations set to hinder the driver rather than help is not how to run a business."
bad,I always worked 70 hours a week and rarely made over $500.00. They regularly had me run off my hours and forced me to spend my 72 hr shut down in a parking lot somewhere on the east coast.They required me to stay on the road for 4 weeks and then come home for 3 days.
bad,the driver leaders don't listen to there drivers.
bad,"stressful, hurry up and wait atmosphere;  commonly was required to sit around and wait for uncoordinated individuals to arrange trips for the day depending on who they liked best.  Totally unethical business practices employed there."
bad,I will not work for them again. The pay is very low for the hours you put in. You can not get many miles and you sit a lot. I will not work for them again.
bad,"Poor work environment. Poor pay. Poor Management, Poor Support."
bad,This was by far the worst company I had ever worked for there are only two managers on the whole revenue services floor that actually know your day to day functions. I knew when my manager told me she was hired for moral support that I needed out! They don't pay you enough to do all the work while they just come to work for a check! Must be nice! When u bring it up to the higher up it gets pushed aside! They have their little clicks and if you don't fit in they treat you like your nothing! Managers go out to lunch for hours and come back with their feet/ nails done or hair done must be nice to have a home life on work time!  Must be nice! Lots of turn over!
bad,I went to orientation in edwardsville ks. Day 1 they did urine and hair folicle tests. Had to take dot physical but couldnt get back to mo to certify with dor. No word back on hair test so sent me home. Tuesday of next week said they didnt get enough hair. Back to ks i go to wait 3 more days still no word. Now in my 3rd wk and still no truck no word of test result. Nobody seems to know anything about it. Cost me 3 weeks of work/pay. Im done waiting on them moving on. The communication all around is terrible
bad,It's a good company to start off with if you love being over the road. You get good experience with driving cross country having to deal with different weather condition.
bad,"After disregarding all the negative reviews - even after all the bad publicity on the CEO - J.M.. (who, if the news is to be believed, should be taken out of his company in hand cuffs)  I thought I'd give Swift a go."
bad,Poor management treats drivers as numbers bounce drivers around from manager to manager hard for drivers to get ahold of managers to address problems good for new drivers
bad,Boo for these cut-throat individuals. Not ever caring if you see your family again. They say you stay out for maybe 2 weeks at a time but they really mean 2 months at a time or longer. Boooo!
bad,"It was fun to travel through the united states with my mother. I made a decent wage, but it's definitely just a start-up company to get your foot in the door."
bad,Little to no training in office just like with the drivers! As little effort from management was all that was given! They really pushed for you to figure it out !
bad,"No home time, no communication, no loads, no pay. I made more money driving with my mentor in one week than I made in two weeks driving solo. My Qualcom system was not linked to my home terminal for about two weeks, so anything I sent was not received by anyone. Swift will hire anyone with a CDL and a pulse. Avoid at all cost."
bad,This company is as cut throat as they come...They hate paying an experienced driver.  They would rather hire rookies that go out and cause accidents and then the company gets sued over and over.
bad,"The worst job I ever had, you had to work 12 hour shifts and didn't get paid for over time, only strait time due to the shop I worked at was considered rural status.  Drivers were violent and had guns pointed at me from the drivers."
bad,I didn't like that it was hard to get home time. You had no benefits. The pay was very poor. The communication was all done by a computer unless you got a chance to stop at one of the terminals.
bad,"stay away from this company, they will run the shoes off your feet and have your look the flintstones. training sucks and they try to keep out as long as possible before you can your truck. and if you do not drive team the will give you little miles a possible."
bad,I signed a contract to work for Swift when I got my CDL. Huge mistake! They lie about everything. The dispatchers are not helpful and will go out of their way to avoid you. Home time is pretty much nonexistent. I was out for three months with one day home! Avoid this place. You can do much better
bad,I stay on downtime too much my training sucks im figuring thing out as i go along they talk to drivers like children and they want you to go in a flood zone just to move freight. Im not understanding that part since its all about safety
bad,During my time with swift it was hectic & chaotic. My driver manger was very rude & surly. They also deposited my checks in someone else account & took another pay period to correct the problem.
bad,"Long distance driving, trainer never let me back up vehicle.  No sleep, no pay if job gets cancel from shipper and no work.  Sitting for 3 days spending money on food in another state with no work.  Paid per mile, can't say anything positive here, sorry."
bad,"Starter job good place to get your CDL but, after that your just a number. Pay is low you get little to no help from dispatch unless they need you to help get a load somewhere fast and on time, then they are done with you."
bad,Everything they said when I hired on was a complete lie. The load planners don't know how to run their fleet. its by far the worst company I've worked for
bad,"this job sucks, all the old timers make the money, no chance for advancement. and you have to find your own place to park your truck mostly leave your vehical in employee parking and take your big-rig home. which sucks"
bad,"HORRIBLE Company!!! They do not value their Employees at all. I was there almost 3 yrs in the IT dept and I left making the same amount I was hired for, which I took a pay cut to go there originally. No picnics, no parties, no holiday bonuses they give you nothing, but they will send emails out almost weekly for you to donate to their company charity!!!"
bad,"Oh My God, where to start, I did get all the hours but the management team is horrible. Never have I seen a company that is this big with a management team that cannot pull their heads out of their rear ends."
bad,not a good place to work. some days make money and other days might work 12plus hours and not make a penny. they do not care about there employees. will tell you to use non safe equpment and say its on you not them. if you don't do those things they will not pay you. overall a bad place to work. they want too see people live up there too make a pay check. nothing like what they say it will be like.
bad,They are great for beginners but for a serious driver looking to have a well-paid successful career then swift is NOT the right company. Swift pushes the cattle through.
bad,Worse company ever!!!!!!  No pay increases they literally have ever trick up their sleeve. To hinder your money making. Their drivers always rollover because of lack of training and being over worked and under paided
bad,Never get home time its very impersonal and they put me in a truck with bed bugs from the previous driver and i had to throw my clothes away and sit out in Ohio for 3 days without getting paid and no way to get around to get food or new clothes and and I Still haven't been reimbursed for my clothes
bad,I got out the army got divorced. Army put me out in a crazy manner and was give really no options. I had a general under honorable conditions. When I got out I got divorced had to stay with my mom for a few months also to visit. No public transportation in that small country town no jobs and did not want to go back into military life. Truck driving was just a boost to being independent again and decided it was not for me.
bad,This company over pays executives and under pays the people who pioneer the company. You are just a body filling space in the building. no employee value.
bad,The job requires the driver to stay away from home too long before allowed days off. the work to home time ratio does not favor any of the employees at all.
bad,Was a good place to get experience. The management sucks. Be prepared to get screwed over a lot. Get what you need and get out of there asap! Period point blank!
bad,terrible company they treat there drivers like numbers in a book. bad upkeep on there company trucks. terrible dispatching if you dont lock in a lode the can and will take it away from you
bad,They really trumped up my record and faked a bad record and bad daq to get out of paying for my school.  I would not work for them unless you use their school.  They training was very poor and silly and purposely destructive.  I think it was a set up to get out of paying 2000 for my school.  But they did set me up for my next job so that much i like.
bad,The whole time through turning it sucked when I got in my truck my turn her head and showed me a lot of things so I had to learn on my own my driver manager was a pain in the butt he was wanting me to run all the time when I was stuck at shippers and receivers for 10 plus hours it was the worst experience of my life
bad,"First truck driving job I've ever had. I was a over the road trucker, meaning that you rarely get home. I never made very much money at swift. It just seems to me if you sacrifice seeing your family and friends you should at a minimum be able to make a decent living not the case at swift."
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anybody because they don't pay good and they don""t back up their employees when push come to shove management is terrible"
bad,I learned a lot about trucking but mostly I learned what a company should not be . And swift is by far is the lowest for of carriers .Ypou are a number not a person
bad,"One of the biggest trucking companies out there with no freight.  They hire at least 100 drivers every week, so that's the main reason why there is no freight.  To many drivers. To many rookie drivers."
bad,"This was a septic work environment. The management sought to get rid of people rather then repair problems that they would bring forward. I enjoyed working with some of my co-workers, but overall this was a job for benefits and nothing else."
bad,"Owner op division needs improvments, to many fees like Qualcomm Rental,bobtail,  no toll reimbursement, 100% fuel cost with no discounts and a balloon payment 30% more then what the truck is worth. You working to make the lease payment!  You only can haul swift loads that's the loop hole"" where you can't make money with the truck you leasing"" that makes you a employee without the benefits. The government need to change some laws, or maybe swift owner op should join together with a protest on demands. Good luck you guys and girls be safe out thier."
bad,"In my opinion, there are better companies out there than Swift. The only thing that they do well is give a new driver a job. After getting 1-3 years experience, move on. Also, unless you can devote 100% of your time driving, do not lease."
bad,Work week long not paid hourly. How to safely drive a truck.Some management on the up and up. Last fleet leader a real piece of work more of a boss than a leader.Driving a truck in different states and seeing new areas you may not go to regularly.Long hours and time off. The customers you visit are the enjoyable part of the job..
bad,Dishonest work ethics about routes and being on the road for training. I was not pleased with the amount of time I spent away from home for training. Company wants you to be on the road for 6 months before getting a local route near home.
bad,"This place is horrible for a veteran. They didn't teach me anything about their macros or company day-to-day operations. In orientation, they were too busy telling me not to sleep with my coworkers. Really? They are men. I'm not interested. The recruiter lied to me and said all the trucks have refrigerators and inverters. None of them do unless you're an owner operator or willing to become one. They flew me from Atlanta to Minneapolis with a carry-on bag of stuff and told me they would route me to Atlanta to get the rest of my gear. They routed me to Seattle Washington. Then, after I kept telling them I needed to get to Atlanta, they kept sending me loads I had to refuse because they weren't going to Atlanta. I asked what some of the messages meant and other questions, and I couldn't even get answers. It may be okay if you're a rookie and looking to get your CDL, but please don't judge Trucking by what this place shows you. It is a bad example."
bad,"300$ A week thats what they pay me they needed me to be homeless so ill have to stay in the truck i quit after 2 weeks!!!"
bad,"Early Manditory Unloads Back to back,  Always a problem with Dispatch, Supervisors never have a clear explantion for any problems, and wasn't getting paid rightful amount for the jobs that was done"
bad,"The coworkers are really helpful , the only bad thing is that the supervisor talk bad to the employ and do not  help the worker to success . The supervisor of trailer shop go in the work time to buy food and takes a lot time ."
bad,They didn't treat there employees with respect. They made you feel like you were just another number. The pay wasn't good and you had to be away for four to six weeks at a time with two days off before going back on the road.
bad,"working weeks away was difficult for me. At first the new employee is assigned a mentor. Each mentor owns there own truck so each have a set of rules in how to operator their truck. As owners , their main goal is to get miles , more miles ran, the more money the mentor makes. The miles that the trainee is running under the mentor goes to him/her."
bad,Do not work here this place is an utter disaster and the management is all very culty. You will not advance you suck up to the crooked management.... just awful.
bad,"This review is 16 years removed from when I worked there. It was my first truck driving job and I wouldn't recommend anyone other than a trainee work there. Spend as little time with this company as you can. After your training and a few months in your own, find a job that pays better and has better home time."
bad,Can't get loads on weekends due to weekend planners not wanting to do their jobs it's also hard to get enough miles to make it worth being gone all the time take 4 day home time an loose a entire check. It's not just the Arizona terminal it's all some worse than others
bad,I was an OTR driver.  I have never been treated this bad before.  Many of these reviews are positive because they are planted by Swift.  That's the type of company it is.  Drove for 4 months with Swift.  Went from one outrage to another and didn't make any money.  That sums up my experience.
bad,The job it self was good you get to travel and see your country while getting paid for it but that's all truck driving careers. I personally had a horrible experience. The on the job training program was paid by the hr and not by the mileage like most. I worked over 72 hrs in one week and they refused to pay overtime.
bad,to many employees to count and not enough loads to go out so sat a lot in terminals and getting paid by the mile doesn't help your pay check when you don't have those wheels moving and manage ment wouldn't work with you and wouldn't honor the Soldier Sailor ACT when I came back from active duty so was worthless to pursue the career with Swift transportation
bad,"Swift isn't an honest company in any way, shape or form. They flat out lie to every driver who works for them. And, they treat their drivers like dirt. Do not ever consider leasing a truck through them either because it's even worse than being their company driver. ZERO stars!"
bad,"If you want to be lied to and make pennies. This is the job for you. Lost my house,my kids,my wife. All because I couldn't get home. And most the time I was just sitting in another state,not making money!"
bad,"If you have no other option but swift I feel bad for you. I was one of the unlucky ones where I was stuck with going with swift because of my criminal record. Let me tell you now,,, whatever you do... (((Do not))) lease a truck with this swift transportation!!!!!"
bad,I was there to begin work and I was not treated properly. Recruiters see it as a numbers game and do not care about you. The Orientation was rushed and you just go out not knowing anything. I was left in the dark and no mentor for days. I was given approx. 10 hours of training in 2 weeks and the down time I was suppose to get paid i got nothing but an empty wallet. Very poor communication and bad management.
bad,They train you to drive but then do not give you work so you sit a lot then you quit and find a job that will give you miles so you can pay your school loan and make money for your family
bad,"Swift is a horrible company to work for. I sat more than I ran in a year, they would make me sit all weekend to run two days to go on home time, home once every 3-5 weeks depending on if they felt like getting me in on time. Miles were low, no inverters, no pets, they expected you to sit in the middle of no where and have no entertainment."
bad,"the time allowed for deliveries was such that i had to drive 10-11 days and nights to get to my drop off on time . this was OTR travel , I resigned in April for a job that is regional travel in states in or around new mexico"
bad,Swift is the worst place to work except to get to learn how to drive the truck and this company is run by truck driver who don't understand nothing and think that they know what they are doing. The pay is the worst and you will not get the miles to make for it. You will spend 3-4 days a week without a load and away from home. So it doesn't worth to work here and instead work at warehouse because you won't make more money here.
bad,"they do not care about your home time request."
bad,I appreciate the opportunity to learn with the company.  I went over the the road for just 100 hours.  I was looking for more of a regional and dedicated route for I-95.
bad,i wouldn't work here again personal information giving to another driver and no freight to big of company with a lot of drivers but no freight for every driver and they don't treat you with respect
bad,Class A CDL Driving  for Swift Transportation is long hours for low pay while complying with Dept. of Tran. time regulations. It is very hard to comment on co-workers as you are with one another very little time. Management normally was a message on the company communication system or a phone call. Hardest part of the job was meeting schedule on-time safely. Most enjoyable part of the job was home-time with family.
bad,"Terrible communication, bad equipment, management is terrible and not supportive and the pay is not competitive. the benefits are not good."
bad,"Swift will keep you out even though you have requested home time, "
bad,"It took 4 different phone numbers and over 30 days time before I could contact my dispatcher directly. My truck broke down within 3 days of getting it, and 3 hours after getting it back from the Swift shop where it was ""repaired"". I was constantly given less than 200 mile loads, half of which required live unloading, which meant I wasn't getting paid (I was paid per mile). Aside from being squeezed for labor without pay, they constantly ignored my home time requests. I had to message my dispatcher a week out putting in said request, THEN I would wait for a load sending me home 5 days later only to be given a load going the opposite direction. I was given loads that would push me over my legal drive time, I was given loads that were impossible to make on time, and I was given loads that were under 50 miles. Overall I'm surprised I stayed with them for as long as I did."
bad,It was an overall horrible experience. I did get a lot of work and my dm was pretty cool guy and try fixing any matter asap. We got showers for every $50.00 gallons of fuel we pumped
bad,"Swift Transportation company advertises and markets a safe, helpful, always available demeanor for their employees. I have experienced nothing but unresponsiveness, unprofessional attitudes, unsafe work environments, as well as risky & unreliable promises to properly maintain the mechanical parts of the truck their employees drive. They do not provide compensation and reimbursement if THEIR TRUCKS break down. They expect you to go unpaid for that time being, as if the break down of the truck is your fault. They make promises in which they have absolutely no intention of keeping. Swift also reels in employees with the promise of having compensation and added benefits, none of which are provided. All you receive is just unprofessional negligence towards their employees."
bad,applied for the class a driver position and they had me driveing an box truck that was only an class b requirement. they also had people with an normal lience driveing an class b vechicle. and you had to have your own cell phone and if that broke and they had no way of getting ahold of you they would fire you.
bad,"This company did not keep one promise it made.  Example was break-down pay(they never pay),  another is there dispatchers were cheats & liars. I would never work for them again."
bad,"My experience with Swift's TDA school was great. They help  you all the way to get your CDL. Once I was hired, the experience as an employee was horrible. The mentors are rude and quick to kick you off their truck if you are not learning fast enough. They only care about ordering people around and money; not safety. The DMs are not knowledgeable in their position. My DM had to to put me on hold everytime I asked him a job related question. Very sad..Anyway, the pay is horrible during training, you get paid by the hour which is min. wage if youre not driving. Less pay than I had before I decided to do trucking. The driver development and driver services dept needs a complete overhaul because of the low customer service and incompitence of these people. DO NOT work for Swift if you have other options. Do your research.."
bad,I have nothing worth saying about this company and i would not recommend them to any one ever  sitting with no loads for days ata time
bad,"Management is the worst ever. No matter how hard you work or what you do, it's never enough. Management doesn't support you or appreciate you."
bad,Swift was unprofitable. Typical day was road manager not communicating sending me to wrong places for delivery. Gave only small paying loads. I liked driving the experience I recieved was enjoyable . The company overall was unorganized and were not team players and disrespectful.
bad,Overall this company has many drivers but the lack of attempt to manage them is noticeable. Each terminal has a different set of rules making it hard to know what to expect.
bad,This company cares nothing about its employees. They send you to wrong addresses and get mad when the load is late. They expect you to give them your soul and get mad when you don't smile about it.
bad,"not one promise made during hiring process is true"
bad,Will let you sit in the truck stops for a few days.  you have forced dispatches.  will try not to get you home when you want to go.  wont give you the miles they promised.
bad,Truck driving at its worst. You are told one thing and given numerous explanations as to why it was not true in the first place.
bad,"Poor cpm, poor management, poor level of respect for the drivers."
bad,dont drive for swift they dont give  care about there drivers
bad,"OTR truck driver. I learned I didn't want to work for this company. The Driver Managers were unorganized and if you did get a load, you could lose it in the middle and have to drop it somewhere. The hardest part would be the horrible pay due to unreliable loads not to mention the down time due to poor equipment."
bad,again they did not have a very good maintenance program but you did get paid buy the hour
bad,"It was a learning experience, I Don't Have anything else to say about this company"
bad,"Not a place for a 23 year old man. I was becoming miserable and hated my job. OTR 48 states truck driving is not for me but i appreciate the opportunity to at least try and find out. All in all, it just was'nt for me."
bad,"this company is good just for getting your cdl,great cast of trainer and fellow students,"
bad,"I joined this place with intension to get a refresher to get better knowledge of the new. I got on my truck with a mentor and learned all I needed in 1st couple days. Not sure why they kept me from home but I'm sure they get money from the government if the keep me for the whole 6 weeks of tortureThey he'd a mentor pick me up in another town and wanted me to take my test in another part of the country to give me a load back home. Well my own vehicle will be sitting in a town I don't live in. Also the $200-$300 a week is so worth it. I completed the hrs they pretty much forced me to do and talked my mentor into driving me to the airport in his home town. Now no money for them from the gov. Lesson learned. Unless you are homeless and don't like having money, the you really should work for swift."
bad,not recommended. not a good company. nothing else needs to be said other than I miss my driver manager
bad,"Management there all drinking buddies, and if your not part of the click your just screwed as a driver, false hopes and promises, days and days of layovers, if you lease a truck you wont get enough loads to pay, you're always broke, and they never work with you, pay sucks, over worked and under paid here, and you get paid what you're owed if you're lucky. Just do you're time to get the experience and get something else asap."
bad,"Good for student drivers. Trucks are slow enough. Company does not care about there drivers. Home time is an almost impossibility. You see and hear of how other companies say their drivers are their most important asset. It's just the opposite with Swift. ""Customer comes first"" is their standing.  And you are just a number, Truck or employee number.  Pay increases are a joke. A half of cent every six months."
bad,"Nothing but a bunch of liars, cheats & theives.  Swift would throw you under the bus rather than stand by their drivers on anything."
bad,"Company has poor managements   "
bad,The company was a large fleet and turnover was an issue. I even was bumped in the company lot by a student in another truck doing an inspection on my truck
bad,"I obtained my CDL through Swift Transportation, and after a poor and highly unprofessional experience with three separate mentors, I left the company to go to another major carrier. Fast forward to 2014. I decided to ride along as a passenger for a while to help my husband-a brand new driver with no experience-out during his first winter, and what I saw him go through with Swift was deplorable! They never kept their word about getting him home when he was supposed to be, not even close as in within a few days of his request. He got NO pay between December and when they terminated him four months later. Yes he took a weekly advance, but he was running, and should have been seeing a check! I was right there with him, I saw how poorly they treated him, and when I helped him, rather than him having to wait four hours for on-road, the Lathrop terminal raised nine kinds of hell. If you drive for Swift, avoid the terminal in Lathrop, CA like the plague! Two words. WITCH HUNT! Lathrop has a BAD reputation, and doesn't care if your food spoils if you have an ice based cooler. Have an iceless cooler or a propane stove? Don't let Swift find out. The guys in the shop will tell you to trash it, or clean out your truck. This company does NOT care if you starve. Their attitude is it's not their problem. They expect you to live on fast food, truckstop food, and to afford all this on $.28 cpm or less. It's insane, and if you work for Swift at all, I suggest getting your two years, and leaving."
bad,"under paid over worked"
bad,"They will send you with a driver first, and than you wont make a dime, untill you become a driver for them 3 months of this, not worth it"
bad,"worst job i ever had,u were forced to take loads u could.nt make on time made to violate dot hours of service and harassed by dispathers the pay was lower then minimum wage but i did like being on the road."
bad,"I loved wrking driving a truck,, had to come off the rd with a baby"
bad,"In the handbook, that you sign saying that you've read it before they ever give it to you, your schedule can change without notice by a supervisor or higher. Raises are pennies ever two to three years. If you do a good job you are told to get back to work. If you fall short of the service manger's projected goals then you are threatened with your job."
bad,"I have never given all 1 star reviews for a company I worked for. "
bad,Cant think of one good thing to say about this place.  They are only good for one thing. To get the experience you need to step up in the trucking industry.
bad,This is the worst company I have ever worked for. They have no respect for the drivers. No driver support. My driver manager quit 2 weeks after I started and they never got me a new one. Know body knows what they are doing in this company. They try to force you to do short runs all week so you only make $200.00 a week. If you turn they down they will play games with you and treat you like you are stupid. I couldn't wait to leave this company after 6 months. The planners if you can call them that are ridicules. They will send you a load with all the wrong information so it takes forever to complete. They lie and con you to keep you from making money. When you get to a Swift terminal all you hear from other drivers is complaining about not making money and how Swift wastes your time. Don't trust this company. Avoid like the plague. If your homeless and want to make no money but have a place to live they have a truck for you.
bad,Never work for them again they show to much favoritism toward drivers.
bad,Don't do it. Human combine. This company sucks. The worst company in Michigan.
bad,not very good to here drivers not very good to here drivers not very good to here driversnot very good to here drivers
bad,Was promised a regional job by recruitment. After orientation was told I had to be OTR.  Bad company
bad,"I worked for swift for over a year out of salt lake city and then albuqurque. I was in fear of losing my job from day one. I did not get on board with their rip off lease progrom. So after a 100,000 safe miles they let me go over the phone. They go through well over 68% of their workforce every year. They get $50,000 for every new student they hire. So basically the company has rookies driving for them. No wonder Swift has a bad name at truck stops and over the CB radio. I was always belittled at truck stops for working for such a crooked company."
bad,worst choice I've ever made as a Professional Truck Driver! I failed to do research on this company before joining them. Everything good this company says is the complete opposite! All Truckers do not work for this company! Currently looking to drive for another company before i put in two week notice.
bad,you are on call EVERY DAY!
bad,This was the WORST company I have ever worked for in They lied to us when they took over the account at J. C. PENNEY. We were told we would not see any changes yet my pay went down $200+ a week! In a months time nearly all of the 50 drivers that had worked for BRIGHT were gone!
bad,If you have no family life and like living out of a truck. This is the job for you.
bad,"We have gone years without raises. We were told today that a bonus that was promised to us wasn't going to happen. Your opinion as an employee means nothing, respect comes from the bottom up and not from the top down, your schedule will change when ever the service manager wants it to, and raises are in pennies. I have been with the company for eight years, my pay has changed by $1.00 an hour. Not a comfortable place to work, not friendly at all, and advancement is a joke."
bad,"No Miles, Horrible pay and No questions answered on QUAILCOMM"
bad,there is nothing good to say
bad,They make you promises they don't keep. Very stressful. I would not recommend this place to some I dislike .
bad,"With Swift all the drivers are just a number , I walked in to our office and talked in person to my driver manager and he did not know who I was."
bad,This company promises you everything delivers on none and my opinon anyone writes a good review on this company couldnt have been a driver ive been with them for a year an been nothing but drama thats y im leaviing soon as my school paid off
bad,will lie to you you only get $450.00 a week for 7 days a week then after 250 hours you get $500.00 a week for 7 days a week then once your out on your own its .27 a mile out 14 days home 2 days and home two days does not mean your home means where ever your at you dont have to drive for 2 days
bad,Typical day was driving and delivering cross the US. I learned the highway pretty good. Hardest part was getting lost. Most enjoyable part was traveling.
bad,"N/a- no good, would not send any drivers there way, they dont care about their drivers or their families"
bad,work for swift i learned a lot i got experience otr but working for that company was very stressful the money is not worth the stress and employers need to think and care about the people that work for them. We are human beings not numbers
bad,no review available unable its a hook and lure for very little pay
bad,drive down the road how to keep good log management was ok did ot have co workers getting sleep enjoyable part of the job was see the us
bad,With all of the new policies in place swift transportation is not a great place to work. You will not get the miles needed to succeed with this company and you will go broke. Do not lease a truck through swift buy from the outside and you will have a better chance to succeed in the OTR business.
bad,risk anaylisis system is very very wrong it prevents people from furthering their carreers
bad,Stay away from this company. They will and have slandered drivers.
bad,Swift thinks they are too big to fail and in turn thats why they have such a high turn over rate of employee. They just do not care about you or your well being just the bottom dollar...i cant even take more then three day of home time with out having to clean my truck out and turn it in no matter if you been on the road 12 days or a month
bad,"To sum it up, the pay sucks and they do not care about the employees..your just another number . do not get hurt on the job.. They do not want to pay they would rather fire you.. . They have a charity for the drivers, money comes out your check as a safety net if you get hurt and need assistance  so they dont have to pay you."
bad,"The company truly doesn't care about you. They will undertrain you, overwork you and drop you if you don't meet their deadlines. I can't say it enough they don't care your just another trucker who can be replaced easily you hold no value. They just need someone to drive their slow trucks and sign up for their lease plans."
bad,Management is only out to make a name in the company  for there selves does not matter what employees they step on and miss treat expected to make repairs in ridiculous art times
bad,"I was skating on thin ice a break down away from not being able to cover truck repairs.I found another job in a nich of time.  The lease driver cant survive its over. I can see if swift was helping them but nah. No safety bonus no type of maintenance assistance to compensate for the lack of freight. No compassion or pride from the richest trucking company ever. So medieval , scrooge company not a desirable place to work extremely toxic."
bad,Couldn't make truck repairs and weekly truck payment. I went a month without earning a paycheck. Wasn't getting enough miles or 100% of the fuel surcharge. If you looking to lease a truck through this company it will be a mistake Knight Transportation made sure of that.
bad,"Terrible management at this company and no chance of moving up or even having a decent job unless they are willing to be the bosses pet. "
bad,"Worked the container fleet, terminal manager said I was doing a great job and gave me $1.50 per hr raise. Next day safety department fired me. Said I had multiple drive cam “events”, I did San Diego to Long Beach run every day. Always in heavy traffic, safety said I followed too close. They want 9 seconds space between me and vehicle in front, have you ever driven in LA?, impossible!"
bad,"Stay away from this company. You have been warned! Working for big corporation type companies is ok in the beginning, but becomes a problem later on. They have cameras in there trucks and if cars cut you off and they bridge that 4-second gap, you will get dinged points for not pushing on the breaks. So in essence to that, if you’re driving in CA with all the idiots drivers, expect to tire your legs out by breaking literally every 5 to 8 seconds! GOOD LUCK if you go, you will need it!"
bad,"live in your truck. eating cheap truck stop food. in your jail cell on wheels."
bad,Its time to move on to better I grew out of this company.  The students I've trained earn higher wages then I.  some of them on costco account I tried to get on that account but was denied. I notice how swift cater to young white men by putting all of them on dedicated accounts and sending the rest OTR to make scraps. favoritism and racism is real here at swift.
bad,I you like drive cams snitching on you constantly and being harrased over your onboard computer and cellphone regarding the drive cams findings.. then this is the place for you. Micromanaged and harassed til i quit..
bad,This company does a lot of shady things from messing up your pay ...to planning ghost loads on you so you move the truck and not get detention...they are nice to you over the course of your first year when you know nothing of how trucking works after that they do things like harrass you about drive cams and drop your miles in an atempt to get you to quit....they also expect you to work for free.
bad,Management is awful  if your not in the in crowd. Worked there hating my job every day as supervisor  told me I didn't meet her expectations than why did you hire me. I was only there 3 months was never so happy to turn my badge in. Best in class funny slogan f li r them as always see ads looking for AR help.
bad,"My paycheck was rarely correct, nasty co-workers, driver respect was nonexistent. The driving school is a ripoff, had to retake my pre-trip and road exam at the local DMV 5 years after I had left the company due to examiner taking bribes. Only plus side is they don’t ask a lot of you but for that pay, what do they expect?"
bad,I been driving trucks for 28 years with 2.8 million miles. I retired from a oil company. I didnt come to swift for the money it was to travel long hauls only. Well it didnt workout that way. Swift had me sitting for 72 hours waiting for a load. I'm running 2 loads per week under 700 miles total. This is the 2nd quarter when freight suppose to increase but its at 1st quarter levels. I feel sorry for those who need the money. The shareholders is bleeding this company dry even when thiers no freight. Shaving miles is making share holders happy. For those who looking to join swift or other companies 1st thing you do find out who thier shareholders are see how they treat thier employees at thier companies. Good luck.
bad,"I was promised a lot of things, good milage and a good work/life balance. I have not received either. Freight is slow and miles as well. I am rarely routed home without asking to be and even then it take days or even weeks to be routed home. I am very unhappy with the company."
bad,Swift is honestly a bad company. You will be Otr 3 weeks at a time and barely making 600 a week. Some of the driver leaders are bad at communicating as well. The only Pro about this company is traveling different areas.
bad,Terrible play still work they ripped off every check I had taken approximately 45% of every check also did not give me the sign on bonus they put both checks together and tax them extremely high planners could not get loads correct most loads I was sent weren't even put together right I always had to call find out what I was supposed to do because made no sense sometimes I would not even get home the same week I wanted to get home time then when I did get home time most times I was a day and a half late on getting home
bad,Don't even bother with Swift Transportation. I worked there for almost four years. They would hire people right off the street and start them off at two to three dollars more than I was making. The shop was so disorganized. Everyone just runs around doing whatever they want. Only a select few actually work. Management doesn't care about anything that goes on as long as it doesn't involve them. You work lots of over time 50 plus hours a week. They don't pay time and a half. You are routinely put down and insulted by management. Nothing is ever good enough. You also get to work weekends and holidays.
bad,Even though drivers are supposed to pretrip the truck and trailer if there was ever an issue that resulted in a roadcall for the equipment the company will always find the mechanic at fault regardless of the time period that the equipment was serviced. The company never updates the shop equipment and they expect the mechanics to fix the company equipment to keep it in usable condition.
bad,"This is a huge company that is in the trucking business to make money; and for this company It's all about the money. Drivers receive shady health benefits that doesn't really cover anything at all and they get very little pay and time off. Your off time isn't paid and neither is any short vacation time that you might have planned for yourself. If all you are looking for is to gain some experience behind the wheel, then at least you're going to get that much. This was one of the worse companies that I have ever worked for."
bad,"Working for swift was by far one of the worst decisions I've made in my life. I've ran OTR, local, and regional for them. you won't make any money OTR so lets just get that out of the way now. you only make money when moving a loaded trailer and they have had me fix so many trailers for them so i hardly had money to eat and pay bills. my checks over the road were about 500- if lucky 600. I got a local job with them that was better on average making 800-900 a week but thats like a full 70 hours a week. they do not care about your sleep, your sleep schedule has to change on a dime for them. they expect you to make impossible times as if they don't know what traffic and construction is. they will work you to the bone on days they can or make you sit for hours. the longest I've sat for them was about 30 hours and that wasn't for my 34 reset. i left the god awful company and they continue to screw me over even after the fact by putting on my DAC report that they fired me when I gave them a 2 week notice that I was leaving. the driver is blamed for everything in this company and when you need help fast you should be ready to sit on hold for at least 2 hours. the company is a joke and the only thing that is holding them afloat is underpaid drivers, people owing them money for schooling, and they will literally hire anyone."
bad,Managers & employees plot to get people fired. Since the merger it became a terrible place to work.  Seems they termed all the higher paid employees & kept the lower paid.  Big mistake in some cases.  They don’t care about their employees neither driver or office. All they want to do is cut costs.
bad,"no work,,no respect,, nothing free except stress,equipment was bad and didnot perform, no enough training, pay grade was very low, truck payments were high"
bad,"Horrible supervisors. Trailer shop manager was fair and nice. Horrible advancement procedures, example: tests were given every three months to advance to the next M level with no material for study and the supervisors not caring your advancement. Hours are constantly changing probably due to management thinking their plan is better than their predecessors, also due to the company no longer being owned by Swift. Pay is unfair, example: the same, if not less, education would be hired on making $2.00 more per hour than myself or other skilled technicians with 100% more experience and knowledge."
bad,Leaving now cause I was promised that when I baby came I’d only have to work a certain amount a week and when it came time to they said they can’t allow it. They also haven’t paid me my full pay in 3 months.
bad,Drove in the snow and heat. Delivered loads to different stores. I had a Class A license. It is a hard life to live. I like to go home at the end of every day. This job was not for me.
bad,I was not treated well. They rarely told me the truth and would not explain why they do what they do. Bad place to work. Very Controlling and deceitful.
bad,When hired they were not where they should be in training their new employees for success. Pretty much just throw you into it to either sink or swim. They don't seem to care for their employees.
bad,"Management is horrible, to start off with. They don't care about their drivers, don't answer calls like they should, don't do their job correctly which messes up the lives of their drivers. It's a horrible company to work for. You are on the road 3 weeks or more at a time and the driver managers always find a way to screw up your home time. Have a family? Good luck ever seeing them with this company. Need to speak to your driver manager or with someone higher up in the company? GOOD LUCK. I recommend staying far away from this company, because in their eyes their drivers are worth less then dirt."
bad,Its a place to get your cdl and put in your time.  Once you have enough time you need to find another company to work for.  Lack of leadership and planning made it very difficult to get my job done with out having to run over on my hours. Do not recommend a long term career at this company
bad,The trainers were awful  they have no time to teach u or do there job that is sl I have to say!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't really have too much more to say in this review you should not trying students with drivers that lease trucks
bad,"Swift did exactly what they said they would.  They trained me to drive, got me licensed, trained me to be a driver through use of a mentor, gave timely raises based on number of miles driven and got me home when I needed to be.  Very good company."
bad,If you love your sanity stay away. You are over worked and under paid. It's a fight every week to get a check from payroll you'll never see detention breakdown or layover pay so don't buy into that hype. The bonuses they offer each quarter vary from division so don't expect good bonuses. They will leave you stranded days on end then ask for a favor and then not pay you for it. I would never suggest to anyone to start here no matter how good it looks on paper. Find another company make less money and be happier when you start off or you'll be out of the truck in a year and never want to return.
bad,"Unorganized, poorly managed with poor trainers. Safety seemed to be no issue. Received little training from trainers who seemed to only want to sleep in the sleeper bunk."
bad,"Favoritism is a huge part of Swift Transportation along with family ties.  If you do not fit in, you get pushed to the side.  The company fails when it comes to training employees for success.  A lot of mouth service on what they do but nothing to back it up."
bad,Swift did not like to pay for work experience. I began to understand that Swift does not want its drivers to think for themselves. Only the drivers given raises where drivers who were completely dependent on driver leaders on how to think.
bad,"This company stopped caring about its employees 10 years ago,  too much political stuff and not enough family oriented! Not a good place to work 10 years behind in compensation also."
bad,"The tires are defective and have inherent flaws that cannot be detected in a pre-trip.  Do not be surprised if a steer tire explodes while driving."
bad,If you need a starter company it's ok just don't plan on being home much if you want a pay check you have to stay out at least 1 month at a time then when you do go home they want you back out after 2 days off. Company trucks have a camera on you all day and night. DM' a are ok at times not a good company to make a career at
bad,"I didnt like management. They treat you like a number, and not a person. I worked  very hard, thinking that I would advance in the company. But i found that it didnt pay off. I met alot of lifelong friends at the company. But I feel they are very stengy as far as paying there drivers. I was crosstrained in many different divisions. Which was a awesome expericence. Management is poor and lack social skills. Very unorganized, and impersonal."
bad,Unrealistic expectations and unrealistic repair time. Wants you to never be able to make Dr appointments or spend more than one day with your family. Dm's don't pay attention to detail with trucks still in the shop
bad,to much time away from home. No loads going to you home town. too much down time. too low pay scale. terminals are very dirty no place to shower or wash clothes
bad,"Dispatch has no training or experience in trucking so they have no idea what the job really is. the company constantly tries to jip you on your pay. there is no chance to move up, they constantly lie to you. they do not honor any of their promises that they make to their drivers. they have no respect for their employees, they are constantly blaming their drivers for dispatches mistakes and they only pay zip code to zip code. after working and then resigning to work for a better company they promised that they wouldgive me a good recommendation for another job and refused when i found a job i wanted. My best advice; NEVER work for this deceiving company."
bad,Do Not recommend it that company. their school doesn't teach you anything. you only get about 5 hours behind the wheel of training. pretty much you buy you license and send you on the road. your a joke to the industry
bad,I Believe My Review Of Swift Transportation Was An Awesome Experience Being That My Over - The - Road Experience Was Safely Completed. My Instructor Was Very Supportive And Mentally Coached Me Through The Complete Process.
bad,"Unorganized, management is horrible with no structure what-so-ever, therefore there's no structure with the employees. This is a very large establishment, strict rules need to be implimented. If it starts with management it will trinkle down to the enmployees and things would run smoother and there wouldn't be such a high turn over in a lot of departments."
bad,"As a beginner they will treat you as such. I can totally see why they have such a low driver retention rate. Management and dispatch treat you like a number and nothing else. You can be stuck in Salt Lake city , Utah making no money and everyone passes the buck in the office. Service department does nothing to the trucks that are requested by the driver. Even if it is a safety hazard. Our truck needed an alignment bad and they never did anything about it."
bad,"I recieved my CDL-A from this company, who have their own DMV in Millington, TN, which should have been a red flag, company was under investigation for massively hiring illegal immigrants when I left."
bad,"By far the worst work experience I ever had.  I worked in HR and the other HR leaders are nothing but unethical dishonest bullies.  Don’t buy into the dynamic culture and great leaders that they try to sell you on, it doesn’t exist. People from the outside coming into this department quickly learn that they mean nothing.   The existing team can’t handle someone new who actually knows how to do their job.  I was lied about, accused of all kinds of things, excluded, and bullied all within 30 days of working there. And, the person who heads up the HR department stands behind them.  Her only concern is their security and happiness of her girls.  It is an unhealthy and miserable environment to be in.  "
bad,"truck driver factory.learned how too drive in snow storms, waiting for days for loads, I felt like I was not important because they have so many drivers"
bad,"This is a company that favors its o/o's to the company driver. miles are never there. I was otr and found myself running what would be considered local routes in new jersey. i live in new orleans, la. many days laid up waiting on a preplan. checks never got over 300.00 a week. nowhere near enough to support my truck and my household at home. There are many companies out there that can treat there employees better. try them first is what i recommend."
bad,i didnt like the company at all it was ran horribly and dispatchers didnt want to do anything alot of promises were made and broken
bad,"a typical day at work driving 11 hours a day dealing with traffic jams, border crossings, DOT/MOT, snow, ice, time crunches,and management telling you to drive even know your out of time on your log books and then when you cant make it they write you up and hold that over your head aswell and if that is not stressfull enuff they start a point system and put cencors all over your truck and if you spin the tires even on ice and not get in to a accident 2 of them a year your put on probation, or if your going down hill with 80K pounds and your truck goes over 70mph two times in a year your fired, not to mention that the truck is govered to 60mph and thats dangerous all by its self, if you slide in the winter time and start to jacknife the only way out of it is to speed up and if your already going 60mph you can't do that. also your a moving target on the road at 60mph going thew states that have 70,75mph and your stuck doing 60mph and your paid by the mile going thew the faster states loosing money, and then after 2 and a half years of service with no accidents and no tickets and no dot violations you get pulled over in a differant country and charged with a bogus charge,they fire you on the spot, and eventually when they thrown out of cort, you find that the company you gave 2 years of your life to, hit your DAK report with falty information so that no one will hire you to drive again untill you jump thew more hoops to get that cleared up so yes thats why they have a 98% turn over on drivers that come in to get enuff experiance and find a better company to work for as soon as"
bad,"Every one has to pay some dues, usually, when starting a new career. Ronald Reagan deregulated the transportation industry and its been chaotic cheap labor ever since. Now the door is wide open to hire illegals, low wage workers, etc. with no recourse because of this economy and lack of jobs. Swift knowing this takes full advantage of every thing. Very little is left for any driver or their family to merely cope trying to live life. Don't drive a truck and don't drive for Swift unless you have no choice. Just don't do it."
bad,As a manger I was constantly CYA. Full of backstabbers and con artist. Turnover rate for drivers is always in the high 90's or even 100%. I worked in the training dept and management. You have to go along to get along. Do not sacrafice your principles. Vice president of recruiting is charged with r.a.p.e. over a three day period and Swift HR knew of this. Just Google and you will see what I mean. There is class action lawsuit against Swift for cheating their drivers out of miles. I am not bitter but I cannot hold my tongue any more. Check out anything I have said on the internet. Bad Company!!!!
bad,"They do not care about their drivers or lease operators. A simple oil change will have your truck out of service for 2 days if you have it done at a company shop. Any other repair will take 4 to 10 days. It took a company shop 5 days to replace a starter. I had a load planner state that all drivers should be required to stay in their trucks even for their 34 hour reset and were close to home. A terminal manager stated as I was talking to him about several office staff problems that caused my loads to be late, ""Even when the office staff makes a mistake, it is still the driver's fault."" The last year I was there, I was away from home more, and got 50,000 miles less than the year before.  I was told by a payroll clerk that I should quit being difficult for trying to get reimbursed for receipts she said they have received but were not going to process. The only thing the office personal, managers, and executives care about is getting their bonuses."
bad,New management is  only out to make a name for there self do not care about the employees that they treat bad along the way to the top the trainers tell tech to change this change that if that doesn't work  do not know
bad,Corporate culture has changed to hostility to drivers.  The driver managers lie to your face and try to coerce you into driving in unsafe conditions.  Your pay is cut.
bad,Not a good company for longevity not truthful concerning money real cheap on mileage pay forced dispatch and the Pottsville location is ran like a dictatorship and when you don’t do the run they give you they withhold better run from you
bad,1820 miles for the seven days of work paid 289$ . Couldn't help but to give up on trucking all together. It's a shady business. I'll find work elsewhere
bad,Not a very organized company excepts you to drop everything when you get through onto a load that they need help with just not very happy with the company not happy with the pay
bad,Trying to earn a minimum of a thousand dollars a week take home isn't going to happen. Definitely the wrong company if you have high expectations. Wonder why drivers quit all the time is Because thier under paid and sick of being mistreated.
bad,"This company is very unorganized, and seem to thrive on messiness and disfunction. They lie about everything. Once you get in the truck and out in no man's land that's when you find out how Swift dispatch, driver leaders will treat you.  Many of days I called my terminal day or night and got no answer. They are only concerned about the load and their truck. I don't know how they stey in business, they are not a safe company to work for. I felt that my license was in danger working for them. The places they sent me to pick up loads literally made my stomach sick  and gave me a migraine headache trying to get down the streets to get the load"
bad,"My short time as a trucker driver is over the training was intense while the truckers pay doesn't equal the work load when thiers non trucking jobs that pays much better. I wouldn't recommend nobody to do this job it's not worth it. Your life is worth more than 300$ paycheck to haul freight , extremely low paying job."
bad,"my experiance is not what i expected. on the clock for 14 hours per day awake longer. breaks were at DOT madatory intervals, so bathroom breaks were far and few between.  peoples lives were lived over the phone and it sounded like everyone was haveing problems. the culture was dog eat dog, its all about me. i had a very bad experiance and it cost me plenty. on the open road it was some what enjoyable. i did get to go to some places that i normally would not have gone."
bad,7 days a week drove 2100 total miles ended with a 325$ paycheck that's 46 bucks a day. I didnt tell them I quit they should've expected it. The company housekeepers make more than drivers cleaning restrooms empty trash cans. I was making 325$ part time in high school working at burger king. Swift is a joke! Fake advertisements cant make 60k a year making 325$  week working 7 days .
bad,Trucking companies like swift you really need to avoid by all cost. I should've did better research. A stock market company is not designed for drivers to make money. Lease drivers is a profitable asset for any company because the lease driver covers all exspense while swift covers absolutely nothing but taking majority of the revenues 89%  plenty of better companies with high moral standards that knows the difference between animals and humans.
bad,"Terminal leader Misused personnel to cover his constant absence, while using others to complete his tasks, and not allowing adequate time for them to complete their own tasks. Misused the time clock with some personnel to make up for his ignorance to pay some more than others. Made promises that were not even possible to keep."
bad,"Last resort for homeless to have shelter from the rain and make no wages.  Both trainers I had have turned in their trucks, because they could not pay the leases. Leases are a money trap to make Swift even more money."
bad,Swift use drive came to get rid of you not to train or help you !!!!!!!!!! no job security !! trainers are in it for money not to help you !!! Driver managers are good.
bad,"I upgraded from mentor truck into a company truck. Didnt make money like advertisement promotes. I been working at temp services before I joined trucking I'm not sure why my paychecks r less in trucking and more at temp service. Its like I'm working backwards no disrespect to this company but I cant do this anymore."
bad,In the first twelve months I loved working for swift. I promoted the company and spoke very highly of the company. I heard all the bad things that I thought were just rumors. Come to find out they are not rumors. Swift does not promote people of color nor does the pay reflect any fairness
bad,"This company take a 16 + employee and set goals that are not obtainable while the company is struggling as whole. This company does not care about anyone or change as the industry changes. They just want a number and exspect that you can control other grown people. Im not responsible for a grown adult, but they held me accountable just to put anyone in a truck."
bad,"Don’t believe a word they tell you, management should be management, it is like the good ol boys club, all comes down to who you know and if your a certain  religion from Utah. They change the culture to their liking and not to company policies."
bad,Overall bad place to work you run all these miles and yet have no money to show for it. Management  suck if you need to get ahold of anyone  it takes the act of god to get them on the phone
bad,"Want a job to rule your life? Work at Swift. Only want to work one person's job? Go somewhere else. Pay is good, but demands are too high. I wish I had found other work then what I was exposed to while I worked there."
bad,"This was a great place to work before the merger with Knight transportation and Knights entire leadership team coming over to run Swift. You use to be treated and felt like family. Valued and cared for, Now its a corporate grinding machine. It does not matter what you've done for the company in the past. Hit their decided upon numbers or see ya later,is the attitude now. No love of the people involved."
bad,"This is thee worst trucking company in the industry. SWIFT is owned by Knight transportation because Swift was to horrible of a company to stay in business ,Knight saved swift from death unfortunately. Don't work for Swift ! They only pay 39 cents a mile ! And you will not receive home time. The equipment is trash and the trucks are governed at 65 mph and they have week engines. Swift doesn't care about its driver's and they will show it. Swift was even sued for taking advantage of owner operator's and Swift setlled because they knew they were guilty. I sincerely suggest you stay away from awful company."
bad,Wait for loads pick up loads drive loads drop off loads wait for another pickup drive to location pickup load drive to destination drop off load take a nap.
bad,"The company is a terrible company to work for. Too much nepotism and favoritism. Hours are very inconsistent and long. You can ask for a 10 am start time and get called for a time 10-12 hours after you ask for. They preach safety but, ask you to work hours that you are not comfortable working. If you tell management that you are not fully rested, they tell you to suck it up and deliver the loads anyway. You are only paid for driving. You may have up to 80 hours in the work week, but only be paid for 40-45. The remainder are on duty not driving. Which you are not paid for. The majority of drivers there are very sloppy and don’t clean up after themselves.  It’s not uncommon to be assigned a truck that had a large amount of trash and filth. The trucks are not assigned, you drive a truck that is available."
bad,"I would not recommend this company. This company made unlawful deductions to myself & many, many others. When it comes to GAAP, they make up their own rules. After 3.5 years they stoled my truck & the majority of personal property that it contained. Upon Detective being brought in to investigate, management flat out lied to law enforcement about even knowing me."
bad,Yes I can't even say bad or good about management.'Cause there is no such thing like that. Working for swift is more like going to a circus. A driver is just a number on the monitor for them.
bad,Short routes and home time and or pay is a one star here. Driver managers can be rude at times and have master/slave attitudes towards the drivers. Would not send my worst enemy to work for them.
bad,"Unable to get home when they said I could be home , back tracking to refuel, making me sit at truck stop for 2 or 3 days and giving my load to another driver......etc....."
bad,Make a big difference which Hub you are dispatched from. Good equipment to drive. Poor safety personnel. Pay is too low. Company not for the drivers at all.
bad,"Regularly had to argue over pay. Class action lawsuit in progress. If you are young, willing to put up with this, and have no family or life then it can potentially be a way into a great paying field."
bad,"Not Half bad if you get a good manager. Despite what you say, your really just a number to them or a means to an end."
bad,Not a good reputable company. Found out they have several lawsuits due to shady things.  They don't correspond with drivers needs. They are losing good drivers because they don't care about them.
bad,"Swift does not have a set of values that are equal. Salary/Position is based on who you know, not what you know. What is ok for one person to do could get another person fired. Nepotism abounded at Swift, and not in a good way. Often, employees used family ties to poison the well that others drank from."
bad,"Those in positions.... DM's are not ""people oriented"" to say it kindly. My experience as well as what I've observed as a driver, Swift representatives extend little regards, respect or compassion for their drivers. Their position/ mentality is ""you either do as told and question nothing or you will regret not doing it."" Drivers are nothing and nobody."
bad,Not a good place no home time no good communication rarely empty trailers leaving you with no option but to decline loads making you miss out on income and making you look lazy in the companies eyes
bad,"After over 3 years with Swift as Company driver & O/Op.. as Owner Operator.. You are not an Owner/Operator.,But Lease Purchase Option. This should be understood clearly. You are not Owner/Operator. You just lose all Worker Benefits. Swift will teach you the basics of the trucking industry. But will drop you like yesterdays garbage when they no longer need or like you. There are many great people at Swift.. But the Corporate Culture is Rotten. Swift is a Public Traded Company on the Stock Market. They do not care about the drivers or employees.. Their only concern is with the Stock Price. The Owners buy up smaller Company's,, a shell game. Stay Away from this Company.. They are rotten to the core. Find a smaller viable and honest Company if you want to work in Trucking. I believe Swift started as an honest Company, but has fallen into disgrace."
bad,They treat you like property and never kept their promises to make sure you where home on time. A place that doesn't care about their employee's and shouldn't be allowed treat people the way they do.
bad,"You will walk on egg shells working for swift - you will be promised alot of money earned by driving alot of miles that they also promise you but fail in because they have so many drivers and not near enough freight."
bad,I must say this company had the worst equipment and the staff was clueless as to what drivers needed to do their job good. The pay was horrible.
bad,"Worked out of chicago intermodal fleet and coming over from central refrig. Otr during central/ swift merger.All central drivers that had stayed on and went to chicago intermodal are gone!Management there ran me away! Not good people , screw up pay .Every week and call it human error.For 5 weeks in a role?! Gotta go!!!!"
bad,"Not recommend. Too many levels of management, lack attainable goals."
bad,"driving eleven hrs."
bad,"I would not recommend this kindergarten company. "
bad,"Not sure who is giving them 5 stars unless they are new to the trucking industry, worked slave labor prior to coming to Swift, or actually work for Swift and trying to raise their review score, but the place is a joke!! Just search for Swift Accidents or Reviews and you'll get the idea!"
bad,Most driver managers will lie to you and are very rude. Most the office people will be rude and have you do illegal actions if your dumb enough to do it so they can save money. They make promises they 95% never keep. I've worked here over a year . I just stay here cause I guess I'm a gluten for punishment. One good thing I can say about swift is they have some great drivers that will treat ya like family. To fix swift they would have to fire a lot of the people that treat there drivers like total garbage
bad,Not allowed to go home for time off when promised the pay scale was a lot less then promised
bad,"Most of the time no one cares of what you do as long it doesn't effect them personalty. The pay scale sucks I was at pay grade 12 which in their eyes means 9.00 per hour. My department supervisor lied to get me fired. I never called off of a shift I was late one time in two years."
bad,Bad review-got laid off when I had to come home from california to go see my x in the hospital and wouldnt get hired back because I left during training and my 12 year old was home alone .My driver manager would not reply to my phone calls. Not a situation you wanna get caught in without company understanding you'r basic needs.
bad,"I have worked for plenty of company's and this one is the Worst one of ALL!! They treat you like a number, the equipment that they use is very poor. I had plenty of problems with the truck and trailers. Told management about my issues, and all they care about is how many miles you can run, with no consideration about the safety aspect of the equipment. They don't pay you enough for the miles, and they don't give you enough long runs to make any real money. I was yelled at for things that were out of my control. Like the person who sets up your trip knows that you are going to drop your trailer, and so when you get to your drop, and UN-hook trailer. They want you to pick up another load but you have no trailer. Had to cancel pick up because of no trailer. And that was my fault. DM was rude, was never there when I called for assistance. Company Is THE Worst at taking care of there drivers"
bad,"I loved traveling the 48 states and meeting differant people. I learned alot about the dangers of trucking,esspecially in adverse weather conditions. Co-workers were easy to get along with,however the undertrained office staff such as driver managers were very rude and unprofessional. They did not seem to grasp the everyday senarios a driver faces. If you would try to explain a certain situation to them,they would simply overtalk you and sometimes even hang up on you. When you had a personal conflict with a driver manager, the upper staff would always take their side regardless.I would not recommend this company to no one."
bad,"One day per month at home. However, if trucking is what you want to do for a living, Swift is a good place to start. Get you license and work for them for three years, and if you do well here in that time (no accidents, no citations, etc) you can get a job with nearly any other company fairly easily."
bad,sorry I cant write a positive review They don't want you to succeed they just want to burn you out so they don't have to give you your guaranteed raises
bad,"I would NOT recommend this company to my worst enemy ! If your considering it ; "" DONT "" !"
bad,"No support "
bad,"You can get a lot of miles at times.  That's really all they care about.  They will forget to give you money owed for detention or whatever.  They seem to have a hard time getting you to home time, like it's not time you earned."
bad,"I have been driving for Swift for 4 months. I only made a $1000 two times. I  have made $12 in a week. I was making more as a student. They have me sitting on the weekends,  and can't get me home in time. I averaged $1800 a month after taxes."
bad,Poor poor poor poor company and I hated it. They need a lot of work with their company and they lied about pay. They didn't pay me for my hours that I worked.
bad,Had a dm that went out her way to help and make sure I was ok. But account i was on canceled and was told the week of so had to do random loads. Got tired of asking for loads. Had issues getting home on time and if it wasn't for her i would've been left. Then once my truck was no longer under their lease they barely gaveloads
bad,"Expect to sacrifice your time off in exchange for the unpaid burdens that come with trucking. Especially if you are just starting out as a company driver. You will get little compensation for learning how to drive while with a mentor, and could lose a lot of money if you decide to go thru their CDL school, and you don't make it for 1 year in trucking do to all of the pitfalls and mistakes you'll make when starting out. You will have a learning curve, but it depends on how fast you improve thru the curve. If you make too many mistakes like I did, you won't make it in the first year. The tuition alone last time I went thru it in 2016 was around $3,000. Other places will be a lot cheaper if you get yours from somewhere else. Expect to be out 6 days a week and off 1 day for every 6 days out. It averages out to be around 5 days off per month as a company driver. And only around 52 days total out of the entire year if you survive and thrive. And you only get about 1 week of paid vacation after you achieve your anniversary date. You won't get paid holidays, etc. when you're a OTR driver. Pay extra attention to port of entries and weigh scales: you can easily get a ticket. And if you're serious about making trucking (esp. OTR) you need to make it your lifestyle and expect downtime when you're still working and not getting paid for it. Too many examples to explain. And I would highly recommend also getting a CDL Defense Insurance to protect your CDL from any possible tickets. I highly recommend not paying the ticket if you are career minded, and have the attorneys represent your case"
bad,"Swift is a company  that will help you get your foot in the door(TRUCKING INDUSTRY). As for long term job security,  um no. Many people don't know that Knight Transportation & Swift ARE ONE..merge together like a married couple. Since Knight has (in my eyes) taken over...there has been a lot of ""egg shells"" walking around d here. Understand that cleaning house is a must BUT once you start get rid of dedicated..good hard working individuals such as drivers or driver managers...chaos is soon to come. East coast drivers get paid a penny LESS once crossing the Mississippi River..meaning IF I pick up a load in Kentucky to take to texas.. I just lost a penny for loaded and unloaded. Not to mention the camera that RECORDS ALLLLLL DAY LONG with audio. SPS scores on ""how much of a risk"" you are given by individuals who have never seen..or operated  a semi, let alone there personal vehicles. MICROMANAGING. Planners show favoritism...and honestly freight has been on a down slope the last few weeks......keeping company  & O/o sitting around doing NOTHING.  Smh"
bad,"As much as people spoke badly about swift, I made good money there. I paid off close to $100,000 of the truck. Then knight took over and forced a lot of us owner op out. By giving us bad loads. I saw so many owner op trucks at different terminals they had to park them in the car parking lot because there was no space inside the terminal."
bad,I was supposed to to get shorter runs at night so I would have plenty of time to get to my VA appointments and that only happened twice out of several times that I needed it to happen. We were expected to be on time even though the stores did nothing to expedite the unloading process.
bad,This is a company that is what you make it. It is a large corporation and that culture is evident. It’s easy to become just a number and sometimes it’s better that way.
bad,"By Swift being a big company, you would think employees would receive a lot of benefits and be happy. Wrong again. You were a name and number at Swift!"
bad,"Needs improvement, dispatcher doesn't communicate. No room for advancement. Company doesn't pay anything for the hours they want you to work."
bad,Reviewing a previous employer is not fair how can this be a productive way of finding new employment has nothing to do with posting a resume
bad,This company does not follow through with what they say they believe in.  Treat drivers terrible yet want to know why there's such high turnover?  I am a DM and I see this everyday.  I'll be taking my fleet with me....
bad,"Recruiter guaranteed local position once finished with training. Upon reaching completion of training found out management weren't going to honor what was agreed, and intended on my position being over the road."
bad,"Over the year I was employed by Swift I spent more time waiting for a load than I did actually driving.  They never got me home on time, or even tried so far as I could tell.  I went through 4 trucks due to the condition they were in prior to my being assigned them (one truck made it 3 miles from the terminal before it violently died, minutes after picking up a load that was then late due to the truck I'd just been issued).  The dispatchers are drama queens (the 2 I experienced both were) and when they utterly fail you as a driver, as they both did, if you say anything about it to anyone, the loads you get after will be garbage. There's a lot of trucking companies out there, don't sell yourself short."
bad,i did not  get pay at all for the time i work i did not like  being put on the unnploment
bad,"You will be treated as just a number.And you'll have way to many managers,telling you what to do.On top of that they don't know anything about trucking"
bad,send you to location and always waiting for days at a time....
bad,Cant nobody basically take care themselves working at Swift Transportation it impossible unless you content with being a homeless person. Swift is a really a bad company to work for There's nothing good about this company. I'm embarrassed to tell someone I worked  for Swift Transportation is something to be ashamed about.  Scamming drivers out of their money is a place nobody shouldn't work for definitely not a new driver
bad,Swift is for truckschool grads needing to acquire exp in team driving setting. Poor Mgmt. results in 94 percent turnover rate of drivers. Many leave overtired on edge of burnout after 3-4 months. 50 percent of loads are heavy to Max allowable weight by dot. Mgmt don't care about driver burnout.
bad,The pay is consistently low.  A lot of sitting waiting for loads not getting paid. Communicating with dispatch is a job in its own rights. Overall there's no point of continuing this. If you have a mortgage or child support dont come here.
bad,Hardest part of job was the management //total jerks/joann cowling treated me like the sum of the earth and I never did get my 1500 dal sign on bonus as promiesd after quitting marten trans port where I traveled 49 states and canada 70.000 DALLORS A years got a new truck each year and treated like a god  4300 MILES A WEEK//UNDERGROUND STORAGE CAVES JOPLIN MISSOURI FERREY BOATS RIDES WITH THE LOADED TRAILER TO NOVA SCOTHIA AND ISLANDS AROUND SEATTLE TO UNLOAD THE FREIGHT
bad,They just ran me hard a different  dispatcher every time to much down time they did not care of their driver also the camera and on board give false information
bad,"They r great fir a starting job. Their lease program sucks you make the payments for 5yrs on their truck, you pay all cost on said truck and you really get nothing for this! DO NOT DO IT!"
bad,"By far the most unprofessional company I have ever encountered. Poor management and no regard for safety. 5,000 miles was 500 bucks lol. You would expect more from the largest trucking company"
bad,Not getting paid for total miles of driving My recruiter left that information out. I wouldve never came to swift. Not getting paid for door to door service but providing door to door service. I'm not sure if it's legal but good companies will pay you for every mile you drive.  Swift isnt a good enough company to refer a friend because they dont pay you for every mile you drive. It help them save money to pay for accidents thats what my driver leader told me.
bad,"It is starting driver scam business, it’s all about benefits. They only care making making off of you that’s why they having their recruiters telling you all these lie and they admitted none of these promised are true. You get racial profile at day with some this people"
bad,I was fresh driver out of school I went to training the trainer didnt teach me anything and was so toxic was always in my business would never give me privacy and made life hard on the road.i was only training for three weeks before I tested out not knowing the ins and outs I learned everything from experience especially backing up and driving down mountains none of that was taught besides cruise control  shortage on pay never tell you the truth they are truly terrible however my driver manager was outstanding and I had a nice truck but overall it was horrible
bad,I can only speak of the claims department. Direct supervisor is ok. Claims director is very condescending and disrespectful.  There are NO employee advocates to help employees with serious issues. Claims load is completely out of control due to severe lack of staffing. In my opinion Swift does not have ANY empathy or respect for their claims staff.
bad,They treat you like a dog. If you have a family emergency don't count on them understanding or if you get sick on road they don't care. Had a death in the family and they were very rude to me about getting home and wanted me to leave out very next day after just getting home
bad,"New safety program gives no leeway for driver error. Outrageous points given for minor ""events"" such as following distance, minor speeding, and other stuff. Once you hit 84 points they fire you. DMs and office staff in El Paso do not care to try and work with the driver. They do and will play favorites no matter how good of a job you have been proven to do. I was terminated due to points and they said and I I quote ""due to your points and driving behavior we have to terminate you because of the risk of a possible accident in the future "". So it didnt matter that my on-time delivery rate was 99%, nor that my MVR is free of accidents, tickets, and violations, they will terminate based on an assumption that there could be an accident sometime in the future. I do not recommend period. As my employment went on, I found that I could not trust anyone for fear of being lied to and manipulated which is exactly what happened."
bad,"Poor management, to much waiting time to reach your dispatch, no complete job disclosure, no disclosure of company point system, to much favoritism, your driver leader will make you or break you, no real open door policies, forced dispatch"
bad,Sucked worst place to work lousy home time. Didn't keep promises lousy manager sucked working there no advancement no life just be on the road and no home life
bad,horrible company to work for only if u need money or experience if not stay away from this company drivers are in and out at this company low class truck drivers you can tell there miserable low pay they try anything to get u to stay example swift university other accounts
bad,"I worked there 14 years. Million mile safe driver. They fired me over drive cams. Obviously I'm a safe driver 1,250,000  with no accidents no tickets or citations for over 10 years. I liked working there and took up for them when I heard drivers bad mouth them. It wasn't my terminals choice to terminate me it was corporate. My terminal manager tried to keep me."
bad,"As one of the few Drvers to start racking up 4000+ miles a week after graduating and who maintained a 100 percent on time rating, I thought taking 34 hour resets every couple of weeks  would be acceptable. I was wrong. They would keep me out for over 3 months at a time with no days off and wouldn't let anywhere near my home, even to file my taxes."
bad,Very unorganized will tell you anything to get you through the door you dont really get the miles they promise alot of sitting around waiting for freight i wouldn't recommend
bad,I went to work one day to find out my specific job was not what it used to be.... gave me no notice....changed supervisors and completely different job as what I was hired for
bad,"Too slow  sending  next load to Quadcom,  wrong address to goto certain place the it's wrong. "
bad,To many people trying to run the show. Not very good at keeping you going.was held up to long getting truck repaired. My experience their was ok the first week after that I knew it wasn't the type of job I wanted to work for.
bad,they say they promote safety but they ignored several safety issues with faulty trailers until my partner was killed. i had a great dispatcher until i changed accounts and worked local in california
bad,"Good work / life balance."
bad,"Living in a cab driving 3300-4000 miles/week No home time, greedy dispatchers, Decent managers, but no time off and rarely home. All in all, it was the dregs of the industry."
bad,"i loved driving on the road its fun and challenging ,im single so being  a way for 2 months is not an issue to me at all , hooking up the trailer and  dropping and learning  ever thing new every day was great  i loved that part"
bad,"Management is terrible, do not expect any help solving problems for days. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody unless you just need 6 months to get some free training."
bad,"Company pulls you in saying they need drivers bc they have a lot of work to be done. After a few weeks you find out they have to many workers and not enough loads. They also don't give the good loads to any of the new drivers, I barely made $450 a week and gone two weeks at a time."
bad,"I learned long haul an over the road essentials. How to find locations, load and protect the load with proper temp monitoring and delivering on time and in good contition."
bad,All i have to say is please don't do it your about to get robbed every check. I been with them for a year now and there have been times i call to see why i didn't get paid for the week they don't have a reason nor try to find out if you want to work for free this is definitely the company for you
bad,Company would drive you hard  to pick up trailers of product and deliver threw out the western states.On  time every time.Assist in off loading as need be to pick up next load.
bad,"Its a good company to start with to get experience, but they have no regard for the safety of the driver. They promote family values, also long as you don't want to be with your family.They promise hometime, but they will get you home when they want to, not when you need to be there. Expect to be left in truck stops or parking lots for 1 or 2 days waiting for a load."
bad,I simple couldn't earn nothing . Swift idea of good money is working at the salvation army or a waitress working for tips. This job is for senior citizens who need a supplementary income for their social security check. If you have plans to buy a house send kids through college go to Crete. Company and Lease drivers .
bad,"People are not important and are treated as expendable resources. While I was fortunate to have superiors at my location that I believe cared about the people there, it is the exception rather than the rule. In general, the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing - once an item is off somebody's desk, nobody is responsible for it; there is no accountabilty or follow-up support. Communication is a rarity. Problem resolution is generally handled by firing someone or by throwing money at it. Training is minimal to non-existent. Management rarely recognizes the existence of non-management people. There is virtually no respect for people."
bad,Not a bad place to start..... but they give trucking a bad name. Low paychecks at times. Favoritism with miles and good loads. Lots of b.s loads and trailer moves. DON'T EVER EVEN THINK OF GOING LEASE OP.
bad,"started out good and than things shifted. they didn't back up there word and I was having issues with my pay. they gave me the runaround bout my pay. I was told that I could take off as much time as I needed due to my mother being ill and had to stay in the hospital for a week. I called in and was told it was not a problem. I received a notice in the mail saying that I was terminated. My driver leader told me it was fine and my recruiter also. She also stated that I could take as much time as I needed. Adding to that that she had to take 3 months off before and she's back at work now. I didn't need nowhere near that much time off though. But I got terminated and along with that my dental and visual plan got canceled after the fact that I was given permission. I just don't understand how was I terminated for no reason at all. I went through a lot of pain and sulfuring due to cancellation of my dental coverage. Thank GOD I am finally getting my teeth pulled in the morning. Anyway, peace and blessings to swift and everyone on board! Much love!"
bad,They need to just focus on teaching and stop trying to be a trucking company. They focus on teaching and  do not focus on trying to keep the drivers that have experience.
bad,"Began as an OTR driver, but switched to dedicated when an opening on the Sears account became available. Originally, I was told it would be 5 days a week and home every week (get home Fri night and head back out Mon morning), with an opportunity to earn a bonus every week. Eventually, though, the higher ups got rearranged; resulting is my time off (home Sat evening, but still back out Mon morning). Anytime I knew something needed to be accomplished, prior to the next day, I would send a message before going to sleep; hoping the higher ups would have a solution the next morning by the time I got up. However, this never happened. Instead it would take them 4-6 hours to get the request completed. In all honesty, though, the people I delivered to, at the various Sears locations, were great."
bad,The company already has a bad reputation in the trucking industry and working for them i understand why. The trainers dont train you they use you for the miles and extra pay. The jobs not hard if youre willing to do the work and you get to see the country. I have had some great experiences driving for Swift but mostly bad.
bad,"Great place to start off and company but management in Temple TX no good. Favoritism and drinks and come to work hungover, all he worries about is picking up his “kids” which is beers and most unprofessional manager ever! Don C."
bad,I was content with my position until they laid me off because they were on a budget and I made too much money. It is a very fast pace environment and you should never get comfortable or get into a routine because in changes from day to day. Management is ok they can be difficult to work with or hard to understand. Me personally I was under paid for all of the job titles that I carried with me with this company.
bad,"With the merger of two trucking companies there are several changes. Most of which are making it more difficult to perform job duties, such as unnecessary paperwork and unsteady schedule."
bad,As a over the road truck driver its a great filling to get paid to see the country but at the same time I miss being a medical technician where I can help other people
bad,"This was where I got my start. My trainer was awesome and was a female taught me so much. I honestly only have the complaint with dispatch. They micro manage you to death. But other than that, the miles are there and money was good."
bad,"If you become a lease operator and then train students, your possible gross income can be around .25 million a year."
bad,was sitting long hours and days for a load
bad,"Terrible I mean Terrible , just plan Terrible. Everything about this job is Terrible the pay is Terrible the work conditions Terrible  driver leaders SUPER Terrible  I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. Bottom of the barrel  this job is . The lousy pay will send your blood pressure to the moon. Im back at PETCO loving it ! The pay is better the work conditions are amazing and im home every day."
bad,"Jonestown , Pottsville PA terminals sucks!! Lack of driver support, dispatch sucks and recruiters promise you money you’ll never even get close to!!! Terrible company to work with!"
bad,"The people are nice and management is okay, but this is not the place to be for the insurance or health care package. I have a 5 month old baby and I was better off getting insurance on my own at a cheaper premium than the one Swift offers."
bad,"No hours and sometimes all we had was 20 or less hours ,sometimes they will tell some of us to go home because there was there was no work to do . I had to find something else .."
bad,"Terminal leader has no control, everyone in the office does whatever they want. Don't care about the drivers or the loads. That's why they keep loosing customers and good drivers. Theres a lot of favoritism and they make it obvious. The company has good intentions but the people in the office don't comply. They need better leaders, Drivers look for help in their managers but the managers/driver leaders don't care."
bad,Good equipment  poor pay for experi drivers and like most companies forget that the accident free 100percent on time drivers make the company not office people
bad,Walmart dedicated in cleburne.Terrible company to work for. Well below pay scale for a good professional driver. They expect you to do several tasks for free. No set work schedule..they expect drivers to be ready to go at all times of the day and night.
bad,they only care about the dallor not the driver. do not work for them.
bad,"         It was usually a good day depending on weather and stress .I learned how to drive safely,how to do light maintainance,and follow DOT laws.The management was good but over worked .My co-workers were good people who worked hard.the hardest part of the job was the long hours I had to put in.I really enjoyed driving the truck.it was about the money."
bad,"Drivers are under paid and over worked. Management don't care about you as a person, rather the load you have on your truck comes first. General day includes pick ups and deliveries around the country as any standard trucking company does."
bad,"Worked as a driving trainee. My duties uncluded keeping log books, vehicle inspections, load management."
bad,"I was hired back in September and sent to get my CDL. The training takes about 2 months to complete between getting your CDL and mentorship while on the road. After I got forced to wait an extra week to test out and get into my own semi because ""we dont have a semi where you are."" My mentor went inside to find out they had multiple 2019 and 2018 semks there. Then after that I went on the road solo and for a short time teams. As it progressed i was sitting more than driving to the point my pay was only a fraction of when i started. Just make sure when you leave to drop your semi and trailer at a terminal. No need to be like my idiot former team driver and owe an extra 3 grand to return the truck to a terminal"
bad,Had to be worried about your job everyday. You are always in competition with each other....Management always had favorites. The people around you are always cursing and then sit around and let otherpeop!e answer their phone.
bad,The job itself was good.   I worked as part of the extended coverage team that operated the AS400 dispatch program and filled in for driver managers that called in sick.  The office area was cramped and everyone who came in sick passed it around to everyone.  My biggest memory of that place was a case of bronchitus that too 2 months to kick.
bad,"I worked there for almost a year got my cdlthere and everything.  I worked sears tire which great money for what work you do, but getting home on time is insane always working six to seven days never home when the sun is up and always running out your seventy if your looking for a job to take care of you this isn't it"
bad,They treat you like a number does not care about you or your life.everytime you call its like a hour before yiu get a answer and if you need to come home it will be like 10 days after you ask to be home.
bad,"ok job, but some of the driver leaders and managers are very unconcerned with any thing that does not pertain to making the company money."
bad,"coworkers..awesome."
bad,"Terrible place to work and drive for. Unreal Delivery times, your job was always on the line. Management would not be helpful,"
bad,"Swift can be a great company, I just had bad experience with a couple of dispatchers, they were very unprofessional, and does not follow rules of the company, I was very stressed working with those dispatchers, I was mistreated on a regular base, example the dispatcher left me stranded at a fuel stop for three hours,and would not approve the fuel."
bad,Everything about this company is awful. The CDL school in GA was a joke. Mentors were awful. Not enough training. It was a huge mistake and a waste of time to go to swift. If you are thinking about doing it...don’t. Go elsewhere.
bad,It was good at first but after my truck broke down 10 times and the couldn’t figure out why I was just well to the point of quitting. The benefits are great though. They’ll work you to the bone but they’ll give you very good benefits
bad,Honestly I didn't like working it because when I did I asked for the miles and I was always giving the run around and that's not what I wanted anymore it wasn't worth being away from my kids.
bad,Swift transportation does not care about it's drivers. Everyone is treated like aunts. They have no respect for peoples lives or what they need financially. It is just a starter company into the business. The pay is terrible. I knew a man who drove there for like four years. He finally paid his dues and got hired on with Kllm. Which is a better company. Dispatch is like talking to people who don't understand. You are treated like a no bod.
bad,Worked as Fema Superviser for chas and clark engineering until job was complete in June 2006.
bad,I would wat for my driver manager give me a location and load to pick up over the computer in the truck .I pick it upand deliver it. Managmenet was not so good. I was a by myself in the truck. The hardest part was to get right deraction my driver manager.The most enjoyable was geting the done.
bad,Have to do train for weeks and make lil bit of money. the trainer makes more than the trainee. When u a trainee u driving for u and makeing the trainer hi/her hours.
bad,"Not a great place for money making,( getting miles) however if you show any aptitude at all for winter weather driving they'll throw every no pay no mile ice road trucking route on you......"
bad,i received very poor training. i was not shown how to operate the truck computer nor was i shown most of the basic trucking industry procedures. in short swift sends you out with a trainer that uses you to uptain more pay for him or her shelf.
bad,"Having to be dead lines on drops, and being able to explore diffrent parts of the usa."
bad,"I was a mentor for 3 weeks. My 1st week with a student was 13 hrs per day none stop trainin in exchange swift give me the miles the student drive which creates a total for the truck.  Without a student I avg between 1850-2600 miles per week. With the student I avg the same!. After week 1 I contacted my DM to explain my situation they said it will get better."
bad,BAD COMPANY THERE was nothing  good about working for the ex-company   nohnothing  go as plan that is all i can say about this company nothing i am going to say about this company
bad,"you spend more than you earn. Dispatchers discriminate, It was my worst experience ever. It only good for the old white men because the dispatchers respect them."
bad,"On orientation they will hire you as SE regional driver one week into it they will tell you now you are OTR driver. If you don't like it you can leave or work as OTR driver, driving 200 to 300 miles a day."
bad,Unless you know a V.P. you will never have a career with Swift Knight transportation. A wealth of talented people work for Swift and after finally realizing they will be in the same entry level position forever are finally starting a mass Exodus.
bad,I was out of school and did not want to drive solo ... Swift did not want to hire my team partner and I was not going to stay and drive solo for them...
bad,Had no real issues with the company. Wish the pay structure was higher so you didnt have work an insane amount of hours to obtain a meaningful paycheck.
bad,Swift did not pay me fairly they would drive us but not pay us what they agreed to pay but way less they had no repect for their drivers and unfair treatment
bad,Swift Transportation was purchased by Knight Transportation and once that happened all things started going towards Knights way of doing business which wasn't supposed to happen
bad,"This is not a good company to work for. If they was so good, why are they posting ads on craigslist week after week? I decided not to work here but I get a call from Swift telling me that my application has been disqualified because I didn't go to orientation. They better stop disqualifying drivers application's, they can't keep drivers as it is."
bad,"I was told by the recruiter I was approved for orientation . But after carefully thinking about it, I decided not to work for this bottom of the barrel company.  They only give new trucks to their favorites. They are the worst company out there!!"
bad,Low pay lots of sitting waiting on loads most management  didn't care about employee and they didn't take good care of their trucks no maintenance and hard to get problems fixed
bad,I was always kind to my team driver but I could not get the same treatment especially if I had to drive my partner always hovered over my shoulders like a hawk which was absolutely distracting.
bad,"Didn't feel adequately trained, learned more responsibilities after I finished 180 hours training, it took forever to get me home after I turned in my resignation"
bad,This company does not care for the safety of it's drivers. Although they offer schooling through a company loan you are better trying to find a contractor under a different company to earn your cdl license.
bad,They overwork you or they under work you they will let you sit for two weeks without a load they will not communicate with their drivers they are actually one of the worst trucking companies out there they miss route you they send you to the wrong town they gave you the wrong information on your dispatch they never want to send you home for home time they underpay you if they pay you at all
bad,It was an okay place to begin a career but I would not recommend staying and making a career out of it. I would only make about 34 cents per mile. Other than that not a bad company.
bad,"The fact to working for this company?Stay away from this company!!!!!!!!! went with a trainer it was a ok start.Then it went down hill.Like i was suppose to know everything in 2 days.Got off the truck.When i got back to my home terminal.Got into my car, the  the best time i had with Swift? was pulling off with their company in my rearview mirror.You have to find a company to get your start? to me!! this company will not be the one for that."
bad,this is one of the worst companies i have ever worked for i wish i didnt go through them to even get my cdl because they are a ok school but the company it self sucks the pay is low and miles are also
bad,"The training school is a scam. They charge you 4400 bucs to go to a lot in Utah and stand around. I got 20 minutes of seat time and zero classroom training. I did get my license but it wasn't worth what I paid for it!!!!! They get you to sign a contract for payment. DONT DO IT. There are much better options than Swift for training.... The pay is not good either. The driver managers have favorites that they give the miles to. Pay is based on miles. You bump a dock and "
bad,Over the Road truck Driver truck driver and all that it entails.
bad,travail all 48 states worked independent. deliver on time read maps and keep log books
bad,"The puppy mill of the commercial driving industry. Takes in new drivers weekly to bi-weekly as they can for orientation & fails to fully inform on expectations or life as a driver for Swift.  Low pay, bad routes, smelly trucks & very poor maintenance are the only perks working for them.....unless a hostile work environment is considered a perk as well.  Swift has one of the highest turnover rates in the commercial transportation industry, they know it & are happy with it for the cheap labor."
bad,Just didn't make enough money. Rather then that it is not a bad place to work for
bad,"not enough miles always sitting in terminal with no load to carry so i did not not get paid went in debt, no medical or pension."
bad,"Did not receive a pay check for almost a month. Was told that I would be driving solo like I wanted. They then turned around and decided to team me up with someone without my knowledge,"
bad,"Swift raised their insurance rates for individuals to pay more than double from"
bad,!I worked the Wal-Mart dedicated account and the position itself was horrendous and nothing like the recruiter promised at all. The management was top notch and made the job worthwhile!
bad,I just did not like the Swift Company. I just was not happy being there. I started out somewhere else and I felt I was forced into the company because it had bought the company that I was working for at the time.
bad,It's fun job if you have the right management to back you up an help  you when you don't know how to do something very large amount of work very nice equipment
bad,Since i been here the only office personnel I've met was the Orientation coordinator. I haven't met no managers or supervisors I dont  no who runs this company. I get my load sent to me Qualcomm device its like working for a computer machine. I suppose to have a driver leader but they only send messages through the Qualcomm no phone calls allowed. When i send messages about my money not right they never respond back to me the only thing missing from swift are prison guards
bad,They don't care about the advancement of their employees. They just care about how they look to the higher up. Been their 4 years only have 2 raises so far.
bad,I loved working for swift transportation I traveled this country so many time I dont need a gps or a map book.  Unfortunately the money isnt the same it's more less they ever. When your high schools kids starts making more money than you working at department stores after school its time to move on from swift. I'd be glade to comeback if the pay gets better.
bad,Get in get out. Good place to start but dont stay unless free and clear owner op. Company driver waste of time. And if your a national guard solider they will lie and dam near push u to be awol if u dont know your rights.
bad,You’d have to go over the road to make a decent paycheck. Currently on a local account which allows me to be home daily/nightly. Mileage pay cap is .45 cpm which is horrible
bad,Away from home 25-35 days in a row.  Driver manager not securing available runs to keep me driving.  Sat alone and empty almost more than with a trailer to pull
bad,I Been at swift  8 months . I like the company they never gave me a problem. I came to swift so i could earn good money to pay off my college student loan and buy a house. the earning i made here at swift was just enough to pay regular living bills i couldn't invest in cloths or personal items or begin to pay off debt. I gross 2400 a month the exact same gross when i  worked at starbucks. I'm submitting my resignation cause the risk dosent balance with the pay. I can pour coffee for what a truck driver earns.
bad,The pay wasn't what i was told it would be the equipment wasn't properly maintained loads were short wrong information was given almost half the time then paychecks were given.
bad,"They'll run till you drop. Moving freight is their only concern. They don't care if the run can't be made legally. Running legal is the driver's responsibility, you'd just better get that freight delivered on time. Lots of time sitting without pay. Equipment is OK,  though they don't really want to spend any money to maintain them. Be prepared for breakdowns and  more unpaid time."
bad,was horrible they didnt treat me well at all. They had favorites. They dont let you go home when they say they will.Some of them talk to you anykind of way as well. Im just saying overall they could do better with their employees.
bad,The training at swift has the length of good training but the trainers are not patient enough for starters. The management is cruel and unprofessional. I don't advise anyone to start or switch over to this company.
bad,Barely any home time and not good money. Only way to make good money is to stay gone months at a time Never get to see family  short loads managers are awful
bad,"I was in an accident and was stranded in my truck for three days.  While on Worker's Comp leave, the company discontinued my insurance.  I provided proof that I paid it and they did nothing."
bad,I became a truck driver during the Great Recession because nobody else was hiring. I would go out on the road for three weeks at a time with only three days off. The pay was also very low.
bad,"I did not get enough miles working with swift.and they where very unorganized.,and was not making the money no felt I deserved for the amount of miles I was driving every month."
bad,"Horrible place to be employed. I was told to die by management. Left on the side of the road for 4 days with no food and no water, and had another employee try to stab me. They are a drug trafficking criminal syndicate that needs investigation."
bad,I do not like to complain and I know the DM's are overworked but mine tried his best to make it work out. There's too many drivers to DM ratios and it started out great paid on time and home on time then i finished training. I would request home time and get sent 1000 miles in wrong direction. then my truck broke down they didn't have a spare and I was down for 4 days i didn't get paid breakdown pay or hotel stay and it was Christmas eve so it was cold on top of it i missed a student loan payment from that and it kept piling up till i got zeroed out paychecks.
bad,I went through the schooling as required.  I was let go for no reason that had to do with my job.  Three weeks into training I was let go and left with a huge debt nearly impossible to pay.
bad,"drove truck with helper, not friendly"
bad,Demands to much for little pay. starting pat is .25 cents per mile
bad,I have noticed that they treat their company drivers like they are no one. The only way you get any respect is if your an owner operator through them.
bad,you drive then drive some more there just a big corp it was not for me but if you want it could be for you
bad,I learned to drive with this company. but working with them was really hard you never knew if you had a job one day to the next.
bad,"On a typical day, I picked up the truck and carried out the assignment. The dispatchers misled and gave wrong address and direction information. I learned that the driver needs to have own health and car insurance independent from the company. My co-workers were great but company did not support team work. The hardest part of the job is the exposure to unpredictable danger and lack of support from the Company. The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to figure out safe road and to get the products to destination on time."
bad,the bottom of the barrel one of the worst jobs anyone could have!
bad,Al they require is go go go....
bad,"poorly managed, not making money."
bad,"Since day one, they sell you a dream. They tell you the pay is 48 - 55 cpm, but pay you way less. They said I was supposed to average 2000 miles per week. I've been with the company for almost 6 months and very RARELY saw 48 cpm or 2000 miles per week. From beginning to end, the communication did improve to some degree, but the pay did not. The communication was terrible in the beginning. It did not improve until I kept expressing my frustrations about it."
bad,The pay at this company is too cheap I only make $.40 a mile I had a death in my family they do not pay for bereavement they do not pay for your holidays and they do not pay for your sick time never been with a company that does not pay for anything like that this is a new experience.
bad,Nothing to Say I did not have a good 10 years plus work experience multiple buy outs and mergers left the company disorganized and different paths the only consistencies was inconsistency
bad,This company is not a bad company. The compensation for work required is not equal. Also upper management is not always supportive of subordinates. Very uneasy place to work.
bad,"My driver manager was cindy, she was always rude to me, and treated me like a bald headed step child that was unwanted, the training was trash, and they expected you to figure it out on your own, everything that went wrong was my fault."
bad,"no fun work place,all ways on you about something.no overtime pay.out more than seven days a year you get wrote up.does not matter what the problem is."
bad,Not the best place to work . Stressful work. They expect work to come first and family second. Nice co-workers.  Nice vacation time. Decent 401k and life insurance.
bad,they send your on a run then you have to wait for return loads and they dont inform you that you are off the clock until it comes in with another run then they expect you to run that load with little or no sleep
bad,if there loads were available and the runs were 1000+ miles this would have been great. However it is not the case. Most of my time was spent waiting for another load from the driver leader. Then the loads were 600 miles at a time.
bad,If your gonna keep a man away from his family he needs to be hauling freight.  I can sit st home and not be making money. They always put you were freight isn't at.
bad,Between dealing with Driver Managers that did not keep control over their driver and a Terminal Manager that took sides. This was not a positive environment to work in.
bad,"You are only a number! Swift has the worst record of any transportation company on the internet for a reason, and it’s not because of drivers. When I trained managers my favorite question was if you loose an employee (after a short period of time) who’s fault is it. Swift is a perfect example of that. They spend too much money on hiring and not enough on retention or development. They just don’t care and if you question them they blame you. Don’t waste your time; find anyone else to work for."
bad,Swift needs to improve trainers/training in order to help make new drivers better drivers. There is little fairness in training program as well.
bad,The job keeps me out 3-4 weeks at a time. Unable to spend time with family as much as i like. Sometimes I would not get enough miles to support family.
bad,Swift is a company that allows you to get a start into the trucking world beyond that don't ever go and work there it really is that bad
bad,I have a whole different perspective about truck drivers. Being a professional driver in a big rig is totally different from regular driving. there is a lot to consider and pay attention to.
bad,it gives me a chance to enhance my verbal and hands on skills I get to ride all over Atlanta and see the different communities I have not yet got to experience.
bad,it was alright until they lied about a local account promised to me. the driver mentor was great though. Very knowledgeable and safe.
bad,Kids who never drove a truck telling me how to do my job. Same as most other companies hard to get home hard to get time off at home. They blame me for mistakes management made. To much time to deliver loads. Trucks roll to slow.
bad,"Driving   Intermodal , start at 5:00am home at 7:30pm. Barely  enough time to eat dinner and relax. The zip code  to zip code milage calculation is a way for them to steal money from you on every trip you drive. Example: Milwaukee  Wisconsin - Swift   milage:87 actual mileage : 110."
bad,"I worked in the Regional routs promised that I would be home every two weeks, this did not happen. Promised that I would make 50 to 70 a year I was only bringing home $500 a week so less than $30,000 a year. The trucks are good."
bad,Drove from point A to point to B make deliveries. Over the road truck driver.
bad,"horrible staff in the terminals.. one would think .being out on the road for so long, the staff would be nice and smile and be hospitable, instead of some rude, grumpy staff, to come too. nothing will be done about it though.. haha"
bad,"typical startup company, you're just a number. When I gave them two week notice they tried to strand me in Baltimore, but I didn't have enough hours to take the load. They wouldn't deadhead me or give me a load from the Martinsburg, WV terminal to the Richmond, VA terminal so that I could haul my tools and gear back to the house in my pickup, they said they'd get me a Greyhound ticket but I'd have to leave my tools! I ended up having to rent a car to go home, The people working the Martinsburg terminal tried to get them to hook me up, and couldn't believe what they were doing to me after giving them notice instead of just leaving. I also was punished during my employment for idling the truck, which I only did when it was too hot for me to sleep (they refused to fix the optimized idle so the truck just ran after I fell asleep). My punishment was having to drive 60 miles to the terminal in my personal vehicle instead of taking the company truck home, which was the original agreement. WHEN THEY HIRED ME THEY TOLD ME TO IDLE THE TRUCK! LIES LIES LIES, HOW TYPICAL OF LARGE SCALE TRUCKING."
bad,New policies try to make all drivers equal. Great on time drivers suffer because poor drivers are given the same opportunities and don't deliver. More drivers are waiting for loads instead of delivering them.
bad,Bad company to work for. I had to chase them down every paycheck to get the money owed to me. i mean i was away from home and my paycheck for the week was $140. Are you kidding me. They don't train worth any thing and bla bla bla. i didn't enjoy my time with that company.
bad,"celadon trucking was good company to work,i hope one day i can get back and work for celadon trucking and management and my co-worker was good to work with,some time management made it an hard job to work,sometime i enjoy driving truck for celadon and some day it can be an hard and not so enjoyable place to work."
bad,Great for single life. Plan on never knowing what's next.!pay rate is what they say but you have to have the work to get the pay.when the work is there you always feel rushed with poor planning.
bad,Poor planning and driver support .. they dn’t care about their drivers will never pickup the calls.. i was on hold for 15 mins on emergency phone line
bad,I feel much better since i left swift it wasnt all the way terrible but it will work your nerves. Driver management need to improve they are part of the problem at swift they never answer freeform messages or phone calls. I decided to brake hard a couple of time  it's the only fast way driver management will call. The pay is very low for veteran drivers lookout for that they pay house hold miles. Some people get sign on bonus if you lucky.  Swift dont give away no money believe that!  Swift can become a more attractive company if they fix a few things.  If i was asked will i ever work for swift again the answer will be absolutely not!! .
bad,Days of struggling for freight to make a profit with low rates has been a disaster. Some weeks i dont get paid or maybe clear under 400$.  After all my expenses thiers not a chance to earn a profit pulling swift freight. I was told i can only haul swift freight while i lease swift equipment.  I  started  hauling loads off the loading board during the times swift dont give me loads.  I really dont care how swift  feel about it i have a family to feed. If swift not given you loads find some on the load boards in your area lease drivers only. You paying 2500$ a month on swift lease truck no reason not to find your own loads with better rates you dont have to haul swift low rate loads.
bad,..........good company for gaining experience. However not the best company to stick it out for the long haul.  Had such an issue to try and find me a decent newer model truck. Smh. Beyond that had such a problem finding a clean truck period. And if you start otr with them and wanna switch to local or intermodalgoodluck
bad,"As a driver you are responsible for everything, but have no control of anything. The company can cancel you at anytime and you have zero control of when you will work.  The expect you to drop everything if they want you top deliver extra loads with out giving any advanced warning.  The communication is no existence."
bad,Don't if You: have no family or other. Dont care about money or need to pay Bill's. If you dont like being treated like a number or a dog. Don't want to deal with the public stereotype that comes with driving a vehicle with Swift all over it.
bad,Swift management does not understand that employees have lives beyond the company.  Don’t use correct pay scales for current times. As a team driver I’m only making $0.30/mile and needs to be elevated to $040/ mile. Me and my driver partner have 28 years total time between us at Swift.  I believe experience and loyalty to a company should be rewarded.  We feel like step children!
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend swift to anyone. They didn’t pay but .25 cpm and management definitely don’t care about the drivers. It is a force dispatched company, and lots of the management use it.  They don’t care about your hours of service or you getting tickets. They want the loads delivered regardless of your time. And if you choose your hours of service over the load, you get wrote up and maybe fired. You’re tickets are your problem. So you either choose the load and probably get tickets if you’re logging is checked, which will be your problem. Or stop and probably get wrote up or fired for not delivering."
bad,"Everything negative you heard is true I found out 1st hand after going into this company thinking it would be different. They treat you poorly, force dispatch you, & the drive leaders hold grudges and will mess you over to get even. You've been warned good luck."
bad,No health insurance or any other benefits don't even get full pay supposed to get 25 percent per car but don't any get paid half of what I haul plus hourly
bad,Does not pay over time and the management does not understand how important customer service is to the effectiveness of the business and service department.
bad,Knight Transportation has taken over Swift Transportation you don't  even know if your going to have a job the next day its crazy people are leaving everyday they don't care about you or your family its all a scam they make things sound good to get you in to get money out of you and the drive leader are trash they sit at home with there family's and your out not make any money because of them they also limit you on miles they can give you more but there not its control
bad,"They will give anyone a chance, including people from another countries that are lacking basic driving skills.  The company is a great starter company but overall you get screwed over during your training as well as after. If you are not driving you are not earning. I had no problem staying busy just a problem with getting my manager to pay me properly. Overall not the worst place in the world to work but they do not pay company drivers enough."
bad,"An overabundance of responsibility without authority.  Assigned work could not adequately become completed in the short amount of time given for each individual problem being worked on.  "
bad,Long hours .I was promised a pay rated that I didn't get. With my experience I should have been payed what I was told I would be payed.I didn't get any good miles .only short miles
bad,Company does not care about you.  Pay is not good.  Poor company to use as a starter for your career. //////////////////////////////////////////////////
bad,"work environment is very hostile towards all employees, pay is not enough for what has to be dealt with hours are not compensated for, passing people that are not qualified to even drive. Drug and alcohol testing is a joke. I do not feel that this company cares about a person period."
bad,i enjoyed every day at work since i have passion with my electrics and the management is better. I enjoy overcoming complicated problems and meeting new problems
bad,They tried to pend accidents on me because of a problem with safety  manager not communicating properly while on the road. they also lied about getting me a working truck on time.
bad,"Horrible just horrible. I'm starving out here. Can't get home time, can't get a raise, can't get paid right. I have to call payroll almost weekly and go over my check. I don't receive detention pay almost ever! My driver leader is amazing & helps in any way he can. Thats the only plus!"
bad,"the local terminal doesn't have any work ethics, it is common to be misled or lied to and turnover is high , the company could be improved with some changes!"
bad,horrible never cared if starved. never payed enough and aslo they ripped you off at every turn. oh and they try to skip out on paying you all your runs for the week.
bad,"Living in A truck for weeks at a a time is tough on your whole life."
bad,I don't like the company. They will keep you away from home. The DM have a bad attitude I can't deal with it anymore.  The hardest part of the job was communication some ppl don't understand English. The best thing about the job they will put you in a decent truck. I had a bad day at work the other day this lady lied to me about a load.
bad,.Dispatchers has NO communications between other dispatch. All things told and promised have never been full filled. Dispatchers are paid off on the side for certain loads.Completely unorganized. I don't see how some dispatchers have a job.
bad,"ok company to start out. i got my license and drive for them for close to six months. pay was very low, home time almost non existent"
bad,not a good work environment  they lie and say there going to get you home every weekend but I was out for months and also don't like sliding scale pay its good for a starting company that's it
bad,"I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy. get ready to set in Walmart lots, waiting to unload a whole lot. very slow trucks. turned off c. b. radio because it was embarrassing what was being said about swift trucks. then to top it off, got passed by j. b. hunt truck. management is pretty much crazy, maintence shop just as bad."
bad,"Could not get trucks fixed. Big on slogans and qualcomm macros, poor in real world application. Don't care if you ever get home. Poor pay, Low morale. Will constantly complain about idle time even if it is 100 degrees outside."
bad,"Pick up load and drive it to its destination. It may be a couple of hours to a couple of days. The hardest part of the job was my driver manager, he had no patience with new drivers."
bad,"Went out with a Mentor for 5 weeks. His truck had bed bugs. I was suppose to get 2 private phone calls during the 5 weeks, in which I could report on how progress was going. I didn't get one private phone call. The mentor didn't go over anything except for me driving. That we covered. "
bad,Swift do not care about its drives at all. You will hear from swift . we are here to help you. That's not the case. 90% of the time swift will not help you. I can not think of any thing good to say about swift.
bad,"good place to go to school bad place to work for unless you are going to be an owner operator and a trainer, not a place if you like being with your family."
bad,"I started with the company as a driver. On a regular day, I would do my pre-trip inspection of my truck. If I don't already have a load, I would check my Qualcomm for a load. I would then plan my route and go and pick up my load. I would drive and log within DOT regulations. At the end of my day, I would conduct my post trip inspection and be done with that portion for the day. After my break, I would continue my route if it was not finished prior to my break. After driving for about a year, I started working in the shop at the Moberly Missouri terminal. I started working during the day and later I was moved to night shift to accommodate me be able to attend church on Sundays. After being there for a while I noticed that myself and a couple of other personnel in the shop were getting in trouble for very little things and two of them were terminated for little mistakes. There were a few other guys that were employed there who I later found out were the manager's cousin and friend. They could do no wrong since the manager was related to one and friends with the other. I had been suspended a few times for small infractions I was going to seek employment elsewhere, but no one was hiring. A few of my co-workers and I worked great as a team. I did learn a lot from them and they learned a lot from me. The hardest part of this job was the hours. I was working from 4:00pm until 3:00am. I slept mostly during the day and didn't get much time with my family. What I did enjoy was I worked four days a week and was off for three. On one or two  of those days off I was able to help out and"
bad,"A daily schedule would be to except a load on the qualcomm do all requirements to stay compliance to DOT with electronic logging. Do a pretrip on my truck and trailer, then go to shipper and get the required bill of lading and documents information in the qualcomm . pick up my trailer, drop and hook or live load after that i set my loaded call and i go and deliver my load , when i reach receiver i do the process to check in my load , i drop and hook or live load and then i do my empty call and i start all over again, i am a over the road truck driver. The hardest part of my job is i want to have a dedicated run where i can have a home life also. I want a employer who appreciates a hard worker and dedicated to doing the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part of the job is that although i don't have home life , my wife came out and she is a driver with me as a team and we are together. We both are ready to start a life where we can have a home and life besides just drop and pick up loads. i really enjoy my job , i just am looking for someone who will give me a position that i can do my hours and go home."
bad,"Not much time for a family life, let alone the little money you make."
bad,"my review of swift is that all they care about is thereselves they do not care about the drivers, they dont want you to go home, they yell at you when you dont get enough miles, (even when it isnt your fault you can only get miles they give you). far as the shops go i only came across 1 yes 1 of there shops that treat the driver well, they listen and do everything they can to fix the problem with truck, (richmond, va). the reason not there no longer is my truck was in shop for over 2 weeks, in this time period they offered me 3 trucks that was in worse shape then the one that was in the shop, i lost a student because i was a trainer, they did not pay me for the down time, and acted like they didnt care i was sitting in the terminal 24/7 so if you want to drive for a company like this well good luck to you."
bad,"Very little pay. You was identified as a number and because of their training, I lost my CDL and had to get everything all over again."
bad,Swift all together thinks the job is a 9 to 5 when it isn’t. They keep after hours and weekends short staffed that your waiting a couple hours on hold just to talk to someone to get something fixed or correct it’s a joke don’t come here
bad,"Its a large trucking company, you'll just be a number in the system unless you get a great driver manager. Even then don't expect the truth from everyone and freight to stay good. You will have slow months and not make enough for over the road driving"
bad,Was wrongfully terminates for a prior service injury instead of having me fill out all the proof of being released to work they terminated me. It took getting a hold of a military agency to investigate my case and for swift to realize they wrongfully terminated me.
bad,3 years wasn't so bad until Knight changed  just about Everything  Get out why you still can before the new year cause if u didn't earn a living u really not going too.
bad,"I started here and it was a good place to get started But the pay is low and there is no work/ life balance thier only concern is having the truck on the road and not for the person in it, Terminals are very bad shape, repairs take forever, but overall not a bad place for someone looking to get into a trucking career"
bad,"I have been with Swift for a total of 2 years. This was my first trucking job. I left after a year and a half to seek better pay. Let’s start with the terminals. They are very raggedy. It’s sad a billion dollar company won’t provide decent showers/driver lounges for they’re drivers.  The shop is a whole problem of it’s  on. I’m convinced that most of them are allergic to work.  I called 10 times to see if my truck was done being serviced and no one would answer the phone. Another thing is I am ALWAYS ALWAYS looking for a trailer!!!! Just yesterday it took them 4 hours to find me an empty trailer. The only reason I’m not that upset about the wait is it gave me lots of time to fill out job applications to other truck companies. There are never enough trailers. The benefits they offer are top notch I will admit that much, but boy are they expensive. I guess you take the good with the bad in that department. So that’s about all I have to share with you about Swift make your mind up on your own, but I for one am looking for another job ASAP!!!"
bad,"Training wasn't difficult. The instructors are the same people who administer the drive test for your commercial class A license. They played favorites with some students so if you didn't get into their good graces, on test day, they failed you, and sent you home. It's unfortunate."
bad,"Intermodal equipment is garbage, daily mechanical breakdown won’t let you make money legally and/or safely. "
bad,Sadly not much to say. Its a good starter company for a new driver. Im sure theres good within. Just not much pay. And a lack of respect from there customers.  It may be better now days. I'm not sure but i won't be going back.
bad,swift is a decent company but the management depending on what account you are on is incompetent 4 years total with this company both as a company driver and as an outside contractor in the end the issues all came up
bad,"Seems like a good company like all in it to make money, but the ppl that runs the say to day opperation sucks they don't have real people skills. Sad State."
bad,"The management team lacked management skills and time evaluation on dispatching drivers. As a driver doing favors for dispatchers you would think that it would have paid off but it never did because they wouldn't return any favors for time off, pay raises, performance bonuses etc.."
bad,"Typical Day at work was very stressful, GET FROM POINT A TO B ""QUICKLY""....not ""safely"" learned what a company should not aim to be and management was horrible....workplace was always stressful...hardest part of the job was the job itself...there was zero things enjoyable about the job."
bad,I was off the road for more than 2 years even though I was still driving so I was forced to take this job.I was close to the 2 year mark and was going to leave as soon as I had the chance
bad,"Been 8 years since I worked for them, but at that time they took away 401k, doubled the cost of health insurance, forced employees to take unpaid weeks off, did not pay time and a half for overtime to mechanics, was not allowed to advance due to age regardless if you were already doing the job. Overall at the time a terrible company to work for."
bad,"while the pay is barely legal and the benefits are okay the amount of stuff you have to put up with is not okay. whenever you call in to get some information you have to spend anywhere from five to forty-five minutes just sitting there waiting for someone to pick up the phone. but while you are on hold you are listening to this non stop sales pitch, that on the particularly more stressful days just make you angry"
bad,"Terrible company, they don't look out for you as a driver, you are just a number, it's nearly impossible to get in touch with Planners, my Driver Manager was the only thing keeping me there as long as I stayed she was really amazing"
bad,"A typical day of work is filled with lots of driving."
bad,"Good to star diving and get some experience to move better pay company, Poor management and unable to get home , pay low for the time you work for week"
bad,"Take on new drivers easily  Rush through orientation but with lots of waiting, doing nothing.  They set you up with a mentor that may not may not suitable.  "
bad,"we were diesel techs to work on equipment , we were everything from building management to groundskeeper . the hire ups had no clue what they were doing . company was trying to squeeze a rock to get water"
bad,"Swift is a big company that treats drivers like equipment without realizing that humans are not equipment. equipment can be replaced and fixed but humans can not be replaced or fixed dispatch and management need to put this on the back of their heads. local accounts have too much discrimination against people of color in the Dallas metroplex area (Home depot account). you can see people that you start work at the same time going home early everyday while others will be made to work long hours (people of color). The work culture in the on-site office is sorry they do not understand drive fatigue or tiredness and will push you out till you can drive that truck no-more or half asleep which is very sad when it comes to safety of drivers and other motorist. "
bad,"Trucking......not the life for a dedicated family oriented person. If you don't mind being on the road to earn one day off for every week on the road, then you;ll be ok. Try team driving to earn more."
bad,"I have nothing good to say. Except for those who are just starting and want to get their feet wet, this is the place to start. Everything here is done by computer. No one knows your name."
bad,It was good. But people behind desk and management do not respect or take their drivers into consideration. They prioritize the load and not the driver which is their greatest assets.
bad,"Managers and staff not very friendly, and insurance is now through an exchange ( very costly)"
bad,"My personal experience was not a good one, was not given miles needed to pay my expenses as owner/op and pay taxes and take care of my family!!"
bad,"You never have a steady amount on your paycheck. Primarily personal property impounds. Income fluctuated horribly. The equipment was very nice and modern but you had to hunt for your paycheck. Base salary (minimum wage) or commission, whichever was greater."
bad,"Checked vehicles to ensure that mechanical, safety, and emergency equipment is in good working order."
bad,Swift is a good place to start your driving career but one you get you two years is in run like Ms Silly in the color purple. They don’t value their drivers because it is a training company and they have $.27 a mile driver’s line up out of the door waiting to take your place. The newbie’s don’t understand their worth is that will jump all over that $.27 a mile and they will take whatever Swift dish because they don’t know any better…
bad,Dispatch treats you more like a number than a person. They only care about their loads. It can be a bad situation and they more concerned if the load going to make or not. Dispatch talk to you any kind of way. When in first started it was awesome! Now it sucks!
bad,"This is a good company to start with. Everyone has their own good or bad experience here, mine was an ok one. I started off slow but I was able to change from OTR to local deliveries. Overall easy way to start your career as a commercial driver."
bad,"This job is a very hard life! Away from home weeks even months for a 300-600$ paycheck!.  This job will stress you out completely. Its institutionalized to the point of losing your mind. You will lose your family over this job. Your neighborhood jobs pay more or the same as this one. This company seem like it's on the verge of closing its doors cause they cant afford to pay a decent rate. Owner ops quiting faster than ever, management is quiting just as fast. Its best to look for another job cause this company is finshed put a fork in it."
bad,"Shop is very limited on what they can pay a skill technician. Very clean shop, but pay was and always be a issue. The people I work for and with was great!"
bad,"They claim that safety is a priority but that is a lie. The mechanics are incompetent, the managers refuse to enforce the safety regulations, the company keeps unsafe drivers while firing safe drivers for petty reasons."
bad,"Working at swift started out just fine, but I was unable to come home more than 2 days every two weeks (work 6 days to get 1 day off). This led to extremely high stress and anxiety, lack of sleep, and other health problems including depression and insomnia which made it impossible to continue working such long hours away from my family."
bad,"The money isnt here anymore for the owner operators/lease drivers. The FSC isnt 100% plus the pay rates have been cut. Its impossible to earn a living. Some freight loads are bad not worth hauling. two hours of detention is free for the shipper/receiver the driver dont get paid. No practical miles  losing roughly 200 miles per week unpaid. The truck buyout is 25% above the retail price with 1/3 as a down payment which is impossible for the lease drivers due to the lack of funds being earned with the company.  The lease agreement contract is non negotiable. Your experience has no value within that document. In other words ,  (DRIVER A) has 10 years vs( DRIVER B) who has 10 months experience, both driver will earn the same set rate."
bad,"I have no idea why I was fired I would love to have my job back asap"
bad,"I personally did not care for this company. Out of all the companies I looked at or worked for, this is one of my least favorites. The people in charge of this company y did not care much for the workers, and service was poor."
bad,His very stressful when people don't realize what you go through and every time you try to call for advice or help they don't care that is very unprofessional
bad,"Driving Over the road is very interesting thing when you get the opportunity to see some of the places that you go, and the sites are"
bad,"I worked 14 hour days 3 to 6 weeks at a time, home for 3 to 4 days then back on the road. Management was under a lot of stress and passed it onto the drivers."
bad,"Working at Swift there is much to learn, however the more you know the more they take advantage of you."
bad,"I drove 33000 miles for swift in about 2 1/2 months but I was really hustling and always bugging the dispatch for more, they can't keep you busy all the time and when you get stuck with time left and can't move anywhere for a couple of days then it gets frustrating, also don't expect home time they usually try to keep you out driving for them full time 360 out of 365 days"
bad,"puts you on almost impossible task, really bad about getting you home on the correct date, will keep you in one place and not notify you for several days and the hardest part of the job is management"
bad,"The company does not pay very well, The people are treated poorly, Advancing is very difficult as it stands now. When I first started working for the company , it was not so difficult."
bad,Wasn't what i expected. Can be a good company just don't believe it was good for me. Just becareful on what they say cause their actions n word doesn't match
bad,"If you can meet your financial obligations averaging $400/week take home, then maybe this is a good fit for you and your life situation.  I can't, and my manager didn't seem to care enough to give me more miles even though I mentioned it repeatedly over a six month period."
bad,"Started out being a good job with good management then all went downhill when trucks ""yes trucks"" began to break down. Went through 7 trucks in 2 weeks by then we was losing miles, and never got to hardly go home because couldnt afford it with low miles. We found a manager/facility that we loved and tried to get moved to it then afterwards the original terminal and managment started taking oir miles away and would change oir run every time we got one with descent miles. We got fed up with sitting on side of interstates in Texas during rush hour because our truck was broke down. Mechanics at 4 terminals from gary, indiana to california didnt know how to do anything but check oil and change wiperblades."
bad,"The swift manager I had would only give prime routes to drivers he liked.  Constantly had drivers waiting hours to days without routes.  Manager would only allow 48 hours off after a 3 week run.  Terminal was in Laredo, Texas and home was 5 hours away.  This was counted on time off."
bad,"stressful, lots of tension, management doesn't listen, dangerous, no pits. shift managers did not communicate with eachother. nobody seemed to document anything properly."
bad,Swift is full of great individuals who are miserable in their jobs. Their business model is completely out dated. The company is defined by its founder who is known for his shady dealings. Just check out SEC regarding Swift. Overworked/underpaid. Poor management. No vision. Bad benefits. Terrible technology. Soooo behind the times.
bad,Swift is an ok company to work for if you are a driver - they do not care anything about there regular employees- they dont do raises and the people that has been here a long time like to micro manage you . My location sucks - nasty dirty and no women bathroom at all.
bad,"The management could care less about the Employees, they shove work on you, give little Practical training, and throw you to the Wolves! My lead constantly threw me under the bus, and Criticized EVERYTHING I did, loudly and Rudely questioned Every single action I took, and never gave positive feedback!  Awful commute, LOW Pay, and high KPIs!  Stay away!"
bad,A typical day on the job . I would try to get started as early as possible to maximize my drive time . Throughout my day I would always run iinto the problem of my qualcom shutting completly down in the middle of my trip which made my day/ night longer as I would constantly lose drive time because I would have to pull off the road to wait for the qualcom to regenerate . After sending message after message to my driver manager about the issue not ever getting a response the qualcom would start up periodically before shutting down again and again . This was a typical day working for Swift . Dealing with the faulty equipment and the unprofessionalism every day I wouldnt tell anyone to work for this company.
bad,"So as a newbie here you would think that the experienced employees would offer to help show how things ran around that place. Instead I came in a group of about 5 new people and put in a room where they would ""train"" us one time on how to do our assignment, then put on the floor to find an open desk and work! Not once was I felt welcomed by the older employers. While the company had a lot of calls coming in there were a lot of calls being made out. Therefor being overwhelmed on the first day, the second day some of  us were left without a seat, because of course the newbies didn't have an assigned working space. The most enjoyable part about working there was the fact that I didn't have to quit and they let us all go. Should of known by the way were treated."
bad,I trained for 45 days and then I was on my own. I was over the road for 2 yrs. then I transferred to Target dedicated so I was home every night. I paid $127 a week for insurance and I only made a $144 dollars a day and in 2 yrs. I never got a raise. I asked several times and never got one so it was time to move on.
bad,you are on your own! no help or support from anyone in the swift organization! it's all about swift! good luck! man if ya'll only knew! do the cdl school and get out as soon as you can!
bad,"Was good pay .39 cents per mile.  But I was supposed to be driving team.  In 3 weeks of driving solo they still could'nt get me a team driver.  Instead they just kept me running up and down California.  Wore me out.  They did'nt want to give me home time, cause I got stuck for 3 days in Reno, claimed that used up my home time, like that was my fault.  The truck was in terrrible shape.  I took it straight to the shop when I got it.  Batteries were dead, so I asked them to fix things like the air horn, the mechanic told me, ""It's not a necessary repair""  My qualcom kept failing, luckily I use my rand mcnally 730 or I would have had a really bad time in LA, CA"
bad,"Don't come here to get your CDL. There are so many other companies that offer training, do not do it. You will get stuck here. They offer you just enough money to make it impossible for you to leave, but no where near  competitive pay."
bad,"Where do i start? ill just keep it simple, its Swift way or no way. they will keep you out on the road for months at a time and continue to feed you the same line that their trying to get you closer to home. if you have a family and love them then this is not for you."
bad,"Worked with Swift 5 years and worked my way to a supervisor in operations.  Then the path just stopped.  There was no way to move up because all the good ol' boys were getting the promotions.   Also the irrelevant executives were having new positions created for them to keep them there so the good ol' boys could move into their vacated positions. Hard work will only carry you so far with Swift it then becomes a game of who you know.  I like the company.  I liked my drivers and taking care of them.  Unfortunately Swift seems more interested in the politics inside opposed to taking care of their lower level people and the most important people....the drivers.  Terminals such as Memphis and their way of doing nothing like anyone else in the company made it difficult to work with them.  I like the skills obtained working here, but unless you wish to be stuck in the same position, with an annual 3% raise, for a few years Swift is not the company for longevity.  If you do not wish to advance then Swift is where it's at."
bad,"Communication with drivers and routing miles that a person could make a good living, not the greatest."
bad,deliver food for walmart and unload truck on call after your 10 hour break
bad,I worked for Swift for almost 2 years. The first year and a half I has no problems. The last 4 months my DM gave me less miles each week. Finally after 400 paid miles in a week I quit. This DM would strand me at terminals for 2 or three days and tell me there was no frieght available.  They lie. They tell you if it not safe to drive don't worry about getting the load there late. Then when you pull over because of an ice storm you get a service failure and they will short route you. You also better hope you don't need repairs at the Richmond VA terminal. They work 8 to 5 and close on the weekends. Breakdown at 2:00 on Friday and you will sit till about 5:00 on Monday. 
bad,if loads are available and you are running.
bad,"Going to a costumer picking up a load and delivering on time , it may take me two days to do that."
bad,"The work was great, I enjoyed most days. There were some corporate structure issues, but nothing not typical with a company of that size. It did not end well but that was more of an office politics thing and not representative of my overall experience there."
bad,"Typical day at Swift would be to assist every driver & mentor who comes in depending on his/her problem.  Set them up with their processor, fax paperwork off for them as needed for payments & evals.  Hand out driver testing for upgrade review."
bad,This company is not good for professional drivers with experience it's for beginners and drivers fresh out of school bad company low pay bad management no respect for good drivers please stay away 😝😝.
bad,"The worst company to drive, dont pay vacation, no days off, bad management, low payment CPM, Ocala Florida terminal the people working there are racist"
bad,I mean other then being pulled into scales quite often and sitting a lot there not to bad but they will make every new driver sit and sit and sit unless you tell them to finally get you moving so you can make money
bad,A lot of job without payment. You spend a lot of time on expired trailers inspections. Also several days lost waiting for a load. 1 cent more after 6 months
bad,They will pay for your cdl to start working with them for 1 yr. You'll sit more than drive miles to make money. I sat in Texas for like 3 weeks just to get a load.
bad,"Never got you home on time.  Throwing loads on you when you only have a few hours drive time left. The base manager was a jerk. Pay zip code to zip code, not door to door..   Old trailers"
bad,The pay I was being offered after I had completed their training was not going to be anymore than the training pay I was getting so their was no incentive to stay with them.
bad,Don't waist your time with swift. You are just a number to them. You will not be treated with respect or dignity. They will blame you for anything that goes wrong.
bad,Swift promise me work and miles that they didn't deliver. I was unable to live and pay my bills on what swift was paying me which was not what was promised.
bad,"Training company only, really a decent place to get 6 months experience under your belt. The amount of micromanage was insane alot of sensors turn to hard brake to hard go to fast and camaras watching you. Real unfriendly, non driver oriented environment. Pay scale is a joke."
bad,I was a dedicated driver and would work at a fast pace all day and would still work 14hrs. One day off a week was not nearly enough to recover from the week.
bad,"It's a start company, not a stay company, they will screw you every time you let them but some times they do it anyway, don't work for them there is more starting companies out there that you may end up staying with."
bad,"If you are a hard worker and can deal with being alone and away from home for weeks at a time, this would be a good fit for you.  Swift is big enough to keep you running, but it is also too big to really know you.  Most of the dispatchers and managers are honest and up-front, but a large minority of them are spiteful and not at all helpful.  There seems to be a huge divide between upper management and the front line management.  If you drive a desk at Swift, you are treated very well, but if you drive a truck - not so much.  To put it another way, Driver Appreciation Week is a time for the office staff to enjoy BBQs and have fun, but drivers are not invited."
bad,"Both as a driver and as driver support, you're a number. Management doesn't care about you in the long run. However they're the 900 lb gorilla in the corner. Can't ignore them, but you have to deal with their presence."
bad,This was a okay place to work. they didn't pay well. i'm not sure what all i want to say about this place. they don't always train well but i didn't go thru there school
bad,Fast paced job. busy. Your just a driver code to them. They want to get the most work out of a person for the least amount of pay. I would not recommend this company
bad,"Would have liked to have run more miles."
bad,"The loads never seemed to be consistent, Idle time was a money vacuum."
bad,"leave after 1 year! poor training and you have to beg for loads. Very inconsistent miles week to week.Cut your teeth here and then leave as soon as you can, much better paying jobs out there."
bad,hated it from jump always had to sit kept me on the west coast never could see my family most days off was 3 or four but if you really need to get stared or like to travel this the place for you
bad,"Great training company but not a company for professional drivers who can manage hours, plan efficiently,  ave provide professional service to clients."
bad,"Not true to their contract or verbal with drivers. Trying to force them to drive solo if not ready too. Driver trainers are really not qualified or"
bad,"Poor training and stressful environment. Company does not give drivers benefit of doubt, when issues come up. Swift always gave me bad directions, regardless of it being a pick up, drop off, or live unload."
bad,Company was about the bottom line.  Did not work well with drivers to balance work life.  Equipment was not up to par either and always broke down.  Pay was not great either.
bad,Lots of live loads that last for hours with no detention pay. Very confusing at times. Difficult to find information needed. At times forced to deal with situations on your own.
bad,"Depends a ton on your manager, and your division. OTR pay is horrible, as are the loads. Dedicated Cosco was higher pay, more work, and better home time with local available, but even harder to get than the dedicated account. Corporate micromanages, and relies too heavily upon technology (sensors) that can often be wrong."
bad,It's a good starting company but that's where it ends. They don't have things organized and they make things stressful. When you are on the road driving it's fine but dealing with a shipper through this company can take hrs or days.
bad,My typical day at work was just that. I just went to work and fullfill my duties. The hardest part of the job was working more then 12 hrs. Daily but I completed my shift daily with no hassle. The best part of the job was riding my truck.
bad,"Truck driver adept at navigation and efficient, on-time deliveries. Personable and energetic. Dependable and committed to getting each job done quickly, efficiently, and safely. Over twelve years’ experience in a distribution environment with in-depth knowledge of dot regulations. Looking for a local or daily route in the memphis, tn area."
bad,"I would wake up, log in and start my pre-trip. I would do the full ten hours a day. "
bad,The work when you are new is slow and they will leave you sitting out waiting on a load. the money is not good for the runs you make. They don't like to keep you close to home
bad,"The CDL school cuts corners and LETS you pass. Be lucky and have a good mentor, which I did not. I've had to learn to do other things myself including backing, which can be a pain in the butt sometimes."
bad,Long work hours. Lack of communication. The dispatchers are extremely unorganized. Hard to find an empty trailer in the morning and hard to find parking at the terminal in the evening.
bad,At first it was okay then later on and started just going downhill from there they wouldn't want to pay me for my loads and had a co-driver that was a crackhead we was doing stuff in the truck you shouldn't have been doing and I told him about it and they threatened to fire me for telling on him
bad,Not the best place to work too if you're experienced driver if your new driver and it's a good place to start my don't recommend they're making a long-term career they do not care about drivers future or life outside of work
bad,I do not recommend this company unless your just trying to get your foot in the door. Some of there dedicated accounts are decent if you can get one. There paid time off is below avg.
bad,if your a home body this job is not for you lots of hours on the road and not guaranteed home time small sleeping quarters lots of eating out and if you don't have a load you can be sitting wasting time
bad,night and weekend dispatch is horrible. lack of communication!! would not recommend this company to anyone unless last resort. I will say that they are more than willing to hire new drivers but they allow drivers with little to no experience to train
bad,"The overall size of the company holds many opportunities. Alas, a heavy turnover rate results in many of the support teams being understaffed or underfunded. An excellent stepping stone to bettering a career, but not the company to pursue said career."
bad,"Qualcomm messages are confusing, and the directions are not accurate. Half the loads they send are a waste of time. Driver leaders have problems helping new drivers find solutions to problems."
bad,A typical day working for swift is stressful beyond belief. Management makes if very difficult to do your job as well as several DOT regulations over the road.
bad,They give new drivers a chance at a driving career so thats always a plus to helping people out you learn real quick over there in the couple weeks with a trainer
bad,"This company has very poor communication, and there is no accountability among the in house staff. They treat driver like they're just another number."
bad,Swift is a good company for an entry level driver to start out at. However past about six months Swift's ability to manage you effectively is burdened by the size of the company. There are far to many drivers than there are managers and ultimately the culture is diminished because of this. Wages are an industry low.
bad,"I had a bad company Driver experience here! I was never home on time even with a 2 weeks notice! Always dealing with new management employees and poor trip planning! Never had  had the mileage they promised etc.,.,."
bad,"they suckle! i worked only for 5 months but in that time 58k safe on time accident free miles for what? to be told i turned in my resignation  in a ""TEXT MSG""? Bull Shot!!!! I never resigned but the ""WOMAN"" who work as my dispatch manager said i did and from day one i diddnt like her and her not me. So im out of a job . Also in that 5 months I was promised I'ld only be over the road for 7 days then home for three ... ha ha again bull shot 5 months out and only home 3 nights the entire time. kinda hard for me ... im married as well as own a hobby farm. lotta work to just throw out on your spouse cause dispatch holds a grudge on ya."
bad,"With this company I never went home on time and didnt make alot of money. "
bad,"Orientation was a joke and once you start working for them they will say you get $150 for orientation. This only applies if you live 50 miles or more from their distribution center. Problem is you cant work for them on this account if you live more then 30 miles from them so don't expect to see that money. They will also tell you that you will make $450 a week while doing 5 weeks of training. This was a lie based on my experience and only saw $100 - $150 a week. After my first week after training i got one good check then was making a weekly income of about $350. I stayed because i was loyal and didn't believe in cutting and running. I asked for all the long hauls they had that no one wanted. "
bad,"I went to school and gained my CDLs through Swift and I thank them for that.  My experience with them has not been good at all.  I have been lied to by them, the DM and other professionals do not work for you even though that is their job and everything thing that I paid them for I gained thru my own and experiences.  I know that last statement sounds like, ok, that is what she is suppose to do.  Right!  Example:  I was extremely over weight o my rear tandems by about 2800 lbs.  there was no scales between where I picked up  my load and where I was stopped at the DOT weigh station( mind you this was my first trip and I had mentors that were not concerned about me learning but about the miles so they can get their money)  I sat at the DOT station for 3 days before they sent help and the only reason they sent help is because I was requesting that they repower the load.  so when they sent someone they could not help me and I ended up sitting for 3 more days waiting for a refer unit to move the product.  after all that sitting for 6 and making no money.  They refused to pay me detention or overlay pay.  Because I was trying to stick it out with them.  I stayed with the company anyway and still continued to get screwed in the process."
bad,horrible dispatchers. but my typical cross country trip was usually very ngood. I never had any problems driving the truck nor keeping up with my logs
bad,"I loved my job before Swift took over.  They turned our shop into a micromanagement nightmare and destroyed any enjoyment anyone could have.  My work load barely changed when Swift took control.  It was the demeanor of the higher management, the attitudes of never good enough, the issues with pay among other things."
bad,"They pay good by the mile, however they have broken trucks and do not have good logistics which affect the driver and his salary."
bad,I was not thought they best way possible. They did give me in opportunity by I mostly learned on my own to drive.
bad,slow ride.. lol learn to never do it again management okay co workers are okay the pay was the hardest part about this job the enjoyable part of this job was that I saw more of the states
bad,Satisfied with this company. Would consider working for again.
bad,A lot of planning issues. Co-drivers are cordial. Hardest part of job is waiting for the loads to be ready and then trying to meet deadlines.
bad,"Set a lot losing drive time. Dispatch didn't seem to care if we made any money or not. Co-Driver with my son who was buying his truck through Swift. Lost his truck and his $30,000. investment in it."
bad,the trucks break down a lot. and they take out advance on your check that you never asked for.
bad,Working with Swift has shed light on my own experience such as most of the work environment was based on politics instead of work quality.
bad,A typical day for swift was driving over the road all the time. I never got to see my family. The pay was not great. I drove several freights on pick up  and drop off on time.
bad,"As a truck driver you do not have any life at all its spent on the road or resting.  But, you get to meet many types of people and see many different places."
bad,"A typical day was driving over the road in the full 48 to pickup shipments and deliver to receivers.  Learned a great deal of living on the road and safe driving.  They do not practice what they preach and training was extremely horrible.  The hardest part besides being away from family all the time, was having a trainer tell you one thing, then do another and complain about the way you done it.  For example, he was telling me don't turn yet, turn when I tell you, and when I turned when he told me, he yelled saying your turning to wide.  Nothing enjoyable about this one."
bad,horrible...poor training poor people skills bad safety reccord
bad,"""Managers"" are very unprofessional. Mediocre pay but no overtime or bonuses for local drivers. Good opportunity for advancement to Driver Manager or various other positions with in the company. You are just a number here. I work nearly 70 hours each week, 5 days a week."
bad,"Trucking is a very unforgiving occupation. I had a 99.4% on time rating, yet I was still fired. If you so much as scratch a truck 3 times, your fired. I have seen other driver's do some really bad things and get away with it. I was hit while I was asleep in TN, was forced to drive a truck for more than a month with dangerously faulty steering, etc. It's a difficult job. You pray every day that you survive. It's possibly worse than being a tree service worker, or being a surveyor-in-training almost getting run over in the road as you stand still with a pole in your hand. I was black-balled for 3 very minor accidents that really didn't have to be reported. A deputy sheriff was even present at one scene, and didn't think the accident was necessary to be reported (I had to back the truck out of a >90 degree turn that electronic guidance steered me into. The underside of right fender was scrapped as the truck had to be steered out of a muddy drop off back onto pavement (no road shoulder)."
bad,"I really wish that I could say the Swift cares about their drivers - but as an overall, they don't... trying to get home is ridiculously hard... illness, whether it be you or your family, is low on their priority list... they try to push drivers way beyond the limits of safety in order to move their freight..."
bad,a work day last between 10 and 12 hours. dispatch would send  you on some good runs. 
bad,I drove vans than I started training drivers for them. it wasn't the company for me takine your hard earned money while you out on the road an you wouldn't know why until you call them
bad,"I started with them but never made any money, and my dispacher would not give me miles so I could not even afford to eat so I quit"
bad,"Get up and run your load in safe and timely manner. You get slammed with over a dozen Qualcomm messages that you have to pull over and stop driving to read, or risk someone taking a load off of you. Most often the messages are some ridiculous stuff that does not pertain to you. The driver leads and terminal managers seem clueless and care only about clearing their load boards. The company terminals are dirty, grimy, dingy and full of complaining drivers. If you set your PTA out beyond 10 hours they harass you and push you to run.They don't care about the driver's home time, it's all about the company making money."
bad,Stay away from this company. Out two weeks sometimes longer for 1 day off maybe 2. Break all kinds of promises and planned vacation time.
bad,work as hard as you can and get very little for it.
bad,The company was good the driver trainers are not good
bad,"Call center culture but none of the amenities of a call center. No sound proofing around worker areas, work stress high because of inability to hear but constant pressure to perform. If they could manacle you to a desk, they would. No flex schedules or part time allowed even though it is 24/7 call center. Male dominated management throughout company."
bad,They will push you until something happens then they will fire you!!!
bad,Pickup and deliver loads be out a 7-10 days a weeks averaging about 2000-3000 miles a week going from state to state
bad,"Nice place to work good people,A great place to work for people who dont mind being away from home for months."
bad,I worked here a very long time and if you had a problem it gets resolved professionally within a timely manner. Payroll refuse to fix  common errors and rapid response do absolutely nothing they may have the easiest job they get paid to show up to work and dont work. When we voice are choice they dont post it they call are phone to ask whats the problem knowing thay won't fix it.  Driver Leaders and Management team makes mistakes that cost drivers money and its perfectly ok without no consequences.  Rapid Response is a joke it need to be discontinued its useless.
bad,"They treat you nice at  orientation. Give out the perception that they are one big happy family but once you get that truck, your on your own no one give a ratass  about you. Always fighting to get loads, seems like very time I call my home terminal i just get bounce around to other terminals. If you don’t have a load going into the weekend your screw.  Impossible to get someone on the phone especially on weekends."
bad,"YOU ONLY A NUMBER! It's only good for beginners in CDL just experience. But, this is my personal experience not necessarily saying someone will experience the same. But, being an NUMBER is a fact."
bad,Swift may be a good starting point if you are a student or very inexperienced driver. Get your training and experience and move on to another company that pays you better and values you. Management is indifferent to terrible and to them your just another body to move that truck. Once you have 6months to a year under your belt you can find a much better position some where else
bad,They initially tell you that you are allowed home on certain days. Then when you get to those days they say that you cant because you need to do this job or another when already at the limit of your hours.
bad,"There was a high turnover rate in Swift's Recruiting Department, as demands are unreasonable, primarily because the success of recruiters depends on too many factors out of their control. Success is mostly dependent on whether or not potential new hires follow through and show up (and the hiring demographic is not the most reliable lot to begin with). Also, the rules were set up to encourage competition among recruiters, and many of the more ""savvy"" recruiters would undermine other recruiters in an effort to hire more drivers, because recruiters made the bulk of their salary in commissions, and many managers supported the dishonesty in this practice."
bad,"You would get sent out on a run to another state, and make your delivery but they wouldn't have another trip for you. So you would sit some times up to 3 days waiting on your next delivery. Not moving not making money."
bad,"Management was awful. No time to self constantly on the go."
bad,"Declining workplace culture due to new corporate management from knight transportation. Not an employer that cares about its employees. Bonuses are ""discretionary"" which means only upper management get bonuses. Too many ""managers"" and ""leaders"" in each department. The ONLY positive is the work/life balance. The only reason the work/life balance is enjoyable is because of a recent class action lawsuit against Swift over employees unpaid overtime. Employees received payouts for the backlog of overtime and Swift changed employees from salary to hourly so that overtime can be paid if necessary."
bad,"drove 11 western states pretty much got to go where i wanted to go,went out 3 weeks and got 3 days off.got along with other drivers and with driver managers."
bad,"Get load assigned and start your route. Most loads did not give you enough time to drive to them.  Poor scheduling.  You will to manage your time."
bad,Poorly paid and a lot of back stabbing by coworkers. Would not recommend it's just for starters. Management won't do anything if there are issues with other workers.
bad,"Been with swift for several years and since the end of August for some reason things have changed drastically, to much time on the loads resulting in massive time loss for a driver to be profitable. Mentors are beening forced to train the trainees for free and having to owe the company money at the end of the week. Communication with the terminals are at an all time low with many call ins resulting in being hung up on before even given a chance to talk to anyone. Wait times on hold can reach up to an hour in some cases inless your calling a recruiter and in the event of reaching someone you typically cant get a result that benefits the driver. This use to be an outstanding company to work for but in recent time the drivers are being treated as nothing more then day labor's. You might make a check or you might not."
bad,Pay is below standards for industry. They are also the butt of all jokes in the industry. Treat drivers poorly With impossible expectations. They will not care if you complain they expect you to be on time even if broke down.
bad,I am currently experiencing low pay with refrigerated loads. Spend more time on one load when u should be on to the next one hardly any drop and hook on this side. No sign on bonus for new drivers. I have a good DM but the pay is terrible.
bad,Low wages Long hours no respect towards drivers. Need to put drivers first and increase freight and payment. I am not happy at all with their company ethics and priorities.
bad,they were my first driving job and it was ok got to take wife out with me and we got to see a lot of the states some were so warm and humid then come back this way and was better
bad,when placed into driver training some mentors seemed to want to train by their standards and not follow the swift guidelines
bad,"Did not pay as well I thought it would. As they advertised, the money was not being made to support a family of 4. Missed a couple of holidays and birthdays due to miss scheduling."
bad,"Large company, terminals in most states. Hard to get ahold of anyone when you call, longest Ive waited was 4 hours to speak to my driver manager about my upgrade but my phone died and I spent the next week trying to call them."
bad,"My typical day at work is hauling trailer's with loads to warehouses."
bad,quickly fired and falsified my d.a.c. (hireright) swift has many lawsuits pending so if i want to sue i have to get in line
bad,"not enough training on the quail com system. Not paid on hold over time and when road closed to light load to much loss time. some day's only making 30 dollars, I cannot live on this income the cost of living on the road cost to much . I advise  not to work at Swift starting cpm .25 and in 4 months I was up to .26 and I had all loads on time and driving in all road conditions. Then home time was not  planned and you sent in your home time wanted and they would want to send the wrong direction."
bad,"My review would be this would a good company for unmarried,lonely people because it takes them forever to bring you back home when over the road. at this moment im writing this I've been stuck for 3 days in Nogales,Az. As an owner operator this too much to handle. It is what they say and they're way. Management tell you one thing over the phone and it turns differently."
bad,I made so little money and was away from the family most of the time so it wasn't worth it.
bad,"good if you keep busy,but if you don't it bad,is OK.not a good place to work .ok"
bad,"Daily Route Planning, I learned that the earth is beatiful."
bad,Good for just coming out of truck driving school. If you're not training you not really making any money. Company steady Lie about home time Never get home.
bad,"The life of a trucker does not fit my lifestyle. I enjoy spending time with my family and don't think 3 days a month is enough. They promise big pay, but i was making $40k a year before driving OTR."
bad,"was given a 3 states Nevada, California, and Arizona for 1 month and had to quit for my first pay check was $250 for the first 3 weeks."
bad,"There was no problem with the workload, but communication between drivers and management could be improved."
bad,"If you're just out of school, stay away from Swift. They'll milk you for a few months then get rid of you when you're due a pay raise."
bad,"Care about getting the job done but not caring about you, the employee. Was OK to work for, but when your tractor breaks down, there goes your money. Broke down 4x in a week. Tried to put me in another truck wich was piled high with garbage and everything from the floor to the cieling was black. I wouldnt put a pig in that truck it was that bad. Turned in my keys and left"
bad,Swift is a decent company to work for. Disorganized which makes the job infinite more difficult than it has to be. The use of job aids or documented processes or procedure would make thinks much better
bad,The company dose not pay time and half after 8 hours. If you are the highest paid driver they will cut your hours. The safety department and the camera in the trucks and the radar is B.S.
bad,Poor if no communication with supervisor on local accounts. Company advertising and recruiting becomes deflated when you actually began seeing  what you have for pay and supervision. Sad
bad,"The company was decent, although it was unorganized at times. I’m looking to be more active outside of the truck. I don’t want to sit and drive all day."
bad,"Due to the scheduled pickup & delivery times for the loads, I spend too many hours parked waiting to either pickup or deliver loads. Swift does not compensate driver for this time."
bad,great place to start not stop or continue. and if i may say one thing. this next thing im going to tell you about swift will succsesfuly help me type just the right amount of chr. they suck
bad,You get and automatic or manual truck random pick each day. So you never know what issues you may run into. I have had three service failures due to truck maintenance failure. My inspections could not find an issue with the fuel filter.
bad,"Just a job. Company places little to no emphasis and employees. Most management are stressed out of their minds. "
bad,"Coming to Swift,you should have 1 thing in mind and that is getting at least 6 months otr experience.This is not a long term company their turnover ratio is 1 of the highest in the U.S. You could do as little as 3 months and get out of their!!"
bad,Training was fast paced and hard to follow. Most people who applied for the course ended up failing. It was a difficult job. I am only looking for a part time job driving a car or a truck not a semi.
bad,Not recomended unless you have no other options . Company is to big. Your just a number there. Pay is not good and it is very hard to get your truck worked on.
bad,Poor management . My driver manager could never remember me. He introduced himself five different times during my employment there. I could hardly get in contact withy driver manager.
bad,"Less hometime, no sign in bonus , no team bonus, less miles , less benefits, poor management, no respect to the driver , over all for me not worked it well with the swift"
bad,As a new driver Swift is a very good place to start. I saw all 48 state's in my 1st two years. Biggest problem is slow times and not getting home when I wanted.
bad,"The case at Swift is not how good you are at your job.  What matters is how willing you are to bend the rules in favor of those who have the power over you.  In my specific situation I proved that the computer should validate the data prior to accepting the entry.  That idea was nixed because it forced the user to be aware of what he or she was doing.  In short they rather push the error down the line as long as their ""keystrokes"" were not increased.  What they failed to see was that by allowing the error to get through, it was creating a problem that would require additional resources to track, identify and to fix.  They saved a couple of pennies in the beginning while spending countless hours and resources fixing the error.  You be the judge of this approach."
bad,"Swift transportation is just as you would expect of a entry level truck company. you do not make much money. the truck you are assigned to drive is underpowered. any mistakes made in routing you are your fault. "
bad,"I work at Swift as a driver and office personnel. The terminal leadership treated me like a red headed stepchild because I was a driver before being placed in  the office in any capacity. The load planner on the weekend would do favors for certain drivers, but only after they either bought him food or coffee. I always felt like I had a bullseye on my back when walking in the door. Backstabbing and comments made about leadership and then the backstabbing was kissing leadership behinds."
bad,"Learned many things, the travel was fun, dispatch was not friendly. Dot rules and regulations are tough and one must know them, the drivers I was assigned to were knowledgeable"
bad,the company has issues. doesn't treat the empoyees accordingly. pay is not competitive and advancement is mis guided.
bad,"I enjoy it, mostly. Do not like the fact that they have a no pet policy. So far spent more time away from home than I would like. I am thinking about a job that is local."
bad,Swift recruiting dept turned into a call center. If you can handle working in a call center you can handle Swift. Management definitely show favoritism
bad,This is the inspector gadget company. Indoor cameras monitor every move. If you left your underwear on the the bunk. All of corporate office will see your Sponge Bob drawers. They will fire you for going 65 down hill in the rain. Even though you risk jackknifeing going slower. And you cant have pets. I saw a guy with a poodle and Pomeranian (little lions) he can have them but I can't. Because he is part blind. I didn't know blind people could drive before that. Not a good career. Most companies give a watch if you have no accidents. Not Swift. If you're late one time you lose your watch. Even 30 years accident free.
bad,"Again I enjoyed running the big rigs,but more importantly I also look to get paid for the work  performed...Their's not much to say other than the fact that I was very disappointed with  the settlements I received from swift..."
bad,"On a typical day I spent 8-9 hours driving and 3 or 4 more unpaid hours loading, unloading and filing paperwork. The job security and work availability was excellent, but the amount of unpaid work and high equipment costs just weren't worth being away from home 27 days out of the month."
bad,"They talk a good game and promise the moon but don't deliver.  I spent the last month and a half working about a week or two.  I took every load I was able to take with my hours and log time and still only made 21500.00 my first year.  They promised 30k base to 50k.  They told me I would be kept busy and at time had no loads for 2 weeks.  They promised to get me home every 3 weeks and there was a 3 month stretch I didn't get home.  They also punished you for going home by not giving you loads to get you home.  By the time you get home you are broke and can't afford to stay home for any length of time.  "
bad,"Typically in a days work I receive my assignment between 6-8 AM each day, never know ahead of that time what my destination will be. Sometimes have to wait for longer period 12-24 hrs for a load. Some days short runs 34 miles, 200 miles which end up taking up all my driving hrs because of delivery times and traffic."
bad,Was working for Central Refrigerated then we merged with Swift Trans.  Immediate manager and rest of department very friendly and helpful during merge.
bad,I'm in my early fifties so it's alot to get used to when your used to being in your own bed every night.
bad,"poor worker relations, little home time, next assignment could be days coming, poor benifit package."
bad,"Not the most positive experience overall. Paid per mile not paid for several hours wait time. Not Swifts fault exactly, loading is done by major company we haul for. Either way income equates to about 8.00/ hour"
bad,"The work day started at 7am and ended at 5pm.  I had to learn to work fast and precise to all of my students.  Management is whole othe story in its self.  Management fired at least 12 employees  with in the nine months that I was employeed there.  That is pretty BAD.   The workplace was good to work in, other than when it gets cold.  Your out in it by no choice.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing your students come off the test site with a glow, crying with the white piece of paper in there hand, which was there CDL license in there hand.  It makes you want to cry right along with them.  I love working with people and seeing them blessed with a new begining."
bad,1.00$ a mile dosen't spread to far temporary at swift. The cost of upkeepings and operations while earning 1.00$ a mile recalculates at .30 cpm cant run a business like that how can you take care of yourself your just an employee with his own truck. Getting your own authority is the best thing ever. Dont buy swift equipment its over price and ran down.
bad,"The positive part is the people in the Atlanta office, great attitudes. Other than that, they need to look at their Mentors and make sure they are following company protocol."
bad,The money was good target dedicated 1.32 cpm plus stop pay. Things have changed for the worst. 0.96 cpm is the current rate for lease drivers stop pay reduced also. Different companies share target account in the northeast I took my truck and lease on with a disclosed company that pays 1.45 cpm to do the same job same stores same route.
bad,It's super hot! Inside my mentors truck. I cant even sleep cause it's crazy hot without no air conditioning. I hardly can breathe I refuse to torture myself. inside temperature is above 92 during the night. I'll work anywhere if thiers air conditioning but not here.
bad,"Pay was horrible I was averaging about 260 a week when I left."
bad,"I didn't like that they would lie to you saying there is no loads available."
bad,"fun good job and around the world fun good job low pay and less hours"
bad,"Trucks dont get over 63 miles. When tryjng to keep rolling, rolling slower than everyone or the road. You have to push too hard to make s dollar with them."
bad,"I enjoyed my job, and Co-wrkrs / The stress came from Mgmt, AKA the LDRSP team. They were terrible. Every Sup had a different answer for everything..."
bad,I enjoy my job to an certain degree and I would have like for it to have gotten better but thing don't always go as planned so it was an learning curve in the career
bad,"Its an OK job, They try to pay as little as possible and ask you to do impossible things. There is a huge break down of communication through out, but that's probably typical of any big business."
bad,Planners don't know what they are doing most of the time.  Try to send you out just when you've run out of hours or to the wrong places.  Had a great driver manager but he moved to another dept.  So got stuck with a new mgr. who does not communicate and cant problem solve.  Spend a lot of time waiting for loads and wasting time having to put this old  truck in the shop.  The poor management sucks and they will keep your miles and money low by always giving out short little runs and bad planning.
bad,"This company is full of cons, setting up false fallacies.  When they hire you and then lie about the truck they intentionally, assign you if they want you to fell!  The truck was driving fine but, the company persisted, for me the end my pick up load. As I waited, for JBS to phone early, load.  Instead, I was told to leave the load and B/M the truck to Denver, CO."
bad,"I learned a lot at Swift. Don't let a few bad apples keep you from standing your ground.   If you want a different dispatch let them know. "
bad,Swift could treat their drivers better......Dont depend on one person just because 20 others dont answer their phone to do their job especially on someones off day.
bad,Swift is designed for the truck drivers who are willing to comment a life time of service. The owner/ceo has a program that fits right in with the drivers needs and programing.
bad,"In the summer you'll be in Arizona (Don't idle) in the winter you'll be in the Rockies. Then it's okay to idle. Not for your sake to stay warm, so the fuel doesn't freeze."
bad,"Over the road type work. You sleep in your truck and eat and shower at a truck stop, provided you have money to do so. At time you sit around the yard waiting for a pickup or delivery assignment. This waiting can take several of days. No pay while waiting."
bad,Swift Transportation is not good on working with your schedule. I miss a lot of my appointments. You cant view your check stubs.
bad,If you'd like to spend everyday not know for sure if you're going to have a job tomorrow because the training is that sub-par. This is the place for you.
bad,"lousy pay, 14 hour work days. i needed a job and chose truck driving. i did it for almost a year and i didnt like it. i am sure that if someone likes truck driving that swift is a good place to work. i got lousy pay and had to work 14 hr days."
bad,driver to different states to make your deliveries to dollar general store and your making your stops on time. the long drivers and been away from the house. their were no good parts about the job
bad,"benefits aren't bad, but schedule, pay, equipment, and trucks need improvement. dispatch is pretty good in some parts of the country."
bad,"From the Time I woke to the time I returned home it was a 20 hour day. 7days a week , no weekends, one penny a year raise. Very nice people to work for though."
bad,"Drive 400-500 miles a day "
bad,It was cool at first until new manger came in and the work got slow then they wanted me to go otr but I couldn't cause I just had anew born
bad,"Swift is a Company to where I felt never padded you on the back very often for a job well done.  I ran over 250,000 miles with them as a single driver for two years, had a 99.8% delivery on time percentage without any violations along with no DOT violations.  I was stopped over 5 times for random DOT inspections and had passed all of them.  Now dealing with reports I believe need to be looked at due to the reports do not match the reports of DOT."
bad,There were many things about truck driving that were unmentioned because the trainee is handed a driver who might or might not know what he's doing.
bad,"The day starts with inspecting the truck and trailer, making sure it is safe to drive. Unsually uneventful, I could drive up to 10 hours a day, with a break for lunch in between. I learned how to live on minimal income. I don't believe the business was managed very well. It depends on the terminal. Some were run much smoother than others. Interestingly, Swift does not re-hire. I had no co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when I missed a turn or got lost. It was very difficult to turn around a 70-foot vehicle. The most enjoyable part was that I was able to see the country and observe the beauty of nature."
bad,"My first job as a OTR truck driver. this company was very unorganized. did not teach me anything, this is not a company I would reckamend to anyone"
bad,I'd rather not thank you!. Some times the less said the better and I firmly believe this is one of those times. My friend suggested I go to work for this company.
bad,They felt like they owned you cause you had a local gig but they got me messed up suspended me for turning down one load kiss my hind parts and I went somewhere they appreciate their drivers
bad,"Take's a lone time to get out with the loads,but fun run's and the store's are dam good at unloading,it's a fun job love meeting new people.finding the store's can be hard."
bad,It was an ok starting job. Good training but miles were low for an average Dedicated Truck Driver. I got terminated because safety thought they seen a cellphone device screen lit up in dash camera. it was possible evidence for safety so they still terminated me instead of talking and gathering more evidence about the situation first for solid proof. I worked there for 8 months and terminated me within a week after the dash camera incident at the end.
bad,"I Wasn't prepared for overnight driving.  I worked 3rd shift for 15 hrs, and I know what that can do to a person--and I had no desire to do that again. "
bad,Stressful and hassle place to work.  I don’t want to go backif They still the same. No changes and also I think they will go out of business if they still pay the same .
bad,"typical day looks like, come check the board make sure all the trucks are not targeting late and there are going to make their load on time. answer phone calls assist drivers if they need some fuel, money loaded on their comdata card, assist them if they are having any complications with a customer of any kind. etc."
bad,Being home every night was the best thing about this job. The only thing I didn’t like about this job is poor customer service and having your load on time never happened.
bad,A lot of good information on trucks and the ability to self pace train alot of information on the truck threw web training and also dealer support if you need help.
bad,"the manager is a previous trailer mechanic that still carries on with everyone in such a disrespectful manner but refuses to let anyone talk to him the same way. if you do hes very vindictive and will essentially start the process to move you out or find way to fire you. honestly the job is amazing, but the work environment is awful and causes people to hate their jobs"
bad,Most of the dispatchers have bad attitude they will never get you home on time and believe in letting you sit if you turn down a load the weekend crew is no help at all over the road no money dedicated you might make it the trainers are the only ones getting paid
bad,"Well going to Trans Tech was great. The trainers got you prepared with skills and knowledge. Swift is a good company just not for me, particularly over the road they really don't give you much of an option to be dedicated or local right after school. I'm not with the other life"
bad,its an excellent place to start a career in trucking and to obtain your class A CDL to get the time needed to become a truck driver.
bad,"I would do my pre trip wait to get dispatch for my pick up and go "
bad,"Good place to start, but not to stay. Excellent co drivers and drivers . Need more staff at terminals spent usually 20-30 mins every time u call them to answer the phone.Recruiters lie was promised a dedicated account and was given otr."
bad,stressfull no good mangement no good moral from other employees
bad,to drive make several stops in different states to drive defensively while being behind the wheel of the truck management has to many employees to over see co workers friendly being away from my family is the hardest part of the job most enjoyable seeing the country
bad,The money and hometime was not giving. They lied about alot of things. I wasn't getting paid what they say I was suppose to be getting paid. They said I was supos5to be out two week but kept trying to keep me out for a month.
bad,Was accident free no tickets nothing. Was let go because camera didnt like how I was driving. But the other drivers accidents running off the road rolling trucks. But camera dont prevent it
bad,"I had a good DM but if he was off then weekends, training and such you would not get a run. Planners and csr sucked. They will make a 1 day run last over 2 sometimes 3 days."
bad,"Training was fast paced and included milestones to achieve every Three days. My class had a 80% drop out rate. If you drop out the DO NOT own any money as off 01/2019 and there is no non compete clause. So if you don't mind making $400 dollars a week for a year. It is a good start to a trucking career. The company never makes you drive more then you feel safe to. But you will also have days with no freight in the middle of No where. Mostly a hub based company with limited long haul options, The recruiters usually lie, Mostly lie they get paid when you show up to class."
bad,"Huge company, thats why they use new drivers very easy. Pay is super low, especially first 6 months. they train and give you a coach to drive with. usually only you drive and coach sleeps and gets paid more than you."
bad,Was promised a full-time position in a certain area of driving/transportation; management did not ever intend to place me in that position.  Cutthroat management.
bad,paid every week a lot of hours.  close to home. in arcadia nice trucks nice people home every night many miles don't get paid very well e logs trucks not very clean
bad,"This is a place for newbies to start off, & a place where an owner/ op can make a decent living. If you're a new CDL graduate, expect little info/ support, & be safe or find a different career path."
bad,"a terrible culture of mediocrity...extremely political, getting to the top is all about who you know. organization structure is nonexistent which simply causes chaos"
bad,"There are much better starter companies than Swift to start out with now, don't let them fool you. There are a lot of companies out there now that need drivers and are willing to train more professionally and pay better"
bad,Working for this company was very stressful. I was sent to many locations out of state. The salary was low and the conditions to some of the locations didn't match the finances.
bad,otr starter company. all other companies has swift. trucks slow. had to fight with my drive manager about them messing up paycheck almost every well. was not fun at all
bad,Company does not utilize your service hours very well no communication they worry more about the loads then the drivers safety I would not reccomend this company to my friends
bad,The company is a good company to work for. The pay is fair and the hour the management are very professional .The hours are very long and strenuous ..
bad,"Sure "
bad,The company isn't supportive of its drivers.  The mileage was spotty at best.  There were a lot of issues with the hub I was out of since it was on Wal-Mart property.
bad,"Company is a good place to work as long as the freight is available to run, when the freight slow down so does work. when work pick back up there is money to be made"
bad,would not recommend them to my worst enemy. they give students the bare minimum in training. one of the worst companies to drive for.
bad,Drive to the 1st store 10 hours before appointment time. Unload freight by hand onto rollers that slide packages into stock room. A lot of time. Freight is throwned into trailer.
bad,Swift its an ok place to work but they do not pay good co-worker are cool to work with but no way to grow with company job is not hard to do and hours were ok
bad,had very difficulty getting through to dispatch and getting all the proper information I need to deliver the loads given properly
bad,"Very good front office provide a very good team ,driver managers etc...Keep consistence work etc....A very safe environment for staff."
bad,The staff are hard to work with; some are rude. I worked for six months and then moved on. Do not drive truck anymore. A typical day at work is operating a truck that is broken down or a trailer broken down all the time; spend too much time in the shop. The hard part to deal with is dispatch. The most enjoyable part is traveling and seeing the country. I do not work with co-workers; I operate the truck. I learned that this company enjoys drivers being on down time while trucks are in the shop.
bad,very unorganized and unprofessionally ran. Over 10 managers over you. neither of them anserw they phone when you need to reach them. they all tell u different things that go against what the other says.
bad,I wake up look at where i am going plan it out then drive to location. the hardest part of the job was the hours always on call and not enough personal time. the best part of the job was the traveling.
bad,"What I loved the most about Swift was my driver's, Swift as a whole, is very unfair company, even though I made very nice salary while working for them."
bad,"Watching my fleet manager treat/ talk to the drivers like trash is hard to hold. Long hours no extra incentives. So much to learn and very stressful managing 40 drivers per day .Pray for me while i work here. My co worker's are nosey and nice. However none of them are happy with their jobs. Since switching from Central Refrigerator to Swift a lot of people have quit, and I see why. 10hour days are a beast. Working M-F from 8am-6pm does not leave much time to handle personal business during the day."
bad,"I enjoyed the travel and getting to see all of the new places. The company did it's best to keep me busy but near the end of my employment, they weren't giving me as many runs so I had a lot of down time. It was a good experience but that's about it."
bad,Overall company operations were not bad. Dispatch needed major work and staff could have used better training courses.
bad,"Ok work place. Fun and safe place to work. Highly motivated people"
bad,"Over the road driver Transported, Delivered and picked up merchandize in a timely manner  Maintained a log book of the driving activities to ensure compliance of Department of Transportation"
bad,"driving tractor trailer, started with a Freightliner first six months, gone 3 to 6 weeks at a time. Then a Volvo last six months - sears dedicated 100 to 250 miles runs to sears stores, NYC, NJ, CT, MD,PA, DE. home every weekend."
bad,"Low pay and too responsibility on drivers and not enough support from the base. So I didn't care for it. Was told I would make enough money, and have 3 days home time a month."
bad,Company hires new graduates who have just obtained their cdl. Not too many others will because of the high risk of inexperienced drivers. The starting pay is extremely low due to the lack of experience. When I was hired I was told I would get one day off for every week out on the road. After I was on the road for 8 weeks I asked for home time and they said no more than 3 days.
bad,You will never get home when you want to specially when you ask for the time
bad,"trabajaba de 4 a 13 hs , como trabajaba con 600 perspnas era un poco dificultoso pero de tener una buena comunicacion , ya que por el puesto que tenia debia hablar con la mayoria , lo mas dificil era q tenia muchas responsabilidades a la vez preo por suerte llegaba a cumplir con todo , lo mejor fue q pude tener independencia economica"
bad,"After working for them for a few years, I was tired of no raises and hours that were cut too."
bad,The hardest part about being a Truck Driver you are away from home for 2 to 3 weeks. But what I've learn over there and what I've become is a better driver and learning the driving skills more then I used to.
bad,Would not recommend. They like to complain because you aren't driving enough miles for them and then when you try to get more miles they tell you that there isn't any loads at that time.
bad,I believe it is an excellent place for people new to the transportation industry. Office staff is very driver oriented and they are constantly working to improve. The negative is that the pay isn't great.
bad,"Swift Transportation is a great company for a recent school graduate to work for, because they are a basic company. There are no emergencies at Swift. Swift is not a family friendly company and home time is not guaranteed on the day scheduled.  However, you may take home time in any state you choose by zip code."
bad,"Overall, the company is great as far as the amount of on the road time. I was able to explore states all around the nation. I drove in all weather conditions and appreciated the experience with traveling.  I had an awesome trainer named Ray! I definitely recommend him to anyone."
good,It's a ok company nothing more or less this company works for some drivers not all thats life. If you fall between the cracks of being successful it's the roll of the dice. The pay maybe perfect for some drivers not all. If swift could pay drivers better they probably would or not i cant say. If it doesn't work out for you atleast try everything the company has to offer from flatbed refrigerators dedicated lease if all those dosen't work for you then you must do whats best for your family thats any job cause thats how life works this company is set on how they do things like a stubborn old human they not going to change but make adjustments to make sure business is  flowing
good,This is the worst paying account for owner operator. I couldn't make no money. The rates maybe the lowest for any dedicated accounts on this planet earth .Swift is payin less than .096 cpm. You been warned!! If your an owner operator dont come to target. Slave wages highway robbery. OTR pay 1.020 cpm. Thats were im at.
good,"very hard time getting maintenance done in a timely manner, felt like I was being overcharged for parts, when they were used parts"
good,"2018 under new management team doesn't fit for the drivers but when they removed interacting with load planners it was the end of swift.  Thiers no need for veteran drivers anymore , this place is strictly rookies and less experienced drivers and the pay is 9$ hr broken down by cpm. If you need a CDL it's free at most community colleges. Overall  swift not that bad if you desperately need a job"
good,Ok place to work. There advancement system sucks. This is a place where more vocational students go to work. There advancement program stinks. And you have to
good,Otr company driver for one yr. It was a  good experience seeing the country.ive been to many states and seen many things. I would like to be home every night now I have a daughter to be here for.
good,Enjoyed working with customers and drivers and other co-workers
good,"would not recommend this company to no one, they take more many from you than you make and do not pay you back"
good,If you love being out on the road and seeing the beautiful scenery that
good,Everybody can't be a truck driver this job is killing me the construction the rush hour traffic 4 wheels cutting me over im hard breaking all the time tight right turns forcing traffic to backup and when I shutdown for the day I have 10hrs until I continue driving all over again. This is madness and the paycheck makes me wont to cry of sadness. This CDL is going in the trash not worth it. Much respect to the drivers who mastered this trucking lifestyle I see why a lot of older people do this job they have the patients.
good,No pay raises work 6 days and on call never new the days off took money and no communications between management  managers had there favorite and who gets what as far as loads
good,"Swift was good for a short period of time, the managment really dont care about their drivers , my mother had passed away and during my phone call explaining I needed to be home I was hung up on. The reason was ""everyones mom dies everyday"". I dont recommend this company to anyone."
good,You will work for 16 hours a day on the local accounts with ten-hour shift breaks six days a week and be treated as subhuman if any problems occur. They couldn't care less about employees health
good,Not enough loads to make the time away from home worthwhile. Spend days sitting at a truck stop waiting for a load 500 miles away from home while not getting paid because you're not hauling anything.
good,Drivers are not treated fairly.  Swift continues to make changes with negative impacts to drivers.  Drivers are no longer valued. Most driver leaders can and should do more.
good,Worked on all trucks that needed repair after being on the road. all major and minor repairs from Drive train engines to regular preventative maintenance
good,I was on a regional dedicated Sears route home usually Saturday and Sunday for reset then back at it first thing Monday morning burning clock all day. They use 11 and 14 hour clock to their advantage and burn you out quick. OTR probably isn't as bad but again no personal life.
good,"I really enjoyed the travel through most of the states in this country. Delivering up in the mountains of Washington, to the Dessert of New Mexico."
good,"overall experience has been gained through this they don't prepare you for the things your going to encounter on the road like lack of sleep, shippers needs wants and desires and putting a 53 footer in a 48 footers spot. over all i am grateful for the time i have spent with swift however i just cannot make any money with them as I'm driving to kill myself over 3000 a week and only pulling in max has been 220.00. "
good,didnt know they were hiring for my position. hmm overall memphis terminal is ok to work for. just watch who you talk to and deal with
good,Unsafe and hostile environment. Paring of drivers needs better compatibility studies.
good,As a student driver it was fun to learn but the comp.had some bad management and made pore decisions
good,"spend too much down time waiting on repairs. Live loads and live unloads seem to be targeted at certain employees which kill your drive time.  ??????"
good,"The position was good , provided a  decent income. As for a vacation you were left finding your own replacement while you were out. Meaning you had to plan far in advance. If the was a problem ( HR ) issues forget going there."
good,"First off Do not trust the Planners they will lie and mislead and deny all knowledge of a conversation if there are question marks. Don't let them threaten you neither."
good,"driveing state to state,learning how to manuver around large cities  is a typical day at work.so many dispatchers with not enough mileage behind most loads but fellow drivers help keep you running.staying out for 5 weeks was the hardest and going home for 3 days was the best part"
good,"they have lost the drivers are family touch since knight took over we have been treated like garbage  and lost half our miles and office staff"
good,"Trained drivers on 18 wheelers. Some people should not be behind the wheel of an 80,000 pound truck. Had many students that despite qualifying for a CDL should not have been drivers."
good,"the job is ok but not for me, Job requires to be on the road for long amount of time. the work environment is not that appealing for me personal. just not for me."
good,"For such a large company, to not be able to set a driver up with loads in to and out of an area is inefficient. Driver will have an open window of delivery, inform their dispatcher of their ETA well before the end of that delivery window, and routinely be stuck waiting for another load until after that delivery window expires, even if they dropped off the load many hours earlier. They cut down the miles a driver gets in a week, even though they did finally improve their pay. Going from an average of 2600 miles a week, to barely more than half of that after getting a nice pay raise means nothing."
good,"A good starter company to break into trucking, i had a hard time getting home in a timely manner, freight was decent as long as you are willing to take any load they throw your way."
good,Pick up and delivery of various products and required using enclosed trailers.  From this I learned how to drive a semi truck with trailer.  Management contact limited to daily contact with dispatcher.  Hardest part of this was when required to un-load the shipment as certain locations.  I enjoyed seeing the country.
good,"not knowing when they will change your pay"
good,Company made promises it didn't keep. I was given faulty equipment which almost caused an accident and could have possibly caused my death if it weren't for my quick response.
good,"Hardest part of job knowing your exact expectations as they changed on a day to day basis. ]"
good,Great group of people to work with. Get real life experience of working with the whole P&L.  Finance team are forward thinkers but it is hard to get ideas off the ground
good,Pickup and deliver products to customer in safe manner.  Travel in USA and Canada to deliver products. Driving requires driving in all weather and conditions.
good,I would travel about 500 miles per day. I learned to be more aware of my surroundings for the safety of myself and others. Management advise me of toll booths that I would have to travel through and pay out of my own pocket. The hardest part of my job would be when I didn't get paid and had to have my family western union me money to my current positon in the U.S.
good,"Working for swift transportation was great until driver managers try to tell drivers they can't have "
good,"The upside was lots of scenery, good feelings serving the customer, an the feeling of freedom driving the truck."
good,great place to get your foot in the door of the technition field lots of basic training is offered
good,I would not recommend them . I only made 500 dollars a week and I worked 7 days a week up to 14 hours a day and when I was on my 10 hour break was still called and had many things to do including check truck amd temperature  have truck repairs done  . Felt like I was working all the time at there call and didn't make much
good,Swift is what it is...it's a new driver company...great if you don't have experience in this field....not so much for an experienced driver... So it depends on your situation...
good,Depending on where you’re at.. I’m in the northwest Nd it’s horrible here..  only come if you’re looking for the experience.. just stay away from the coke account.. unless you’re local.. Nd it’s still not enough
good,They want you to work from sun up to sun down when your only aloud to drive so many hours a. Day and when you tell them your out of hours they tell you no you still have 4-6 more hours when you really don't and then they put you on safety hold cuz your in violation and won't let you work until the safety hold is lifted.
good,"supervisor discriminates,  after working hard pay did not reflect the work load and hours. had to get my accounts manager to writ them for them to send my money to me"
good,There trying to change into something they'll never be. They are focused on safety and i get that. There profiling drivers with audio and cameras  losing good loyal drivers.
good,"Dispatchers and driver managers play favorites on load offerings, they excpect you to be awake and available for dispatch 24/7 even if they are aware you havent slept in a couple days. great starter company but get your experience and run"
good,people do not tell the truth so u get what u ask for bad management low wages to many boss most of they time office personal treat us like we are not welcome trash
good,"Honestly its been almost 3 months of me working with this company and overall 1 to 5 stars i give it a 2 they dont care about you."
good,An environment of rudeness where management was unwilling to address long tenure dispatcher. Issues many drivers had were often brought up audibly in open office area in a very unprofessional manner. Phone calls the dispatcher would have with drivers were openly rude and disrespectful.
good,When it comes to big companies your just a number.  The more people they hire the better they look.  Its just a numbers game.  Profit and loss statement looks better than working for this company.
good,"Drive OTR over the 48 states.  Hard to get ahold of dispatch when need to, impossible over the weekends.  Good equipment to work with.  Most are good people, just too many chiefs."
good,"its a hard life, protect yourself if you going to work for swift, they wont throw you down... But if you fall under the bus they will run you over."
good,This company has its ups and downs. Over all it was a job. Why are you making me review this company. Im just filling word count at this moment cause i choose to remain neutral
good,"tanar ambitios cu chef de munca"
good,"Not very organized, great pay if you never go home. have had a lot of down time while out due to receivers rules.  would be more helpful if dispatch disclosed complete information such as unload, lumper fees etc."
good,Nothing the company promised was true. I felt I received a lot of ill will and eventually quit. The company had all these benefits in place. However no help with actually doing them. After sometime I picked up on other things of course. Which lead to me realizing they were not trying to help me be the Driver I wanted to be. Maybe going through their school program is different and you receive more help and information.
good,If you're fresh out of truck driving school. Swift if the place for you. Forget what you have heard about the company all the negatives are NOT true.
good,Been a otr driver 2.5 years now..had 15 trucks  . People inside treat u like trash . Your mile go up and down ever week one week 2100. Next 2800. Then back to 1900... pay check sometimes are wrong u have to wait 2 weeks to 3 weeks for them to fix it right... the computer they put in the trucks break down all the time.. hometime .take more then 4 days off lose your truck.. . U may gross 850 a week . But most of the time it 650 to 500
good,"There was no management backbone at the location I worked at and the drivers had complete control of the terminal. Once you get one complaint against filed with HR you are toast, they will be watching your every move and looking for every insecurity and reason to get rid of you. No job security at all."
good,"Long hours, salary and benefits some holiday work days required  most days are repetitious, little chance for advancement, not enough training sink or swim  it up to you. i do not wish to  review this company any further  it totally up to you what you make of it"
good,don t  give new driver   a chanes  as they  do make mistakes  ran WA . OR. ID.   and was home weekly     other driver were unfriendly   management don't care as long you  were able drive    deliver  to terminal      always hard to fined spot to put trailer     driving to different  palaces
good,lot of work low pay your just a truck number at this company move loads across country. You will have no life 2 days off per month . If you break down you dont get paid.
good,"I was walmart dedicated."
good,"Inspecting the vehicle and driving over the road."
good,Swift is a place for people starting out in the workforce. There is a high turn over rate at this company and they don't invest in their employees.
good,If you : Dont have responsibilitys.....Dont have a wife.....Dont have a life......THIS is the job for you
good,"Driving large vehicles to transport materials to and from specified destinations; inspecting and maintaining vehicle supplies, or equipments such as water, oil, gas, tires, brakes or others to ensure the truck works properly; loading and unloading of trucks; following maps and geographic directions; obeying traffic laws; verifying contents of inventory loads based on shipping documents; presenting receipts or bills; and reporting delays, accidents, traffic, or any mechanical problems of the vehicle"
good,"Not happy with current job, because i,m away from home to much. I only went into truck driving because i really needed a job and i could'nt find any in the machining field."
good,I enjoy working for the company with the people I delt with on a daily basis except Management
good,"Swift is a good training company but, in my opinion not a very good trucking company for experienced drivers. Completely under compensating for all that's required of the driver."
good,"Swift is all about their bottom line and try to push through bad driving conditions just to get their bottom line in the do what it takes to get there not pull off to be safe until the weather passes which is why they have issues keeping drivers always putting them at risk unnecessarily, leadership is ok at best comps is good for beginners getting feet wet  but that’s the best that’s offered, and 29 cpm sad either"
good,management could use some help on being a little nicer. all they need to do is smile.wal-mart management at stores could answer back receiving door a little faster.
good,"Typical day:  Good when I got good runs."
good,"Did 1 year OTR, 1 year regional dedicated and 1 year local dedicated refrigerated. It wasn't all that bad and went through quite a few managers but one bad manager made it unbearable. I would have stayed if that manager had not been given that much power. That particular division most managers are related so your grievances fall on deaf ears."
good,"A driving job is a thing unto itself. Work/life balance is inherently bad and very little if anything is done to make it better... but that is trucking. The things that matter to me are in two basic categories, the training/support/resources given to do my job, the lack of thoughtful consideration in trip planning. First things first... after you do your mentor driver time, there are little to no resources available for when you have.a question come up. If they do exist, they are not anywhere you can find them. A simple fellow driver mentor that takes over for phone calls after the in truck mentorship would be a game changer. Everyone misses and forgets things from class, you  cannot change that reality, especially with brand new drivers. Second - trip planning has a lot of room for development. Sitting at a receiver or supplier is so frustrating and expensive for everyone... not getting driving time because of it is maddening. Having to do a reset in a random parking lot is understandable a time or two... but as a regular occurrence... that is bad planning."
good,"Swift will beat you out money with fraudulent tax schemes & over taxing, etc. They have excellent customers & great equipment. office staff very helpful.  very slow trucks 62 mph will cause accidents , in everyone`s way out on the highways.. Stupid rules enforced.. They`re so big they are not conscious of anything but profit margins.. That`s why they hire mostly inexperienced kids with no CDL.. I give them a thumb`s down.."
good,"A typical day of work was stressfull.  Management required work to be done with minimal overtime.  Management micro manged employes.  Prior management respected the team and allowed the employee to get there job done.  Deadlines for dedicated billing often caused overtime but the unbilled numbers reflected postivly to the time."
good,Could be stressful at times to make sure you got to the client on time.  Location of clients were all over and pickup times varied.  Had to drive to many locations before you could get a regular route.
good,good compamy. just not concerned for employee rights. you are never correct. they have their own employment objectives. overall swift is a fair company to work for. their safety sux because other employee's make you inferior to them. generally the older drivers know more than you do.
good,"its ok, pay is not great but work schedule is very flexible. management could be better. Communication between driver leaders and drivers needs work.."
good,"I drove a lot of miles. I would unload trucks, and reload trucks full of goods for many different businesses/frsnchises. I did get receive benefits, pay was not enough for cost of living in my area"
good,Our team ran dedicated runs.  We had a good on time delivery ratio and we were given loads that was in danger of being late.  Dispatchers from other accounts department would give us runs to try to salvage a on time delivery ration but would no clear it through our dispatcher which created problems in dispatching our loads.  There was no communication between dispatchers as to rotating a driver or team to other areas
good,The job itself is pretty easy. Managed to get into a local account for amazon. Real easy work but the lack of communication from management to drivers is horrible. Which is hurting them in the long run due to drivers leaving from not being told what’s going on and hours being cut.
good,"Very little chance of advancement. Limited dedicated lanes in the area I live. More worried about profits in load, then getting miles for drivers. Very little acknowledgement in safety awards."
good,the compensation was great but the management team was very unprofessional. managers have voiced their frustration on the call center floor and walked out the job.....managers were reprimanded for doing what was right....confidential one on one meetings with employees were discussed with other employees....a manager once could not tell the difference between two employees and discussed pay rate with the wrong employee
good,"Best trucking job I had when I first started and was assigned to a dedicated contract near my home.  Worst trucking job I had when the company cancelled this contract and then lost me in the system.  After a month at the terminal in Greer, SC where I ended up with mechanical problems with the truck, no perdiem and no place to stay, I finally turned in my keys and left.  I found out later that the truck was never repaired and never went out on the road.  My first dispatcher was great in assigning trips and making sure I was OK.  The company, after that, didn't even try to take care of me!"
good,did the driver training program to get my class A license and over the road experience also got to do yard hostling and local driving pulling containers from rail yard
good,don't remember anything specific.. But the put there needs in front of promises they make when it came to home time. they didn't seem very organized when it came to load planning.
good,"Pick up, deliver 53' trailers nationwide. sometimes wait while trailer was loaded and unloaded. Keep an accurate log book of hours worked, To keep in compliance of transportation laws."
good,I started at Swift after getting my CDL at one of their schools. It was a great place to learn the ins and outs of driving. I went on to be an owner operator/lease purchase driver for them. I suggest you do your homework before taking that route.
good,"This was my first CDL job and was a good place to get experience. I was on a semi-dedicated route.  Delivering to Walmart stores in NM, CO and TX.  It was good experience, but not sustainable on their pay scale."
good,"Swift is an alright place to work, they can't seem to get my money right but they did pay for me to get Thermo King certified. I do have job security there but the advancement is a little different."
good,"Iv worked here for many years never receving the top driver ranking ive earned with that come better dispatch ofcourse more pay miles and home time when u ask for it being here this long i should,nt have to ask they should be offering"
good,"Driving for hours at a time. Fatigue is not good, if your tired pull off @ a safe haven and take a rest! Poor management! No communication when you need help with assignments. When you have to sit and wait for your next call to pick up and drop load. Hardly any home time. Going Home!"
good,"They certainly don't think much of you if you don't play their way."
good,"The company put me through training and got me my CDL-A and 4 weeks of mentor training with an excellent driver, then my first 6 months were pretty good, they kept me moving and i often had an average of 1k mile loads."
good,"steady work, strives to best in class great equipment for drivers,still growing , driver friendly motivating annual meeting for upcoming year"
good,"It was not what I expected. The pay was low and I was away from home too much, and for me the work was too dangerous. Others may like this line of work, but I found that it was just not for me."
good,"They train you and set you out on your own but forget that some of the training does not pertain to everyday real life situations."
good,Great over the road experience with lack of opportunity to advance pay.
good,"i been at swift over a year and had an ok experience at swift transportation. trucks run at 61mph well thats what my gps is show and is usually accurate. the dashboard always shows a different mph (65mph) which is not correct lol. had problems recently with bed bugs in the truck or something biting me throughout my body and leaving scars of my itching. grrrrrrrrr and had to leave especially when its cold and very cold outside cant deal with both and not being  "
good,Driver managers and planners do not communicate. Planners do not listen to drivers input and act as if the drivers do not know what they are talking about. Also planners do not always keep track of drivers down time or correct load plans and will send drivers random loads. If the driver is dedicated (i.e. Delivers to Costco or Dollar General) planners will send a random load plans to drivers and say it is a part of their dedicated route when it clearly is not.
good,Nothing entirely special about the company. I've never had a bad truck with them and I've never been off dispatch. Pretty solid.
good,"Company, gives opportunity to succeed in the area; but most of the times as mentor, you have to sacrifice the most of your family life."
good,good company to start. dont expect alot of pay. pretty much starve during training.
good,swift is a great company for beginners and folks who do not own their own truck-to be able to learn the industry and acquire a truck.
good,Like in any big company they have ups and downs.Driving 10 hrs a day and away from alot
good,"this would be a great company to drive for but literally the driver makes the company the most money and is treated the worst , with the lowest pay and the worst equipment , but some how they get the best accounts , so they treated the drivers bad and have alot of turnover and they treat the customers like gold , and that's why Swift has they most inexperienced drivers ."
good,"Met some people that enjoyed the career, but it wasn't for me."
good,Drive 500 miles per day from okc to Arkansas 53ft van. How to drive.
good,OTR is a job for a person who has no ties or anything in their life.
good,"nice place too work if you traveling state to state, meeting and seeing different things"
good,"A good starter company to get your feet wet in the industry. High stress job, fast past. Must be able to multitask. Be able to stay calm in stressful situations."
good,As an over the road driver and professional I could manage my time better than the driver leaders I worked for. But they would not listen to my needs.
good,"I don't recommend truck driving as an occupation because it is unbalanced. The long-haul driver has no time for a life, The work is sedentary, demands long hours, and drivers frequently must work in extremely dangerous conditions. You may not get routed home for months at a time, making it next to impossible to have any semblance of a family life. While Swift is one of the better companies in a notoriously corrupt industry, it is by no means squeaky clean. I am expecting a large check as a member of a class action lawsuit claiming that Swift underpaid thousands of drivers over a period of many years. If you are desperate to cut your living costs and make some money that you will have little opportunity to spend, you can give up your apartment or rent your house out and live in your truck, which is what you will be doing anyway. Starting pay is about $30,000 a year, and goes up with each year. I topped out at 11 years making about $60,000 a year as a driver trainer with Swift. I can't recommend it unless you are desperate and can stand long hours, dangerous conditions, and lots of solitude. You will see what there is to see of the country from behind the wheel. You'll become well acquainted with truck stops and the Swift terminals around the country, none of them worth writing home about. Consider long haul a last resort to be reserved for times of desperate financial need, and as a short-term solution."
good,Swift is a company for getting your experience and then moving on or becoming a trainer. 89% or the trainers are great people and can teach you a lot. The cons of Swift are pay and home time.
good,"I would go months before requesting hometime and then instead of giving me the week off like requested the most I ever got was 3 days. In 11 months I was home a total of 10 days. "
good,"I don't have any special for review in this company. but some  of a few thing I don't like is they did a lot of mistake Exam  pick up the load or, delivery  schedule .extr. not listen to the driver when we right."
good,The only reason this place gets 3 stars from me is because of my Driver manager M.Sadler..he was a very good guy and made me feel like family and not a number!but the company runs like a work horse and pays like the 17 century..had is not been for my driver manager being such a loving and helpful guy I would not have given swift 6months of my families time away from them honestly it’s not worth it
good,This is good start company for someone that hasnt drove commercially before but after about a year the slow trucks and touchy cam events will push you away from them.
good,"Entered as a driver manager in 2003. In going to other locations across the country I found our Terminal Leader here in MN at the time to be a tenured manager who failed in his leadership roles and lost many good leaders in the process. I was lucky to have others within the company recognize my skills and put me into a leadership role where my skills were needed off-site, and had success there."
good,It was good unroll knight and swift merged together.  Now you never know from day to day if your going to have a job or if your going to have a check.  Don't lease on with them you will never see a check.   Its a good starring company bit that's it.
good,"They pay what agreed upon and most loads are drop and hook. Swift don't want to send you home for home time, but they will have you babysit a load for 4 days @ a truck stop in the middle of nowhere,Mn in winter. Summer freight moves you moves, winter not so much,then winter games begin."
good,it was fun to go out and travel to different states and see place's you never seen before and it was alright working there until they did alot of changes then it got bad but it was fun while it lasted.
good,I was a temporary employee working at Swift Transportation so I really can reflect on any of the above questions. It is located in the transportation district of South Phoenix so it is not a very clean environment. The staff was pleasant to work for while I was there.
good,Not sure what happened and the family oriented company became more self serving then helping others achieve goals as a whole. That has been lost for quite some time. Too bad.
good,"Unhappy with swift as an employee.  Lack of communication and poor management.  Low pay and miles not guaranteed . Poor equipment, and slow maintenance."
good,"Training could have been more extensive, students mostly learn by trial and error after they are on their own. This tends to make SWIFT drivers as a whole to be the brunt of a lot of criticism which wears on your self esteem, no matter how successful you are as a SWIFT driver."
good,"A typical day was just driving and making sure loads got there on time, I learned how back up better while I was training. Management could have done a better job making sure things was explained because I was told one thing and it turned out to be something else. The hardest part was having to deal with a trainer who never had a student before,The only enjoyable part I saw parts of the USA I thought I would never see."
good,On road 360 of 365 days a year. Very little home time. If the truck wasn't moving you don't make money. Lease option is terrible for a person with a family.
good,Will not recommend the company. Was a stepping stone to get experience in driving after Marine Corps. My driver leader was a great help getting me my experience.
good,"Like i said in the summary. The reason is this, working at Swift. You can get stuck, working day to day. Look up an haven't accomplished nothing but pay bills. Your salary is going be basic. So you going to have to learn budgeting skills working here. Seriously BUDGET!!!!!!!!!! All in all Ok place to work, day to day routine. Not to many compliants. They tin to just throw you out there. So ask alot of questions."
good,"Plenty of hours around the clock.  You must keep your phone available at all times.  Work was for the most part busy.  Remember to keep a log of each load that you run, and also, keep up with pay.  You may be required to work through holidays as well."
good,"Had a trainer who was angry all the time, I was there to learn. One example how to back up into a dock, only time we practiced was at night. In the dark, in a hurry with poor lighting driver spent alot of watching tv."
good,done company otr driving with them. lots of miles for the most part but i was making only arround 500 a week then ive decided to lease a truck and it was very expensive and eventually i could not make lease payments
good,"it's a great job if your single and have nothing to come home to. sometimes i wish that the dedicated fleet was a lot for considerate. family is and always will be important, to some driver managers and planners your life is irrelevant."
good,"They tell you they have home daily routes.... They do not.  They tell you guarenteed home time.... No it is not. You can earn good money and have a great job at swift if you are ok with being gone all the time. In 5 months I was home 1 night.  Not because I wasn't asking all the time to get home but because they didn't care. Not all Driver Leaders are this way at Swift but mine was. Asked for a change in DL and was told no. For a single person who wants to see the country and live in the truck and stack up his pay it is a great place to work. If you want to have a life outside of trucking, even a small one, then keep looking"
good,Swift is a good company for a single person. Home time is hard to get. Be prepared to work holidays even if your truck does not move you will still be sitting. Common for trucking industry.
good,"I started my truck driving career with Swift. Its a good company to start with, but that about it. The terminal where Im out of is very dirty and ranned down. The management is rude also."
good,"Driver manger was disrespectful, first day I met him, he left a bad impression. starting off they give you a truck thats not that great....I had to pick up my truck that was abandoned"
good,"Many new drivers without experience and it causes problems at work place affecting experienced drivers to have to pick up the pieces; leads to headaches. They also never are willing to talk to their employees, only text, leading to bad communication."
good,not enough hometime this job was not for me. they me out for two months straight. I requested for home time but was not given it. until three weeks later.
good,It was definitely a great learning experience. The pay I was told i would be making wasn't true. I spent a lot of time at trucks stops and rest areas.
good,"As a driver for Swift, I learned how to survive on the road. While the pay was lacking, the experience was fulfilling. I traveled America and saw many places that most Americans only read about."
good,I'm on dedicated account. Work schedule very unpredictable. Typical trucking uniform overall. Never had a pay situation. Overall stable company for sure. Room for progress if your at the right place at the right time.
good,"the most I like about this job and other trucking jobs, is that I get to see other towns and cities, meeting new faces is also fun. driving trucks means distributing goods and food to other parts of the country, which makes me proud to be a driver."
good,good company for inexpereinced drivers they have the miles and they have planty of accounts to chose from. driver mannegers arent that great depends on who you work with. home time sucks
good,Need to more money  away from family and friends  for to long not enough  time at home  not getting paid for all my miles when driving  keep about 100 to 150 miles each week
good,I say be careful with this company they will treat you like dirt. If you don't have a good driver manager will not make good money. They will report anything to your Dac Report even if a tree branch hits your trailer marker light. Worked OTR for 8 Months and ran family dollar dedicated for a year and a half. Dedicated was the way to go for me more of a steady pay check and better mangers.
good,"overall good company to work for, some times management can be overwhelming. great promotions available."
good,Easy place to work but doesn't pay enough. Management needs to be improved. Your responsibilities consists of collecting outstanding Debt from current and former trucker drivers.
good,"I was developing an Iphone framework about logging the user's action, zipping the file and sending it to a server."
good,"As far as company cant really say to much, I stay to myself, preform my job duties as DEL and P/U on time. My DM is very understanding and helps out in all ways she can and can relate to a drivers home time and home life if their family oriented like myself, but its some things  she cant control like getting planners to get you home as u need and as you scheduled. So with that being  said my DM is only person I contact and message."
good,"I have been with Swift for 8.5 years. "
good,"Swift is a great company to start with as far as first obtaining a class a CDL. I earned my CDL via the training in Salt Lake City, and immediately started my OTR training. Once I received my upgrade to my own truck, I quickly realized the pay was terrible. I've earned my OTR experience but currently looking for better."
good,"Working for Swift has been a tough experience, but a good experience as well. I was able to get the proper training and experience for job placement after completing the swift driving academy. However I was seeking financial stability and was not able to get that with little experience."
good,"Swift is not bad  they don't care about anything but keeping trucks on the road , which is ok that's what they do, but when it comes Christmas , thanksgiving, all management will not be there but everyone else is expected to , you are definitely treated as lower class . however it is a great place to build experience because they will just let you work on trucks until there done , you repair everything that is damaged ."
good,Swift will teach you the ins and outs of trucking without question.
good,"get job to start career, just stay focus on your goals, sometimes hard"
good,"I was an independent over the road truck driver whose typical day would begin any time of the day or night. Once hired, I had to learn  problem-solving and coping skills.  Management expected drivers to do what ever it took to get the job done.  The hardest part of my job was not being able to find parking spaces in tight places where there were vehicles on both sides of the street and waiting for clients who did not have their loads ready for pick up on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling to cities and states I had never visited."
good,Management is terrible at most terminals. Got lied to quite a bit from them about loads. Miles were mediocre. Only time i made good money was on a dedicated fleet. DON'T go into the owner division. Just get your driving experience and get out.
good,I drove a big rig for 12 hours a day 5 days a week. I would be out on the road for two to three weeks at a time.
good,"learning to drive semi trucks "
good,"Good miles'"
good,their training was great. they dont treat new drivers thier.
good,"i had lots of fun here but the pay was bad, training terrible and the only way to get ahead was to be willing to break the law. id be sent risky and impossible loads and routinely was a scapegoat for office incompetence. if the office staff were required to be better and the pay were better. it would be a great place"
good,I appreciate the job for its willingness to train guys without experience. Its just unfortunate to have be away from home for so long.
good,"I trained with Swift through Glendale Community College. I completed training and graduated but I received a ticket on my 2nd-to-last day of training. When I called back for my route/schedule I was never given one. They never returned my calls and when they did, it was for someone else. They either dialed the wrong number or misunderstood my name on the several messages I left for the Dispatcher. I knew that ticket cost me the job. I should've known as the New Jersey Highway Patrol Officer laughed and said I wouldn't get the job because of the ticket."
good,Picking up and delivering loads on time. Follow DOT regulations. Driving. Older drivers didn't get the needed miles.
good,• Picked up and delivered freight and containers from pier to customers from seaport.
good,"It is a great company for training and learning the trade but when it cmes to raises, driver policies as to days off and rights, they are not concerned with what their employee's needs are."
good,"not good pay, they cheated me out of 385.00. Give you low trips."
good,I thought I was ready to just drive and make money but theres to much I cant tolerate being over the road
good,the long hours demanded by the company make work/life balance difficult. the company did let me go but i did not object as i was ready to leave. my feelings of the company are not the most positive.
good,Swift is very frustrating at times with regard to communication.  You really cant trust what us told to you as a driver and have to check and recheck information with multiple people.
good,"No perfect trucking company which is understandable. Mainly one issue that i consider unfair and it will leave a sour taste in your mouth until you decide enough is enough. Zipcode to Zipcode pay is the worst thing any trucking company can do to thier drivers its under cutting them out of practical miles, fair enough for a company driver to deal with that But to pay the owner operators/lease Driver Zipcode to Zipcode losing hundreds of dollars on fuel to drive extra miles non paid miles on top of that is not so nice rates. Zipcode to Zipcode need to be outlawed in the trucking industry. It's a form of Free Labor."
good,"If you can't afford trucking school, working for swift is not a bad way to get a CDL. You can ignore the various myths that float about working there. The pay was pretty average compared to other companies, and there are certainly perks to being with a mega carrier. There was never a shortage of miles. If you already have a CDL there are better companies to drive for, but if you need a CDL its not really a bad way to go."
good,Do not want to talk about swift it's not in my best interest to talk about this company I would rather keep my opinion to myself 😉 they have employed me for ten years
good,"I got my CRL through their Academy, so it had no up front costs. That was my MAIN reason for going with Swift. School was fine, but getting on the road after your mentorship is where you really learn. Swift is a LEARNING company. You get your experience, and then you leave. I would not recommend staying past your school being paid off, because by that time, you’ll have so many more and better doors open to you."
good,"The miles were low, the pay was low, and hometime was on-demand-- as in you must demand it loudly. But they were tolerant of my mistakes and superiors were bound by company policy. They are also one of very few companies with a terminal in almost every state. Summation: A good company for beginners. Experienced drivers can do better."
good,It's been a rollercoaster ride with freight across the country as a lease driver I haven't made a profit I cant blame swift but I'm a investor with the company and swift dont  protect us while we're leasing truck from them or allowing us to used the truck for outside work when swift doesn't have work available but we paying a lease on the truck without full rights to operate the truck as what a lease is.  Reducing the truck payment or maybe a free tank of gas once in a while can help alot rather watch your lease drivers struggle under your umbrella swift have the capital to make things temporary better It seem like the owner operator division is coming to a end.
good,"I didn't like it, the course teacher was always yelling, and I got to a point where I needed a job to support my family so I quit. I'm not mad it was just a choice that worked out for me in the long run"
good,Only apply hear if you wanna get your CDL other than that don't bother working here for long. Swift left a bad taste when a DL lied to me about a refer position. So they will lie to you. If you can stomach the bull for a year than do it. Otherwise find something better. The pay here is not good at all. At times the planner gives you trips that are planed late.
good,"get your experience and move on to a better paying company.they will train you, and give you an ok truck, id  say work 6 months and move onto a better company"
good,"To long ago to comment. I can not comment on a company that I haven't worked for in over 25 years. I will say, nothing is the same as when I was employed."
good,working for switft was pretty decent in the begining. as the years went on and lack of raises and no overtime it became very difficult maintain a living wage. the environment was pretty relaxed and comfortable.
good,"For a beginner driver as I was it is a good company to drive for."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, my supervisor was an awesome and great guy to work for, makes for a good work day. Switf is a good starter company for new drivers."
good,"Swift Transportation is not a bad company to start with as a beginner class-a cdl driver,as long as you have a good drive-leader&planners. If you get a bad drive-leader or planners.You may not get the miles you expect to make a descent paycheck.Favoritism is the biggest part.If your liked you'll do fine.Upper management is getting so entrusting in their electronics from their desk computers to truck computers & sensors  they are forgetting that the drivers are Human,they make mistakes,they're not Robots.Driver Safety is Not a concern like they state.Example; Most of Swift's fteet are Frieghtliners,if a driver is in there sleeperburth and something happens in the front of the cab,like a fire.Where can the DRIVER escape.The sleeperburths only have small vents in the side walls. Unlike International-ProStars & Kenworths both having ether large windows or doors to exit from the sleeperburths."
good,Lots of  Oppertoonities for new drivers that have not been in the industry long Need to work On Actual pay for experienced drivers being more comparable
good,company had benefits but were affordable due to pay and i always was driving and never could get time at home or even a dedicated run and tried many attempts
good,"I enjoyed working at  SWIFT, however the terminal manager fired everybody in the shop with over 5 years experience and hired a lower level of worker. The change was to save money although the company was not in financial distress."
good,Es una empresa muy buena aunque te hacen muchos descuentos a la hora de paga.. Y solo te toman por 3 meses a través de agencias
good,Swift is a great place to work if you are just starting out. However as you gain experience compensation and benefits are  typically better at other companies. As far as pay is concerned it's right down the middle of average. Support is lack luster in most cases hold times waiting for particular representatives can be brutal. Perpetual babysitting and micro management quite often slows you down. Realistically it's not much different from most large carriers.
good,Good company but just looking for local job so I can close to my family..fair company and its good for single or retired person..pay for 401k and healthcare...
good,"Its a good company with a lot of energetic young people determined to their work,I enjoyed working on this company very encouraging managarial department."
good,"Fast paced and stressful with pickup and delivery times being so close together for the distance between one another at 61mph and always questioned on why running behind for next load or delivery even with dispatch knowing the reasons why on running behind. "
good,It definitely took a minute for me to get a handle on things and how everything runs and the company lacked that hands on approach that I was looking for. I did find out on my own how to run and make more out of my time
good,I enjoyed working there they treated me great and the only reason I am leaving is I need to be home more than once a month and make money. The pay is NOT good.
good,To much to get used to and just a whole culture shock. You only get one day of for every seven days worked but no more than four days total. Just not a good work life balance.
good,"stressful high stress level poor equipment maintenance"
good,The training is good the only thing i didnt like was that u get about 2 days for family and work about 15 days then another break for home.  And the pay was not that good.
good,Swift was a good starter company to learn how to drive a tractor trailer they always have alot of work but i feel the pay is lower then what they should pay for expierence
good,I feel like this company can have many improvements just as any other company but overall it's pretty decent it mostly depends on who is your DM or if you can get a dedicated route that is good like TJ Max or Wal Mart
good,This job is the single people. Long distances with lots of days builtin and little home time. Management requires  a lot out of the driver. You got to live in a shoe box
good,long days very little communication weak management late on loads school is weak always stuck at terminals no help when you ask for it.  weak maintence department.
good,"I did dedicated WalMart in FL and Target in CA. Walmart in FL was badly paid and had no set schedule. Target in CA was very well paid for a few years but changed to hourly with no OT, also not a set schedule."
good,If you are starting out and need to learn how to drive this is the place. after a year you cost the company too much money so you become relegated to short hauls at 300 miles or less. you will have to run three to five local runs to get a 1000 mile run. you will get in trouble if you call the customer and re negotiate delivery time. a 1000 mile would have 4 days. and a 300 mile run would have three days.
good,not enough hometime this job was not for me. they me out for two months straight. I requested for home time but was not given it. until three weeks later.
good,"if u have a family i would look elsewhere.  little home time, not a family oriented business.  treat u like a number they dont care about your situation whatever it may be."
good,It's not a bad place to work. If you don't mind not being home staying on the road for months at a time it's the perfect place to work for you. The communication with driver managers is not bad.
good,"Pay is well below average for all departments. Opportunities to grow within safety are minimal, however in operations or customer service its open ended. New regulations from department of Labor have opened up the job/life balance. Who you know gets you further than what you know. ""Good Ole Boy"" attitude. A lot of nepotism which seems to protect C players. Hardest part of the job is changing behavior with 2000 drivers without support and accountability of the upper management. Focus on retention a lot of times outweighs focus on safe drivers. Hiring is open to a lot of drivers that have no business having a CDL. Orientation has minimal focus on safety and more on pushing the process through to get a dispatch. Mentoring program although appears to have a lot of accountability, there is minimal follow through when concerns are raised. "
good,I really have nothing to say about this company.  The people are the reason it has such a bad name in the trucking industry. Simply put like any and all trucking companies the problem comes from the lack of communication between Driver and Driver Manager.  Money can be made with this company if your willing to work for it.
good,"es lugar donde uno va rotando costantemente de puesto y a la ves va aprendiendo un poco de todo en la empresa ,uno se adapta a cada puesto, lo negativo el poco crecimiento laboral que hay."
good,I've been with the company for a short time but for the most part it's has been a very hard living. The miles are low and the pay is even lower. There have been several times where I haven't even got paid and couldn't pay my bills. I'm a solo driver. Most of the driver managers are helpful when you can get ahold  of them. It may just be me but a company this size should be able to keep its drivers running and getting paid.
good,The company is a great place to get your toes wet in the industry. You will definitely learn something in your time here. The mentors are not teachers but they will definitely help you learn.
good,"I drove for Swift for 6 months and had a good time there. I was lucky enough to be assigned to a nicer dm who would try her best to meet her drivers needs, whether it was to put in missing pay, getting us home, finding loads, etc. Swift has a strict policy with idle time and fuel consumption for obvious reasons and will not hesitate to tell you what you are doing wrong. Like any large company, there is not a lot of camaraderie and special treatment. Pay could be better."
good,Working here has helped me getting experience in working on cars. The pay is not very good. Lousy pay for long hours. The best part of this job is that you get to work on cars and get to meet new people that love cars too.
good,"benefits are to expensive, recruters lie to get you in, there are miles if you are willing to cut corners and not your full job, and some dispatchers and fleet managers are not the easiest to work with."
good,"sometimes its really good, you keep moving then other times, especially the weekends you sit at a truck stop or chase around for an empty"
good,"Driver support isn't really supportive, they're more people who just try to pass you on to the next person with not really helping."
good,"I was with a previous company for 7 months. I didn't know how good it was until I joined swift. It's a hard life when you do 300-800 mile runs constantly, because you're constantly swapping trailers and therefore waiting on shippers and on deliveries. With my previous company, I would most often go on 1500 mile runs up to 2500 miles - it was truly an OTR 48 states job. Not so with swift! All I got was California and the surrounding area - maybe 6 states total, not even 11. -_- I made more at .31cpm with the previous company than I did with swift at .35cpm. Really, I think I was making minimum wage many days."
good,This is a large company with a lot of accounts all over the US. Expect to get lots of miles and limited home time. I started here with their mentor program which is only as good as the mentor. I was fortunate and had a good mentor but its a 50-50 chance your mentor will be good. The account I was on was a regional dedicated account with 100% driver unload.
good,Organization is well established however the planners could be better at load assignments based on drivers down time etc..  Planners not to take into consideration local loads for OTR drivers thus restricting their earning potential.
good,"You have to trade your life for work. If you love being on the load, this is for you. If you have a family, it's not. Good starter company."
good,"Must be computer literate"
good,Everything is okay if you have an family if not look to change shifts atleast 4 times to make other workers happy and to keep them from quitting
good,"6 days a week, with long days and no weekends off.  Sleep in the truck often, home time very limited."
good,Okay place to work 50 hour weeks rude co worker manager did do a thing about it.
good,Good company to start out with. Neat clean and well organized place. First mentor I worked with was very knowledgeable and taught me tip for driving the road no other mentor taught me. Second one was less so. I could not understand him over his extremely heavy accent. Make matter worse he fell asleep at the wheel more than once nearly driving off the road. Hit hit the rumble strip and did not not wake up at all.
good,"I was able to travel over the road to several states and seen some beautiful sites.  Anyone can learn to back up a trailer to a door or drive in intimidating situations.  Unfortunately the truck did not idle, as I was sleeping and when the outside temperature was hot or cold, it was uncomfortable.   The driver managers would call at times when I was sleeping and was not aware of the hours in my log book to get me to confirm to another load before I knew before I knew how long the load I was on would take.  I made a good effort to keep good records so I didn't break the 70 hour week or 11 hour day law."
good,You may or may not be called into work. Most loads pull out at night on the Walmart account.
good,"They tend to have the worst owner op program on the road today, taking full advantage of desperate drivers trying to move up. They do however offer assistance so long as there is a way for them to profit from an already profiting position. They hold a portion of your money in an account if you go over 10k miles a month but you can keep that money and put it towards your next lease if you plan to own the truck, otherwise it will just accumulate until you do decide to own it. Most of the students that I have seen recently are all lacking in common sense so just because your a mentor does not mean your going to bank. I have been with the company for more then 6 yrs and I have seen some of the most incredibly stupid people come and go. This company is a really good start for people starting out in trucking and not sure where to start. I have noticed that Swift does offer one of the best training programs available for such a cheap price. Swift is at this point profiting from the government and not the avg individual in this case. I have noticed that Swift students appear to be better trained and better suited for the road then any other half fast company out there."
good,job was ok pay was low peaple were fine shift was good hardest part was alot of lifting best part shift was good
good,"You drive 14 hrs a day+"
good,Drive most of the time but on Tuesday and Fridays i un load truck at dollar tree stores I've learned how to manage my hours how to back the trailer  very good how to be reliable get the customer product on time and safe! As far as coworkers i got a lot i work with a lot of people witch is not a problem  i get along with every one. I say the hardest part of my job is to be away from my family but i got to pay the bills and they understand. the most enjoyable part of my job is that i have one. I got my CDL to not be on the road but to work in the oil fields frac job I love to work i am a hard worker not scared to get hands dirty or of heights or bad weather
good,"Receive dispatch"
good,"Jerry Moyes is a legend in the trucking industry, but lightning does not normally strike twice. Swift's management is stuck in a 1990's mindset. Swift's survival is based solely on its size. Swift is poised to be the carrier once management begins to run a 21st century company. "
good,"very exciting when first started out , as time went on learned about changing weather patterns from state to state. Changing weather while learning first hand what it meant to be a commercial drivr was a definate learning experience"
good,I drove various tractor trailer day cabs to rite aid pharmacy stores. Hand unload via pallet jacks. i learned a lot about communicationg with others. The hardest part of the job was having to leave it. My co workers were very soical and always willing to teach me something new about the job. the most enjoyable part about the job was being out on the road and getting to see new places.
good,"Did not make $64,000 a year only brought home $26,000. Could not get home on time and driver manager did not give good mileage in order for me to produce the finances needed to provided for my family."
good,"Great at giving a young trucker an oppurtunity to learn the ropes about trucking. Without swift I wouldn't be where I am as of today. On the other hand pay sucks, long weeks out, and the turnover is a major factor why drivers don't stay if they start you out at 34 cents per mile when your pay increases new drivers will take less and then if your not an owner operator your stuck out."
good,"Being a truck driver is the best part of the job, traveling and seeing the world also great. The hardest parts were being away from home for long periods of time, being in unreliable trucks, breakdowns, filthy etc.. The staff i worked under wasnt great some worst than others but ive learned that this is the life if this is the field you want to pursue."
good,"At Swift Transportation i worked as a safety compliance associate working with recruiters and processing new applicants.The recruiters would bring in new drivers for orientation that was held once a week.I was responsible for making sure all orientation paperwork and DOT docs were in order, checking backgrounds and driving records.I learned alot about the trucking industry and recruitment of new applicants.The Management situation was somewhat poor though. I was assigned to a manager in memphis TN. So the only time i spoke to this person was over email or on the phone. My review yearly for a raise, ( if i was lucky to get one) was conducted by someone who has never met me or seen how i work. To make matters worse, during my 4yrs with the company I had 4 different managers. They always seemed to quit. Operations management in the terminal was of no use either. Whenever I was confronted with a dilemma , onsite management would only help me AFTER they made me feel I was incompetent. When all of them are just ex truck drivers with no form of higher eduaction. My coworkers were a mix of good and bad. When the company hit hard times even the good people i thought were my friends turned to be snakes in the grass just to save their own jobs. The hardest part of the job was being laid off and then being asked to reapply. I reapplied and had to interview for my old job i did for 4yrs ! I wasnt rehired and found out they hired someone else for less money. Who does that? Why lay me off? In my opinion the smart business decision for any company thats need to do cutbacks would be to cut back"
good,"i typical day working is getting your load assighnment and planning your route to deliver frieght. swift has been a good company to me. there are problems there in management that im sure other companys have also,one of there biggest problems are the lack of understanding driver needs most of the managemnt have never drove a truck or even knows what we drivers go thru. but they still demand alot from you no matter what the situation is. i would say 99% off the time if you are involved in a minor to major insident from a scratch on a wheel all the way to a accident they blame the driver for everything even if the authoritys find u at no fault swift wiil fault u for the insident. i am one of the hardest working driver at swift i only get 1-2 days off a month on average somtimes less depending on money.swift is very quick to punish but slow to praise. swift is mostly a training company they dont retain drivers.but there are bright spots here as well very good terminal network good onroad dept and most driver managers are hard working for there drivers if you can find the right dm and a good ded route things will be nice."
good,"Lawsuits abound with this company, very unhappy with them."
good,Good place to work management was very encouraging and motivating for advancement within the company. i have no complaints about the company or job i was assigned
good,"I'm am easy going guy. I've been through some stuff in my life that has taught me to be patient, but jesus you could write a movie about some of the things that have gone wrong. I've been with the company for a couple of months. Yes they have a bad rep. They are better than some."
good,"Learned how to do most basic driver responsibilities, time management, log booking, route studying, and dealing with customers both friendly and irate."
good,"Swift is an interesting place to work always have loads always opportunities to make money, Home time process sucks especially starting off gonna be out m ok months at a time I used to go home every time I got with in the state or 5 hours from my home in Texas make decent money as a starting off truck driver and owner ops make decent lay but alot of expenses are tied in so you practically taking homenabout 65,000 to about 80,000 a year managers are people you have to meet while at terminal to get cool with if not you will struggle like a mf with loads good runs and money they teach you flatbed ,van line and car hauling skills if you are interested lots of hands on experience  opportunities  not a place to end your career or retire from so to speak I left cause I was homesick and got tired of seeing asphalt all darn day try it out you might like it worse part about it is everyone that sees you work for swift will give you a hard time"
good,Started with swift at their CDL school in Waco Georgia very on organized poor training no money. Received my CDL started driving no money average is 400 a week after 3 weeks I got on my own average 600 to 700 a week the only way you can really make money is by selling their gas are stealing their freight. The most of ever made with swift and one week with $900 after driving 2700 miles . Which almost never happens you will receive short mileage loads and you will be sitting at schippers and deliveries 4 hours dispatch has this rule of for every week that you are out you receive one day at home that is a lie there is no official policy about home time which means you go home when ever you want but they will take your truck and they will blackball you to small mileage.and 1 week.
good,Wouldn’t stick to my FMLA paperwork for shorter hours cause of my health  cause they were running me more than anyone else. Punished drivers who turned down loads regardless how many hours you have. Then when they fire you when your wore Down and make 1 mistake in 10 years
good,Upper management is like day and night 3 different answers from 3 different managers I was doing driver manager and on site leader and getting paid state minimum my drivers where awesome my yard guys where awesome but upper was scary and corporate is old school and slow
good,Swift has a problem with hiring drivers as a training co so alot of drivers are new and alot of tickets and accidents driver turn around 7 months to a year plus not sure but swift seems to lay off older office people thank you
good,"Some jobs are just for some people and some for beginners, and some are just right, but for a temporary stay. All else is for every individual to explore the opportunity for themselves."
good,Swift is good for new drivers in my opinion but for the longterm I'm not so sure.  As for hometime it's not very often. Pay is not very stable. Getting consistent work can feel like an uphill battle at times. It could be better if planners planned correctly. There are some good terminals and not so good ones. Holiday pay does not exist but should be given for those who work. Most managers are friendly and work with you but the company seems to ask more but offer less.
good,"It was what you made of it.  Willing to work hard & play the game, you will go far.  "
good,Always busy working on the task at hand. Always being encouraged to get better at what we need to do. Good environment to work with. Must meet goals to make all numbers green.
good,The hours are very bad. It is very stressful they are very  over worked. They got rid all the plants so it smells very bad. I worked really weird hour's and it takes a toll on your health.
good,"I drove to all regions and most states. Seeing the sights was great. They had plenty of loads."
good,"Drive too many hours and only home 4 days a month with $200-$400 a week on average. "
good,ok sometimes no advantage  no raise no bonus no home time no food bucks no new equipment I don't no what else to tell you everything and everyone was sweet
good,"Ok if u really need a job. Fast paced hard work low pay. But overall ok place to work. 30 lunch in lunch room, locker and refrigerater for ur lunch. Where house is hot in summer"
good,"spent 4 to 5 weeks on the road, 95% of time was drop and hooked, loads were ready for pickup, dispatch understood the dot regulations, and was never asked to  go over my hours, was easy to get hold of at all hours at night"
good,"I drove on a dedicated account for a year and liked it. Paid decent for miles and stops, and when I requested time off the dispatchers found a way to get me home when I needed to be home."
good,OTR is a very lonely job. Make sure you get a DM that will get you the miles you need to make that cash. Expect a lot of unpaid off the clock work.  have a firm grasp of the truck laws before you get your an expensive ticket.
good,"* pre trip inspection of truck & trailer, start daily log then pick-up load from shipper, drive 100's of miles or 14 hours per day, arrive at destination to unload, my driver manager was a good guy! "
good,"Swift Transportation was a first job OTR Driver after 20 years lapse of driving. Requalified by completion of CDL testing, DOT physical and background examinations, and attending orientation at Swift Trans in Inver Grove Heights, MN."
good,A great starter company to get your feet wet. I was able to learn all things important about DOT regulations.This company has low standards to hire drivers as it is a place to learn how to drive.
good,My drive leader and office people were always on my side. My truck was excellent and taken care of immediately. Training was very inclusive. The mentor program failed horribly.
good,"A bit stressful due to not knowing if and when the next phone call was going to happen with the next load assignment along with getting assigned to a truck, getting it loaded with personal supplies and pretriped, getting the right paperwork, right trailer, load legal and to all of the delivery stops by a predetermined time"
good,"I would recommend this to a single person or married with no kids. Not someone with a family. There were some weeks I only got 0 on my paycheck for all the miles I went. Some weeks I got 1,000. It depends, it fluctuates. Not good for someone who is depending on a weekly paycheck to make ends meet. And going home was a job, if you needed to be home for a death or holidays or whatever, they will be sneaky and send you to a state on the furtherest side from where you live so you can't go home."
good,"The Pay isn't great but if you work 70+ hours a week you can make a decent living. "
good,"Going into the trucking company, my District Manager worked well with me while I was out on the road. Making sure I was able to get home on time when I requested."
good,The best parts of this company is lost or will soon be lost due to the lack of empathy and care for it's employees. I wish the company would try to retain the good that is left
good,I just couldn't click with my driving leader want something to be home daily and good pay and benefits  just want a change with home daily and good good pay
good,swift gives you a chance to start your class A truck driving career but not the best pay . spend a lot of time away from home for pay that is not well .
good,Swift is a fair company in the trucking business. One of the largest. The only problem i had was management. They need them more than drivers. It is the best with bonuses.
good,its an ok place to work if your single and do not have a social life. if you are married do not go to night shift it will put a very hard strain on your family life
good,Enjoyed going to work. some managers had favorites but if you just did your job it was fine.  Pay could've been better.  Cafeteria was good.  They do do random each month which was fine you just went across the parking lot to clinic to take
good,Forced to drive through 
good,Many of the driver leaders are not even driver they're more concerned with making their money they don't show regards for the employees at least I didn't feel any my driver leader was exceptional but my first two driver leaders there was an experience and most important they never drove before
good,"Swift Management should be accountable as a whole to another. Individual agendas erode professionalism in its management. When individuals abuse their roles of leadership, the abuse is from greed and the results is a form of power replacing leadership."
good,"Swift is good for experience"
good,"Scan and file all paperwork submitted by employees"
good,wages are low to start. they do not give much for yearly increase. You are expected to work 10 hours a day. not a bad place to work if you can handle these things.
good,Swift was a temporary job for me I took this job so I can team with my wife. Only worked for for the summer my dispatcher or as they say never manager she was OK she try to keep me busy and try to get me home on time most of the time.
good,Great for OTR experience. Lots of help available to you at all hours of the day and night. Plenty of customers to help keep your truck moving. Good job.
good,I worked hard at this company. if you had time to take a break you could every time you stopped at a customer to be loaded or unloaded. other wise kept really busy. I learned how to my job very well. I think the hardest part of the job was waiting around to be loaded or unloaded. I did not like waiting around. We would go to train yards and sometimes have to wait on trains for quite a while!
good,"Days are long or nights if thats what you get. Management is hit or miss. You can get a manager that works with and for you, or one that is there to get a check. The hardest part about the job is waiting for a load."
good,"The  experience i had was not bad, i changed company because they started to pay me less. I worked long hours but i didn't make enough money. I think at that time the company was having some financial problems."
good,"As long as you stay a company driver you will and can succeed with Swift. I was a company driver for 1.5 yrs and made a decent pay check, when I became Owner Operator my pay checks doubled but you have to stay out on the road to continue to make that kinds of wage."
good,Working for Swift was very organized and on point. Some days were hectic with a difficult disgruntled driver upset who cold not be hired . Pay could be better .
good,"Awift is a good company, but are not fair to their employees, managers are not supportive to their team, not a lot of room for advancing, they don't take the suggestion that are made in regards to things they have asked, they ask us to share but don't use it or try it."
good,I was a team driver that  was paired with a driver that i had nothing in common with. The DM's are not readily available if you need them through out the night.
good,if you have a family it is really tough being out there for long periods of time. Wish they had something where I can be home everyday and still can make a decent pay check.
good,alright company there is a lot of fine print in contracts. management was fair freight was great never had to worry about not having a load trip planners kept me busy
good,"great coworkers, needs better management in the parts department and customer service is bad when it comes to helping out mechanics getting parts for trucks"
good,"Great Learning experience"
good,"Everything seemed to be ok the first few weeks when "
good,"Entry level job, good learning enviroment. Lack of comunication in terms of middle management...Lots of lack of caring. It may be important to you, but that doesnt mean its important to them."
good,"great place to start with the right trainer, people will give you a hard time but hey a jobs a job. we all have to start out somewhere and I'm happy to say that I had a great trainer that taught me well."
good,"I mean, it's Swift Transportation! If you are thinking about becoming a Truck Driver period, I suggest that you sign on with Swift. They are a pretty decent company to start with. They offer the freight that will send you all 48 states to build your driving experience. I actually started with Swift and gave them 2 years and after that I've been seeing growth in my driving career ever since."
good,"It's a good place to start at the other drivers for the most part were really friendly and nice, the pay's not that good but driving was fun. there was alot of cool places I got to see."
good,"i drove for swift for about 3 years and was treated like a number, not a person.its a great place for driving experence but that's about it.  the communication throughout the company leaves something to be desired"
good,"Not a top paying company, equipment up to date and good for beginning career, learn operation of vehicle and over road training, hardest part of job is getting time off getting home, the best part is you can travel all across the usa and canada"
good,"Trucking is not a great job...it's a decent job that many grow to love. It's not easy in the beginning and like most places no one takes you seriously (read competent) until you've been around at least a year or more with no accidents or service failures. "
good,"They sell you dreams until you actually get there and everything they said or promised is the complete opposite. It was an okay job, my recruiter just mislead me had me thinking this and that but once he got me the bus ticket he could care less about me lol! It all was an learner experience without them I wouldn't know none of what I know today, so I am grateful. Then I didn't know after completing the training it was additional training being out with a mentor for an additional month. That kind of ticked me off but I did what I had to do to better myself and start on my career. I worked for swift for four months but, giving  y family situation I cant afford to be over the road therefore im looking for something local."
good,"I've Learned that Black Ice OTR is alot dangerous than you think..Its an overall good company they just need to find new people to work as the Driver Managers because the swift terminal in Decatur, Ga does not know how to run a successful business."
good,Data enter all work orders for the shop and outside vendors. Assisted at shop desk as a service writer. Help drivers when needed.
good,"Their training program is very thorough.  The dispatches in the dry box department can be chaotic and poorly planned.  Make sure to use common sense and do hesitate to ask questions.  The pay is low, and the trucks are slow.  Office staff (dispatchers) seems to be disengaged from the drivers not knowing what a map looks like so dispatches do not make sense at times.  But it is experience and they do get you behind the wheel."
good,A good company to work for but you will be run over if your not being productive.
good,"to picky about safety rating, speed governors make driving unsafe"
good,Good place to train but not sustain a career.  They have a sense of urgency for getting the job done
good,"Was very impressed with safety culture.  I never ever got pushed to do anything unsafe or illegal."
good,very simple gone two weeks home two days and it sucked. people arent nice and the dm didnt even drive a truck and they tell us they know what we feel
good,"I was working 2 full time positions, I learned Swift does not realize there is Swift Phoenix and then there is the real Swift. 39 other terminals that go above and beyond to make Swift an amazingly successful transportation business. Recruiting is doing more damage than good for a company that strives to be best in class."
good,"I made great money here but there was no balance available for my life. i have a wife and 4 children, driving OTR I missed most of their lives during that time, when I switched to intermodel not enough hours to make the pay cut but lots of time with the family. need something with better balance. I left in January 2013 and went to work for a local company.I enjoy my current job . but we are moving a few states away."
good,OTR ain't for the weak. nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
good,"Drove semi between Texas, and California. Required long hours on the road, little time home and at times, stressful driving conditions."
good,Drove truck to drop point.How to drive in different conditions snow ice etc not to much dealing
good,A typical day of work is driving to the destination of where the frieght needs to be delivered or picked up. I have learned how to drive a tractor trailer & document my daily/weekly destinations with an electronic & paper log. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the different states. The most difficult part of my job is that I am away from my home & family for 14 days at a time & being home only 2-3 days when i am home.
good,Delivery of stock to the Virginia ABC stores and I learned how to route my deliveries to maximize my time. The management was okay and my co-workers we really didn't do much interaction due to the job type. Hardest part was driving in the tight spots and the most enjoyable was be able to see parts of Virginia I had never seen.
good,"Too many people controlling your dispatch/preplans/etc. When one person does something, the do not relay the info to the next person that has to work on it. With this company, you are just a number and highly undervalued for what you do. Even the office staff talks to you like you are trash at most terminals."
good,"I am drive up to 11 hours a day. I am on the raod for days at a time. I have learned that I rather be local driver instead of otr. The hardest part about this job, is getting my trainer to tell me what i need to be learning. he doesn't give me all the information i really need to know. he hasn't helped me do my log book or shown me how to do the log book."
good,"Would live out of the truck for weeks at a time. After packing the truck for a trip out and picking up the load, my days would mostly consist of waking up, having breakfast, then driving and taking breaks for food and restroom. If I ran out of hours, I would stop at a truck stop and go to sleep. When I arrived at the destination for the load, I would go inside to have the papers signed and either disconnect from the trailer or wait for it to be unloaded. The only person I would have contact with would be my driver manager, who would get me the information about the load. The hardest part of the job was the fact that I would only get 1 day at home for every week on the road. I did like traveling and seeing the country, and actually driving is pretty easy."
good,"Wasn't sure what trucking was all about. Had a great driver trainer, became freinds. Got my truck,rough poor shape, bumper hanging, hood all cracked, looked like junk, ran like a beast, hard to sleep in no air,just figured new driver worst truck. It did run good, even out pulled some of the newer ones. Did alot of sitting around waiting for loads not getting any miles, it was close to home but was aways all the time doing nothing."
good,"i was never ho,e but 2 says a month and it is hard to have a family and do that type of job also."
good,The job was very understood and laid out well. Management lacked the respect for their workers. Treated most of them as low life.
good,The pay was good when you first start out but as things went along the pay was really bad because they hire to many drivers for the account there on and not enough loads for one to do a day or week once things slow down plus just felt you cant spent your day off home like you would want because there calling you for a load in the middle of your day of for a load the next day.
good,Great place to work. Friendly environment.  Opportunities for advancement was there. Compensation was ok. stable company to work for . Provided a typical workday
good,I was being rushed to go get late loads had to pay late fees both picking up and delivery.Had refer brake downs.Sometimes took half my day driving around to find trailer.sometimes 6hr to get loaded &8hrs  to get unloaded.Always running out of 70 in 6 days.
good,"Lack of management, and trying to carry to many drivers for one dispatcher, and time between driver leader and person who a sign trip. "
good,"Not bad if you can deal with the phones and fuel stops, must stop at fuel route or call for emergency fuel, fuel card not open, roadside suck, checks are decent, keep you rolling"
good,"swift was my first truck driving job. I was able to become a trainer within a year. the business has a wide variety of work options from local, to regional and long haul."
good,"none my driver manager "
good,The pay. The pay. The pay. Would have to unload the whole truck for $20($10 bucks a stop)....often felt like a crackhead for the work and pay.           M
good,"Swift is a good company to start, they will train you and you will get yr CDL and exp but they will also screw u on yr pay, you will sit for hrs and hrs and not get paid, they only pay you for short miles so if you drive 500 only get paid for 440, checks will be abt 650 after taxes a week for 65 hrs. The trucks are pretty good they are gov at 63 on the pedle and 65 on cruise control. They get things fixed when you need and they will usually get you home on time, they want you to be out 12 days b 4 you can go home. All in all they are alright if yr homeless but the fact they rip u off so badly on yr miles makes me say screw this place"
good,"Overall I would say Swift is a great company to work for. During my employment there, I enjoyed having the flexibility to work without being micro-managed by my supervisor & I learned so much about the industry. However, I feel Swift could improve on its salaries for office employees, offering more incentives to keep its good employees within the company. I also feel like they could make it easier to promote up within the company."
good,"Swift hires a lot of new drivers and that’s how they strive. New drivers are offered all the miles they can handle, but as your pay increases your miles tend to go down. Your loads get shorter, and it feels like they want you to quit."
good,they have many different positions depending on what kind of driver manager you get will tell how much you will like the job I enjoyed the driving part of the job just didnt like the schdualing for some deliveries
good,"Stressful Days "
good,There are many options for advancement with this company and the benefits are great. My only concern is the employee is strictly a number you are not treated as a human being with the company.
good,Only problem not getting the pay promised. If not for that it's a good company to work for. Have nothing bad to say other than that. Would tell one to make sure you get what's promised that's it.
good,The work environment is better than most trucking companies. The engagement committee does a good job of planning activities for the employees. This makes the environment less stressful.
good,"Swift Transportation is good for new or drivers who just finished driving school, they was taking almost everybody. they got training, person is driving with trainer in his truck first couple months, then person start driving by him or her self and earn $0.25 per miles, then in 6 months these person earn already $0.37 per miles."
good,I don't have anything bad to say about Swift Transportation. It was a good company to work for. I learn a lot at Swift Transportation. I enjoy working at Swift
good,i should not have to participate in this survery. this is beyond ridiculous having to fill this out. i am not answering your petty questions. deal with it!
good,Awesome DMVs they find you a load and work with you when you have problems out there on the road for the most part they keep you busy out here on the road you're never sitting in Hardley
good,"Swift is rather a decent company, although there are things they can work on such as when they put you on safety hold due to classes scheduled. I was really impressed with their applications in which a driver can monitor their miles and pay"
good,"I would get dispatched, usually a Costco load that I picked up in the adjacent yard, deliver the load to various Costco stores throughout the state of WA or sometimes OR and Idaho. I would then follow my dispatch to my next assignment, usually a back haul. Even though this job was not considered an over the road job, it kept me away from home most of the week which was very hard on my family. I had a great trainer and to this day keep in contact with him as a friend."
good,"started with my pre trip inspection,then driving to or from product destinations to ensure on time delivery,it was over the road so i learned how to navigate in tough situations,work under high stress,experience in commercial driving and learning d.o.t regulations. the most enjoyable part was meeting people from different parts of the country. the hardest part was never being home to spend time with my family"
good,"When i first went got the job it was challenging but fun. I worked 4 on and 3 off, which i loved. When i got into management i was set up for failure. I should have never left where i was happy at."
good,Most of my days where gravy I think it was stupid once u signed on to the Walmart account u lose so much money but I learned a lot from swift the only thing I really didn't like was the cameras n the truck n also the policy of the speeding cause I been working for swift 4 yrs I never got a traffic ticket or was never n a accident but swift don't care bout that just other stuff they can write u up about
good,"They begrudge you every day you're not rolling. They claim to be all about safety but they're not. And preferences? Forget about them, because they don't even bother to remember!"
good,Management is typically corporate.  Too far away from the head office no attention made for accolades or achievements.  One big problem with pay that was guaranteed and never given.  Worked 3 management positions for a year now with no compensation.  Lack of communication from local management to corporate office.  Or corporate office does not concern themselves with no small issues.  Shop environment and local management is on par with equivalent companies or a little better from my experience.  Most enjoyable part of the job was co workers and attitudes were positive.  Typical day at work involved Shop and Personnel management to keep tractors and trailers up and running to maximum capabilities to deliver product on time and proper amount of equipment to run volume of product needing to be delivered each day.
good,"Driver managers discriminate against company drivers by giving the worst loads ie, worse routes, time consuming customers etc. while giving owner opps great miles and almost exclusively drop and hooks. To add requesting days off 2 weeks in advance doesn't make a difference they will route you wherever whenever without regard for home time. Most terminals are nasty dirty and VERY cheaply made."
good,Was not pleased with the company as a whole. Not a good place to work. Did not treat you as a person only as a number. Work assignments were terrible. No money to be made
good,"Job was pretty easy for me I would say."
good,Swift is a company that will allow anyone to be a trainer without doing a background check on them. Mental evaluations need to be done on potential trainers before they are allowed to have a student on the truck with them.
good,If you like driving and don't mind being gone all the time this is the job for you. As an over the road driver I saw a big chunk of the country. My driver manager was great and always tried to keep me running loads.
good,"Overall seift is not a bad company to drive for. My experiance was pretty awful. The planners always gave me loads that i couldnt deliver on their time scale, every now and again i got a decent load. Lots of sitting around. I was employed before swift and knight merged."
good,"typical work day is busy but i learn new things hourly, i work from home so workplace culture is calm. its hard delivering bad news to vendors.  most enjoyable part is saving on gas working from home."
good,"drive safely, pay attention and don't plan on going home, after a bit you can start making decent money, but you have to keep the truck moving to make money"
good,Swift transportation is a very high stress job.  Every day is very busy and you have to be moving very fast.  When I was hired on I was told that there is a lot of room to move up in the company and now I have realized that the company plays favorites to an extreme point.  Still a very good company to start your career.
good,"Good place to get training and experience with the transportation industry. Aside from the larger company issues like petty gossip, if you just stay focused you will grow."
good,"Swift is a good starter company. Everyone has to start somewhere and this company is a good choice. "
good,Taught me a lot about life an family an safety an patience. An road hazardous. the most  enjoyment i have just being on the road with my team-mate. seeing new state.
good,"Over work their employees. Under paid. Did not allow you to be home with your family. They had a lot of areas in this employer for drivers."
good,"Working on this dollar tree account wasn't what I thought to be.stores are very slow,the  distribution center loads our truck horrible,make it hard for us driver to work."
good,The driver manager i had is a great guy but most of the dispatchers were never on the same page and hard to get along with. Very stressful and treated people with little respect.
good,"Swift is a standard logistics firm, with 26,000 trucks on the road drivers are little more than a number. Freight has its ups and downs, however with Swift it seems to be many more downs, a driver may be going for 3,000 miles a week for two or three weeks, then deal with several weeks down around 1200 miles, most of this is due to poor planning not a lack of freight. I wouldn't tell people not to work for Swift, but I wouldn't encourage them either. As a Driver you are out away from the house for weeks on end, you are guilted into staying out for longer and longer periods between home times. When you do get home it can be difficult to get loads leaving your port of call. Just keep these things in mind. Decent if you are just getting started but would suggest moving away from it once you have a bit of experience."
good,Just like any other bug corporation isn't for all. Pros and cons of course just all about what you will put up with and won't. Simple
good,"A typical work is very simple. First, check your truck before you get on the road to make sure it's safe to operate. Secondly, what I've learned at Swift was how to really be responsible. Management was fairly okay with me I never had any problems and they handle everything very professional. But, it depends on who your driver leader is because they might try to work you too hard and not tell you what's gonna happen in advance. I always see different drivers over the road and for the most part we looked out for each other. The hardest part of the job is when you have a breakdown with your truck, accident, and traffic if you're in a big city at a certain time of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to enjoy traveling all over the United States from city to city meeting new people and also the scenery."
good,great place to work just was not for me I wanted to advance more then what was available to me at the time. fair pay when you start off with the company but as you get promoted your salary does not follow.
good,good job but wasn't honest on most of the things they where saying learned a lot from the job the hardest about the job was the pay
good,"while you are gone for a good month before you can go home, you do receive a good amount of money, all depending on how often you are driving of course, the communication between terminals and the corporate office could use some improvement, however, i enjoyed my time with this company while everything ran smoothly."
good,"If you're lookin to start a new career in trucking, SWIFT ain't too bad. I first started out with USA TRUCK, what a horrible experience!!!. Swift has good-excellent equipment and that matters alot as a rookie.. Their rules are strict and the pay is low, but hey, you're still a rookie and u gotta start somewhere right. Try Swift for a year and move on.. Trucking is a game, learn to play it.."
good,"Daily report, always willing to learn, easy to work with co workers, night call outs, day to day task. Company meeting, training schools."
good,My experience with Swift was fine until they put me on a dedicated account for personal reasons which at the time I thought was great. The account manager I worked for had a horrible attitude and had no concern for drivers safety. When I resigned from Swift they put on file I was terminated.
good,"I liked swift ok, DM was a lunatic who thought he was gods gift to trucking but didn't drive. didn't like all the alarms and warnings etc always going off in the truck and tattlling on you. Got too many critical events etc, didn't like that. Doesn't seem to stop other drivers from doing dumb stuff, I NEVER was in any danger of rolling their truck but electronics blaring all the time, and I hit a pothole in new jersey,, had to be counseled on safety because of that mess. They also forced me into an automatic truck, I hated that heap. I have driven a stick about as long as I have been driving and to me trucking is about the transmission as much as the driving skill."
good,A good place to work for to gain the initial experience needed to move forward. I would recommend to anyone trying to get there foot in the door.
good,"Swift is a good company for someone who has never been an OTR-D."
good,I love being on the road. the only thing is having someone to listen to me. when I have things that isn't working please hear me and check things out.
good,You have several options when working for the company.  You have the option of driving a company owned truck or driving your own personal truck.  There are several companies that you can be a dedicated driver for or you can drive over the road.
good,"Many other trucking companies offer higher mileage and or some other empty promise that they dont intend to keep. The pay is typically the key to anyone's longevity within the company. "
good,I have no comments with regards to this company. There's plenty of work if you stay motivated
good,company dont focus on the drivers. dispatchers are rude and dont care.
good,"Nobody knows when to make a decision about important matters concerning drivers at delivery locations , not enough pay for miles ."
good,good place to work if you like driving a truck.AWDIHBawkDFJBHawdiuoxybaWDJNBawoifduhnAWDOIYBawodiybgADOIFY7HaWD0i7uhAWSDF)io7hAWD097HaecdoifyhAEFD0IHafdOI7HAesfiubh
good,Great company who is fair to their employees. Not much room to advance outside of corporate office in Phoenix!
good,"working for swift was good. spent many years there."
good,Repair equipment for Swift (DOT And Federal Inspection) Learned a lot about trucks and trailers
good,"Driving a flatbed truck OTR consisted of securing different types of materials to the trailer of your truck, inspecting the truck and trailer, completing a log book, driving through weight stations to your destination."
good,"A typical day at work, consisted of tracking customers freight. Dispatching active loads, and coaching new and developing drivers in the work field, with time management Hours of Service, DOT regulations. Covered new and up coming lanes with customers, getting drivers home on time. I learned the industry more in depth from the drivers aspect. Certain areas of management were excellent, where others lacked the commitment to the team. Hardest part of the job was keeping a balance of keeping the customers we serviced happy, and the drivers who kept the company going happy. Most enjoyable part of my job was working with the diverse team I worked with. Also the companionship and bond with the drivers I worked with that became like a huge group of big brothers to me."
good,"If your looking to get into the trucking career Swift is a good company to start with. The training is pretty good and you don't have to know how to drive a truck to get a job. Their are difficulties working for this company, but they are the same difficulties you have with any trucking company."
good,I've was lucky to see parts of america that I never thought to see but I was away from home too much which should me that this is not the career that I thought I would love
good,need better facilities. Driver managers who have never driven have no clue about driver problems on the road
good,good company but i did not like going 6 months straight with out home time.
good,"Regular schedule, occasional weekend work. Some turnaround requires adjusting to new employeees frequently."
good,good job. plenty of travel. nice company to work for. make your own hours. on the road amonth at atime. live in your truck.(sleeperbirth) must have a lot of patience for other drivers
good,"Good steady work, support is fair, slip seating no problems getting maintenance for your truck. In all you must maintain a professional manner. Please read all written materials."
good,Swift has good practices in place to help new drivers learn the trade of being a professional driver. They have a large number of customers to work with and drivers can always be assured that they can continue to have enough work to make good pay
good,Just not a good fit for me never home for the weekend really don’t have much to say they’re not a bad company just not a good fit for me didn’t really see a decent check either
good,Great place to start as  CDL driver but swift on some academy accounts  have dispatchers  that think there to boss of you and make you feel like you have to be unsafe or there cut your hours but great place to start off
good,company is good the only thing about swift is that i got offer to be only in Texas areas and after start driving i got pull to other states and is was not what i was looking for
good,"They asked me in Friday to drive from Gardena to long each to Valencia to Fontana Ca in three hours left on my 70 hours "
good,Swift will help you get your CDL. Good company to start with to get your experience and move on. Trucking isn't  for \everyone so make sure you and your family are ready for the sacrifices.
good,Swift is an okay company when you are first hired on. You get get loads and they will have you running good but once you have been there for a while you start to slow down sit and wait and the home time isn’t what it is and my dispatch couldn’t get me home l.
good,I liked working there for the most part. Great for those just trying to get their foot in the door in the logistics industry. Room for pay growth and management has a disconnect with the workforce
good,It is a good company to start out with. They are forgiving of new people when you make a mistake. They help you to learn from them and grow. Overall a decent place to be.
good,"No practical miles no sign on bonus or safety bonuses no freight over the weekend , It's plenty of favortism going on. What made me come to swift it was the best place to be especially making that money!  They was ranked in the top 10 for best dedicated rates for owner operators not anymore. Swift made some bad decisions where they can no longer pay good rates it's part of business you win some and lose some it's how you bounce back. Things are not the same anymore it feels like a ghost town. All my owner op buddies moved on I feel like I'm part of the last survivors."
good,"Swift is what you make it. Swift is one of those company that what ever you put in to it is what you will get out of it. It is as simple as that. Once you do your year with swift, you can go and drive for anyone in the world."
good,This company wasn't really bad.. only thing I really had a problem with was the pay... dispatch doest hassle you.. and it's very relaxed at this company
good,Miles are the name of the game here some get them like clockwork others starve . Sometimes it's the driver most time it's the drive leader / planner not feeling you. I'll say this once you are in they look out for you but it's a hard row to ho to get there.
good,"I have worked here and I don't mind working, but however I would love to relocate once the opportunity presents it self but I must always be looking for ways to become more successful."
good,"Enjoyed  driving cross country, meeting other drivers  but didn't enjoy waiting days for loads and driving trucks that needed repair and driving in bad weather."
good,Position was eliminated overall enjoyed working at Swift good supportive staff and was a good team in driver services benefits were comparable to other corporations
good,"My mileage was always low seen quite a few 100 dollar weeks sometimes I just wanted to park it and leave, but I stuck in waiting for the pay to get better unfortunately it never did not recommend unless it's just for the experience."
good,This company gave me the experience I needed to further my career in trucking.  It also gave me the opportunity to help new  truckers and train them to become great truck drivers.
good,Swift has a lot of accounts associated with them. Most of the accounts are not offered to new drivers.  The pay is okay when they actually get it right.
good,"Overall, Swift seems a fair company to work for recent grads."
good,Swift was a fairly organized and well thought out operation. Many training facilities. Great communication with drivers. Management appears involved most of the time. They respect all employees.
good,"Loved the job   Multitasking  and attention to detail was a must.  Fast paced and very customer focused   Management was fair and the environment was casual yet professional and very ""family"" feeling"
good,"Had a good CDL training program. Their driver mentor program really helped me get started. However, their OTR management was poor. To many days of no pay between loads."
good,"At first it was a good job, dedicated deliveries, simple enough. Once Swift took over the account from National Freight, the management changed and treated drivers very differently, almost like they were trying to bring in their over the road drivers and get rid of us that had been there prior to them taking over. Micromanaging and the office personnel in charge seemed to become complacent in their jobs and it became very hard to talk to/relate to anyone especially if you had a concern or a problem. If you had a legitimate problem (ex: a breakdown or trailer malfunction) it seemed to take longer than it should for anyone to return your call."
good,Swift doesn’t take home time seriously.  Barely get to see my family gone 2 weeks or more at a time only get two days home. Trucks are always breaking down. The pay is ok.
good,"Swift is a nice company that makes you feel like other drivers are your family,they are a very cultured company that brings different people together to support one another and they keep you busy with work"
good,"Working at Swift was the same as working for any other trucking company. I worked my but off and got payed well enough."
good,"This is a good starting location. After you get experience, you should get out. The miles were never the best, nor was the pay. You don’t actually have a choice where you’re able to go."
good,"Easy to get along with co-workers, and other drivers. They have nice trucks, and trailers. you can get the miles if you want them, comfortable sleepers, extra room in them."
good,"They offer both local and long haul commercial driver positions along with competitive pay and medical, dental, disability, and life benefits for the family."
good,got yelled at for nothing. i learned alot. management just wasnt good. some people are nice. trying to nice to my driver leader. i loved going th US seeing places.
good,"truck driver job, living in your truck, driving all over the usa, eating cheap food, dealing with bad drivers, alone a-lot, missing important events like birthdays and graduations"
good,You can look up the phone if ya got it run it out of the truck I’ll be back rolling in a few hours and then I get to work tomorrow and get your money ready and then you get a chance I’ll give ya money to you get a truck
good,"Looking for a career in mortgage lending, sorry not sure how to delete this job description for swift from this page. I have never worked for Swift, thank you"
good,If your new to the game I would recommend swift do your 1 year or about 2 years and always keep safety frist and you'll do great....to get good loads you will have to keep in contact with your DM manager..... the otr miles suck...and the dedicated account routes are way better then the otr miles...
good,"typical big company with typical large company problems and issues.l          will not work here unless I have bought my own truck, then I would shoot to be a trainer"
good,"Overall as long as your truck wasn't in the shop.....you had steady work. As it goes for management that all depended on who you were working under and how you got along with He/or She."
good,"a typical day starts with you up and ready to accept a load to anywhere in the US but most times you end up waiting until you are tired and just when you feel like its time to take a nap again after waiting for 4-8 hours for a load you hear the Qualcomm beep with a load heading way across town at which time you are tired so you don't accept it because you are now tired again and my motto is safety first. Now as a result of you waiting all day for a load and not getting one while you were up al day waiting the next day you can be sure to receive a good amount of niglet and punishment for you not accepting the load yesterday and then you might just end up sitting for another day before you actually get a load. I remember weeks when I would go home and my check would be $200 plus and my girlfriend at the time who is now my wife would ask me if this is a joke because there is this idea out there that once you drive a truck you are bringing in the big bucks. well, that's not true at all, at least it wasn't back in 2007,2008 nor 2009 while I was driving. at that same time, you had people who were making the same and some who were making much more than I was with the same amount of experience. after some serious research, I found out that my problem was my driver manager. the good thing is I learned and got my experience through the company and for that I'm grateful. the fun part of the job for me was driving from state to state and getting to know America better than almost everyone who was born here or lived here longer than I did."
good,"Good company to work for in the beginning. But, if you ever get hurt, it opens up a whole new can of worms and you can kiss your career or job goodbye."
good,In my opinion everyone has their own comments i experienced a lot. I learned how to drive city to city how to drive in tight areas and get out of tight spots.
good,It is tough enough being away from your family but add the stress of not getting enough trips can be very worrisome.   Some drivers get favorable routes while others scrape by and have to work 6 days which minimizes your quality of life.
good,My truck is broke down more then running. And someone keeps taken the good loads away from me. THEY tell me to go get a load and no trailer there. And my call com never works right
good,"Swift is a good starter company for somebody trying to get into truck driving. My only problem with Swift is that the management don't care about its drivers. You really don't count. After five years of working there I had, had enough of been spoken to as if I was a child. The culture is one of hostility throughout the company from mechanics, trainers, managers and dispatchers who where called driver leaders to make them think they have the power over the drivers.....they used to be called driver managers....but this got down graded to stop all the clashing and arguments with drivers....it didn't work."
good,"No contract, they reneged on the agreed pay.I was told by my driver leader that if I moved to the next dedicated account I would be making 1,200 take home,after he left they kept not paying me what he promised,finally I realised that they were not going to keep their word,so I left."
good,"Transporting freight and delivering over long distances.  Great company to work for. Safety and communication were top priorities. Problems solved with truck and equipment. Very professional staff courteous. Drivers lounge, showers, washer and dryer made available to drivers."
good,"A typical day at work is normal , How to deal with people, great management I learn skill work driving  trucks, friendly staff. No hard part and i  enjoyed the interaction with  staff. also driving across the country was a big experience."
good,It is a production plant you deal with cattle. I was a cooler operate at that time and it kept me very busy. I was in the cooler and I was always pushing cattle onto the rails to run onto the right chains.
good,"Excellent equipment, poor management from the executive branch all the way down through to the terminals. Doesn't seem to realize without the Drivers there is no business."
good,To make money i had to stay out 3.5 weeks and only got home for 3 days. When i was on the lower side of the pay scale i would get a lot of miles but as the pay went up the miles per week went down and the new drivers would get the longer distances. Had a great driver manager to start but he moved to a new position and the replacement cared less about us experienced drivers leaving us sitting a lot waiting for a load
good,It was a ok job. I just wanted to be closer to home. it is ok starting out but if you not use to being away from then its not for you. The pay is ok as well.
good,"Its an over the road company 2-3 weeks out , plenty of options if in the right area.Good equipment , but the use of drive cams is very intense an they are always watching you."
good,Some delivery locations are not designed for 53 ft trailers and a sleeper truck.. an increasing amount of customer locations that take more than 2hrs to unload. Detention pay is totally inadequate.
good,"Becoming a driver was a fair event, no discrimination in orientation."
good,It is a life for those who want to travail. I have been to every state in this country with this company.A travelers dream all you do is drive from one place to another
good,I would have to say they are fair. They will work to solve problems you may have. If your work hard they are there for you. Show up to work everyday. Do your stuff go home and do it all over again
good,This job was new and good experience.  I would recommend this career to anyone young.  This job is for a person that does not have a lot of responsibilities at home.
good,Driving a semi truck is a stressful job and working for a big company is at the top of the stress list bad communication low pay and disrespect is a every day thing when your at the bottom of a billion dollar company but if you can take that you could clime to the top.
good,Over all working at Swift has been a good experience. People are friendly and it's a good work environment. The only reason why I'm looking for new employment is because I need a better paying job.
good,"Very bad. Say for 4 days for 1 mile. Wasted time, left me stranded, horrible pay, bosses didn’t help. Lack of communication and guidance. Planners didn’t allow for hone time"
good,Swift is the largest truckload and LTL company in the world. Others make fun of Swift but the joke is on these detractors. Swift has the best and newest equipment on the road. DOT glosses over them (goes easy) because of their equipment. I would go back if they had any local work in NYC. OTR is hard for some including me so I'm looking for a company locally. It's a great starter and career company for those who are serious about trucking.
good,"Swift Transportation was a good starting company to go through. I aquired my CDL through Swift and was happy to start working for them immediately. quick paced, always moving."
good,"my first trucking company starting off, I didn't know are feel comfortable getting to different location because I didn't buy a navigational device. all in all it was not that bad"
good,Was a good place to work the people I worked with were cool but the starting pay wasn’t good and hard to get a raise.I have heard it has gotten better but that was my experience.
good,"Company is good, but it was not the way the recruiters put it out to be. Company was not forth right with all the information from beginning. Would not have had such a bad overview if the company recruiters had been honest from the start."
good,"I was at the Home Depot contract. Fast paced, stressful at times. Easy drop and hook contract. It is Swift, so you must tolerate being micro managed. Just keep your nose clean."
good,Good place to work. Appropriate for new comers and those that have extremely flexible schedule.  Dispatch is nice and manager is nice and accommodating.
good,The hardest part of this job was dealing with insufficient equipment.  There wasn't good communication between management and drivers.  I wasn't guaranteed to be home each weekend either.
good,It is a great company for beginner drivers for experience but not great for pay in the start. Must be willing to wait about a year or so to see changes in pay.
good,"Stable employment with average to below average pay, not enough employees for the amount of work required, swift transportation does not pay any overtime"
good,"I was driving most of the time, but my number never seems to go down...had differences between myself and trainer...but I really enjoyed the company ,because they seems to be very great company"
good,I learned that you can do anything you put your mind to. The hardest part was staying woken and the management is decent great people to work with and get alone with.
good,"Swift - This was a place to make a start.  I do not recommend it to anyone.  They provided a place to get your 'foot in the door.'  Many of your peers in the industry looked down on your for working there because they felt like you were taking jobs away.  Had one OTR Driver try to run me off the road in Texas.  They abuse you and you feel like you are a slave on wheels."
good,"Its a good company to work for if you live in the city that the yard is in. But I live 125 miles away from the yard, that makes it a little hard on me."
good,Nice trucks. The management was ok but sometimes difficult to work with in times of crisis. The hardest part of the job was talking with the management.
good,Great if you like driving or would like to see the states.  Have to have a understanding family if married.  Most day consist of planing routes and driving
good,Hard working job. Hard labor and very under paid. NO way to climb the ladder. They promote with in the company based on who you know and what you know.
good,"Do everything thats asked of you, dont break things, dont whine, and you will be treated well. Lots of time out away from home, not a great hometime policy"
good,Should have had more time off. Team drove with another man. Had to drive day after day. Hard to get time off and time with family. Got to see the country.
good,Start @ 6AM and the whirlwind doesn't stop until 4 or 5pm. Day flies by. Learning new things everyday that keep you coming back to know more and get better. Seeing you make an impact on drivers lives is the most fulfilling thing.
good,Swift is a good company. They are willing to work with you as far as providing loads that work with your schedule. Pay is average. The trucks are maintained often and in a timely manner.
good,a work day was10 to 12 hours. I learned that I really don't like driving  a truck very much. management was alright. I liked being off nights and weekends.
good,"Had typical day driving truck over the road, driving in various weather conditions & hauling freight.  Hardest part of job was driving in the horrible weather"
good,Just really don't have anything to say about Swift other than I didn't stay long enough to get a great fill for the place.  They do monitor everything you do.. inside the truck and while you are driving.
good,Driving OTR is overwhelming for someone with a family because you spend a lot of time on the road. But if you like to travel and don't have a family at home then this may be the job for you.
good,"Working for Swift, operating new equipment, any problems on the road were reported to dispatch and they always took care of the problem.  Any layovers, they paid per-diem, all and all I was happy with the pay."
good,"Swift isn’t a bad company just some of the dispatchers are stressful. Some of them will not provide you with the miles you need to make money, but some of them will give you the miles I recommend staying as a company driver and not doing a lease because that is when you will stop making money and your miles will get really low...."
good,Very stressful.  The worst part of this driving was trying to find a place to stop at the end of the driving day. Truck stops are sometimes full. Rest areas do not have showers and a place to get something to eat.
good,"This is a good place to started off working when you first get your CDL, They have good training to help you learn how to handle the truck. I like Swift my self"
good,"Is a decent company if you get lucky to get on a dedicated route, does have cameras facing drivers which is not ideal, maintenance depts are terrible."
good,"Swift has lots of miles for drivers who want to work but I suggest moving on after a couple of years. They are so big that you are kind of lost in the shuffle and other than your driver manager you are just a number and are expendable because of the high turnover rate. Good company to get experience, nothing more."
good,"Busy environment. All corporate offices are in AZ, so there wasn't much of a career ladder in our office, however, we did create some new departments and positions in the time I was there."
good,A typical day involved assisting drivers with their daily needs. I learned the various aspects of the trucking industry. I enjoyed the relationships that I built with the drivers.
good,I got the proper skills through the training school .160 hours or 6-8 weeks then out with a mentor for 4-5 weeks.I was ready to drive confidently on my own.
good,I recommend swift to everyone to at least try for themselves and make their own decisions. If you love driving and seeing new places then get on board.
good,Its ok if you want a truck driving career a train here. Its a job where you will not get paid low mileage because its a large company and there are a lot of drivers that work here. You will get a load by your location and sometimes have to wait until you get one.
good,We signed contracts yet they were only binding for us no tthe company. Our commissions were changed a few times and then taken away all together. We were promised job growth and advancement possibilities but non of that happens because we are a satellite office.
good,"Great starter job"
good,I was impressed with Swift at first then someone higher up made REALLY bad decisions and it affected the loads from being picked up or delivered on time which affects the driver.
good,This is a very good place to work every body is very friendly and nice safity is the number one thing here which is very very good for trucking company
good,Good people great atmosphere.  everyone is always friendly and treats you like family.  Very nice environment to work in and office is located in a great place
good,"It was a good company but the miles where short , I was promised so many miles and they did not come through with what they promised,  like home time was a pain to get off."
good,"not enough pay and you hardlyget to go home on requested hometime..long runs,low pay.. never will I ever go back to Swift, unless pay scale is up a littlehich pppp more .. long hauls, bad dispatchers..."
good,Office environment was very stressful and everyone was after each other to blame someone for one thing or another. Not a team oriented place. The terminal manager would come up with improvement idea's but then would never implement them.
good,they have lots of freight but the driver managers could communicate with drivers more. Also the time consuming portion is the loading and unloading of the loads.
good,A fast paced setting with lots of person to person interaction. High volume work load. The ability to work within team is needed. Good communication skills are a must.
good,"Lack of Leadership support. I had a weeks training and basically self taught myself the system and operational roles need for this position. "
good,Swift operates on a contract basis. Swift lost the Home Depot flatbed delivery contract of which I was working under. they knew from the point of application that I wanted the morning shift and I was hired leading me to think I was working mornings. That was not the case. They stuck me with the night shift always telling me that it was not for long. Well a year went by and I was still on the night shift. that was poor management.
good,They are a good starter company my business manager was the best but was ok they kept there equipment maintained a lot of there freight was live load and unload
good,"overall it is a decent place to work but the rules constantly change ,safety is priority only if it doesn't cost anything.the hardest part of the job is dealing with so many different things at the same time it sometimes is overwhelming."
good,The job was not bad at all. I just needed something local with more home time. The owner/operator I trained under was great and very hands on during the training.
good,"swift Transportation prepares you for what you don't want to put up with in trucking. But if you could just be able to stay there for six months you will be prepared for a better company. You will get the miles, you will drive in some area that I think new drivers should not be. The pay is ok this company takes a lot of hidden fees."
good,Swift trandpostation was a god company but i wasn't getting the experience i need to better my career as a diesel mechanic at the fuel island and it was hard to transfer to shop
good,they are a great starter company for those just starting out in the truck driving job force. the hardest part is manageing your time to match loading an delevering there loads
good,I initially started with company in training mode for over the road driver which I did for 6 months but company saw my resume and felt better suited for Driver Manager role. Most rewarding to keep drivers moving by seeking out freight in locations throughout the USA
good,"Basically any driving job could be stressful, depending on traffic, construction, and weather conditions."
good,Ok it was a good experience jus no money to start very low training pay could of been a lot better other than that it was ok and the training mentor was nasty
good,Ran intermodal job was ok pay could have been better as well as some dispatchers. But overall if you are looking some local work this would be a good choice
good,Its an alright company to get your start in trucking. I went through their schooling program and paid off my school loan by working for them. Got to see many places and meet new people.
good,The people that I worked with were great! The problem that I had was that I would have issues with the trucks that I kept having to change into. Since I wasn't an over the road driver I would get what ever junk was available.
good,was a good job to get my foot in the door in the trucking industry long hours with not a lot of pay for the industry mangers don't fight for there staff
good,"My manager was overly critical, would feel the need to find something wrong with your performance if you were recommended for an award by another department. If you made your job look too easy my boss would take it away from you add it to her plate get stressed out give it back to you and then dictate a completely opposite program on how to get it done. Simple processes that most companies have today to make work easier faster they do not have in place yet. Most of the Department's I worked with were fantastic easygoing and great to work with however the accounting department that received all the debt for the company was the most stressful most unorganized and the most unreasonable bosses I've ever worked for."
good,Trucking requires you to live on the road in the sleeper truck 3 to 6 weeks at a time.  It is nice to see the country and the scenery but was too long away from home
good,I had a good time learning how to be a trucker. I traveled ocean to ocean and border to border. I met all sorts of interesting people and really got a taste of Americana.
good,"There were too many stress raising regulations, I found unnecessary on top of the Department Of Transportation's regulations. Not enough runs, most enjoyable to me was completing a one thousand or more mile run and getting another good run, (700 miles or more) right behind it. Learned to enhance my patience level."
good,"this reviewing to submit an application on indeed is very stupid and if I continue to have to do these surveys i will stop using indeed, so lets hope this it"
good,A good company to work for and grow with. Room for advancement; may require you to relocate. I have worked at Swift for over 10 years; it's a solid company to work for.
good,The good thing is SAFETY..Safety is first priority to the shop and to everyone else around us. Salary is another story and they don't keep their promises..
good,"Not as terribly corrupt as most car sales places, I can say it's a real shame that this place closed down. The owner was actually a pretty good person, and I'm sorry I wasn't any better at selling cars."
good,"this is the place where a driver does their time in the seat to get experience.  it can be unfair at times, but also a pretty decent place to get their experience."
good,wide variety of hours and trucking loads to be expected.  Regional work available to be home weekends for valuable family time.  Management is understanding if you have responsibilities and need to be home for important appointments.
good,Great company to start a career. OTR with plenty of loads once you've been there past 6 months. Great pay and benefits. Great job to have if your single with no kids.
good,"When I started with Swift things were a lot different than they are now. Now it seems like all management cares about is numbers. They are less worried about quality repairs. As with anywhere else management have favorites. They are constantly breathing down your neck with questions like ""What are you doing right now""  when you're obviously turning a wrench on a truck. Expectations are always changing so be prepared to be told you are doing something wrong constantly. Upper management steps over shop managers and foreman. Don't be surprised if upper management comes out in the shop and starts giving orders."
good,"riding alone, enjoyed seeing different places, dispatch keep me rolling, the atmosphere at the terminals was good. the hardest part of the day was getting up. the best part of the job was when you got home for your days off."
good,swift transportation is ok but they do not get u home all the time.And they could work on management.thier dispatchers are very ruid and do not car about you.all I can say is if u want to be lid to go to swift
good,Exciting job got to see the country and meet different people was a really great experience in itself learned a lot about truck driving.the only downside was not enough home time.
good,here you will just have to go there and get into the right department or don't sign up at all if you're looking for freedom try another company. Well you want me to give you information I don't have so apply and see for yourself
good,"It's a nice starter company to get your experience needed. If you put in the effort to drive the miles and prove yourself, you can receive that paycheck that you deserve."
good,Not bad company they will work before your 10 hours are most of the time you will stay in your truck over night but the pay is good if you run hard thanks
good,There was a lot of experience over the road trucking at this company.  The managers were easy to work for . I left there because it was difficult to see my family.
good,"call center environment, the most enjoyable part of working the early shift. helping the truck drivers keep their running to make their deliveries..........."
good,typical truckers life... its really what you make of it... you will either love life on the road or hate it... a great experience to me... its not easy but if its the life for you live it
good,Decent entry level transportation company.  Easy to work for. New equipment and decent salary.  Friendly managers there 24 7.  Pay is good providing you stay for sometime.
good,It was a good job just lack of hours they have great benefits also it was some ungreatful people but I went to do my work I was a great worker I am depebdable
good,they will run you as much as you want but if you are trying to have some family home time on a regular basis be prepared to be frustrated. if you team up with some one you can drive coast to coast.
good,OK organization.  Seem to have lost touch on the technician side.  Expects them to do things in adverse conditions which does not build good morale at all
good,this company is not a bad starter company to those who would like to get there class a cdl the training is not the best its pretty much you need to learn on your own
good,Great company to learn the do's and don'ts of the transportation business. The hours are very long because its a 24 hour business. The employees are very nice.
good,the  terminals need more tensions the people some  times are good the most of them need a lot more work  the only things that are good with the company is the  shop and parts  department
good,Always document all information on every load before and after cover your own behind.  If you don't keep documentation of all your paperwork somewhere downline you might need it.
good,Young and inexperienced mid-level management in IT.  Great CTO though.  No clear direction for work done that does to fit into the agile framework previously done.
good,"Great place to work if you like over-the-road work. I need to be home at night so was not the environment for me."
good,Its what you Make of it. one piece of advise do not lease a truck through IEL or Swift. You will regret it later. Best to stay company driver or own your truck out right.
good,"Good place to work and get the hands on experience. Very busy and different each day, with a fleet of trucks ranging from Volvo to kenworths. Also the employees are very helpful"
good,"Management was good, while they lasted. Typical day at work, I'm up and running between 6 am and 8am. I've learned that theirs not always gonna be consistent work every season. The hardest part of the job is being gone between 6am and 9pm 6 days a week and then you look at your pay check and then you see you've only made between $300 and $450. The most enjoyable part of working was that I used to get along with my dispatchers so they gave me good runs but they currently quit. Now things have gone array!!"
good,Swift is a good company that offers growth. During my employment freight was slow and there was a lot of down time. I took away a good sense of business from swift. The hubs were friendly and accommodating.
good,went through there driver trainer program. went to truck driving school then trained with a trainer for six weeks. hauled over the road van truck and trailer.
good,they offered a trucking academy and since I needed a cdl this was a good fit for me. after graduating I was on the road quickly but home time was always a issue.
good,"to answer dispatch and accept  a load for delivery or pick up, so much of your time is living in a truck at local truck stops, and wait for next dispatch"
good,"On a typical day i like to start early and finish at a reasonable time."
good,It's a okay starting company to do get where you got to go..most the people r cool ...your not going to get rich by no means here...
good,I learned to balance family time and work schedule. It may be difficult at times to balance both of these. The hardest part of tge job is initially assuming all responsibility for your day..
good,upper management needs help and parts department needs an entire new structure and get parts that are actually needed....................................................
good,"Pre-trip, Check navigation and plan out your day, travel to trailer drop spot, am only allowed 11 of drive time when I meet that time I stop for the night. "
good,No set schedule Hard to have family life. Work dominates life. friendly co workers. Mostly work nights. Avg day 12 to 14 hrs.
good,I have been with Swift for 3 years now and I have had some minor issues with them. But talking to management was able to resolve them. I'm currently a mentor to new students and that has been a financial plus. I also have a  good relationship with my driver manager and that does make a world of difference. I get home when I need to be that has never been an issue of mine.
good,"They need to late up on the up garding parts some people gain get and some gain not .And get better Mentors that like doing that not,"
good,With the help of swift I was able to get my cdl and by going to the walamart account it help greatly improve my backing in a very short time.i word consider working here to get your experience in and go else where
good,"Swift has a great truck driving school, good teachers....that I had.  Some of the teachers are worse just like in other companies.  From a driver's stand point...Swift gives you everything you need to be successful...it's up to you to make it happen.  Very fair company."
good,Swift great company to work for.  They have friendly driver managers and drivers. I learned how driver a semi-tractor trailer.  The easiest job I've ever had. I love traveling the world to places I've never been and that's what I like about this job.
good,I learned new skills and enjoyed the people I worked with.  My job was very detailed as I reviewed all documents that were submitted by a new hire.  I was called upon to help with many duties outside my job and was more than willing to help where needed.
good,I love to work at swift because i got to see a lot of different places and I was my own boss. I knew my product  had to be where it was was suppose to be on time. I was able to make the judgement call to assure the delivery of the merchandise.
good,"A good start to trucking. Decent training, a good school in richmond, va, but it doesn't pay enough in order to be considered a ""career"" rather than just ""a job I'm doing for now""."
good,Swift in my opinion is a OK company to work for but i myself would not make them a career. Management was ok. The hardest part of the job was the places the company sent you.
good,was a good paying job with good benefits. had really good home time for an over the road driver. would recommend to anyone
good,"Long-haul trucking was ok, but I would prefer local.  I like the idea of being home each night. Hardest part of the job, was living out of a suitcase. The most enjoyable part was seeing the country."
good,Been awhile since i worked here. i hope it got better. i did like some of the drivers i meet. and most of the dispatch was ok. just wish it payed better.
good,"Was out 1-3 weeks at a time, was a good learning experience.  Would say the most difficult part of the job would be, being gone from my family for weeks at a time.  I enjoyed seeing new places, meeting new people."
good,"check truck and trailer for leaks breaks and anything that could keep me from doing my job, drove thru most of the eastern states never got to stop and enjoy the sites. lonely not a fun job. you are the manager you learn time management I would get to where I needed to with time to spare to take in sites but I was never in a place that I wanted to."
good,"It's ok if you like working nights, weekends and holidays.  And if you like working 12 hour shifts.  I miss holiday's with my family."
good,This is a company that is good to get started in the trucking world. the managers are really good to talk too. the trucks have new dash cams. that's not good.
good,swift transportation company located in phoenix arizona is a good starter company for new drivers.  i have nothing bad to say about my time with this company
good,"A typical day at work pre-trip to make sure your equipment is in working order also cleaning out the trailer for Your next load. With a good driver manager you can be productive and make good money. Hardest part of the job is the weather, lack of information, locations sometimes are not really truck accessible."
good,"Regardless of what people have to say about this company, I truly believe that this was a great place to get a start. Swift by no means is going to be a company that you will get all that you want and at some point you will want to move on, but nothing wrong with starting here."
good,"Long hours , many miles driven , logbooks to fill out , loads to be delivered in allotted time frame . Hardest part of job being away from home for long periods of time"
good,"Productive fun place, with lots of opportunity to travel the country, and make money doing it. Get to view the world from behind the wheel of a big truck, and get to meet new people and see new places."
good,"was responsible for transporting freight thruought 30 states,having to meet a time deadline I had to plan my trips hours of drive time for a entire day making sure that I did not go over the leagle limit of drive time."
good,"nice place to work but you cant live of the pay there are other companies that pay more for the same work asked of you there. there is some encouragement to move around in the company but they also hire relatives of upper managements and promote them without any experience in some areas and give it to them. "
good,the training was really long. if has to be that long theres needs to be a break half way through so you don't get burn out. the hardest part is the waiting around for another load it could be an hour or it could be days
good,"Gave good experience at long haul in the lower 48 states.  Great company benefits, great team players, great trucking equipment and great experience for a person who is starting out."
good,working as a lease operator learn a lot of the facets of the trucking industry. one also learns defensive and safe operation of his vehicle.
good,"This company is no different than any other OTR Co. All of them paint a pretty picture..and don't get you home when they are supposed to. "
good,"They don't seem to care that you have a life outside the truck."
good,Communication with dispatch could stand improvement. Hours of waiting for loads and not making money. Not a bad job but not the best
good,"Good experience when you are just starting out in the professional driving industry, "
good,Don't expect to be home a lot if you are OTR. I think they should definitely work more with the truckers who want to be home more.
good,Swift Transportation was a good company but management needs to have better communication with employees. They also need to pay attention to payroll.
good,"Plenty of miles to go around, but getting home time is not always the easiest to get. Driver Managers will try to work with you when it benefits them."
good,I am thankful that they extended the invitation of employment to me. I would like to remain neutral at this time. It is not worse or no better than any other job.
good,Swift Needs to Improve in how they take care of their Drivers...too many grey areas when it comes to compensation for their Drivers.
good,"Enjoyable workplace with supportive management. It's not all about the money but how one can personally grow and develop. There is a decent of amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,got good miles while I ran but had a few issues with dispatch/driver manager not communicating effectively. Always was able to get short runs rather than waiting around for a long run. Always asked what stuff I could do to help and always was moving.
good,it was laid back job at times if you able to get loads with miles and the terminals was nice with food and entertainment. I also like how they have the kiosk to scan paper work.
good,i go in at five do my lot check on the trailers and then i go to set up my area for all coming through trucks and i wait till one comes in to service good co workes but boss was ok and the heat was the hardest part
good,"Although I generally enjoyed my time at Swift, picking up and delivering 53ft trailers anywhere in the country, they had the bad habit of shaving miles off my pay and constantly lying about delivery times. While I do understand the"" corporate needs"" this does cause undo stress on the individual driver. Other than that, I found the people and the work enjoyable and I look forward to working in the trucking industry again."
good,my 8 years at Swift have been a great learning experience. I've been able work my way from the ground up. I've had some great people come through my working experience and teach me or have given me the opportunity to expand my skills and give me a chance to show my skills.
good,"For me, coming from a 30 year career in a very structured and precise environment with very a detailed job scope, into the trucking industry has been a fairly easy transition. However gaining the confidence in the new skill set and feeling that i am as successful at it as I was in the environmental sciences has been a challenge. I learn something new everyday, for example i should not  get into a spot that I cannot easily back out of or pull out of, and that is okay to ask fellow drivers for help backing into a tight spot. I enjoy the long haul drives, the scenery and meeting new people all over the country. The hardest part is the bad equipment which often is in need of repairs and the wait time on that can be very long and cost me loss of ""on duty driving hours"", which mean I am losing money. Rules and regulations are strictly enforced by the Department of Transportation, which is a good thing over all. Each trucking company has many policies and restrictions in place as well and learning all those details can be daunting."
good,"This job was very hard for me at first being away from my family and what not. i worked alone and drove 10-12 hours a day non stop. The best part of this job was seeing how beautiful the world is. Management was okay, it paid the bills at the end of the day."
good,"Waiting for a load and then driving across country to deliver the product, some down time. No co-workers to really deal with, the hardest part of the job-driving alone"
good,I enjoy the fast paced work environment.  I enjoy working with drivers in the transportation industry.  I manage about 50 drivers a day and assist in making sure they get daily plans and dispatches.  I handle the payroll for hourly drivers.  I communicate with drivers through the QUALCOMM and phone.
good,"I drive to a customer and wait for hours. Sometime two or three for pick-up, when I deliver the goods to a customer they  might be.  No manager"
good,Swift transportation is 1 of the leaders in the transportation industry great company if your trying to get your foot in the field of commercial driving
good,it was fun but it had its days im glad for the chance they give me to learn and drive I had no hash word about them im thankful for everything they did to help me grow
good,"I drove over the road on a flatbed and Van.  Secured loads with straps, winches, chains, and binders.  Transported Van Loads.  Transported steel, sheet rock, lumber, landscaping materials and other materials.  Scanned delivery paperwork."
good,"Swift Transpiration was an enjoyable company except for their policies on home time."
good,"A typical day of OTR driving with Swift consists of daily vehicle inspections, route planning, Navigating, vehicle fueling, communication with driver manager and hauling product via tractor trailer cross country. "
good,"I enjoy driving over the road although i am not at home much, management could be better but my current overall experience is ok."
good,12 hour shifts. Learned the whole driving industry by working for Swift and I have that to be thankful for. Gained great knowledge of the industry and the experience to move on to a better paying career.
good,"Lot's of travel across the 48 states, Very time demanding, and attention to detail.  Long hours, and hard to schedule hometime"
good,i inspect all trailers and perform repairs on trailers as needed and im also proficent with the as 400 system also and i also know how to weld
good,Overall a nice environment to start learning about the transportation business. Great people to work for.
good,Overall I was treated with respect from Swift. Doing a dedicated run had some difficulty due to being on call 24/7 and an 80 hour work week. But the people who worked at the terminal made it easier and knew your name.
good,A lot of up to date meetings to keep you in tune with the company's goals of production.
good,Away from home more than I would like to be. Great company for men...not very women friendly unless you work in the office.
good,"rive to pick up your load, then get your rout in order , head out to your destination, had to be responsible to get the merchandise to and from in a safe timely manner .most  of the time there are no co workers you work alone, the most enjoyable part of the job is traveling"
good,"had a great co-driver. visited the US, all 48 states. good flat bed driving experience."
good,"Seeing the US is great."
good,"long driving, and don't know what time you coming to work. You only get one day off work. The hardest part is being away from your family and don't have time to get anything done"
good,"once you've received your next load you begin planning your trip and "
good,"A good start for beginning truck drivers and a chance to see most of the country. The miles are decent and the pay is adequate for the field. Swift is quick to hire new, inexperienced drivers so they are a good employer for those people seeking to learn."
good,A typical day at work is doing  a pre trip  on the tractor truck to make sure everything is working properly. Pick up and deliver loads to different locations.
good,"Deliver freight, long, late days. Operate tractor-trailer vehicle"
good,is a beginner company if one knows how to learn it is beneficial but if one doesn't know how to learn
good,Overall a good experience with this company. I learned everything I know about driving from them and i appreciate the company for that. The equipment wasn't the best but they had no problems fixing any issues associated with their trucks.
good,co-workers are great to work with they welcome you and teach you the do's and don'ts of the job to keep going.
good,Swift was a good starting out company with very good teachers that make sure you know everything needed and after you get out the drivers for the most part are helpful
good,"Fulltime rotating shifts on the road most of the time"
good,Picked up good and was given a specific route to deliver the goods.
good,stay out 3-4 weeks at a time too long un organize dispatch not so friendly
good,"lots of options, good training center, driver focused, loads and home time good"
good,On a typical day i drive a truck from a DC to a store to deliver freight. The only thing i would like to change is the home time; getting more of it.
good,"Schedule was consistent"
good,The work i perfomed for this company was great. The managers all had open door policies which made it easy to commincate effectively. The environment was fast paced and energizing.
good,"driving company that is good for entry level drivers."
good,"Great pay, people, benefits and good hours, Only thing you have to work some holidays,"
good,The hour we good lots of place to eat lunch. Co-workers are nice.
good,"They gave me a chance and a start. I am grateful for that."
good,Over the road Truck driver. Drive cross country. This compny also rerequires a CDL licence in which I have obtained.
good,"it helped provide for my family,but i spent a lot of time a way from home,i didnt like being gone so long"
good,Good company to work for. gives the opportunity to advance.
good,Swift has the worst reputation for over hiring and not being able to finish the training required to drive your own truck very disappointing all around  
good,Every day was a new day with a fresh set of tasks on a different tractor to be completed. I would perform oil changes to resealing differentials to repairing electrical problems. 
good,This is a place for trainees to get their experience rather than someone with time behind the wheel.
good,I enjoy working in the paint shop. Painting is a true joy to me. I like being able to make a truck look good with a simple paint job. 
good,"I transport freight weld driving a tractor trailer safely. My job consist of backing, moving tandems, adding load locks, and delivering load on time.   "
good,"Just an average OTR job. Wake up in the morning, drive, eat lunch, drive some more, shower and sleep. Nothing too special, nothing too negative. "
good,My day consist of driving 10 hours a day and sleeping 10 hours a day in my tractor.
good,good starters company can make more money training others
good,Driving tractor trailer. Transporting shippment. Good management. Co-workers that I met was good. Traffic. Exploring different cities.
good,Big Company with lots of great trucks but makes you sit and wait for loads way to much.
good,"If you like to travel then this job will be fun for the first three months, but there are very little breaks extreme time constraints and at time very little money. If you get stuck in the wrong part of the country you can get stuck there for days waiting for a load to take you to some other part of the country, you have to drive in all kinds of weather many of which can be deadly"
good,"good equipment, computerized communication, had to wait for a load, paid by miles and unload, working in a truck= lack of connection with others."
good,no day was typical. I did learn a few thing about over the road. like managing you'er time. I'd be to early and have to wait some place for appointed time. jobs before was to get to destination as fast as possible. Mangement was good. Didn't relly have co-workers. the hardest part of the jbo was the setting and waiting don't do that well. I didn't realy enjoy the job. but was happy when I get though a snow strom and arrived at my destionation on time.
good,Typical day started with my vehicular inspection then drove.
good,"always working towards saftey and on time delivery.you dont get to see your co workers your on the road,the hardest part or job is delivering easrly in the morning no set schedule. the enjoyable part is stopping for your ten hour break cause you are ready,"
good,Get a good Mentor that will utilize your time. that is so that you can get great training
good,"i liked this company but i just needed to be home more with my kids, the hardest part of the job is leaving home for 12 days"
good,It was kind of repeat but good to know you made things flow through the US.
good,Would like to work for the company but when time for my hometime nobody want to talk.
good,"clean/sweep areas, run forklift when needed, recieved Forklift license with the company"
good,Nice place to work. Very fast paced and challenging. The staff was very supportive.
good,"Driving long haul, wherever it took me. I learned the roads cross country very well. The management was pretty good and I felt they were doing their best to provide loads for all drivers. There is often people to talk with while on the road. It is easy to become friends with the people you work with as you are in communication with them so often. I really enjoy the open road, but I miss my family while I am away so much."
good,Company was family oriented but changed over the years. Would rather not discuss
good,• Box and Refrigerated Division
good,"While i worked there, I would sit to much because there was not loads."
good,Best training programs.Lots of opportunities depending on your geographical location.Great company to start your career with.
good,"your on the road alot not for family men or women very good for single or couples that want to work together and be gone all the time. you pre trip, do paperwork, hook, unhook, load and unload some times. and drive and see lots of country"
good,500 mile per day
good,Typical day at work
good,Liked the job . I was training new Drivers. Long ours up to 14 hours a day. I did like working on my on on the road . Being away from family so long was not ideal.
good,great miles and great driver manager bad truck though. the only reason i left was to chase a career. still would be there today if i hadnt decided to leave
good,It was a great place to work. I started from the bottom and worked my way up to management. I wish the pay would have been more I would have stayed there.
good,Swift has many opportunities to work. You can get experience on driving they have classes for parking and backing. They are very helpful and make easy to apply the only thing is that if you stay with them you have to do over the road first in order to get a local job.
good,Been home every day for two years only work 6/8 hours a day good pay both not stable both accounts got ended now a 3nd one I’m on will end soon and don’t see any other local ones available.
good,"My immediate manager was incredibly awesome. Great guy, never  asked me to do anything he wasnt willing to do himself, which he often did. Everybody that worked there was very nice too. Great mechanics, "
good,"Great job to get experience and if you know the right people it can be very profitable. Hometime is not what I would like it to be but to it could be different for others. Miles change from week to week, average being around 2100 a week. Pay could be better but isnt horrible. Overall a good place to start with no experience."
good,yes nice company for the new driver coming in trucking. they treat everyone like they just joined trucking. my home time is mine not the companies. supposed to be treated like family.
good,"This was a good company to work for but with the Knight purchase of Swift, many changes were coming and turning Customer Service more into a call center and not a good customer experience."
good,"Long Hours"
good,"There are some good things about Swift and some bad things about Swift. In short summary "
good,Swift has poor drivers with little to no training bad accident ratio poor home time for drivers. decent on time delivery percentage though with some senior driver force. decent pay could have been better though for the amount of work that was done.
good,Started driving with this company with my husband and we drove as a team.  Wanted to travel the United States and found this an interesting way to do so.
good,Get a good driver manger stay on time you can buy trucks from Swift the bad thing is no APU  units on the trucks so they get mad if you run your truck in the summer time
good,As a lease operator the jobs and accounts I was able to be apart of were helpful in the building of my business.There were times they would help out in the making of your business run smooth.
good,"Never met employers, was always driving by myself, the most communication you had with the dispatcher was by phone or computer. Not that much person to person contact."
good,"Well a day would start with a pre tip of the truckcheck all lights on truck are working.Check tires got air all mud flaps are there. check oil in the levels on truck are up.If you are loaded you can start you day.Hardest part of the job is being on time with the load.Best part of job is the end of day,and dinner time."
good,I do repairs on Trade Equipment and repairs on minor wrecks. Have learned some body work. My day is usually fast paced and constantly busy. During trade season the work increases substantially.
good,"The trucks are decent for the most part and they already have some of them with automatic transmissions,  The automatic transmissions make it real easy to get around when you're in really bad traffic.  The GPS system that they have is pretty good and rarely needs to be corrected."
good,Working at Swift was a great learning experience. Although my leader had not much clue of her job.  It is a high stress job with many duties. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all the Break Screens and emails. Other than that it was a great place to work.
good,"-picking and dropping off loads driving and paper work"
good,"As an office employee, some managers empower their employees. Others not so much. The company is very large, this can be a positive, but can also be a negative. Overall, good job security."
good,"Swift is a good company to drive for.Only,if they had the technicians to get you rolling sooner ,much sooner than later.Much,much later.As far as dispatchers go,the one I was assigned to,was great. The trucks are o.k.Get ready to spend a few hours looking for empty trailers,though."
good,"If you enjoy driving and travel this is the job for you. Little time between jobs is a good thing if you want to earn your max potential."
good,I can't say much but its an decent place to start at in the transportation industry. Just don't do the Owner/Operator program its a rip off for sure. But i will say it wasn't bad at all
good,"Driving trucks is more of a lifestyle choice than a career. It may suit some people who want to drive around and live for free, but not for those who enjoy the company of others."
good,i hate the cameras on the dashboard that watch you while you drive and the sensors on the truck. It cost alot of good drivers their jobs.
good,A typical day would consist of an inspection of the truck and proceeding to the destination im assigned to. The best part about the road is sight seeing and meeting new people. Worst part about driving would be weather conditions but most times the weather would be ok.
good,"the money was good miles were good in the beginning, but new dispatcher not willing to work with you making things difficult. A typical trucking company."
good,"Decent miles, decent equipment. More good people in some terminals, more not so good people in others. A good company to start, re-start or finish your career with, might want to find somewhere better for the in-between."
good,"Getting my truck and my load assignment and then heading out to pick up my load, and delivering to costumer. good time management making many friends, hardest part of job being away from home and family. and the most enjoyable part was the open road."
good,"Swift is the largest Trucking company in the country. But, they are so big that they do sometimes forget the individual needs of their drivers."
good,"A typical day at work is going and receiving the trucks that I am assigned to. Fixing the truck to the best of my ability. We have onsite managers/foreman's if we have issues/question that are very helpful. I learn different things everyday as far as diesel trucking industry is concerned. The most enjoyable part of the day is working with my co-workers, because we are always willing to help each other out."
good,"Over the road driver,inspects truck before and after trips and submits report indicating truck condition, reads bill of lading to determine assignment, fastens chain or binders to secure load on trailer during transit,loads or unloads, or assists in loading and unloading truck,services truck with oil, fuel, and radiator fluid to maintain tractor-trailer,obtains customer's signature or collects payment for services,inventories and inspects goods to be moved, wraps goods using pads, packing paper, and containers, and secures load to trailer wall using straps.gives directions to helper in packing and moving goods to trailer.drives tractor-trailer combination, applying knowledge of commercial driving regulations, to transport and deliver products, livestock, or materials, usually over long distance, maneuvers truck into loading or unloading position, following signals from loading crew as needed,drives truck to weigh station before and after loading, and along route to document weight and conform to state regulations,maintains driver log according to I.C.C. regulations."
good,They were good to work for but they need to treat there people like people not just a driver.
good,This place could be a lot better some of the mangers needs proper training to handle the needs of drivers and customers
good,it was my first driving job .but it was ok to work there wasn't to bad.
good,"Hard to get decent miles, you have to accept a lot of short hauls to get a good long run. The few really good dispatchers are overworked, and the rest turn over frequently. Being the biggest, you are only a number to them. Any ComCheck you use will be deducted from your next pay, until settled, which may or may not happen. Very hard to get home, most of the time you are out 4 or 5 weeks. Pay is never what they advertise. Takes over a year to qualify for any benefits, which are usually a lot more expensive than all the other companies. Lots of mysterious shortages in your pay. HOWEVER..... if you can tuff it out for 4 years (with a perfect driving records and always on-time deliveries), or you start with at least 5 years experience (and a good record), they will treat you like a king!"
good,Swift Transportation was had a lot of problems from getting my full pay to me and keeping me on the road seeing as how in order to make a pay check i needed to be driving. A typical day at Swift consisted of driving from state to state from like 5:00 in the morning until 6:00p.m i never seen any of my coworkers or management. The hardest part of the job was being away from home. I really did not find any aspects of the job enjoyable until i returned home for my off days.
good,"driving or waiting for truck to be unloaded, learned patience(60mph top speed) ontime delivery, customer relationship and fine tuning my driving skills, management acknowledged my work ecthics by selecting me driver of the month and nominated me for driver of the year"
good,"Wake up at whatever time you get your 11 hours back... start heading to your destination, drop that load and pick up another one."
good,To much work load for understaffed office staff.
good,I had gone to school to learn to drive truck. Swift gave me the opportunity to get some over the road experience. And learn more about the job I was doing.
good,Swift is a great place to work. No boss breathing down your neck and you get to see this great country of ours. If your single with no kids I would rec amend working here. They have a great medical plan and take care of their drivers.
good,"Driving for Swift was challenging and I over came the challenge getting my load on time ,I don't mind driving but there's alot of night driving and I don't mind driving at night"
good,"In this position, you take breakdown calls from drivers. From there you either have to troubleshoot or try to find a vendor to setup service. You also will receive calls from vendors trying to collect payment. During the weekdays you have several supervisors, team leads, and back office to assist you if you have any questions. The downside of that is rarely they will be on the same page.   "
good,"Good mentors , out from home for long periods of time.  Great equipment . Overall good company to start driving with . Think of it as a paid vacation while you learn to drive a tractor trailer for of you are just starting  out"
good,"They cut back hours, don’t give paid holiday or sick leave. Won’t let you work overtime, quadrupled your work load and no raises. No breaks except lunch"
good,It was for the experience. I just wanted the experience in truck driving. It’s s great start job for new driver me that want experience in truck driving
good,This is a descent company but the miles is dropping.. Wanna get home more but not gonna make the money you want cause the miles are gonna drop.. Other that good company.
good,"They were organized, I had the most wonderful manager.  They work with you, I felt secure working for them.  Nice having terminals everywhere.  I really liked them."
good,Job is fine if u work in office as a manager or ect. The schedules are pretty nice earlier starts if you prefer getting up other than that pretty standard shift work half hour lunch.
good,"Walmart  dedicated driver "
good,If you are single this is a great industry to go in.  If you have a family it is more hard as you only get paid when you are driving.  When you are out of hours to drive and are required to sit due to DOT rules you are not compensated
good,I was left a couple times due to other driver quitting. Was sent out given the incorrect amount of days. Sometimes load would be cancelled and would not be communicated.
good,They train you to do your job and be safe out there they don't rush you but your load sometimes not 💯 good to make your money it all depends on how you run
good,"Unless you happen to be in management, your opinion is not considered,  Expressing your opinion, more than likely clash with your boss and that in turn will make it very difficult for you to move up.  Some of the current managers are not up to speed with the newer technology so you will be stuck patching up old problems.  Worse yet, not a chance in a million that the problems will ever get fixed.  The culture is that IT is subservient to everyone else.  Pay is good but the stress is just off the charts."
good,"Worked over the road and had poor pay checks. Had loads removed that I committed to. Sent miles to find empty trailers."
good,"Good place to start career in junior roles to gain experience and basic know how. Not much upside to staying past 4 years."
good,I was fortunate to have gotten an amazing DM & I did well...I ran good miles & made a consistent pay check every week...I like the people I met there...I always felt like I was a part of their family
good,Company is good to work for.  I have been employed by them for 14 years and held several positions within the company.  Good management in place.  Have enjoyed my time with the company
good,"I had 2 jobs with swift. I started out as a full time driver then I took a position in the shop full time and was a casual driver. I would enter all the techs work orders send invoices for payment or issue or customers payments. Answer phone,"
good,Good to start with you cam make money. Some good staff and some some staff available to your needs. Will train you and house you and only have to pay it back once you are off mentor truck
good,"I found in my experience with Swift transportation, it gave me the tools to be able to handle over the road experience and to not be afraid of any challenges that come my way when dealing with any over the road company"
good,"They did keep up with their drivers,  you had options to choose your loads and schedule your deliveries so that you made them on time and you could get an advance if low on cash while on the road."
good,I loved being otr. It started going bad when I didn't get paid for loads. I went very far as a team mate. Then I got to drive solo. It was a blast. I can't wait to get back in a truck. I just got back home.
good,The beginning is pretty rough they train you for about a month to get your CDL. If you don't already have one then.Then put you on the road with a mentor for about a month. Once that's over upgrade to solo or team. its pretty rough being OTR Driver at times.
good,I enjoyed it but didn't like when they left us stuck in a certain place for long periods of time.  Sometimes we wouldn't get loads in days or had to be stuck because we got there too fast.
good,"I've been with Swift for about 8 years. I was lucky to get a mentor who lived only 8 miles from me. I was home every weekend during my training, but I believe that I was the exception to the rule. If you're a family man/woman, it's tough being away from them at first. What I mean by that, is I hated being away from home/family, but I bided my time, and I looked for a local driving job while on 10 hour break. There isn't much out there until you get at least 6 months experience, but more like a year's worth. I did regional and got a dedicated run after about a year and a half. I did that run for about a year and a half, and then Swift lost the account. Back on regional for a short time, and I'm currently on my 4th year on a dedicated, local run. I'm home every night with my wife and kids, not missing any little league or high school sporting events. I'm making a pretty good salary now too. My advice is don't be a whine bag, do the things (runs) you don't really want to, and hopefully get lucky as I have with a great Driver Leader (Manager. I've had the same one for all but my first 2 months). The pay is low to start, but if you can prove yourself, and stick it out, you should be able to make some money. DO NOT GO ""owner"" operator. You won't own anything except a marriage to a truck you can't divorce. I love my current position, my dispatcher, and the Extended Coverage Team @ my terminal. This took some time, and I stuck it out. I might not have if I didn't have so many people relying on me. 1 more thing. I saw some people list independence as a ""Pro"" for driving for Swift. It"
good,as long as your staying busy you have a job. the work duties are simple and easy most of all the work gets sube out so all you do is basic maintence ..
good,"not a bad company to start your cdl career off at.pa is not bad at all for a beginner driver.they keep moving pretty good,you can make decent money by keeping the wheel turning"
good,"go big or go home, they will have you away from home a lot, just like any otr trucking company, but hey its money to be made, stay focus and get money"
good,"Swift leasing program it's not working at all, very expensive trucks with a lot of bad paid and missing miles. But in you are new in trucking business this is the best place to be, take give you the opportunity to drive without experience."
good,"Swift has the ability give new drivers the 48 state experience during and after training. This covers all types of terrain this country has to offer. ( regionaL work, local work) Many terminals and otr drivers can pick any zip for home time."
good,"Given my 15 years experience driving truck OTR, Dedicated, and locally. Working with Swift on the Target Account has been a refreshing change into a regular schedule. Typically out and back in the same day. Easy and friendly office personnel to aid in my day to day support needs. With supervision willing to work with me when I may have special needs such as doctor appointments, family gathering, and so on."
good,"Swift is to big of a company to have a career in. But if you need the experience, just starting out in this industry Swift would be good for you. Overall Swift is a company that will think about themselves before thinking about the drivers. The pay is good but your not getting your full pay. Swift pay by the Rand McNally Home Movers Guide, which only pays from zip code to zip code. You will lose on average about 50 to 100 unpaid miles."
good,"Dayly pre- tip and post trip inspection .Accommodate all necessary prior  to start such as pre -plan trip rout brakes and all safety precautions following DOT regulations. My experience at Swift was my first at the trucking industry and got to say one of the best ,learn to manage and understand many things. The hardest part of the job was the wates for the next load assiment that sometimes were long. but the reason is i love driving the machines and dont like to be sitting for long periods of time"
good,Heard about all kinds of problems I would experience if I worked for them. None of it turned out to be true. Seemed like an average OTR company. I quit only because I got tired of being out 2 weeks at a time. Wanted more home time.
good,Swift was  a very good company to work for due to the fact that they had their own training programe for drivers   And policies for transport applications
good,"This position was very demanding of your time. This account operated on a revolving 10 hr shift. The hours of work were pretty consistent of 12-14 hrs per day, with a 10 hr break that rolled based on shift start and end time.As compliant as this company is, its operations under this account, were borderline  FMCS violations. I did not interact much with co-workers, as routes/times were very unpredictable & inconsistent. The hardest part of this job was balancing personal time with work, as the unpredictability was intrusive in every aspect of a personal life. the most enjoyable part of this job was the interaction with customers."
good,"love driving"
good,"A good job, allowing me to set my own hours and work (mostly) at my own pace. Working mostly by myself, doing something that I enjoy doing (driving), only having to deal with others when loading or unloading trailers."
good,long driving days with great views of country sides and different cultures
good,I had a good dm and I got great miles the coworkers was good and friendly and I learn alot there.
good,"Love to traveling all 48 states, but rough on home life. Would love to get back into it after thing get better."
good,It was the best company to work and enjoy your job. My manager was great allways there for me wen I had a problem.
good,Everyone at swift treated me really well. I would have stay longer but still had kids to rise at the time.
good,Driver management is very helpful and do the best they can to keep you moving and making money. The career development is very unresponsive and don't seem to care about drivers. The pay is not very good.
good,No matter what happened they always be there they good people I was really enjoying the staff for the first time driving over the road. Experience driver no no no isn’t worth it.
good,"the culture in the company besides the drivers is a good culture. they try  to get conscious drivers to drive for them, but, the experience of driving for the company is a little less of desire."
good,The swift academy was excellent highly recommended for all beginners entering the trucking industry the mentor phase upon completion of the 3 week training was also up to par..but once you reached the fleet the dispatchers at my assigned terminals were not helpful and more so hindrance to operations
good,You get an average of 1-2 loads a day at $67 a load plus .16 empty miles if your lucky and they like you you'll get preloaded trailers. My average was about 800 a week it's not bad if your new and dont care about money.
good,"Great place to start a carrier as a none experienced driver, they wiil take the juice out of you with miserable ""pay"" but will train you good for what ever came."
good,Would recommend for someone just getting into trucking to get some experience under their belt. Cdl training done through them feels rushed though. Better if you go there after you get your license
good,A typical day included driving average miles then sitting with no retention pay. I learned how to use the Qualcom E-log system which helped me prepare for my trips. My driver manager was very helpful with any questions I had involving my trip to dedicated locations. The hardest part of the job was adapting to the constant change of schedule. The most enjoyable part is   ....... I love driving.
good,Swift transportation was a great job.  I would get with the dispatcher and he would assign me loads.  Once load was picked up I would make it my mission to get there on time if not early.
good,Get your experience and try to get on one of the accounts. After a certain amount of time being over the road your miles tend to drop a little. That might also have to do with the driver leader as well since you might go through a couple through out your employment. Best thing to do is get the experience and try to find something better.
good,For a truck company if you are starting is a good company to work for. Go over the road if you want to make money. Hard to do this job when you have and love your family.
good,They taught me to drive truck .Trucking is not for everyone . It was not for me . The instruction and teachers where good. But I just couldn't get use to that truck.
good,"like any major company such as swift, you will have some problems. but they are really good at correcting mistakes and helping a driver. great benefits and training depending on the ""mentor"" you receive"
good,"Start with emails, open the phone and take phone calls take care of drivers needs with their hours over the phone. On down times, do log audits on drivers."
good,I loved the traveling I did. The job was not stressful it was better than I thought it would have been. I handle that big rig. I did have an issue with their training guidelines when it came to the expenses. READ the FINE PRINT
good,dispatch on loads. pick loads up in a timely manner and deliver them to customer while keep a 100% on time record. Drive a 10 speed standard transmission freightliner.
good,"Swift can be a much better company. There is confusion among the planners, I have had loads that was accepted, only to be taking away with no reason why. Can't find empty trailers in time, miss assignments because of this reason."
good,Drive 8 to 11hrs and do paperwork for 3hrs I learned how to drive Semi Trucks also learn how to drive the truck over the road and really enjoyed viewing the country driving
good,"I worked in team, and then this is very complicated because is like to live with a person every day and every night. Thats so dificult. But the job individual is good."
good,good for learning on how to start driving. The staff is extremely friendly and willing to help when you ask. Always kept you busy with work. pay is based on how much experience you have
good,It’s great place to work I recommend anyone who want to become a driver go with swift transportation there are great teachers for getting your class a cdl an you get to see a lot of the USA.
good,"Get a load then drive for about 11 hours a day until you get to delivery point. I learned how to connect a fifth wheel trailer, disconnect, drive a semi. with a 53 foot trailer. back a large trailer.."
good,"You learn new things every single day. "
good,"My typical day at swift was slow learned the business, managment was supportive. the workplace was was the truck, and i would say it was hard staying away from home for so long but i enjoyrd the veiw"
good,I'm the type that likes to stay busy .  I enjoyed meeting new people and Seeing new things . My work day like to plan everything out .
good,"They were true to everything they said they would do. Driver managers were very helpful. If I had been able to get more miles I would have stayed. But I only averaged 1400 miles a week. Would get 600 mile runs with appointment deliveries 3 days out or other time wasters. Owner Ops do well, Teams do better. Hard for solo drivers. Health Insurance is expensive, no compensation for low mileage runs. No inverters or APU. Trucks generally newer model and in good condition. If company driver expect to drive automatic. Manuals tend to be the oldest trucks in the fleet because they are not being replaced, just phased out."
good,I feel its a starter company. Low pay and straight pay after 40. The management does not put there foot down which coworkers run the shop not the management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job is pulling the truck in repairing the truck and getting it back on the road knowing you made that happen. I've have learned everything I know about diesel.
good,Drive the U.S and get to see the states and their beauty.You will be OTR with a trainer and learn all you need to know to be prepared to drive on your own.
good,"My responsibities are to work as a PA to the purchasing director as well as senior administrator to a busy purchasing department. My main role is to co-ordinate between internal departments and external suppliers to ensure on time feed to the largest market leading manufacturer of touring caravans, motorhomes an holiday homes in the UK. I work for good managers, its down to re-locating why I am looking for another job."
good,"Driving state to state,"
good,"pretty good experience at swift.  was able to go home when I needed. I didn't have a problem with swift. good loads, very good experience . was able to travel ."
good,"If you have no experience driving a tractor trailer, this company is for you. They will help you get your CDL Class A and pay you a beginner wage that is very common in the market today. I highly recommend this company if your just starting out."
good,typical day is on the road driving ALL day ALL night. benefits are great and personnel is wonderful.
good,"Good place to work at great advancement opportunities, coworkers help each other out, I learned alot from my managers and coworkers overall if i would be given the opportunity to go back I would."
good,"During my last stint with Swift Transportation driving as an independent contractor, I had to stay out over the road almost all the time in order to receive a positive weekly pay check or at least break even."
good,Good company to start out with. Courteous and dedicated to help people out with getting one's CDL during training. My only issue is being away from family for long periods of time while only making .40 a mile.
good,"Great company to work for and keeps you moving. I enjoyed my time with SWIFT but the pay was not sufficient for my family responsibilities had to move on to work that provided a better income to provide for them. "
good,Swift is a very big company they do everything by the book you are rushed to get trucks done and out sometimes you don't have all the parts that you need and you are made to make do with what you have management is very poor it could use a lot of improvement
good,I was a long-haul truck drive my job was to drive a 53-foot trailer  halling  freight from state to state at all different time of the day and night to get to I'll customers  on time
good,Average company to work for. the only problem with swift was the process for getting loads and too many messages on qualcom while trying to drive was a distraction. The qualcom constantly going off. I was not there to long because the truck they gave me had been wrecked and the drivers door would not properly close and in the winter it was too cold trying to drive and freeze. They also treated you like a number and not a driver.
good,This company have good trucks and good pay for senors if u new drivers gonna be hard to get good load and miles . But overall good place to start and have experience
good,as long as you work hard and do the job right the staff there will treat you like a valued employee. They will also give you recognition if you go beyond what is asked of you.
good,I don't like the fact that you have to take tests in order to receive a raise. Packets have to be completed in order to receive a decent raise. The tests are not hard but its the process that you have to go through is what is frustrating.
good,They r great to wrk for them if u r a family it hard to spend time wth them ur family n u in for couples of days n then back on the road u r in all kind of weather
good,"all five start projected training thru swift university outstanding challenging due to different engines cummins,freightliner and volvo engines as well as cng engines needs more open space to properly and safely work on natural engines atmosphere in addition"
good,"Worked like a dog."
good,Plus 1 program designed to utilize drivers 70 hour work week. Electronic logs keep you on the road daily. You will run and Swift is great about reimbursing drivers. Trucks are decent to new and when you get your home time your truck will be given to another driver. This is a full time part time job and you might as well say goodbye to the mistress
good,"don't care about there drivers or the families have to do what they tell you or your fired even if it is unsafe!               "
good,Just hate how the company tell me to do something illegal to put the trailer on the rail road ..to back them up to make their money but cant back me up for making a traffic ticket then firing me..smh..should expose yall to dot for all the illegal things yall do but ill wait till the perfect time
good,"SWIFT Is a training company, not a career company, they will hire any one regardless of experience or background. they also dont pay their drivers very well, and owner ops dont even make enough miles to keep themselves from starving.Bad idea to work for them."
good,"dont get home often they send you anywhere, but you just want to make money good place to do it"
good,Swift is a large company. I have never seen a company that could careless about their employees.
good,"Columbus Ohio swift academy is one of the best experience in my life! The school instructors drill you with learning the basics of the truck I wished the training was extended for two extra weeks cause the instructors had so much knowledge to give. I wished they was my mentor cause I trusted them to turn me into a professional but my mentor was always upset about his pay and sometimes didnt feel like training. But I managed to upgrade from his truck into my own and I worked thier for six week and I resigned cause the pay wasn't what I expected. But the school and the instructors is amazing and if swift were to have the instructors become mentors after training students, swift would have the best drivers on the road and could send those trained drivers to other companies as a business opportunity for those outside companies who need trained and skilled drivers strictly for those companies who participate in the program."
good,Poor management and tired of driving over the road. I had problems with getting home time and extra pay. I want to be off and at home at some point in time to spend with family
good,Ok company to beghing as a truck driver they give you a chance to establish experience. Ok company to begging there but after 6 years of service i didnt see much advancement...exa pay increase
good,"Good company to work with, the managers are good and have a good relationship. It’s good working for swift. They respect everyone in the company. They take their time to teach you how to get a load and ready to answer any questions at anytime."
good,"Ok place to work, but once I had my first baby and came back from leave, I was not doing the same job functions I was doing before my leave. They laid me off once I complained to HR and management."
good,"Leave for trailer pick up anytime between 1:00 - 6:00 am sometimes the load was ready sometimes not. Safety check load drive for 2 hrs to 6 hours to destination, get unloaded or wait to drop the load at the yard and pick up empty, back to pick area to drop off the trailer.  every once in a while you would have to stay out overnight"
good,"I was driving team for them, and they kept us running but they seem to not care if we were tired and needed to pull over. As long as the load was on time, was the response. Overall, it was enjoyable, and the manager was great. Sometimes they would take a load from us and give it to someone else 2 minutes after they give it to us."
good,"I DID Learn here how to do Pivot Tables and V-Lookups with the best of them!  Other than that, my Training on the Job left a lot to be desired."
good,they had very nice trucks cuse they new you had to live in them and they took pretty good care of you.got you home fairly regulry and didnt bother you too much while you where there
good,Culture has become toxic over the past several years as market conditions changed but our company did not adapt. 80% of the work is done by 20% of the people. The remaining just micromanage that effort. Company remains in the 20th century.
good,Should have to express how much you need a job/career when you have been there for awhile. When a former employee is let go/fired one shouldn't have to justify there job
good,Immediate Management was great but the hrs were long and it was stressful a lot of the time. Very little time off. Drive for 30 off for 4. The enjoyable part of the job was getting to see the country.
good,"SWIFT is a great company to start off with to get your experience!  They do receive a lot of negative PR but they are not as horrible as people make them out to be.  The only thing I wish that was changed is to lengthen the truck schooling courses.  Two weeks is not enough time to learn how to properly operate a truck!  Luckily my husband was my mentor and we drove team so I did not have much of an issue, otherwise, I feel that I would have failed."
good,i drive between temple and Walmart all over Texas it does get rough sometimes between the lack of sleep and never knowing when you will go out i am on call 24/7 so its hard
good,"After 10 years in the transportation industry I have released that Patient patient is a must. When driving,or with a customer."
good,With this job you only get one day a week home and your going to spend a lot of time away from home and your responsibilities because you want to work up to enough home time to at least visit a week.
good,Have been cursed out on several occasions by supervisor. Supervisor told me not to speak while we were on the phone. She said that I was going to do what she said to do when she told me to do it.
good,"Did not like the DM. DM was pushy and did not like me or my husband. When ask to change the DM we could not get off her board. I also had equipment troubles, that Swift put a temp. fix on and the truck never ran right."
good,pick up and deliver freight from different companies and deliver it to other customers
good,"I learned a lot at SWIFT, they make every effort to keep their drivers going in the right direction and they have the highest level of concern for all the issues involved in the transportation industry.  That said, I believe this company is too autocratic because of their immense size.  They are fair to their drivers for the conditions available, and honest about the fact that this lifestyle is not convenient for those drivers who have families to support at home since they are away most of the time."
good,should a big company like swift have better equipment to work with they should . good people to work with
good,"While driving otr i was treated fair."
good,when Knight and Swift merged started to go down hill. Had 2 level 3 DOT inspections in two weeks of each other passed both but had 1 warning on each and Swift decided to terminate.
good,"Generally pretty safety oriented.  The pay could be better.  "
good,The pick up/drop off sites were rude never on time with appointments. Always getting hassled by the driver manager about driving to close to a vehicle in front of you that just cut you off and was trying to slow down to get a good distance in front of you.
good,I'll always be Team Swift not sure what direction Knight plans to take Swift in but at first glance it looks to be in the right direction.  Hopefully it continues to be a great place to begin a transportation career.
good,nothing really good to say about them after they let me go after 6.5 years I was a great driver and they even stated that never late on a delivery never cited for speed but let go because of a incident I didn't put the proper macro in on a qualcom
good,"This is a fantastic company to work for to ""get your foot in the door"" in the professional driving industry. The pay could be better, OTR miles are not consistent, and after hours/weekend dispatch does not take driver appreciation seriously."
good,"It's hard work. Driving kills your back, there's nothing to eat but Subway and fast food. Truck stops are not luxurious what-so-ever. Pay is okay, but you got to work for 11hrs a day in order to make any money. Swift staff tend to be snotty pricks because they can, but once in a while you get someone who is a decent person. Their technicians are fantastic, they're really good at getting you on the road as fast and safe as possible. I was cheated out of $2,000 my first two weeks out of training because someone didn't change my status and they didn't care to compensate me for it either. Your miles will be high the first few months and then drastically drop. If your not a people person this job is perfect for you cause you get very minimal human contact that isn't a jerk guard at drop off locations."
good,"had to get my foot in the door as Class A driver. Swift helps you - be careful with them driver leaders - they can cheat your pay. Other than that, great place to get started."
good,Constantly on the road. Learned different areas where I traveled. Learned a lot about trucks and maintenance of them. Management wasn't as helpful when it came to personal issues. Co-workers kept to themselves for the most part. Hardest part of the job is making sure I had enough rest for the missions ahead. Most enjoyable was privacy of living out of a big cab truck. The freedom to travel different places across the country.
good,"I started with Swift as a company driver, then transitioned into a lease operator. Overall, the experience was good, but the lease program was difficult to use."
good,I didnt like being away from home all the time.other than that it was good money with ok management and excellent advancement opportunities.
good,"This is a very big company with some really great equipment. The trucks are constantly upgraded, they are inspected rigorously at several of their many terminals, unfortunately they don't pay as much attention to the trailers. Most co-workers were indifferent to me and just had grumpy attitudes. My contact with the office was a constant nightmare."
good,"This is a fast paced work environment, which will keep you on your toes at all times.  Management lacks education, leadership skills, and are promoted based on relationship, not experience.  Co-workers are hard working and will make sure you succeed, but have to deal with a micro-manager who only looks out for himself, and does not reward or recognize his employees.  Management is the most challenging part of this job."
good,"Huge company with room for advancement, however very little personal relatinships"
good,over the road drive with advancement opportunity after a few years.
good,Swift has a great structure but your just a number & a number doesn’t get payed or treated like part of the collective. They run on a corporate culture. Sometimes dollars and cents shouldn’t be the bottom line.
good,"Life on the road - usual trucking. Company is huge, lots of terminals, drop lots. Most loads drop and hook. To get someone on hold usually takes time. Newer equipment"
good,"I gave swift 4 stars because they're better than alot of mega carriers. Just like all trucking companies it have thier Bad and Ugly side which I will tell you."
good,"Lack of comprehensive training when on the floor made the experience stressful and frustrating, Department was under staffed for inter-department training sucked."
good,"I would normally drive from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm..  But because he  on time. Truck driving is not a whole lot of fun. While in training if you get a good trainer/mentor I guess it could be fun. They had showers, microwaves, Big Screen T T's,comfortable lounge chairs, tables bathrooms to accommodate their driver. "
good,This is a good company to start your driving career at. They will train you and get you started in the field but its a starter company unless you get a good dedicated run.
good,i delivered to the dollar tree stores drove to the store unloaded there products drove to the next and so on and so on until everything was out of the trailer go back to the warehouse to pick up your new load for the new day
good,The job was very much the same every day wake up drive shower eat. then wake up and do it the next day real boring if you young and have a life . Good first time company learned alot
good,"If you are new working like CDL A driver I recommend this place, they are hiring all the time new drivers and you can learn to much."
good,Had very little training due to lack of accountability from other employees. Very busy phone lines .I helped truck drivers in time of need after an accident. May be a fender bender or a fatality. Obtained all needed information and entered into system to create a claim. I helped drivers with transportation to get to a safe location. Teamwork was great. Everyone was willing to help. Hardest part of my job was hearing a grown man cry due to a fatality. The best part of my job was getting the driver all the helped he needed and knowing they were going to be ok.
good,"overall good starting point for new drivers, requires hard work and good work ethic dont get caught up in lazy crowd.  Trucks are governed slow and pick a mentor who cares"
good,The JC Pennys account management have been the best people Ive worked while working at Swift. However truck driving has proven to be limited in my over all life goals.
good,if you're a new driver this place can be for you. I just finished my year and am looking for work elsewhere. I learned everything necessary to move forward with this type of career. if you love working alone and challenge yourself daily this is for you.
good,Good starter company but the planners will make someone confused quickly. The safety department is pretty good but could use some improvement.
good,A good place to work but the management there needs to be changed.  They have there favorite picks there.  I was a diesel mechanic. I drove trucks around and serviced them and got them ready for new drivers.
good,Swift is a good company for the new drivers that just got out of school
good,A good place to start if you are just starting out but no room to grow. Management is not fare. Great customer base.
good,"Deliver freight, pick up freight drive at least 11 hours a day an work for at least 14 hour work day. I learned how to drive real good working for this company. I learned how to manage my time well had a great mentor who terned out to be a great co-worker. The hardest part of that job was learning how to back up my trailor, the most enjoyable time was backing up by my self."
good,Perfect starter company for new drivers. Dont believe the hype no where near as bad a advertised
good,"I came here after MHC Kenworth and my boos and coworkers were amazing, not a bad company and you can grow but, just was not for me anymore so i had to let the job go."
good,There not to bad and support  is great but getting someone on the phone at night or the weekend is hard no one seems to answer or be there or they just don't like to answer
good,"Loads are back to back and expect to burn 11hrs drivetime, everyday so 34 resets happen often.  Trucks are well maintained and pay is appropriate to the job."
good,I work hard show up on time dedicated into my work we clean eighteen wheelers and detail the inside of them it's basically a nice job but I'm looking for something better to do I work my work
good,Planners are competitive and preditory. They do not do their homewok when booking loads (i.e. not enough physical hours to run load for delivery times) ect.
good,"Traveling to different states that you have never been to, being patient driving, be more aware of your surrounding. Keeping your sanity because there are a lot of careless people out on the road."
good,"Friendly management mostly. Discrepancies in pay. "
good,"My only problems with this company is that their equipment is never really fixed properly. "
good,This was the company which provides the multiple options far all employees to grow in such a manner to achieve the best opportunity in the carrier.the management is also very cooperative.
good,Swift is not a bad company to start with especially when you're fresh out of truck driving school. Now I think it's a lot more easier because they no longer use manual transmission trucks.
good,the swift driving school is excellent with great instructors.  Problem is swift was my home time. I lived  in Tucson and had to drive to Phoenix for home time.  It was always hard to drive to Tucson after driving 10 hrs then have to drive home.  i tried to get them to help me but the answer was always....no!  I would have stayed with swift if the would have helped me.
good,"I still toy with the idea of going back, I left because I HAD NO WINTER DRIVING EXPERIENCE which I felt to be too dangerous to be out on the highway. I was also kept away from home for 3 months straight without home time which ultimately was the deal breaker for me personally."
good,Definitely learned a lot since starting here. I moved up in positions quickly while under the right management. I would definitely tell beginners to come here but you would probably move to a different company once you settled on what you wanted to do long term
good,I worked for Swift after I got my CDL A. I was in their 1 month training program they require before they let you go out on your own. Great training program. Always had a nice truck to drive too
good,Not a bad place to work at first. The buy out cost a lot of people their jobs. They also cut our pay. There has been many drivers find or looking for other jobs or companies to drive for.
good,Face paced environment with awesome opportunities to network and to establish professional relationships. The rewards of working with new drivers to the industry far exceeded the decent pay and benefits . 90% travel required. Exceptional benefits for using your own personal vehicle.  To much family in management and  administrative position.
good,I was employed by Swift for 7 plus years. They presented me with numerous chances for success. I took them and excelled. The reason Swift has a bad reputation is due to the labor shortage created by the market and the inability to visually monitor its workforce outside of its own terminals. Swift is forced to employee drivers who would rather use the truck as a home than to actually make money for themselves.
good,Good for new drivers or if never drove. Many academies throughout the country. A good amount of strategically placed offices for support throughout the country
good,Pays well when miles are there. Terminals all over the country. You can go weeks without having to talk to your DM if you want. You can Call and Speak Directly to the load planners and the CSR's.
good,"I am not paid for over 10% of the miles I drive. Even if the mileage they think is right , you still have to add more for stopping and it always comes out to more than what you get paid for. Detention pay isn't great either."
good,You won't get any home time at first. I went from otr to working at Walmart DC but swift is loosing the account and I don't want to go otr with swift because you are out for weeks and they take long time to get you home.
good,"fast paced. juggle work schedules constantly. could be bettor mentors to some of newer  techs. all about numbers and cost."
good,"It was a good opportunity and experience to travel throughout the U.S. for this company. I am grateful for the opportunity work here however, I still continue to look forward to working with a company with more growth and stability."
good,just waking up getting ready for the day hoping the day goes good  doing my pre trip inspection and driving to where I need to be  I have learned that everyday is different  I have learned to manage my time better when you work for some one that will help you with your job you do better work    the hardest part of my job is being away from home would just like to be home more with my current job  I am out 3 to 4 weeks at a time and only home 4 days then back out     the enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and seeing new places
good,"Good pay, but your whole life is in the cab of a truck. The driving is great most of the time. I love seeing new places, especially the undeveloped areas. The hardest part of the job is the isolation."
good,Swift was on ok company to work for but after our driver leaders got changed everything went downhill. The driver leader we were given was a real piece of work. We lost miles and pay because of him and he did not care for his drivers.
good,"Offers an excellent start into trucking. Easy potential to transition into other aspects of the industry such as planning, safety, driver manager, etc. Lays a good foundation to either advance within the company or to use the skills to go to a more desirable company"
good,"its a great company to start off with, management is not so friendly, Not home when you want to be, They give you are hard time to run when you feel its unsafe."
good,Swift is a very huge company and they're pushing out a lot of stupid drivers every day chances are you won't pass their classes because they give a little one on one time
good,I enjoyed driving for this company. I gained experience needed to advance to a more exciting driving job.The mentoring was excellent. You can park overnight in secure yards if near a terminal.
good,swift transportation trained me well and equipped me with all that I need to know about long haul driving.
good,"i loved the job but had to move"
good,I really enjoyed it but I'm one of those that were ment for otr and swift does not like to get you home which was fine by me. .. I started with cr england and moved to swift a month after and enjoyed every minute I was out. .. my trainer for the first month was very helpful and took his job seriously as he was and still is an owner op... He taught me so much more than I learned at england and did it in a helpful way and I can't thank him enough but then after 4 months of being with my team driver I had to go home because of family issues and they would not put me in a local because of lack of experience. .. They wanted a yr of experience for me to drive the rds I drove my entire driving life and 17 yrs with a class b but they were more than willing to send me across the country unsupervised with only the training month from them and the month with england. .. I just don't get it.
good,"Worked here nearly three yrs...Thought I wanted to try another comp so went to crete who payed me more by the mile,but less miles,so pay was about the same. Came to realize I needed a break from trucking after 3+ yrs of missing out on a lot of things"
good,"Cube farm. Normal office setting. "
good,Would definitely go back if I wanted a career in truck driving.
good,"Swift Travel as been Active from past 25 years, And it been serving the corporate companies through transportation for Employes About the company   Good, Co operative , Time Management, Enjoyed Working Everyday"
good,Local supervisors helped drivers as much as possible to do their work. The work rules established by corporate was hard on drivers who had one weekday off each week with 14 hour shifts each workday. A driver could work as much as 70 hours in a five day period and then take a 34 hour break before returning to work.
good,"My typical day starts off by getting to the DC where my truck and that days load is at. I start my day by checking into the DC dispatch office to get a copy of that days BOL for the load and then head over to my truck. Once at my truck I do A pre trip inspection on the Tractor/Truck and then bobtail over to the out bound row where I hook to and pre trip the trailer I will be transporting up to western washington for delivery with the stores needed merchandise. On the way out I usually pass other co-workers on their way out and throw out a waving hand has for there is about 15-20 of us that leave around the same time in the morning."
good,"Working at Swift there was just too much Drama involved. The actual driving wasn't bad, there was plenty of loads to take,but Yous literally had to fight with the terminal managers to just drop your load off"
good,"ok place to work and learned lots of the country, co-workers were great to work with buta bit more down time than you want since you need to be there in the yard waiting for jobs or runs."
good,"Good job if you never need to be home."
good,"They aren't able to keep up with my need for work."
good,"great company to start with, good trainers, great drivers, soso office"
good,This job was rewarding by teaching people that had never drove a pick up truck and in a short period of time were driving a semi truck and pulling a 53 foot trailer down the road. This was a life changing situation for almost everyone I trained.
good,This was my first job where I was asked to leave. It devastated me and left me unsure of myself for many years there after. Yet that was my over reaction to a situation largely out of my own control. My days were spent in a isolated office as was customary when one works with partners in a law firm. I was accustomed to working alone where others shy away as many in a law firm already know the challenges one may face. I worked directly with two partners whose clients were different types of clients.
good,good job.no room to advance up in the company. or make better pay.
good,"Traveled across the states, picking up and delivering different types of goods. Worked with me to get me home for my drill weekend or two weeks off for AT."
good,"Trouble with 1st 2 mentors, 3rd mentor was great.  I learned so much in a short time, got 31k miles in 4 months, home time as requested, hard to get in and out of home state - not much freight in that area, averaged 2,700 miles per week"
good,"My first job as a cdl driver , my mentor was amazing, and overall a great company. I was there for Aprox two years and I enjoyed it. Theirs pros and cons but it’s like any where else. "
good,I worked several years for Swift great people to work for Great trucks to drive great sleepers slow on repair work sometimes the loads are slow due to a great deal of trucks that the company has I won't let you drive and dangerous weather and they keep the truck's updated they have over the road dedicated Regional h a u l s they would try to help you anyway they can
good,o.k. over the road.  Made more money hauling for walmat.  If you can get onto  a dedicated route it's not bad.  I was treated well and kept busy.  Over the road is just like anywhere else.  Your gone for weeks.
good,To make the most money need to take on more responsibility OTR gives you best miles so more pay the longer stay out more money because when go home less flexibility becoming mentor is more money in pocket if can handle it and teams constantly make money.
good,"Bein as my last Position in the Intermodal Division , i was paid milage plus, and not hourly, really sucked i never was happy about that, but my Operations Manager was awesome, and my Fleet manager , him and i didnt see eye to eye, and i worked and the Sumner WA Terminal and they were all down in CA"
good,"I loved working for this company, the leadership change 3 times within my first month, but after that it was very smooth. The company transitions according to the market so as soon as they implement a change, its effective immediately."
good,The demands of the road can be overwhelming but the flexibility of being an owner operator allowed for scheduling family events much easier.  Health concerns was a big factor when deciding to come off the road as a driver.
good,"always helpful and ready to take you to the next level of your career, they were a pleasure to work with and other than I did not want to relocate I would have stayed with them longer"
good,It’s a trucking company it pays low offers the world and gives you very little time home and much of a life and not enough training done overall not great
good,I got my CDL through Swift and I had a good experience with them. Training took a couple months total and is free to you if you sign a contract saying you will work for about a year (can't remember exactly how long) As a team driver or if you are on some of the dedicated accounts they offer you can make pretty good money starting out. Average miles of 2500 a week.
good,"get to the truck check tires for air ,check lights check the rims of the truck for any damge start the truck up then plane the rout for dilever take a 30 hour brank in rout"
good,"I don’t think they know the value of experienced drivers or drivers period! They would be nothing without drivers! Me and my family gave them five years of my life and they terminated my contract for something happened outside of work. Which I hired a lawyer and had it cleared up but they still let me go! "
good,"A typical day at work will consist of me working from 5am to 5pm. Driving from Hershey PA to Edwardsville, Illinois. Working Monday thru Sunday completing between 5-6 jobs of 800 miles on a weekly basis."
good,"I did not like being away from my family. I was away 4-6 weeks a t a time. The benefits were good, but hard being away from my family. It was difficult to take time off."
good,I feel this is one of the biggest trucking companies. It's a great place to work and lean all about trucking. They are looking for new ideas and way to help the drivers.
good,"I loved working for swift. learned a lot and am looking to go owner op."
good,"Pick up truck at the yard and drive route for the day. Learned to drive tractor trailer with this company. Management was alright. was always on the road alone, so there was no culture. Hardest part of the job was dealing with traffic. It was a dedicated, drop and hook which I liked."
good,"too much time over the road compared to time at home, I didn't like living out of the truck. I didn't like driving in bad weather conditions with the large truck"
good,Laid back company long as ur getting loads there no tickets no accidents u won’t ever hear from nobody lol they give u whatever amount of time u need home the driver managers are cool
good,For the most part the office personnel go out of their way to help the drivers be successful.  The level of training that is offered/required is outstanding.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Swift Transportation and appreciated the opportunity, however, my reasons for resigning were due to a personal and professional nature."
good,"Good place to Learn the trucking industry. BIG employer but not big money. Still good place to work . ..  Pretty good equipment and management... A few Autoshifts, but mostly standard transmissions"
good,Work was steady and work environment was satisfactory.  Their truck and trailers were in good shape and I experience only seldom mechanical problems. Terminals are acceptable.
good,"Don't get me wrong, Swift is a good company to drive for. Especially to start at and get your foot in the door to the trucking industry."
good,"Swift was a good job. It paid ok, had good benefits and I worked there 5 years. Unfortunately it is also very dangerous, nerve racking, and irritating. Had to quit from family reasons."
good,traveling across the lower 48 and Canada was the best part of the job. I really enjoy driving and going on road trips. Being paid to drive the tractor and trailer was the best part of the job.
good,Many trainees came and went but those that could handle the demands required for safety and commercial driving went on to have productive careers in the trucking industry.
good,"swift is a good place too start learning the trucking business.you will learn the ins and outs ,you can get good miles but not a lot of home time,if your single and don't mind being a way for long periods of time good place to start"
good,Trucking is a very stressful industry. As a driver you must be available at all hours of the day and night. It strains relationships and causes one to be away from family.
good,As a part time volunteer working with a private contractor with was a nice start. It was a easy job that took time and detail to making sure it was done properly.
good,"loved swift and professionalism, would highly recommend. team driving, competitive pay, and home time. company works with employees to fulfill needs, great place to work"
good,was a great place to work at first.  then it got to the point where they wanted me to drive illegally over my hours and drive while i was fatigued or tired which is also illegal.  i refused so they offered less deliveries to me.  less deliveries meant less financial stability.
good,"I personally loved driving for swift. I found everyone really worked hard to keep the truck rolling. I loved the terminals, and the company. There are a lot of things you SHOULD get paid for, but sadly as the trucking industry goes, you do not.  If you want a professional driving career, they are an excellent place to get your start. Owner op program is a great way to learn the biz if you ever want to consider running your own truck."
good,"If you like being in the truck for days, you can make a decent living. Its just not for me. Upgrading to an owner operator can make you more money, but with more obligations."
good,good place to work great leaders and driver coaches lots of miles flexible schedule great equipment to operate well maintained by good mechanics friendly environment
good,"Swift Transportation was the one and only trucking company I drove for. For what its worth, Swift treated me relatively well. Over the course of my employment, I made great connections and met new friends that helped me along the way."
good,if you are a student coming out of a truck driving school this would be a good company to get your feet wet with they put you with a mentor and if you listen to your mentor you can learn a lot
good,You have a lot of Drop deliveries. The only problem was the companies that you delivered to and from. They are awful to truck drivers. Swift is better than most companies.
good,Constantly moving on routes all over United States. After 3 month trial they wanted to route me away from my home instead of from my home to begin and end at home. They hired me to work from my home and in my region and changed their mind.
good,Swift is a good place to get in the trucking industry.  After getting in the industry and being away from home alot I decided I wanted a change. I need the ability to be home more.
good,"Great leadership team in the local terminal. "
good,"mucha diversidad de personas y eso es bueno, ya que con eso conoces a mucha gente y sus diferente culturas"
good,Swift provided many opportunities to advance within the company.  There was a lot of travel included that proved to be a vast amount of time away from home.
good,"A typical day at work was relaxed and enjoyable. Great equipment, new trucks and trailers. Management involved caring for employees.The hardest part of the job for me was the PM shift, not sleeping. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming home everyday to my loved ones.I loved my job, but due to health issues I had to quit."
good,Got up everyday team dedicated they put me in a tractor with an experience driver with huge miles who rarely ever wants to go home. every day he complained and eventually they switched my account to solo dedicated it was better but the cons where extreme.
good,It's a great job if you want to stay out for weeks @ a time or all week 5 to 6 days. I enjoy working with Swift I just need something Local where I can go home everyday. They have an awesome Academy for training drivers.
good,"I started my driving career at Swift. I do not regret it. If you get a good trainer, your off to a good start. The reason I say it is not a great place to start a career is the pay. Their pay scale is built in such a way that by the time you have 2 years of experience plenty of other companies pay a lot more for your time."
good,Treat your drives like people and you will begin to retain some. Raise your standards. Give more and expect more. Shiny posters don't count. Every corporate idiot on the board should be required to live on a mentors truck and pay bills at home on $300 per week salary. Pay your trainees at least what McDonald's would. Appreciate the mentors who try to train these your recruits with all they have.Its not as if you train us. We do our best. We risk our lives. Don't get mad when they quit because you rip them off. Doesn't mean we didn't train them well.
good,I enjoy working on the computer and I am good at detail work.  I like the group of people I work with. I enjoy what I do. If I was not relocating I would not be leaving this company. But they don't have a office in Indiana.
good,Good training program with a mentor to assist in learning the systems and methods of commercial driving. Very helpful with OTR drivers when on the road.
good,"Being an over the road truck gives the driver the ability to travel across the country and see/experience many new places, cultures and organizations."
good,"Like most companies you have good management and some that are most so good. For this suppose to be a team enviroment, this is not so. There are some people that understand this concept but you seem to find more employees that are not team players."
good,"Decent company, dispatchers are cool most of the time. If you take home time, it might take a week or two to get back in the loop. Don't listen to heresay, swift is a good starting company."
good,Swift is one of the better companies to be employed by. My direct supervisor was awesome and he helped with whatever I needed even if I was venting and I had a hard day. That being said a great number of other driver leaders always sounded like they couldn't be bothered by the drivers.
good,"I liked working for Swift, even though they're a very large corporation they still treat their employee's with respect. Everyone has their own experiences when it comes to different types of companies. Overall, I had a fairly decent experience, and actually would have stayed with the company."
good,"Swift is a good company to work for. Because they are a big company, sometimes the local management or work environment may not reflect the corporate ideals. They maintain their equipment and keep you informed on updates in DOT rules and regulations. They have the miles. You just need a good DM who is willing to give them to you. They have lots of terminals. That was important to me as a new driver. I felt like I was among ""family"" at the terminals. I gleaned knowledge from the seasoned drivers."
good,A typical day can be stressful considering you deal with a lot of complaints. He staff are fun and a great group of people to work with. Don't expect much in the benefit department.
good,"time schedule"
good,"But you need to be ready and willing to deal with life on the road for 4-6 weeks at a time. Getting home is sometimes difficult, as is getting a load in general sometimes. Two years as a lease operator saw me make under $7,500 per year average. This was after taxes and expenses, but still not enough to support a family. If you go to work for them, I'd advise to stay a company driver."
good,Absolutely loved my position here. Compensation was lacking but you are able to make that up with bonus options. Hard work pays off!
good,"Good job security for OTR Driver. If you enjoy traveling the US then this job is for you. I prefer Local and enjoy home time which may not always be possible when scheduled, depending on freight."
good,"Swift really is a great company to start with, and to stay with. When they restructured the pay scale, it made them very competitive. newer equipment, and the company will not allow an unsafe vehicle on the road if the driver communicates any issues. The only downside is management. They seem to be out of touch with the drivers that are making the company money. Always some kind of meeting or sending multiple cliché safety messages daily. If you are decently smart, you can fix most issues on your own. But if you have to call in, be prepared to wait a while, and be transferred all over."
good,"A typical work day consist of getting in truck receiving load instructions and being on you way. Friendly owner, staff, and employees. A good company to be a part of"
good,"Everyday you wake up in a new location as an over the road driver. You have to work hard, pay attention, learn and follow lots of rules, but the pay off is to see the entire country (from the highway) and get to prove yourself in a challenging atmosphere everyday."
good,"It was a challenging place to work, always busy and on the go with daily opportunities to succeed.  It was a place where I could learn the basics of truck driving with room for advancement."
good,"A good company to drive for, but would like to get a short haul driving job to be home more.  Good team driving allows for not such boring trip."
good,safe place to work and a fun place to work. people were easy to get a long with enjoyable part about my job was learning new things
good,"Company gave me a chance to work in North Dakota, furnished transportation and clothing necessary for the job. Swift had a company rep to help with all necessary wares and relationships with company we were contracted to..."
good,"I held several positions at Swift, and learned a lot about the transportation industry. Management seems to stay engaged with their departments and workers. My co-workers shoulder a lot of responsibility, keeping trucks and equipment operating and safe on the roads. I feel the hardest part of this job was getting ""lost in the crowd"". I most enjoyed the variety of experince and knowledge I obtained in my many positions."
good,"Head cook, bartender, Supervisor					"
good,"Everyone there was friendly and helpful. Family atmosphere even though it is a large company. Lots of amenities; gym, health care clinic, on site grill and company store."
good,"Driving for this company was a amazing experience, I got the opportunity to drive across the country to different states and cities to deliver all kinds of products and help supply growing companies. the management system there allowed me to conduct everyday task on my own time an I was to get to the specific location on time and the hardest part of the job was that some deadlines were unable to be met."
good,"Swift is my first and only driving job. I have been here for two years now. Driver ranking system gives fat bonuses quarterly for safety/productivity. I moved up easily through the ranks to platinum in just a year. Super easy...don't be late and don't crash and you get a $1, 000 bonus every three months. Sweet. This is a super easy job and management will bend over backward to accomodate. For instance my grown children live over 120 miles from the closest truck route and so whenever I want to go visit them my driver manager gets with the planners and arranges for me to drop my trailer at a drop lot and then I am allowed to bobtail over 200 miles round trip and Swift pays for the fuel without even a peep about it. Tell me who else would do that?!"
good,"The best part of the job was seeing new areas of the country."
good,A good place to work overall. It's a bit of a commute unless you live on the West side.
good,I enjoyed driving dedicated Wal-Mart grocery. It was busy work and I like to be busy.
good,"Fun to work at, training company. People are very nice but I have to find a local job."
good,"I transported freight throughout the USA in a safe and timely manner."
good,Many sites to see while working as well as challenger type of work.
good,"Swift was a enjoyable job with plenty to learn. I learned about safety rules and regulations, working one on one with drivers and making sure they meet hiring criteria. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the new Driver Dashboard System but after I received the manual it became natural. My most enjoyable part of the job was on Holidays when everyone in the office came together for a feast."
good,good to work for had trouble getting home for home time pay was ok then a yard job came open so i took it
good,"The phone rings continuously and you have to pick up everyone by the 3rd ring, answer incoming qualcom messages from drivers, track customer orders, find another truck in the area if one breaks down, Help drivers who come to the driver window. Keep contact with customers on status of loads. create loads. I have learned how to multitask, prioritize, and organize. Management has to be very organized and very quick or you fall behind and things get out of hand very quickly, you have to manage your time efficiently.I only have 1 co-worker on midnight shift. We are each other's support group. The hardest part of this job is not losing control. It is very fast paced and thing can get out of hand very quickly. You just have to keep your cool and work through it as quickly and efficiently as possible. The part I do enjoy the most out of this job is the people contact. Working with the drivers and the customers is always interesting and some times entertaining."
good,"drive for 11 hrs, deliver freight,meet all types people, drive in all types of weather conditions,get to see the country,and meet new people"
good,"A typical day at work is starting around 7 drive, drive, drive..  Drop trailer at store pick up empty then drive,drive, drive  either to a back haul or dc"
good,"No home time "
good,Swift is a good company to work for as long as there are loads to keep you moving.
good,I had quality training and they mostly kept me productive. I did not care for forced dispatch
good,"The hours were odd, sometimes leaving for a run late at night. Compensation was fair. Management did the best they could to keep me running and making money."
good,overall a big fast growing and moving company. alot of impersonal but you get to know some of the people that deal directly with you.
good,"Good Job except that the management was terrible. We would drive all over looking for an empty trailer or just sit waiting and waiting to hear from someone. It was really ridiculous. "
good,"decent miles,  pay was ok, a little lacking on maintenance but over all not to bad"
good,"I am a very competent, outgoing person always being proactive who is able to meet deadlines and work as a part of a team as well as on my own initiative.  I have a very empathic nature and an ability to deal with people from all backgrounds. I am honest and conscientious with excellent time management and organizational skills. My experience in Customer Service has given me exceptional communication skills and I enjoy meeting new people. I am professional with a very focused approach when dealing with colleagues or clients. I am now looking for a new challenge with the opportunity to learn new skills."
good,"they hire fresh drivers out of school, or you can go to their academy, they have lots more freight than other companies, so you are able to keep moving more than sitting, they have Qualcomm with Gps not the best but gets you to where you have to go most of the time, never had pay issues with them and never had management issues. Very good company to begin with. but not for the long term of your career."
good,"11 hour driving rotation"
good,"Working for this employer was informative and a great learning experience after being in the military for over 20 years.  Learning the logistics of transportation over the road and the spotting was great.  I worked the inbound side of transportation handling the driver calls for accidents, fatalities and hazardous spills."
good,"Administrative duties to upper management, perform payroll and hiring for office and maintenance departments. Complete billing records, set up management meetings, purchase office supplies."
good,I was a company flatbed driver for swift transportation picking up straping/chaining/tarping various products throughout the usa
good,Great company. My department afforded me a flexible work schedule.
good,Not many young professionals but company takes care of its employees. Although politics play a big part in getting work done.
good,Pretrip to Truck/trailer
good,"I felt Swift Transportation was a good company but the problem was that, and that is part of being a truck driver, only one day off per each week you are out there. 3 weeks out = 3 day's home. Not enough time to get all done at home and some rest and see family. Just a hard time being a truck driver for me. Plus I like roots and being home. The company is very good and has a good philosophy, but sometimes the dispatch can have odd thoughts vs. what a truck driver sees out there."
good,Learned much needed skills to provide quality performance
good,looking to finding a new job driving transits on timely shifts. I'm a very hard working person who values her job and very friendly and dependable.
good,"good benefits and compensation,chance to advance,several locations,"
good,"I like working at Swift. they let driver set there own PTA, they have good equipment"
good,"Terminal in Fontana Driver Managers were not as sincere nor professional as those in Phoenix, Arizona Driver Managers and would bend the truth to get me to deliver their load assignments."
good,"In my experience, it was the easiest job I ever had. Only problem, I wasn't willing to endure the office politics that plagued this particular terminal."
good,It is a good place to start but 2 months later and have not received my last check even after calling and going to payroll and still no body has returned my calls or responded and still have not received my last check
good,"One thing that really disappoints me is the continuous monitoring with devices. If your hired to drive a 80,000lbs vehicle and do not have common sense of driving conditions, speeds, distance etc. they should not be driving, which would limit the company’s liabilities. My feeling as a good, safe, courteous, observant driver I'm being over schooled for my professionalism. Swift should levels of experience as other profession do"
good,truck driving is hard and rewarding too. delivering good from one customer to another. have big responsibilities from the truck you are driving and the load you're hauling. The rewarding part is you are your own and your office is the open road.
good,"Swift transportation warehouse work is a fast pace environment. You have to be able to work at stressful measures. Everything is based on proper timing and accurate data, shipping information."
good,"The position is flexible depending on immediate supervisor. Great work atmosphere and very busy work environment if you work in the shop.  Throughout the years, you get a chance to gain more knowledge in other departments due to cross training.  The more confidence upper management has in you to do your job, the more they pile on to you  (meaning doing 2+ person job plus yours).  The compensation is not too flattering after working for 3+ years.  If you're comfortable with what you start with and with your job, then this type of environment would be right for you.  There's also quarterly bonuses as well which again, isn't too flattering either. Also, there are annual reviews, benefits, 401k, Swift Charities, stocks, etc."
good,"This company can be a great one to start out with, or  you can stay here for the long haul. With all the safety bonuses that they have, I really haven't found any other company that matches up to their safety bonuses. I get paid really well for what I do.  They do work with you with your home time and that's a great thing."
good,Lots of freight. Bad Home time.  Always get assigned a newer truck. Alot of terminals. Not a bad place to work. DL can sometimes be inexperienced and not educated on the actual work of Tractor Trailers and Drivers. But its one of the best Mega Carriers you can start out at.
good,Swift is a great company just freight is really slow being that I have bills and a truck payment not cutting it so I’m currently seeking a different plan
good,It was something that I always wanted to do I love driving it's peace of mind and I meant a lot of people and I travel the United States I really enjoyed the job I will go back if I can good management
good,"Your experience is largely dependent on the fleet you drive and the managers above you. Anyone willing to take short runs will be rewarded with a long run, eventually."
good,Never want to give home time and pay you just a lil more than the rest
good,"8 good years, Everybody treated me with great respect. I enjoy working with staff and the Truckers, I learn to treat everyone with same respect personally and professionally, multi task day. good place to work."
good,Working as a truck driver for swift transportation was not what I expected. We were paid less compared to other trucking companies. The pay was the only thing I dislike about swift.
good,"I learnt quite a lot while in the company. However, there was not enough diversity in the company. Most of the workers were from India."
good,"You do get to see the country, but can be very stressful, and unhealthy. Must like to drive, follow all road laws. Don't get to go home very often when you want."
good,I liked working at Swift.  They kept me in good equipment and had plenty of trailers and miles. They are sticklers regarding safety.  I drove single and usually averaged 1500 to 2000 miles per week.
good,The work place was very productive had to meet daily quotas. The managers were always available if we need help even if they had to take over the call.
good,"Aside from my driver manager it was a good place to work. Swift has a bad reputation but many good people work here, the equipment is satisfactory and the pay ain't the greatest but, alright place to work"
good,Enjoyed working with this company for 5 years though they still have a hard time with communication and planning has difficulties at times. Would recommend to a driver that is just starting out
good,I enjoyed my time at swift but was ready for something local... I learned more in the 10 months OTR than any other job I've ever had... Management was always helpful and friendly. the culture was every fast paced always looking  to keep you moving... The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing so much of the country that I'd never seen before.... Ironically the hardest part was being away from my son
good,this company is a great to get a start but so big you do some sitting and to many policies and procedures that tie your hands of making money regional routes are available but limits miles and otr limits getting home to family
good,"I would recommend to new drivers, depending on job given. Experienced drivers steer clear, compensation is well below what we should be getting. On the other hand, it’s steady work."
good,although swift drivers do have a bad reputation in the trucking world its not a bad company to work for.  they have nice well maintained equipment and they have a really good training department for those drivers new to the trucking world.
good,"I drove as a heavy haul for OR, WA and western Idaho region. I could start my week in Sumner, WA and drive to OR/CA border and back while making stops in between. You are on the road and sleeping in your truck minimum of 6 days a week and then off for only 34 hours, and not necessarily at your home. You could end up spending that 34 hours in a truck stops hundreds of miles away from home. The routers were pretty good at getting you home for your 34 hour reset but sometimes there were conditions or runs that wouldn't allow for it. Keep an open communication with your driver routers and driver leaders as this will be very helpful. Most runs were done at night, anywhere from 6 p.m. all the way to up to 3 a.m. so if your night vision or night driving is bad or makes you nervous this might not be the gig for you."
good,management really didn' t care about you long as you delivered the freight. workplace was pretty good working alone and getting the job done. the hardest part was dealing with traffic on the road.
good,Work with co-driver with on time deliveries.  Travel to various locations thru out the east coast.  Stop and eat at various locations from truck stops to nice restaurants.
good,"If you like having a flexible work schedule and you like driving, then you may want to consider this job as your next career move. OTR Drivers can earn competitive wages while driving coast to coast taking in the sights along the way."
good,I worked for Swift for 11 years.  I enjoyed my time there and worked with a lot of great people.  The nice thing about working for Swift was they offered many different shifts and departments that you were able to learn many different aspects of the business as well as have a schedule that would work for you.
good,"They have a truck driving school and it is a good place to start out.  You have to remember that you get out of it what you put in, and don't be afraid to say no to your driver manager."
good,"Beginning the day with planning the route given by sat-com and the conditions of traffic and weather, and hours left to drive on DOT rules."
good,Decent place to work for beginner drivers. My position needs more pay for the area I work in. My driver manager always takes care of our team to get us hours.
good,A productive company to work for with a great environment and good people to be around you get good miles traveling coast to coast and the company pays well going coast to coast.
good,"Awsome company to start a truck driving career with, they train you to get your license give you a job and a opportunity to make money and get your experience"
good,"loved working for swift but they did not have the opening i wanted to be close to my son , other than that i would have stayed i was not fired i left due to my family"
good,It would be better if I made more for the amount of time I am away from home I have a baby that I am missing out on other than that I have no problems every one is friendly. But it is how you make it
good,What I liked about swift is that they are a large company which might provide me with more advanced opportunities than most trucking companies.The only reason that I'm trying to branch out from Swift is because I have a family and another child on the way. I would also like to be able to be home more often while still being able to provide and support  my family.
good,"The days were nice, got to see a lot of new places and things. "
good,"I would say overall good management team, and a safe working environment. Excellent and well maintained equipment, which set the bar high for future trucking companies and their equipment."
good,"I was a trainer/mentor for Swift for 5 years and their training program is very good. This is the perfect way for new drivers to get into the industry."
good,I love it just never got a raise the whole 12 years when guys getting hired came in with Lil to none experience and making more then me...
good,"High stress with unrealistic expectations daily"
good,"10 hour shifts were fast paced and inspection precision. during my time here as a safety lane tech (while attending college full time) I grew in my troubleshooting and diagnosis abilities as well as documentation and mechanical experience.  The hardest and yet most enjoyable part of the job was the independence and trust bestowed upon me and my skills to analyze, diagnosis, troubleshoot and repair"
good,"I enjoy working for Swift Transportation of AZ. I feel that they are more than willing to take on entry level personnel and train them.  However, in the place I work you are kind of dead ended.  There is alot of room for gossip, and things are brought out in the open that are not true.  They have a hard time holding onto office personnel and the atmosphere is contstantly changing. Work schedules, job descriptions, the computer program used between client and provider of services."
good,"From start to finish, a typical day consist of repairing and diagnosing the equipment that comes in off the road. This also includes communicating with the many drivers who are responsible for delivering the loads on time, which is why some are less than enthusiastic when a repair is in need, some of which can take anywhere from 5 minutes to more than an hour. All repairs are done outside and expected to be done as quickly as possible, which can be a challenge when we have a lack of consumable parts on a daily basis. Days are made workable only through the conversations and jokes made with my coworkers, drivers, and the occasional drop in traffic through the terminal."
good,"I went through Swift's driving academy in Phoenix, AZ and then drove for them for about a year."
good,"Truck driver adept at navigation and efficient, on time deliveries. Personable and energic. Depenable and committed to getting each job done quickly, efficiently, and safetly. Air break certification. Heavy hauling. Cargo handling. Safety minded. Map reading expert. Defensive driving. Ensuring compliance with applicable federal and/or state laws, regulations, and/or agency rules."
good,Learned alot from my mentor while on the road for the short time I was there. Basic driving and the conditions you have to look out for.
good,The people that run the shop had experience in the field. The guys in the shop could ask questions to do the job rite the first time.
good,"Hmmmm...... Well Its a hit and miss Company it depends where you are in the national that determent how you are treated. some terminal's there very friendly and would give you their shirt off their back to help you. And their Terminal's that will treat you like well not so much.  The overall care of their Trucks and Trailers are fairly good and good up keep. Their Safety Department is generally on the side of the drivers. Their Human Resource's Department is a so/so.  The Payroll Department will find a error and fix it very fast. The best words of advice i can give for someone interest in joining is. don't rock the boat. And do what you can to make your Dispatcher aka Driver Leader and Fleet Manager happy."
good,"6-10hr work days mostly drop and hooks. The work was easy and simple pay was great . health benefits where great, got me home daily."
good,"Good place to learn driving.                                                                   A very hard job with a horrific turnover rate. "
good,"Great work environment, with strong professional ethics em vision. A place where team work is a true driven force."
good,"Good money, owner op program works really well if it is a team truck."
good,Swift is one of the top carriers and organizations in the industry.  They have strong values that are handled from the top down.  Fast paced.  Always looking to improve.
good,"Good job for the single."
good,"Overall the job was good. Nothing major usually happened and I enjoyed the times, when on a long mileage load, that I could spend attending to my needs and just enjoy the leisurely drives thru the different states."
good,Typical day is making pickups and on-time deliverys all over the USA. Not really any management or coworkers because your on your own in a truck. Most enjoyable part was seeing the country.
good,Driver OTR Pre trip Post trip knowledge CSA 2010 knowledge. Haz Mat and tanker endorsments.
good,"I learned a lot of things ,lot of place, co-worker was good"
good,A typical day of being a truck driver consists of waking up from the sleeper berth. Then you do a pre-trip inspection of your truck and trailer. Then you get in the truck and drive. Keep driving until you have driven 11 hours or reached your destination to deliver the load. Then get out of the truck and take care of your personal needs like a shower and food. Then go to sleep in the sleeper berth. Repeat.
good,Swift stood really strong on the safety aspect. I was instructed to be safe driver.  The hardest part of the job was staying away from home and my loved ones for long periods of time.
good,"The goal is to relax, be confident, and learn as much as possible. Learn from drivers who have been driving for more than five years. Collect endorsements and move up the latter of the industry."
good,I chose Swift Transportation due to their overwhelming success rate at taking individuals from never having driven a manual transmission vehicle to being able to be on the road as a full time OTR driver of a combination vehicle.
good,It was okay working there. I've gotten good training there. The introduction and the rate of training was at a good pass.my  driver leader was the best. If I had a problem she help me through it.
good,I liked being apart of the swift Warehouse team. Great overall experience of course there were rough days but overall great experience difnately would do it again if the pay scale reflected the work load.
good,I enjoyed being employed at Swift Transportation. It was my first transportation company to drive with and my driver leader helped me a lot to carry out my work tasks as well as learn about DOT policies and procedures. My mentor was a great guy out of the Minneapolis terminal.
good,"Long term not the best decision, a great place to get your license and get some experience. start you off as OTR at least for a minimum of six months."
good,"Dedicated account for Clint"
good,"My manager was respectful, helpful and consistant. Okay for a beginner truck driver company. Out 6 weeks so away from family for awhile. Equipment was maintained"
good,"This company treats driver's like numbers because they always have others ready to be trained to put in a truck, and they don't allow for enough home time for drivers with families."
good,"Its a great place to start out if you want to get into the trucking industry. The schools are great and the company is fair. Swift is leaps and bounds from where they were in the past, and have partnered with knight transportation so they have higher standards."
good,The former terminal manager and I just did not get along. The new one is a completely different story. I have visited the office recently and it was surprising how things had changed for the better.
good,I been here 13 years you hear a lot of rumors about Swift dont believe the rumors find out for yourself i found a great spot that worked for my lifestyle but the reason why im leaving is because when they merged with Knight they cut my pay an i dont play that i like to move ahead not backwards that should be illegal but i guess in Texas its not ive lost 4000 bucks since the pay cut so its time to move around but for a beginner its not a bad company they gave me a start an im thankful!
good,This was a great company to work for. This company treated me good. The only reason I left was they relocated and it was too far. I was team with this company and I really appreciate working with such a great company
good,"Swift as a whole is a good company. Like any big company, sometimes driver need aren't met as fast as the driver would like them to be. The pay is good, but sometimes communication can be a problem."
good,I enjoyed my job at Swift. Great miles. Long runs. Would go back in a heartbeat. Had a passenger onboard that was difficult. You had to be there. I typed a message I shouldn't have in order to get her off truck. Lost my job in anger. All I said was she has beer on the the truck. Stupid.  Lost job. Lost home. Lost everything. Oh well. Stilla good place to work. I could actually refuse loads.
good,Swift transport was a great company. Fair wages. Steady work. Id recommend to anyone looking into working for this company. I enjoyed the friendly atmosphere set forth by the other technicians who made me feel welcome.
good,"I was chasing a dream when I started driving trucks. Swift helped me start my trucking career. I had hoped I would still be with Swift; but, they let me go without giving me a clear answer."
good,"Swift may have a bad reputation in the industry, but I find it to be a very good company to work for and they treat you fairly.  They expect you to work - but they pay well and I have found my Driver Leaders to be personally interested in their drivers"
good,I would not say that I would recommend this company to anyone because of what happened to me but it may work for others. I would probably still be there but things happen.
good,"Start with low pay, but they keep you moving. With pay based on miles driven that's a good thing."
good,Swift transportation was a very good job. The job was stressful at times but well worth it. I miss the check every week. I had to leave there because I wasn't able to spend enough time with my 3 year old son.
good,I had great time driving for the short time that I had been with Swift Trucking Company and helping serve the customers with on time and safe deliveries.
good,"It is ideal for obtaining your Commercial Driver's License and learning to drive a tractor trailer. The school was hard, but if you hang in there, it is very rewarding."
good,"When I first started with Swift transportation, I was surprising of how important and not too difficult this was, compared with comment I used to here before I started with them since I was told Truck was a very difficult job to do but in reality, it wasn't like that..."
good,The days are long and routes can be short. there will be weeks where you don't get the miles but there are weeks where you get almost too many. Some of the driver managers are hard to deal with.
good,"Swift is an Excellent place of employment for truck driving. one of the Best."
good,"Great company for those just starting in the trucking industry, with plenty of opportunity to make yourself more desirable to other companies, must work on management tho"
good,It was a little fast paced when big rig trucks came through the safety lanes to get their trucks inspected as in their mileage tire pressures and any lights that were broken to be fixed
good,"In business for a long time, training company. Great people to work with. Managers were great and easy to work with. Training with the company was great."
good,There is a lot of time to yourself without someone over your shoulder but not a lot of time at home. i miss being home! I like seeing the country tho!
good,"The cons of operation would be maintenance at certain terminals.sometimes very slow.idling vehicle in the summer time,no rest with no air.advancement was slow,and as one advances in pay increase,one finds themselfs with lesser miles a week.and some deliveries are next to impossible to make without getting a serviceviolation.service violations are given out without much review."
good,"Great place to work."
good,I learned a ton from my driver manager and others from Swift. The vast majority of the individuals I worked with were great people a couple bad eggs but overall a good company for newer drivers.
good,"Values provided with this company are crucial to their success. Many people on the outside complain about their issues as a transportation provider, however you will find these same issues at any large trucking company. Their compensation is average, but their benefits make up for their pay packages."
good,Swift is a very friendly family oriented company to work for.Living out on the road isn't for everyone. Be sure that the lifestyle is something your aware of before pursuing a driving career.
good,"Good Company to work for.  Swift does a good job of training new drivers for life on the road, company policy compliance and DOT compliance.  Lots of health plan option and 401k."
good,"If you keep in mind that this is the real world, the executives and staff are acceptably competent and the pay checks come out on time.They won't try to get you to violate HOS. "
good,"Good miles low pay good equipment good rider program.home time was fair reason for leaving family mudered needed at home by family.company understanding about why i had to leave "
good,"Decent place to work, good pay, good management, desire more home time, good work flow, managment inclined to help when help is needed, good equipment."
good,"Swift has the employees to help you start a driving career. I never set still unless I wanted to. 2,500 to 3,000 miles weekly as a solo driver. Starting pay is a little low but you won't starve. "
good,I start my day off doing a pre-trip on my tractor and semi. Next the would see where im going to stop pre plan my trip. The hardest thing about driving is the road construction and having the change plans and hurry to find a different route. The most thing the enjoy is driving and seeing different areas around the country.
good,"A typical day would include driving a truck for 10-11 hours. 2-3 times a day you inspect you vehicle and load on the trailer to ensure everything is up to DOT standards."
good,ive had a great driver manager that keep me on the road driving. had no down time. truck and trailers were all in new and descent condition. the pay was also descent.
good,4 years with the company - unable to change schedules even though I'm the most qualified in the entire location.  Driver retention is poor due to freight volume and they are not offering raises this year.
good,"This company is an excellent place to gain experience for the trucking industry.  The pay package is below average, and there isn't much room for growth or advancement.  "
good,nice people to work for they sent me to different places all over the world i learned a lot from other co workers they where ok to work with.
good,"I gotta say, for as big as Swift is, I'm impressed with how well I was treated there.  The pay is low, but they do try to work with you, and if there is an emergency at home, they work hard to get you there.  Great place for a new driver to start their career."
good,I want to thank the Houston driver managers and office staff for making my work experience with swift outstanding.  I was able to gain the knowledge needed to become a mentor
good,the pay is good but it comes at a price to the family. It is hard on families with small kids. I missed a lot of birthdays. Christmas is the only guaranteed holiday.
good,"I think I really made the hiring managers day when I told him I didn't have anyone at home because once they had me out on the road, I never got home. Which is good for making money but after months on the road with a break you can find that your sense of humor about the people driving around you disappears. "
good,Vary Stressful at times but rewarding to make deliverys on time. Seeing the country side was a bonus. Love the newer trucks Swift provides to their drivers. Down side your responsible for accidents out off your control in Swift eyes. But I did have a excellent dispatcher.
good,"Swift is a great company to start your introduction to transportation. I attended the school and entered into the workforce eager-ed to be trained to be a safe driver.  Training was intense and challenging at time but in debt and necessary. For someone wanting to be introduced into the transportation industry and needing to go through training, Swift would be a company I would recommend. I have traveled around the world to many countries on business and leisure and I have now had the opportunity to travel to 45 states  and Canada by working for Swift. That's one thing less left on my bucket list. thanks Swift!"
good,"Good company to work for, however the computer will site you citation for over-speed when coming down mountains."
good,"Driving most of the day, picking up loads, delivering loads, refueling, checking for loads.  How Swift operates as a large trucking company. Management is professional. Co-workers are professional and friendly. Downtime, away from home for long periods. Experiencing the diverse nature and beauty of our nation."
good,"Never a dull moment, always a challenge. Booked & scheduled freight for National Account customers. Also dealt with complex problem solving."
good,Accept your routes and plan your trips.
good,Typical day consist of driving and delivering freight. We also kept a log book which was very important
good,never short on work always busy. most of the people are good to work with and for. good variety of jobs.
good,Overall a good company. Never had any issues with my managers. They treated me with respect.
good,"Very good company, enjoyed my co-workers and management. Left because of reduction in force. I was one of the last ones hired."
good,"good starter company, could be better else where. I am a very new driver. so I don't know and not interested much on how they are rather than, getting myself together to start everything on my own."
good,"My normal day i would inspect my truck, plan driving routs, keep log books."
good,this was a productive place to work. plenty of miles and good benefits. new equipment and well maintained
good,The company was good. It was a good learning experience for me. I had to cut it short because i have a family member at home with cancer and I am the only family that can take care of her
good,Great company to work for as long as you don't give them any garbage. They did their best to make my life easier by giving me a local job.
good,i could not be gone over the road for the expected amount of time they were asking.
good,overall good company to work for
good,"Good.place to work, nice atmosphere. I have nothing else to say"
good,good company and they have a lot to offer . pretty good eqiupment and enough time allowed to get your job done.
good,If you’re interested in this industry this is a good foot in the door the people there are great (at least my location in Phoenix) it’s very easy to wake up and want to go to work because of it and management was great and actually tried to be involved  with employees. The position is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. The pay is the only thing I didn’t like other companies pay a bit more plus commission
good,Perfect for new drivers a great stepping stone for new CDL drivers. Don’t expect a  massive paycheck. Remember what you joined for and you will be just fine
good,"the best part i enjoyed about driving was getting to see the different states and all the sites. the hardest part of the job was making sure i didn't back into anything, but in the 5 yrs that i worked for them i never had a ticket or a wreck."
good,great work place for entry level mechaincs to get a feel for the diesel world and how it works.. only issue is no room for growth currently.. and micromanaging is at an all time high
good,"Driver Managers are the key to happiness at Swift. If you have a good relationship with yours, they will work as hard for you as you do for them.  If you have a sour experience, call another terminal, or ask for a new Driver manager before giving up on Swift.  I was offered a local position outside the company otherwise I'd still be there."
good,Good equipment.  Descent drivers and trainers. They have different accounts to choose from. Most of the good ones are down south. Local intermodal seems to pay very well.
good,Good start for drivers who are looking for a schedule route. I learned to be a professional driver with a value and thank Swift for teaching me how to be professional.
good,Great place to start your trucking career or even stay with swift. They have good equipment great benefits 401k. And great miles if you want them. And also have a good safety bonus.
good,"Swift has been good to me. Keeping in mind that your not their for the drive managers, your their to learn and earn income. With that mind set you'll love it."
good,"For anyone complaining about lack of time off, welcome to trucking. Management has worked with me across the board. If you want miles, be prepared to work. This is a large company decent pay and benefits.  I have been with Swift for almost 2 years and intend to stay."
good,"Over all Swift is a great start for a new driver, they are very safety conscience and they do try to work with you in all aspects of your job so you can get better and do better as a driver."
good,I loved working for Swift. My hours were great and the people I worked with were like family. We kept busy and helping the drivers with nay problem was always fulfilling
good,"As a trailer mechanic you'll have a lot of opportunity to get into diesel work, refridgerated trailer work etc. Cool people and well equipped shops."
good,It was an environment that shared the thought of 'be recognizable'. Steady work and great opportunities for different routes/miles/pay. Management was not good all of the time.
good,"I injoyed working at swift , I did my research I knew what to expect, I got my experience time to move on to something with the home time I want but no real complaints"
good,Swift Transportation is a great company to work for. Relaxed atmosphere and friendly knowledgeable people Following Core values that made Swift the mega company we see today!
good,Taught me the all the functions of being a commercial driver. Management was always willing to work with me and provided plenty of help in situation I didn't know how to handle. Hardest part of the job was the people in planning department not seeing the whole picture which can cause problems that wasted company time and personal time.
good,"good training. long hrs, great pay if you are a safe driver and work. about the same as most. work ok about the same as others trucking companies. it is what you make it."
good,Coworkers take the time to teach you what was needed. Fun people to be around. Overall a helpful place to be able to grow in confidence and expand your knowledge.
good,"I liked that it  gave me the opportunity to see the whole country an the beauty all around us. however, people you care about so far from you is difficult to bare."
good,Working for Swift was challenging and rewarding. I thoroughly enjoyed driving and seeing the country. Because of this job I got to see most of the US and Western Canada. Most of the time it was fun. Once in awhile it got old being gone from home so much. Management treated me well and if had been able to stay I would have had opportunities for advancement.
good,"When you enjoy driving and traveling on a daily basis, this is the job you want, but it comes with a lot of responsibility. There is really no time off that you want. You really travel for the needs of the organization and not necessarily for your convenience. I did travel across the US and did get to meet up with friends that I had not seen in years."
good,"Swift has a legal dispute about intentionally under-paying there employees. So when I mentioned about cost of living and feeling underpaid, that's why.Also I noticed that they always would claim the route was shorter than what it was."
good,"Great training, certain terminals need a little work on business and professional work ethics. Sad to say harassment in every way is what destroys a lot of careers and longevity with the transportation industry."
good,"good company, with good management job security, but a lot of time away from home."
good,"Working at Swift was generally relaxed.  I already had dispatch experience, but I did get trained on load planning.  Knight Transportation bought out Swift last year, and they are making changes in scheduling, which no longer fits my life needs."
good,"Job is long hours but it’s great pay, benefits are ok. Management has its ups and downs but overall pretty good. Trucks are in great condition, never had a breakdown."
good,"Great job, Swift offered fair pay and a good work environment with lots of benefits. The terminal lead was untrained and did not know how to manage thus the terminal was closed."
good,While at swift it was good to know that the company wasnt going any where or that there wouldnt be work. Very routine everything was done the same day in and day out. Of course surprises now and then and we got busy but nothing too crazy. Reliable.
good,"I loved to drive, especially the responsibility that comes with it. I take in great consideration to always be on time to work. I like meeting new people."
good,some days you could have a good day and get plenty of loads and others just two loads and you working til six o clock . I hated when you have to sit and get loaded it takes forever and the appointment time might be day old .
good,"Initially the job seemed pretty laid-back, but once I became knowledgeable of the department I was bombarded with numerous task from multiple people. Supervisor has no understanding how much time assigned task take. Some expectations are completely ridiculous. The job is pretty secure, they aren't quick to fire you, but get accustom to being critiqued constantly"
good,company gets a bad rap what I did which was regional I liked it the manager was great was able to set my own schedual worked 5 days a week then home on weekends  good pay as long as the wheels were turning
good,Just like almost all trucking companies.  You get out of it what you put into it.  Do your job well and you will be rewarded for it.  You can advance if you really want to .
good,"This is a company I do not want to leave and I am going to give them the opportunity to keep me but I am looking to increase my pay and it might be very hard to accomplish with Swift. Swift Transportation has been a very good company to me I learned how to drive with them and they trained me and help me through difficult times in my life I have nothing bad to say about this company other than , no overtime or double time straight pay hours only"
good,In my year and a half working for Swift I am satisfied with the company overall.  I have worked for more companies than most people think is proper but to my advantage I have enough knowledge about the differences between good and bad companies that I could write a book on it. I also know what to expect out of them as well as what they look for from employees or contractors.  That being said Swift ranks up with some of the best companies I ever worked for in my opinion.  This certainly does not mean that they don't have much to improve upon but that they are constantly working on it.  There is plenty of opportunity to learn and advance as a driver and if you want to change direction all together and take a desk job they are delighted to give you a shot and are large enough to accommodate many of your needs.  For those like myself that dream much bigger Swift is an awesome starting point to build upon and know that if you leave the nest in good standing and you happen to fall Swift is that home nest that welcomes you back home.
good,It is Fast paced environment with daily problem solving opportunities. The day goes by extremely fast and the quality of coworkers is great. the best part is helping driver be successful in their duties
good,"If you recently got a CDL license but can't find a driving job because lack of experience, then try Swift. Excellent for those just starting in the transportation career."
good,"Employees are expected to do flawless work without question. When mistakes happened, favoritism was involved. No room for advancement even with college degrees."
good,"Love working as a transportation coordinator/ECT, I enjoyed working and connecting witb carriers as well as drivers. Miss you Swift. Our Department laid off due to company merged  with Knights Transportation."
good,I didn't mind working for swift but its a job you don't want if u have a family and kids you'll be working a lot you'll hardly see them. but it was a lot of fun working there driving all over the states
good,Good job  good job steady work guy don't like to be alone that I work long hours be away from home and family need to be on your toes all the time watch out for other people keep it safe record and you'll do just fine as a truck driver at Swift
good,"Good company to work for, depending where you work my be room for advancement. Good support base from management. Good benefits package is offered. Pay could be better."
good,"Swift was pretty good when it comes to bringing your spouse. I did when I worked there. I did get along with my supervisor and benefits were good. Can be very exhausting and boring at times...especially when driving a lot but you get breaks. However, what I didn't like that sometimes they would give you short distance load which makes you little money. There were times when you have to wait for awhile or longer to get another load. Which can be frustrating because you only get paid when your truck is moving. Other than that, Swift is an okay company to work for."
good,"A typical work day Is dealing with a lot of drivers with different personalities that all have to be assisted."
good,the management at swift treated me fair I made decent money had to be gone 3 weeks to be home 3 days. I liked the rider program that made being home so long easier.
good,"Swift transportation is a great non prejudiced place to work. If you are healthy and comply with d.O.T. Regs, they will put you to work. Thanks swift for being my second career three times in my working history.Fuul line of benefits as well. They aren't always perfect, but neither am I."
good,Swift driver terminals are the best. They are like truck stops but better. They have a great benefits package. They take very good care of their trucks and expect their drivers to do the same
good,This job was great on most fronts. when it came to teamwork and leaders there was no problems. It was a fun environment since you work along side some one. You would have company to keep you entertained. The leaders were fair and would try to help you when needed. overall the job in it of itself was not that bad. The issues comes when the work is not guaranteed daily. Even if you are among the top (the ones that always get called no matter what) you may find yourself getting a call to not go to work. Not to mention where the leaders are helpful the supervisors are less then that.
good,"I worked for Swift over 23 years and loved my job there. We were family. I started as an entry level admin and worked my way to upper management. You work hard, everyone does. They run lean. That can lead to problems. You can be too focused on fire fighting and miss the big picture. The people were the best and worst part of the job."
good,I have no complaint whatsoever about Swift. Just need to be home more with my family. I love the fact that I'm alone with nobody over my shoulder every minute of the day. It's almost not like work because everyday you wake up and do your daily routine without ever speaking to anybody UNLESS a problem occur or need another load.
good,"Seems slow on freight, drive all day Friday looking for empty trailer. Drove Saturday to get empty trailer, by time i get loaded trailer I have burnt 2 1/2  hours of driving time, and supposed to deliver that night which was impossible . I ran out of drive time. Late on my first dispatch. Still waiting for second load at truck stop been sitting for almost 34 hours."
good,"working for swift is not hard at all as long as your dedicated to run hard, management is very respectful and understanding, never really had any problems with swift I really enjoyed working for them and with them"
good,"Prefer not to say, swift as a whole is a good company to work for, they do hire and keep some idiots though. the job isn't demanding but management is more than can be desired...."
good,"1) arrive at shop to get location and where to go for run and get semi and hook up truck and check truck lights, etc and drive to location from 3 to 4 stops and return empty to DC and inspects tractor and return keys to office"
good,Mi consejo seria que haya mas colectivo que lleguen a la empresa.
good,"Good people very caring light and fun atmosphere. Learned people skills and supply chain. Good benefits, decent pay, but long hours good PTO hours."
good,This job requires several months of OTR.  At first you will be gone for weeks at a time.  It is a great place to start a truck driving career.
good,"I loved this job for many reasons it was a fun experience for me, I love driving and I love going to different places. I learned a lot of time management skills here and learned how to use it wisely and productively. I always made sure the freight would arrive on time and safely."
good,"Benefits are great and inexpensive.  The only real downside is that my work week is extremely unpredictable, which makes it hard to plan for a social life."
good,"En tant que secrétaire de direction, je planifiais les journées de mon patron, je lui préparais les réunions, j'assistais aux réunions et prenais les notes de la réunion que j'envoyais à tous les présent."
good,"This is not a job for everyone. You need to be quick on your feet, and be able to resolve issues. No matter what anyone one tells you, this is a job that you can't be picky on which loads you want. decline too many loads and you'll find yourself sitting in a truck stop for a very long time while your load is given to someone else."
good,"Typical workday for managers starts anywhere from 5 am to 7am. As on onsite manager I worked from 5-3. These hours however were dependent on if you accomplished certain tasks. Otherwise you were in earlier the next day. Management was their. I had a boss who always was their for me until the very end. Co-workers were great, It was more of a team environment. Hardest part of the job would be attempting to accomplish all the tasks to satisfy your drivers an boss's. The most enjoyable part of the job was you made alot of long lasting relationships with the drivers."
good,"Each morning I would conduct pre starts with different sections of the business, Informing of current safety hazards and any up coming weather events, "
good,"very supportive company, they will train you and get you on the road making ok money."
good,Sorting pallets and driving forklift. Working with cool co workers and having a nice boss.
good,"I work from 6am to 6pm, and my typical day is planning freight on drivers that are in my scheduled areas and will be able to pick up and deliver on time, with the utilization of there d.O.T hours."
good,Money is ok ... equipment is new and system is in place to keep you moving so you can get your miles
good,"Good overall company to work for, plenty of work, but spent to much time away from family."
good,.Great Place but long hours. I would recommend this company to friends and family..
good,"a verry good traing company"
good,"You wake up, you pre trip, and you floor it to get to we're you need to go. You have no time for breaks, only to get to your destination."
good,I only had one problem with this job and that was i was on a hire list that would have took 3+ yrs to get hired on.
good,"Working at Swift Transportation was enjoyable! From my co-workers to my superior managers, we had a great time supporting each other as we supported our drivers to ensure effective production."
good,good company with nice people for the most part. had some issues with home time but for the most part consistent. the only bad issue with the company is they dont pay their drivers anything close to what drivers deserve.
good,I really enjoyed the work and the office staff did work to help me get my part of the logistics done out of Minneaplois and moberly Mo ofiices. there were other offices that did nothing or treated the drivers like they were the bottom of the food chain. I understand them had little Idea of what the driver was doing but the way they handle those persons was poor. In the south it was even worse( GA.LA.MI) were they had a strong class division.
good,This is more of a training company. Not real good for someone who already has training. No miles =no pay.
good,Great driver manager..dispatchers were good once you developed a rapport with them
good,"It just didn't work out, I was involved in a couple of minor accidents over a 3 month period and they have a 2 strike and your out policy. I wasn't going over 3mph in the first one, some other trucker was illegally parked at a truck stop and I nipped him with my trailer. The second one wasn't even my fault; some elderly lady turned into me as we both were turning right after the red light turned green."
good,"You may hear some flack from drivers about moving to slowly but you will never have a problem if your the conscience and courtious driver your suppose to be out there on the road, I didn't !"
good,"The work truck's were very well maintained ensuring efficient delivery of customer loads."
good,Nice friendly job really like itDedicated to CostcoFleetthe Costco account is nice and everyone and help anywhere they can to make your day that much better and thanks a lot really like working like that
good,"Hardest part is being away from home"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Swift and learned a lot.  I had to chain up a lot my first month solo, which was a steep learning curve for a new driver. I saw a lot of the USA, which I enjoyed."
good,Needs to sometimes understand little more that certain things not in drivers control. Understand also that life can change certain paths for so its out of their control.
good,"I really loved working with Swift, I was employed for 3yrs driving over the road, then moved from US to Canada it was to costly to reapply for CDL here in Canada, I would love to come back either as a Driver Manager or a Driver."
good,Class room and OTR training Mentor training request.  Contuine with a Company Driver Owner Operator position with refresher training.  Interested in management training claims agent company investigator and Driver Manager opportunity.
good,"When I joined as a driver in 2006, I wouldn't have guessed I would join the office. I stayed for the people (culture). now they are closing the Minnesota terminal and relocating is not an option for me."
good,"It's a pretty steady pace. Once you get into the groove of things, you know what's going on, how certain people will be, who you can count on. It's a good environment, we're like family. It is a stressful and fast paced job, however it's also very rewarding. The worst part is sending reports and the best part is getting to know the drivers."
good,"People are friendly, and atmosphere is open and inviting. They do listen to people when discovering an issues with any processes. They do ask for your opinion on matters that might affect you."
good,A day filled with driving over the road talking to a driver leader and also dealing with heavy road work and other cars getting to and from shippers and finals
good,"Incredibly stressful, always busy. Multi-tasking on steroids!  Very little time for personal life. I'm either working or sleeping. But... You are compensated well and the people and atmosphere are everything."
good,Swift transportation gives new drivers every opportunity to learn and grow into safe professional drivers.  Management is very helpful and supportive.  The hardest thing for new drivers is to be away from home.
good,Swift Transportation is a really good company to work for. The managers I have had have been previous truck drivers which really help the situation if I ran into any issues. The management at the terminal I am based out of is really awesome and they totally care about each and every driver and help them with whatever they need to help them succeed.
good,"Easy to read on a qualcomm with the communication.  keep you busy on the road after get load and unload.  I hate ""live unload"" because one company warehouse WINCO sucks!! take you to waiting for more than 5 hours until finish unloading."
good,"Swift actually surprised me, offered me dedicated accounts, good cpm, and catered to me when I needed it the most. They gave me a great local account where I easily made $1500 a week and off weekends. Eventually went OTR for a very great driver manager, paid for me to get my TWIC card and gave me the easiest well paying routes I could ask for. Literally went from Phoenix to LA, to Otay Mesa, to Mt. Pleasant South Carolina in that order. Never touched the freight and never broke a sweat. Never dealt with weight issues or worried about scales. Hauled 40ft containers for Bose. Literally the easiest job I’ve ever done. Only left to try out the oilfield job, other than that, I HIGHLY recommend joining. Equipment couldn’t be newer, basically ask for a new truck, and voila, you have one."
good,"I worked the local Wal-Mart account. You get paid salary$195 a day plus stop pay $20 each. You make about $260. A day. You can work anywhere from 4 hours to 12 hours a day and still get the same pay. When the weather is bad, and the product gets stuck on the other side of the mountain, you still get paid for the day. I liked it alot."
good,"They are exceptionally productive with a good balance between professional work ethic and humor, they prioritized safety and old fashioned work styles, IE. they preferred to to change tires via bar method."
good,Swift is a good company to get experience in otr driving. The management will work with you too make sure you are doing the job well. Pay and benefits are pretty good.
good,I know many drivers who have started with Swift Transportation. I went to their driving school and did some owner operator work with them too. They will keep you rolling and the lease purchase program was pretty good too. Wish I had stayed long enough to own my truck.
good,I learned much of the real world after truck driving school. The company really takes care of you and honors home family time. But management could improve.
good,great and fun place to work and learn work experience good people that are willing to take the time to teach and direct the willing in positive way .if you dont know this is the place .
good,"Be positive, open minded and just do your job. Be honest with all your drivers and the relationship will come. The better the relationship the less turn over you will have."
good,Fast paced environment and team oriented workplace. Great management and excellent incentives. Comfortable atmosphere with potential for growth and advancement.
good,"Had a great experience with this company. Co-workers were more like family. After the terminal I was working at was shut down, I was allowed to retain my employment with the company but had to commute 3 hrs to next closest terminal."
good,"Hardest part of the job was:  preventive maintenance work, the most enjoyable part of the job was mounting and dismounting tires.  As far as workplace culture, from  what I could see, employees seemed happy at work."
good,"I'm on a dedicated account with Swift, I use to really enjoy the position but now it's really slow due to load cancellation. I use to work a average of 60+ hours a week now I'm working about 40, other then that I like the job."
good,I've been  with swift going on 7yrs I have a family that has extra needs and they have always been  understanding when I  started I didn't know  anything about repairing trucks and trailers it was all new to me and a new career in which I  took a pay cut to futher myself and build a career and like I said 7yrs ago a pay cut and now I'm about $0.15 away from my last job money isn't great but I am still  here and still  hopping to move up some day
good,loved driving truck and getting my own the student where scarry to drive with but did lots of west coast snow ice rockeys if it was bad weather I probably got stuck in it or chaining tires
good,"Good people to work with the nights so times are long slow hours. "
good,Worked there 6 years. It was a pretty good place to work. Great people there. A lot of stress right now though due to the merger. I still think though that Swift has a great future ahead.
good,They lost the dedicated accobut at Wal-Mart's and I really don't wanna go over the road.  The pay is real good. Just need turn trucks up. Don't like the cameras in truck. It was ok to work for.
good,Relaxed place to work. Nice people and good benefits. Not a lot of room for advancement but the pay is fair. Management is nice and not peolebwork together well.
good,I would definitely recommend to new drivers. Excellent pay rate for new drivers. Driver training available. No vacation. Unpaid time off. Home time weekly.
good,"Swift is a great company to start with for OTR drivers whether you are solo, team or an owner operator.  I would think that it would have worked better for me if I could have stayed away from home longer than a month at a time."
good,The company is more worried about the driver than the whole company with all these employees there is more to the company than just drivers and the not knowing of what will happen with contract disputes
good,"Love the dedicated job opportunities for raise,very safe work environment, acknowledge their employees safety as a driver, by awarding with certificate,medals, driver appreciation cookout/dinner ...etc.."
good,I will recommend whoever want to become a truck driver to this company. because this company is better for the start and also Swift  has good academy.
good,Few complaints. Good environment. Just couldn't adapt to the lifestyle. Was used to an active lifestyle and couldn't find the time to exercise. Gained lots of weight and developed degenerated disks and IBS.
good,Good people to work with. Management was very understanding and open. Work load was very reasonable. Very good equipment to work with. Loads were nicely put in trailers.
good,Great job good people management and co workers you learn a lot from people you work with daily day begins at 5am to 5p sun-wed no hard parts to the job enjoy working and making a living best part of the job
good,"I started as an OTR driver and transitioned into a regional position. I did not like the OTR at all. The pay was not stable, and my driver manager had a hard time getting me home for my scheduled home time. Right now I only driver regional and am home everyday. Being a salary driver and home everyday is pretty good. Can't complain"
good,"I enjoy working at Swift because of the team and the tools I have to support my drivers. I have worked there both as a fleet leader and a driver, and have grown in my role at Swift."
good,This company in my option is a good one they help you from the bottom up there are a few flaws in there starting program but it is a big company. you just never get to be home
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Pay is ok for starting out. Route is what I like because I am able to get home, if need be, within a day or two. My driver manager is great."
good,Home daily start my runs early around 5a.m -6 a.m pick up load in Plainfield CT and deliver the load to a location somewhere in the New England area..
good,"Great for a starter driver like i was, the mentor ship program lacks a lot, but use the time to ask questions and practice as much as you can. Best advice is try and drive for someone withing the company, because as a company driver you wont make a lot of money."
good,See parts of the world you have never seen before and it's nice staff for the most part and you get treated right and basically work at your own pace
good,My coworkers are awesome (including the drivers)!                                                                                                                                                                                                                              .
good,"These guys were the best company I ever drove for. Yes they have the same issues all trucking companies have but overall I was treated well. They are the largest company in North America for a reason - despite their flaws, they know what works. "
good,"Loved working with the drivers."
good,"Swift hired me right out of truck driving school and my experience with them was nothing but pleasant.  I learned a lot about this industry and was able to advance quickly as a mentee, mentor and then an owner operator.  I had a great experience as an OTR driver and I learned a lot about how to run my own business.   The hardest part of my experience was being away from my family for extended periods of time but otherwise it was rewarding for me because of how much I learned which is why I am the confident and professional driver I am today."
good,Great company to work for willing to work with employees home every weekend sometimes durring week great start for new cdl drivers
good,It had good days and its bad days but overall this is a good company to work for. This company cared as much for their employees as they did there customers.
good,"my tenure with swift Transportation was a life learning experience , that's where I started my operations carrier. it was instrumental in teaching me, work skills, customer service skills and management skills. it was the first big company I had worked for. the management was great in the beginning  when it  was smaller. I was able to work and learn all aspects of operations in transportation field. ."
good,"Nice place to work, instructors are informative. Learned to drive a big rig and be comfortable making deliveries. Sometimes you can be paired with someone who is not in your age group and you have to be understanding."
good,i drove for him and as long as i did what im supposed to do i was fine i did my job and meet all my goals. never late never rushed never had an anccident in a little over 4 yrs stayed in same company. great with customers. not and average looking women driver. i stayed fit when can i traveled arcoss states and my bonus was having free time and ate the best foods that my boss paid for. thank u
good,One of the biggest truck driving companies in the U.S. This company does training to obtain your commercial drivers license.
good,"Since beginning in November 2014, I've had the opportunity to learn several new facets in the transportation industry. I enjoy working with new people and learning new aspects of the job. A lot of on the job training and internet classes which helps with the process. Glad I had the opportunity to work here."
good,Followed company guidelines to supervise nightshift drivers.   different managemnt style than what I was used to.   Offered me the opportunity to expand.
good,"Swift taught me well but you get tired of always being away from home. You are away from your family and friends for very long periods of time. You can make good money ,but you never home long enough to enjoy it."
good,Good place to start for new drivers or those who are looking into getting their commercial license. They have their own academy and you are placed with a mentor fairly quickly after getting your license.
good,"As an O/O, you can pick your routes, time off, and what you want to do. Pay could have been better had I taken anything offered.  Enjoyed working there, but home time was limited in order to pay for lease on truck.  Had to be rolling frequently."
good,Great place to work good managers Just don't get a lot of home time.
good,A typical day of work consist of performing preventive maintenance to equipment.  Communicate with driver leaders and vendor to set up pickup and delivery schedules.  Plan your route and safely transport freight.
good,I started in February and I had some bump  in the road but my Fleet Manager and Driver Manger got me on track. I had a death in the family and presently home awaiting a procedure for my colon and they have been there. They only thing that can be change all truck driver get paid for holidays.
good,Make your own hours. Drive the continental U.S. 70 hour work week.
good,Working here is initially tough but when you get it is worth it.
good,Here I had to pick up tie down and safely transport materials from one destination to another.  I learned how to properly tie down and tarp loads.  I learned how to navigate the U.S. Highways in a safe and timely manner.   Didn't get to see much of co-workers much unless we were picking up or dropping off at the same places.  We then would help each other out with loads to get the other driver on the road quickly.  The manager was great.  She always kept me rolling and got me home when I needed to be there.  The hardest part of the job was being away from home for long periods of time.  I really enjoyed driving and seeing the country.
good,"Easy to work for. Took care of me while deployed. They have dedicated routes, regional and OTR. Start your day with a pre-trip inspection then roll out to pick up your load (333 miles away). Its just you and the open road. Pick up your load and head to your delivery destinations "
good,"They give a lot of new drivers a chance and so they have a bad rap for it. All in all they are not a bad place to go, I had a better offer so I left, also I lived about 200 miles from the terminal so made a long drive on weekends off."
good,im still employed here currently I love the job wish the hours were not so demanding and the pay was a little better. all in all I would recommend to other job seekers
good,"The training was really exciting and a little scary, when you are training someone who has never driven on long trips before. I learned"
good,"Management was professional and responsive.  Some favoritism in Terminals, but overall a good company."
good,company gave employees the room for advancement. great scheduling for the working parents. open door policies for those whom needed help from the management team.
good,Good equipment and environment. High terminal count allows convenience.
good,"Job was hard in the beginning but quickly grew on me. I was switched around constantly from daytime shift to nightshift and was given constant overtime. Although this was happening, management did not want to hire more personnel. This led to overwork which eventually got most employees fed up."
good,"It is a very good company to work, co-worker are just fine, you learned about transportation and some mechanic."
good,"There has been a lot of bad talk about this company over the years. I spent 8mo with them, and enjoyed every moment."
good,As i get my day started as a truck driver. I get up everyday at 4am to make my delivery on time. Never had a Service Failure on a load. I love driving truck because love seeing the kids eyes light up to see i big truck and to see people eyes when the see what inside of a truck.
good,"Check emails, go over the transition sheet to make sure alll priority loads are dispatched. Reply to any break screen messages and request update trailer sheet."
good,Typical day was driving and loading and unloading the truck. Making regular inspections of the truck and loads when needed.
good,Swift has huge opportunity for advancement. Upper management is very supporting and will help guide you to success.
good,"The company is supportive and is always concerned for my safety.  There is no home time policy, so take as much home time as you want. But if the truck is not moving then neither is your pay."
good,Nice Job. Pay Scale is a bit too low. You do have a steady work flow of travel. I enjoy working for the company and traveling. Traveling and seeing new places are always great.
good,Swift is a good company to work the only thing some of the dispatch some time the trying force you to pick up a load at the bad winter condition I love Swift transportation
good,It was a good stepping stone to start with swift I like the company they treated me good gave me some good loads. I just want to make more for my family .
good,Good company overall. They care about driver safety and office employees welfare. I have learned how to deal with stress and different cultures and attitudes and genders.
good,"Swift was an excellent place for me to start my career in trucking. Contrary to popular belief, the academy training was superb. The mentor training was tough but made me ready to be on my own. The equipment was almost always in good shape and they did not skimp on maintenance. The miles were there, if you didn't turn down loads. The pay was not great,  but with no experience, it was more than enough."
good,"I valued my time at swift, and worked with many different people. The work was interesting and with the change of owners and systems it was always challenging."
good,"Enjoyed working at Swift"
good,"I was lucky to have a very positive experience with Swift. The Lewiston ID terminal staff is top notch and they really care about their drivers. I would have stayed longer, but had to stop driving due to a family emergency; which they were very compassionate and understanding about."
good,Everything was okay accept a few things I didn’t like but overall It was good they took a chance in hiring me and when I had to be hospitalized for 2 weeks they held my job for me
good,"Real good company to work with every one is helpful and  friendly, they check on you to make sure you are ok. I recommend  them for anyone. Orientation  was great and very informative  listen to your trainer ask a lot of questions  and you will do great"
good,"My dispatcher was very excited to give me loads, I enjoyed his enthusiasm. Most of the fleets are automatic transmissions. The load themselves being dished out at first will be short runs, but over time the miles start to stretch."
good,The company is a great company to get started into the driving field. They have schools to achieve your CDL and training that is nessacary out on the road to operate the equipment properly.
good,I liked working for swift! Unfortunately I got really sick and couldn't work for a while. They were under standing about that. If I could work there again I would. But for now I can't work regional. I think I  will look into some local work in the future.
good,Good company to work for sometimes it can be hard sit will you unload the truck cuz of people where you're at. Know how to do it properly the stores you go to take forever to unload supposed to be 500 pieces an hour some of the stores Take 6 hours to unload 1100 pieces
good,Great company to get your foot in the door to this industry but I wouldn’t recommend staying long term as they pay is low and the hours are long. Management could definitely use better training as well.
good,Alot of people gripe and complain about this company I can't say enough good things about it especially if you are new to the trucking world just don't think your a super trucker
good,good company to work for. I had job security and there was room for advancement. I would recommend this company to anyone who wants to be a driver or any other job swift offers
good,Traveled across country; visited family and friends in different states. Able to rest when needed. can drive as long as I wanted to; great coaching/mentoring.
good,swift is a good place to start a driving career especially if you have no experience in driving. many benefits and seeing different locations through out the U.S.
good,"A good place to work. Many opurtunities to go up the company ladder if you are seeking to do so. Hard working,self motivated worker is what they seek. Fast paced work but not overwhelming. Managment and floor leaders well educated on work and work with you to learn job."
good,Amazing place to work for. Very appreciative of the workload and willing to assist in career advancement. Always open to new ideas on how to streamline the work load.
good,certified drivers to make sure they were in compliance with the department of transportation.Answered phones and send messages to drivers through email. Filed documents.
good,"My driver managers keep me busy earning cash. Started on a dedicated account after graduating the Swift Academy in Memphis. I work hard and get what I need for time off. Typically on the road away from home for 3-5 days out of the week. I enjoy the job, especially the independence."
good,"Swift was a good company to learn OTR driving with.  At first they kept me busy and I was driving most of the time, however, the longer I was there the harder it was for them to keep me busy."
good,Swift is a great company for anyone who is looking to drive semi over the road. They provide the training to get you on the right track to a rewarding career.
good,Good miles even better DMs only thing is the company is changing and with change comes issues. No less then 2200 miles a week. Hometime time used to be easy now it harder.
good,Swift Transportation was the 1st Trucking Company I worked for out of Trucking School.. They gave me a shot which I will always be grateful.. Good place to work at..
good,"Good place to work. Come in, sign on and clock in. Have a list of loads to watch and a database to update. Spoke with my opposite of any issues and worked from there."
good,I really enjoyed working for swift. The only thing I would change is the work hours. Working some nights and some days and every weekend it was hard on my body.
good,Swift is a great place to work for recent graduates. I like the respectfulness of my dispatch managers and my fellow co-workers. I like my first mentor/trainer. He is a good instructor and I would recommend him to any new recruit.
good,"I found Swift transportation a good place to work. It just lacks the equipment breakdown pay support. The terminals are good, just have old equipment laying around, that should be sold off as scrap."
good,"Working for Swift, even though it isn't known as one of the best companies in the industry, it's certainly one of the biggest companies in the industry and it has some really good people.  If it wasn't for the policy violation that caused my termination I would probably still be there."
good,If you are willing to drive the miles...there are plenty miles here to drive....trucks governed at 65 mph... but I still managed to average 2500 to 3000 a week
good,"I give safety class's  all day from 0700 hrs to 1700 hrs. I learn that safety is important in all jobs not just in trucking industry. management was good,workplace was good, adjusting to drivers  safety needs. sitting down with drivers and going over what they did wrong and explaining to them how to correct the problem and hear from drivers that they understand."
good,"Central Refrigerated was purchased by Swift. Central was the second  most profitable trucking company in America and Swift almost bankrupt it in less than two years."
good,Well great place to start out as a truck driver. I did enjoy the job I wish I could have stayed longer but due to circumstances I had to move on. Hopefully...
good,"Started there on 03, want to retire there. Been there 15 years, like the people I work with  everybody has there ups and downs, as long as the job is so will i."
good,Great equipment and the people really make that company. Swift taught me how to drive and haul freight throughout the whole country. Plenty of work but limited opportunity to really advance in your career.
good,If you like to travel and make money great place to work. Work 12 days a week home 2 days if you want to take time off in another state for a vacation you can go anywhere that isnt you home.
good,I liked working at swift. It was a great job that let you see a lot of different sceneries in different places. You got to take breaks on your own time as long as you were on time. The job gave you a lot of thinking time as well as alone time. I enjoyed the job while I was working there.
good,"Muy buen clima de trabajo, y mucha gente con ganas de trabajar."
good,a good company  to start learning new things hands on the road...lots of experience..... experince on the road........................................................
good,Loved my job. Was very interesting. I had great coworkers. Everyone got along and was very helpful. There was plenty of advacement. They had a great HR Department. We had many potlucks.

good,drive and get to see the usa and get paid to do it. its great and fun and relaxing taking loads across the us and have fun doing it if i had to explain the feel its like a free home on wheels
good,Working with Swift was exciting  . Traveling through the south eastern part of the nation was interesting. Swift Transportation has the right equipment for the job.
good,"A good company to work for. The attitudes of dispatch was good. Exercise good team work, wonderful work ethics. I will always recommend swift to anyone"
good,Huge company didn't mind working for him just family need to look out for wasn't home enough for my family so therefore I had to look for a different job.
good,Swift provides good benefits and is a solid company to grow in. I started in a transition situation and Swift took on everybody's tenure. They also matched their pay at that time.
good,They treated me very well. I would recommending to someone looking for a driving career. They have great management that you can talk to on a personal level if need be. The past 12 years my life has been a roller-coaster and they helped me through everything to get my life back on track.
good,"Swift had a nice work atmosphere,  job security and great management. I enjoyed driving for them except there weren't enough miles on my route. I would work for them again only having more miles."
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere at the OKC terminal. The family type air about the coworkers was great. Had good loads and good miles. competive hometime as well. dedicated runs for locals
good,"this was a good company to drive for good miles and I had a great driver manager good equipment, treated good by the company, never sat very long waiting for loads."
good,"Great job, long hours, a lot of tie away from your family and hoe, excellent pay, a lot of travel, a lot of different job options, Driving full time OTR"
good,"Its a decent gig but trying to manage a home life and trucking isn't for every one. But swift can compensate for your time away from home, they have a very family oriented staff that doesn't make it too hard."
good,"I liked working at Swift. There was plenty of advancement opportunities, salary increases and bonuses as well as training. I liked my coworkers. Swift gave me a job and trained me for a career not just another job. I wish I could go back."
good,Swift is a great company if you are just starting out driving. They will provide you with training and get you the skills you need to get out there. Probably the best in the industry as far entry level drivers go.
good,Swift took the time to invest in each employee during an extensive training program which took me across the country.  The company is great for those who don't mind being away from home.  It also gives the opportunity to travel and experience new places as you travel your way to each destination.
good,I loved working for swift but i have to say it is not a job for a family man with kids. It gets very emotional out on the road without having your family with you. I left swift because it was making my daughter very upset me being gone for so long at a time and not to mention it was putting a hurting on me as well. But other than that it is a great company to work for and i recommend it for any one that is singe with no kids.
good,"fun workplace very relax great schedule, managemnt is cool, just show up do your work and go home, nothing crazy great for expeience and learning, pay is okay"
good,"I had a positive experience with dedicated runs, but I would not it as an experienced driver. I have no intention to live in a truck,  I prefer coming home."
good,"loved working for Swift , due to family obligations had to come off the road, enjoyed going to different cities, learned alot abouttruck driving. hardest part was being away from my family."
good,A good workplace to work .. To known another cities while you work.. Get a lot of experience driving a truck...........................................
good,"Great environment"
good,They treated me well as a company driver for the most part. I got good miles and made some decent money. When I went to become an Owner Operator things changed and my miles became less and the loads became heavier which is not profitable as an owner operator
good,"Good company to start with out of driving school. Big company with decent benefits."
good,Good company to work for. Depending on how long you work for them they give you pto hours every month. Easy to move up and get raises. Flexible work schedules.
good,could be myself with this job. fun to work here and it is plenty of terminals in any state and good communication with employees. always loads coming as soon as you drop a load
good,"It was great to work no forced dispatch"
good,There is really not that much to say about Swift Transportation but its a good trucking company . The pay starts off slow ; but once you've been there for so long ; the pay gets better
good,"Enjoyed my time at Swift Transportation. Been with Swift for 13 years and learned a lot. Had opportunities to work in intermodal, ocean containers and OTR."
good,good place to work. management need some work on but other than that very fun place to work. Got the opportunity to work on several different makes and models of trucks.
good,"Swift transportation co. Gave me the opportunity to travel to multiple states. The equipment was newer, as well as the trucks. Great opportunity for anyone."
good,Every day goes with lots of challenges and too many issues to be handled . For sure it teaches good experience and great learning in managing things. Work place environment is also good.
good,Swift is one of the largest trucking company.  Swift believes in helping their own.  They provide training courses in all area to get an employee familiar with company rules procedures. The people i work with in work comp performed their duties in a respectful.
good,Stressful day and a long day.  When you are out over the road your have to stay focus and alert.  The hardest part was being away from home and the enjoyable was you got the opportunity to see the world.
good,Swift transportation was really good to me once I landed a dedicated route but as an over the road driver it kinda sucked but over all not a bad company.
good,Really didn't get to enjoy driving as much as I wanted to because I had family problems back home but overall through the training and school I really liked it
good,Good place to work and benefits are good also. Your work ethics will produce comparable pay and overall benefits and bonuses. Everyone works as a team.
good,"The night shift is very stress free and fun to work people are very "
good,"The only reason for me i did not LIKE  for OTR I want to be home       "
good,"It's a great company too work for. you will stay very busy. I love working for this company, because as soon as you drop a load you will have another waiting for you."
good,this is a good place get started driving don't really have anything bad to say bout them I had a good time there just had to get home to my family easy to get home time
good,I have enjoyed working at Swift Transportation as a Company and Owner Operator over the past 6 years.  I have been a solo driver and mentored drivers to become a team driver with me.  A typical day would consist of picking up a loaded truck at a customer's warehouse. Do all the necessary truck and trailer inspections. Check all the paperwork and computer information on the load to be delivered.  Drive a 10 hour day with appropriate stops as required by law. Arrive at receiver dock and back in and do necessary paperwork. I work well with all of the support team members at Swift as well as all the customer employees to provide the best in customer service. Over the years I've learned the best methods to get a job done well and efficiently. The hardest part of the job is getting enough sleep. I guess that is what weekends are for. I enjoy working with people and sharing a joke or two. I like making people laugh.
good,all companies got they ups and down but with swift I never felt that I was just a number in the system. over all it was a lovely experence
good,"I only worked for the Intermodal business. It was a good place to work. They're a solid, established trucking company with advancement opportunities. They have solid leadership and a relaxed environment. They have employee appreciation days and always have something fun going on for major holidays."
good,Enjoy it but need to find something with a set schedule and wanting to relocate. The company is alright don't have any problems with the company just need to get out of this town if they can relocate me I'd stay with them
good,"get out of it,what you put in.Can be hard work, but manageable."
good,"Very nice environment, a lot of advantages for employees and it provides also a bus shuttle for the external employees."
good,"making a run to another state looking at the beautiful country, learning that it's more to driving a 18 wheeler than meets the eye. You learn how to manage your time because now you are on a schedule you are obligated to get this load to its destination on time and intact. hardest part of job sometime backing truck into dock. most enjoyable part seeing this wonderful country and meeting different people"
good,This job was a hard job I worked for the dollar tree account and there is alotof physical work. It is niot a bad job just one of the hardest I ever had in the trucking field.Bthey have great dispatchers keep you working.
good,I would wake up and switch my duty status then do a pre-trip on the truck then leave to drive hundreds of miles to my destination. I could only drive about 8 hours before having to take a break then drive 3 more hours. I learned that even veteran drivers dont know everything about trucking. i liked the managers and co workers. Hardest part of the job was having to stop driving. driving was the most enjoyable part of my job
good,"Good company benefits good tractors good trailers problems when drivers damage equipment  and don't report it you pick it up but you can,to use it. Didn't like waiting somewhere there no freight but over it was pretty good . But tried of being gone all the time from home."
good,"depends on the person but swift in sumner is a good place to work"
good,"Good place to work"
good,"location was okay, management was good, the only concern was benefits in the long run..recommend this company to others with three thumbs up.................."
good,"This was a very time sensitive position for on time deliveries and pickups. "
good,"home time terrible."

good,"Driving state to state ,I learned to be patience with the customers.Helping others drivers when they are in need.Waiting on the loads at the dock"
good,Fun work. Lots of good memoriesxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good,I've worked with Swift for 20 years and have loved my tenure with them. They are a great company and great people to work with and for. Huge company with so much growth potential. They are always working to stay ahead of the game. That is what it's all about. One cannot become stagnant and stale as if one does then they fall behind and become complacent putting them in the back of the line. My current position is relocating and I am not able to relocate for another 3 years till my children graduate high school. At that time I'll be able to relocate so one never knows what the future may hold.
good,"Great place to work and you get to see the country, not  much time to go home but when the wheels are moving the money is good."
good,"Management at that time wasn't so good , might be better now.Learned a lot about customer service and all the paper work involved. loved seeing the Great a USA"
good,"company has offer great career advancement but now at ceiling and want new challenge and growth. i need challenges and growth want to move ahead, and increase challenge."
good,"I typical day at Swift is to book freight.  I have learned how to use AS400, I have a great relationship with my Team Leader as well as my co-workers.  Being at Swift just seem like one BIG family we learn from each other and don't mine sharing what we have learned with each other."
good,Kept drivers happy and had a great support staff.  Made sure that the drivers were happy and that they were home when they requested it.

good,lots of to work keep busy. Learned to drive in snow/rain/dust storms with safty in mind. great co-workers. management did their job right!!! driving on the open road!!!
good,"(Very similar to Celedon description)"
good,Check the status of the trucks and trailers to make sure they were being fixed and back on the road as soon as possible. learned patience and negotiations and that sometimes you have to be tough in order to get the job done properly. Co-workers were great. The stress that could arise when there was an accident. I love the relationships that were made across the country with the maintenance technicians or office personnel.
good,good training program but over the road driving was not for me.good training company.
good,They are a good company to get into for new drivers.  They have lots of different oportunities from otr to dedicated routes to intermodal.
good,i really was taught alot by my trainer here and how to manage my time wisely on my loads everyday
good,Swift provided me with all the tools to grow. The training was the main piece of growth.
good,"Oppurtunity to deal with complexed problem solving situations.  Test your skills in staying foucused on the task at hand, time management, test your ability to deal with l  demanding people. Requires self motivation, execellent written and verbral communcation skills. Self reliant, a lot of time spent alone, with little time for wasting time. Oppurtunity to see the world. Fun, stressful, rewarding, insightful, away from home long periods of time. Will miss a lot of quality home time with family. Can make a lot of money to provide for family needs. Great job but at great costs."
good,"Yes it's a very secure company they showed  me how to handle a truck. They showed me how to keep up with my daily log, daily truck inspection and tracking my loads. The hardest part of the job was being away from my family."
good,I got to travel all over the world. I enjoy my work. They were very professional
good,just traveling from state to state dropping off goods and picking up goods all alone no co workers was an enjoyable experience
good,Swift transportation is a well based team working environment. Good relationship between the dispatchers and the drivers in that case it allows a nice easy transition to meet both driver and customers expectations.
good,"*Professional office environment."
good,Given plenty of miles and able to have a home life with small children.
good,Mi tarea era reponer la mercadería que era enviada a los diferentes supermercados. Debía controlar los espacios que se habían pactado.
good,got to see all 48 major states
good,"I enjoyed the atmespher. I felt important to the company. Benefits where good, raises where good, training classes where interesting."
good,Regardless of what you may have heard about Swift....I have found it a wonderful company to work for. Nothing but positive results for me during my 3+ years driving for Swift and training new drivers for Swift.
good,Swift was a great company to work for. I enjoyed working for them and was saddened by the lack of work that made me end my employment with them. They taught me a lot about the trucking industry and helped me gain the knowledge I now possess.
good,We were trained even on a simulator to go through hazardous road conditions driving large rig semis. The on the road mentor ship was long and intensive and well worth it. Hardest part of job is going down severe grades and learning how to jake brake and be safe.
good,I enjoyed the company because you are allowed to be your own bosss. I also got to travel to the west coast for the first time because of this company.
good,"i learn a on how to drive a 18 wheeler, learn on how to be a good driver, alert at all tines"
good,"I have work for swift for a year now. It has been a really eye opener for as a driver, Safety is the first think you learn, because its your truck and your job!!"
good,"Lower end of pay for OTR but if you get a good driver manager, dont get any tickets or violations or damages, and you work hard it pays off. About 3 weeks on, 3-4 days off. Got a new truck after training and they accommodate me really well."
good,"i loved swift. one of the companies where they will definitly take care of you. i recommend it to anyone. once again, they will take care of you as they too care of me and i would go back anytime."
good,"Good working place. The pay and benefit are good. But, the management is not helpful at all. They don't listen to employees. I don't like their drive cam. It makes me nervous."
good,"A typical day at swift was checking your qualcomm for your next trip. Letting them know that you have all the information you need to do the trip and hitting the road. If you have any problems you just let them know and they will take care of it for you. You never have to touch any freight, all drop and hook."
good,"the shop was very nice and clean and air conditioned and heated"
good,"The milage isn`t always good. They do have good driver managers"
good,Safety is the main focus at Swift. I will always tell people how much fun I had working with them. Swift gave me a chance when no one else would. And I would love to work for them again.
good,"We take phone calls from drivers and help to assist them to make their deliveries on time. Try to answer questions, help them find their way using google maps. Send money advances with needed and  company advances. If we can not assist them, we direct them to the  correct people who can help."
good,"Since this is a very large carrier, it works best if you communicate regularly and often with your immediate supervisor. I’ve had 10 different Driver Leaders, 7 were great; fleet managers listen and try to get the best matches. "
good,"excellent work environment , my dispatcher has been a good friend , easy to work with . tractors and trailers have in very good condition.  Repair dept very good and fast"
good,good company to work for as long your willing to work. and if your following the rules and getting your loads to the customer on time and following HOS rules.
good,i learned several positions while  I was employed there. I started there as a foreman and several years later i become a service plainer in that time  learned how to  Recieve and charge out  parts.open repair orders and process and put into the system and review and then close them .the people i worked with were great . management  in the shop was good to work for.
good,"My hardest part was California’s cat scales, I learned no matter where you are always  make sure you ask  around to see where’s the nearest scale house so the load can be legal enough and safe enough to drive. Always check trailer carefully to make sure it’s in a good condition to haul. Always follow traffic signs, there may be roads truck can’t go on at the moment or permanently can’t go on period."
good,"shop is busy"
good,"Is a great place to start out a trucking career. Will give you alot of verifiable experience and a usually very competent staff for support on and off the road. Consistent and reliable work and never had alot of downtime. Is not a dead end in the trucking world, but this inst the entirety of the spectrum of jobs you can have. Swift does mostly dry van, and refrdigerated, which is pretty typical work. Though if you want any sort of specialized or higher risk/paying set ups, you will have to look elsewhere for them."
good,"Loved this job.  Inspiring to give people jobs and watch it change their lives.  The trucking industry and atmosphere at Swift is amazing, though stressful sometimes, the rewards outway the stress."
good,Swift is a very competitive company. Drivers must be independent because no one is monitoring them every minute. Drivers must stay compliant and willing to run hard.
good,great place to work at if your willing to put in the time and energy. like the saying goes....work hard play hard
good,"Great benefits, hours and people. This is a fast paced position working with deadlines. My supervisor was fantastic. Great vacation and work/life balance. There is some conflict between departments. Overall great company."
good,This was not a bad job you do need to be able to be on your feet for 90% of your shift and be able to lift between 25 and 50 lbs . there is a wide variety of people who work there so it was interesting most days even if the line was slow . The location I worked at closed down so I had to find work else where
good,I did over the road and regional. Over the road was amazing pay and good loads but did not do much for home time. Regional was amazing. I enjoyed doing regional.
good,At Swift I did a lot of work and enjoyed every minute of it. The Manager was a great teacher and taught me a lot during my time there and never looked away when I had a question. Always a busy day as well which is nice I never just stood around twiddling my thumbs there was always work to do. My internship was only 3 weeks long through Job Corps. but in those 3 weeks i learned a lot more about Tires than i did spending about 6 weeks just goes to show that actual experience is better than the classroom in some cases.
good,"Swift is a great Company that will train you on everything that you need to be a local, dedicated, or long haul driver. They provide a great way to see the country."
good,Very good place to start your career whether it's for a year or 10 years. Fair otr starting cpm. Lots of opportunities to switch accounts to feel your way into the best suitable position. Don't get sucked into the hype by old run down truckers from other companies that swift is a terrible company to work for because it's further from the truth. If it's slow industry wide you better believe those mom and pop companies are feeling the drought worst than you.
good,I was not at Swift long enough to form a very thorough opinion. I was working for a dedicated customer and was only there 3 months and Swift terminated the contract.
good,"The only aspect of Swift that I enjoyed is that it feels like a College campus whether at corporate in Phoenix or at a terminal.  "
good,Swift is a great place to get started as a truck driver they take care of their drivers they have great equipment you are always moving which is a great thing for those who want to make money
good,Great company to work for but not many local job opportunities. Swift Transportation is a good reliable employer. Swift have many accounts with customers and companies.
good,"Everything is perfect, most of the faculty are very helpful and respectfull. very good trainning never felt lost on my duties."
good,Swift is a grate company if your running state to state. No local jobs for the new drivers they make it hard for you to get on local. they want you to drive state top state for some months before you can drive local for them.
good,A typical day at work would for me to get at work and hour early everyday. Start with organizing my tool box for what ever my job was for that day. I learned new things everyday as i took on a challenge i never seen before. I was a Level 3 Tech out of 5.
good,Driving truck to and from customer with the capacities of 3 tons or more. Checking with the Security officer at the gate to determine which door I will be loading or unloading at. Maintaining records of the bills from the companies.
good,"I learned a great deal about customer service, planning and the shipping industry.  At Swift they will work you as much as you are willing to work.  You have the potential to earn a nice income with them and can travel.  It is difficult to work with them and raise a family, especially if you have small kids.  They will work around your schedule,  however if you set your time out too far you may not get as many miles as you would like since the loads that have some distance on them leave out early so as to get to their delivery point on time."
good,I worked on the Home Depot dedicated account in Dallas TX. Dispatchers were friendly and easy to work with. Pay wasn't the best. Only $150 per day and a $100 safety bonus each week. Then again there's alot of otr drivers out there living on the road for weeks at a time making less. That job had me home every day. Night shift was best because less traffic and they usually run out of loads and send us home early. Only complaint I have is the equipment. Swift has nice new otr sleeper trucks but most of the day cabs are really terrible. I am considering going back.
good,"Used Bill of lading and Electronic logging devices to track driving log and tracked record of accident free"
good,"my first experience as a truck driver and i still love drive today,they have a tractor trucks terminals bases almost in every state which i love it.The only thing its back that time iwas begining my driving carrer and dicide to change and stay driving local with other company."
good,I enjoyed working up front with my Management team as well as my team. It is very important to work well with those around you and be able to support one another in a shared goal to help our Company succeed.
good,I have been working here a little under 6 months now the management is great and they listen to you.
good,"OTR Company driving truck through 30+ states, dedicated runs and OTR, decent pay when starting out driving."
good,"I had two mentors, the first was more interested in making trips than in my learning what he had to teach."
good,Great company to start with and overall. pay is on the lower end for industry standards but miles are steady. overall they are a good company to work for.
good,"Driving product from state to state while making my deliviers. I learned how to heandul myself when driving on the Interstates, Highways, country roads, And city streets. Perfected my backing up skills. Management okay. Co-works were cool. Hardest part of the job, nothing. Enjoyable part of the job was beening out on the road and meeting new people."
good,"Swift was a great experience all around. From the time I was in school to the time I got my own company truck. I got to see the world. They kept loads coming. When I had break down, i was never down long. The people were very friendly. The only thing I didn't like was that I had to be gone from my family for so long and only had a few day home."
good,I love working here my DM is awesome. Not chasing miles home when I need to be. It's great I guess depending on which DM you get. Every job has its ups and downs but so far so good 👌 they have been awesome to me and my family.
good,was otr for about a year dispatchers were some what decent at times always had a load to keep me moving then went to a Dollar tree account which is tough work but decent pay and decent home time
good,Great place to work.they took care of me and my family. Would go back to them if I was not a single father. They will treat you like family on a dedicated account.
good,Swift Transportation is a great company to start with and has a great academy to help people get your Commercial Driver's License. It's a wonderful place to meet new people and learn an awesome career.
good,Have a great knowledge of electrical systems and mechanical systems the work environment is great and management is on top of all aspects of the company
good,This company provided room for advancement. Within 6 years I moved from OTR to Dedicated accounts only and into Management relatively quickly. Advancements are there if you're willing to strive hard.
good,My position was a 4 by 4 (worked 4 days on then 4 days off).  12 hour days with rotating days off.  Would spend part of the day supervising and planning the local fleets. Dealing with the over the road drivers by assisting in getting new loads and/or removing their current load.  Provided gate security.  Long days with having to multi task.  Able to meet new people almost daily from all over the United States.  Being able to help them find local customer for delivery or pick up.
good,Even paces friendly work environment. Lots of good friends made over the years I worked there. There was always something new every day. Either from the techs or the drivers coming and needing help.
good,I had an overall excellent experience with this organization and would recommend it to anyone interested in opportunity for growth and security. The culture is one of demanding expectation but potential for great reward.
good,24 hour operation with around the clock work was very independent with a fast paced work environment. although work was fast paced it was not stressful I would recommend this company to any one looking for a night shift position
good,"Swift Transportation LLC, has a good working atmosphere that promotes safe driving and operation of their trucks."
good,"I learned a lot inside the classes, my mentor taught me a lot of things and I was driving and acting as a professional driver in ten days or less. Trucks are new and in a good condition."
good,From day one the work was exactly what was described. drive a truck where you are dispatched. as for the school recruiting/recruiter they will say anything to get you to sign up for their school.  if they say it takes 2 weeks till you start earning money it takes at least 3+ weeks. no matter how well you do in the school. have at least 2 months of reserve money set aside before you go to the school.
good,Worked there for 13 years and still would be if job had not been eliminated.  Still in contact with many of my fellow workers and plan on maintaining those contacts.
good,The IT infrastructure was a real learning experience.  It was great to work and learn in such a large IT environment.  Most of my fellow employees were open to sharing ideas and new concepts.
good,"Great workplace for over the road driving. Excellent benefits, and pay, not enough time at home spent. Great mentors and management team who helps you get loads from one state to another state with reasonable timing and pre planning."
good,"was able to pick hours work"
good,Very good company to be employed with. As a company driver or office staff you will receive full support from management and corporate
good,"Good place to work at. Most of the dispatchers were knowledgeable, and happy to help. Most! I'm actually thinking about going back to work for them. My overall experience there was positive, at least where I ran out of wich was the El Paso terminal."
good,"-It is a fair workplace."
good,"At swift I was able to advance many times to different departments. They work well with me at all changes, that I made within the company. The manager was very nice to work with."
good,"If you do not have a CDL, and have no truck driving experience, Swift will pay for your trip to one of their schools in order to teach you, and you are guaranteed training/employment afterwards. Can get around $30k a year at entry level."
good,"During my time here, I worked in Sumner, at one of the best Swift terminals in the country, fixing trailers and keeping inventory in the tire department."
good,"Working for swift was very rewarding for me. Daily duties included pretrip, driving from d c to store locations in northern California arriving at store locations on time. Unloading using pallot jack"

good,"This is a good company I work for a lots of terminals with friendly people working there my fleet manager Sergio, professional and never let me with out a load. Good job"
good,It was a great experience and I got allot of training to do my job. My manager was a great asset to mu learning as well with one of the foreman. We all took care of each other as well . Highly recommend anyone to work there.
good,I learned a lot from this company from administration to recruiting to customer service to hiring student drivers to owner operators and being in charge of their  safety and well being
good,"Truck load carrier. Tending to customers needs, by telephone, email, website and computer terminal. "
good,A typical day usually just involves driving to and from warehouses and various receivers. The management is great but the planners are not so. I enjoyed the fact that I could travel to most places i could think of.
good,inspections were always required especially since we were traveling from state to state equipment was fairly new and it was a great learning experience on time management
good,"First off this is a truck driving job. So if traveling is your bag and you like money this is a pretty good mix."
good,i would go back to work for them thay were good to me and keep me rolling down the road so i could make my living
good,"Swift is a great company to work for, they offer many incentives, the benefits are great, the driver leaders really help when there is a problem and with them you never feel alone. They are always making random calls just to check on you and see how things are going."
good,"Goo"
good,"We ran on the cabellas acct, loved every minute of it. That division was absolutely the best to work with.Management couldn't have been more helpful,easy to work with and knowledgeable about everything or anything."
good,Great job training and always willing to train you if you need help. The driver leaders our great and have a great communication with you and they are willing to help you

good,Excellent school if you are looking to become a driver. Daily Classes can complete the program in one month
good,They’re first is very nice & respectful but driving for them was amazing but certain things I didn’t agree on & they gave me a hard time. I like driving for them but I’m going all over the United States & I deserve to get paid more so that’s why I changed jobs. I have a whole family to provide for and $300 weekly is not going to pay all my bills at all . I have responsibilities just like anybody else. But other than that I loved driving and enjoy making sure my customers all well satisfied
good,you have to work your 70 hour clock down so be prepared to work 12+ hours a day they promise you that you’ll make anywhere from $1200 a week plus but that is false the take-home pay is less than $1000 if you work really hard or even less than that if you want to do only one  run  a day. Overall  it’s a good job just be prepared to always have safety on your mind.
good,"Driving Long hours and weeks at a time away from home. "
good,If you think About going make sure you don’t do drugs I seen slot of people where they end up getting there cold but owing the school almost three k plus some more advice I my self family is everything I so is money so you have to consider how much you wanna be home put it like this more home time less pay less home time more pay you can’t turn wheels at home
good,"the driver leaders always had attitudes, they did not listen to us about where we did and did not want to go, they did what they thought was best for us and they were guessing on road conditions"
good,The hardest part of the job was being away from home. The most enjoyable part of the job is I got to go all across the country. A typical day involved picking up my load and then delivering it.
good,swift gave me my first driving job and for that Im greatful. I learned a lot and drove many miles. My family needed me  hom due to somee life changing events
good,Great work experience love the type of work.. learned several ways to manager an account thru AS400 software co workers are self sufficient. the hardest part of my job is working the long hours when unneeded most work can be finished in 8 hours but in stead 10 hours of work is done per week plus an extra 5 every 6 weeks
good,fun job in the daytime.. no fun at night.. new equipment.. management... hardest part is driving in ice snow and chaining truck during winter months
good,The company is ok a lot of changes recently but a great app lace to start or you can make it you last job. The ball is in your hands with this one just focus on you and your tesm
good,"Totally reccommend this company to any person who are interested. .I have had a wonderful experience working at this company from my driver Manager to my fellow employees were all geared at making you feel welcome,"
good,"Consistently busy all day, everyday so the days go by rather quickly.  My title does not match my job duties by any means.  I support multiple departments primarily Driver Recruiting.  Responsible for reviewing, auditing and processing billings for various department vendors.  Ensure all billings are accurate and paid.  Database account and training setup for new department employees, assist with manually ordering driver records thru HireRight, manage adverse letters, run weekly/monthly hire reports, manage all 3rd party contract recruiter/dedicated processors, assist safety compliance personnel with any Tenstreet database questions, back up classroom instructor for the Driver Orientation Facilitator, assist safety compliance team by submitting new driver files to generate employee codes as well as submit rate of pay changes for drivers previous experience.  "
good,"I really love driving, but the being away from home just did not play well for my family. I learned much from the experience and was able to learn much about the country in my travels. The most difficult part was lack of information regarding delivery access to locations and unanticipated delivery/pickup procedures of some customers."
good,"I was able to drive the 48 states, I saw a lot of things. Met a lot of really neat people. I didnt always get to go home much, but I got to see a lot of things most people wouldnt. GREAT EXPERIENCE!"
good,They want to work you for the max amount of time. I was on walmart contract and i was only getting about 6 hours rest a day.
good,"I sit for eight hours a day answering phone calls. Co workers come and go. It is usually a revolving door when it come to co workers. It is a very stressful job and many of them can't handle the stress. The hardest part of the job is thinking and making decisions for other people. Management is ok. The most enjoyable parts are helping the drivers, speaking with vendors, speaking with other techs from other terminals, and the leaving for the day."
good,"Its ok, but I have not gotten pay yet for two weeks."
good,I was able to train well but the trainer I had drove me insane for a while I had to stay in the truck while he went home for a visit that was unprofesional
good,A nice company to work for with benefits. Get paid weekly a decent pay. You can drive by yourself or work with a team driving. You get to see the usa the whole country.
good,It's good company for work..I work for them bout 1 yrs.they thought me everything I was a flatbed driver and it was so good experience no complaint bout this company
good,Many of the trailers needed repair. they were hard to lift and lights were out. A few times no loads out of area equals no money.They paid the best for new drivers.
good,Swift is a great co. To work for especially if you are trying to get your driving career off and running. Great equipment and many accounts to choose from
good,"Extended Coverage Team (ECT) / Yard Hostler/Driver"
good,"Arrive at your scheduled pickup time, connect to your preloaded trailer and perform pre trip inspection. Deliver your loaded trailer to your final destination, back into loading dock and pickup empty trailer. Return empty trailer to customer."
good,"Productive and laid back, all the work you want. Great bosses. I would recommend the refer department. I've been there 1.5 years and received a great raise. Excellent equipment,  newer models."
good,This is a great company to go to if you live in Illinois to be able to get the CDL training necessary if you want to be a truck driver. They take their time to ensure that you can successfully attain your Class A CDL in Illinois.
good,"Trabajo constante, no muy buena paga,"
good,The hardest part of my position was to adhere to all last minute changes that customers would make to freight and to keep driver proficient to these changes
good,"Am applicant with unique skills in developing the very company. Ready and willing to be part of this great company"
good,"A typical day was arriving at 0500, clocking in, rocking the planning board to cover as many loads as possible with the available trucks. Intermodal department was very high speed and if you cannot multitask you will not survive. The workload is very methodical, structured, and you are more of a cog in the machine than anything. You are very much responsible for your actions while given a moderate to minimal level of oversight. I enjoyed the structured environment and generally efficient system in place. There were areas that could improve operationally but the mindset of management is if it isn't broke don't fix it and if it is just put a bandaid on it."
good,It was a very minatl work place and a very tenceful work invoroment OTR driving but I don't mind but I would prefere to be closer to home with my family maybe I would be able to find
good,"I worked there for 6 months and had to go home due to family illness. Good trucks, they keep you on the road if you are agressive with the dispatchers."
good,I like driving for swift so far it's not easy but I enjoy the work.the people here try their best to make you a good driver. I am having a hard but good time driving so far .
good,"The terminal in Greer, SC just one of many. Swift is all about helping customers move product. They also have great Driver Managers that are there to help the driver succeed. Great Company."
good,"Flat bed is not a good place to be in  ,the van loads is the best way to go you have a lot more miles to make money but overall it is a nice place to work"
good,This is a very good training company. There's a lot of freight and a lot of miles. I used to run coast to coast and made good money doing it.
good,"lots of work, keeps you busy. work though out the 48 states and god pay. nothing really hard about it if your already a truck driver."
good,"You drive all over united states. 2,500 miles a week, Your payed by the mile, you are your own boss on the road, your home 8 days of the month. If you like driving this is the job for you."
good,"Very well organised, well maintained fleet, up to date maintenance of the busses. Very supportive colleagues and management. Always trying to improve to get better and grow as a company."
good,"Good company for new drivers, The pay is not great but it is enough to get by on. Being a new driver I did not want to deal with the pressures of being alone during truck problems etc. and they have a great service department/program to get you back on the road. There program gave me time to learn how to drive safely instead of having all the stress as a new driver."
good,"I was doing my job very well. I was good driver and I was good responsiblity for my everything about my truck, like safety, on time for delivery at load."
good,"Very good Management, helpful, proactive company. The colleagues are helpful, and i have learn a lot with others and we work as a team."
good,"They are not committed to retaining drivers.  There is a revolving door on hiring.  Starting out be prepared for not running a lot of miles.  Pay is average compared to industry.  The only problem is as they say "" if you aren't turning you are not earning"".  They don't keep you running."
good,A typical work day was always enjoyable. I learned that as long as you put your mind to it you can advanced and be appreciated. My coworkers always worked as a team.
good,While at Swift Transportation I was able to assist many of people with becoming a safe and productive driver really enjoyed he students I worked with.
good,"gives you a hard workout everyday, gave me some experience driving a bigger straight truck with no cdl needed. Good workplace"
good,This was a good company to work for I just wished that they would have allowed me to be able to have more home time with my family.
good,"I really liked this job, loved seeing the Country and getting for it, enjoyed co-workers, Management was also good. I worked my way into a dedicated account that brought daily, and money was good."
good,Enjoyed working for the company.  It interfered with my military career as a Reservist.  But otherwise and excellent company to work for.
good,"it is a good place to start your driving career but if you re wanting more pay, it would be best to find another company. they have plenty work but it is for little pay"
good,"drove truck all over the country,and to pay could have been better and they need to have better communication with the drivers."
good,worked here for about  7years one year as company driver  and  the rest was owner operator had a great time traing and also had did a target account
good,Had a great experience working for Swift. The staff was very helpful and professional.I would recomend anybody looking for a OTR or Kansas City Local trucking job.
good,"This driving position required OTR over the road driving. Driving 13,000 miles and being away from home for 27 days. This does not work for me. I need a local job so I won't be away from home for so many consecutive days."
good,Nice company to work for and I would recommend to anyone seeking employment in this field.
good,This was a weekend job and a summer job that my mom got me. She worked there for close to ten years and so I knew the owner of the company. It was hard working in the summer time because all my friends were by the pool and going out partying and i was stuck in a cold office but it made me learn and build some work ethics. My boss was a really good friend of my folks and so it taught me how to act in a work place and the clerical work in an office.
good,did delivers all over the east cost had fun doing it.it was a fun job
good,"fun place to work, good management fndsfnsdhflsdhflsdhfildsnifodkfdsfhsdlhfsdfosfljksdfhjofwerof"
good,"A typical day at work was returning emails and missed phone calls. I traveled allot and always needed to stay caught up never knew who needed me for something.. ;0)"
good,"Billing, conducting warranty claims "
good,"I miss working, I've been off work for a long time and I'm trying to go back to work but everybody wants recent experience. How do you have recent experience If you have'nt worked in 9 years. I know how to do the job if someone would just hire me iI coulg get some recent experience. I rest my case. Thank you I hope someone can find it in there heart to hire me so I can have some recent experience."
good,Not enough home time. It would benefit drivers if able to see love ones more often.
good,"•Safely and defensively operated 53 ft, 18 wheel trucks with a partner and sometimes alone for two to three weeks per job, approximately 12 to 14 hours daily"
good,"Nothing really typical about the job. I learned that you have to be patience doing this type of job. Management was very good to me. Co-workers are very pleasant. The hardest about the job is waiting on loads, and most enjoyable part of job is relaxing."
good,A typical day was an four to five straight hours of intense workout.
good,"Got my start driving over the road with this company, they paid for my training and allowed me to team drive with my husband."
good,long
good,"the employees totally you not you,they are very nasty about the truth and they have the attitude that you are nothing in their company and do not believe you"
good,a typical day at work was challenging and physically satifying. I learned how to drive a forklift and load semi tractor trailers so that the load was evenly distributed and would not shift. I felt that the managment team treated my coworkers and i with respect. my co-workers were hard workers who never lost motivation. the hardest part of my job was the breakingh pains when i first started due to the heavy lifting required. The most enjoyable part of my job was the feeling of job satisfaction and accomplisment at the end of the day.
good,A company that is enjoyable to work at with great co workers and a fun atmosphere
good,great company great benefits just couldn't find enough trucks for all the driver s they hired so i had no choice but to move on
good,drive drive drive the hardest part about being a over the road truck driver is getting home with your family
good,"Number 1 rating, good working place, with good pay and good equipment to drive."
good,"The people are patient,friendly,very up to date,and great equipment."
good,I like this job a lot it’s just the location is too far from my family and I’m never at home to spend time with my kids. The pay is great and the environment is great just with they had local in my area
good,Awesome place to get to see countryside. Very nice and new equipment. Great miles and pay was good. Benefits were decent. Was allowed to take truck home and was paid for the miles. Overall a great company!
good,Great place to work where you can earn good money. Due to issues with certain dispatchers problems arose where my hard work was under appreciated. My two mistakes over shadowed the the great work i accomplished in my time with the company. As for as the job requirements it self i found non demanding and easy if you had the time it requires to commit to the job.
good,"Yes, Swift is a good company. They have given me opportunities that nobody else has. However, I have been in the same field of work for more than 20 years and need something different. The team that I had at swift really were like family to me. The most enjoyable part of my position was watching them all grow and change. The most difficult part of my career at Swift was leaving."
good,"Swift is a great starting company for brand new drivers, trucks gov out at 62 mph. I like that Swift is big on SAFETY,  I also am big on Safety!"
good,"Swift help me become a truck driver I take pride in that, I been with Rite Aid 11 years. I work with the best Drivers. The little things add up in the office, We have had the contract for over 12 years the drivers work very hard. To hard, Rite Aid has their own procedures but the stores don't fallow them. I am in the Active Army Reserves 35 plus years a Master Sergeant. Rite Aid makes my job twice as hard. Swift is a great company to work I feel the CEO is doing a great job"
good,"Basically, this is a new field for me.  Long driving hours.  Completely isolated in truck.  Away from home.  This is a job I always wanted to try, but I have discovered that the long distance truck driving is not for me.  I am interested in local driving if available."
good,"very productive"
good,"I learned a great deal at Swift and will always think of it in high "
good,"Rolling"
good,The hardest part is being away from my family. Every day is something different new and innavoative. Following guidance of directions to locations. The management is very strong saftey minded. My co- workers are proficient at their tasks. The most enjoyable part of my job would be being accomplishing the task under the guide lines given.
good,"able to gain experience and grow, very flexible with schedule. Teams are very welcoming and helpful. Need to be able to plan and manage daily tasks. Time management required."
good,They are not a bad company at all. They treated me fairly and I don't have anything bad to say about them. I got good pay as well as good bonuses for my work and referrals.
good,"First off. Don't listen to every driver who decides to run his/her mouth about how bad of a place it is to work for. I have a lot of good things to say about this company. No company is perfect as they are all operated by us imperfect people. Anyway, enough of my soapbox. I really liked how well they had their Qualcomm macros set up. The workflow was easy to remember as well and made things a lot less stressful just for the fact that they are really organized. If you drive Over-The-Road with this company, you will definitely get to see the country. I saw so many beautiful sights that I will remember for decades to come. They also have really good clientèle with drop-and-hook, no-touch freight. If you're lucky enough to get a Kimberly-Clark load out of Tulsa, OK, take it!!! Those loads are gravy, light-weight, loads and those guys are so organized, at least on the drop-and-hook side of things, that you'll be in and out of there within the hour for sure, as long as you know what you're doing. Otherwise it could take longer. Anyways, do yourself a favor and apply with them. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Can't say for sure though cause I have heard some pretty awful stories from fellow drivers. Definitely a great place to get your start. That, I can be sure of. ;)"
good,"Not cut out for everyone, but if you receive good training and have a good manager, you'll be alright. You're on the clock whenever you're not asleep and you're home for the weekend about once every month."
good,I love my job at Swift Transportation. I am my own boss and I am traveling and viewing our beautiful country God has provided for us. I am a father of 4 wonderful girls and being away form them and my wife is the hardest thing about truck driving. BUT THAT'S WHY I'M OUT HERE!!!!
good,"In my opoin I feel swift is the best for student to come in an get there training an move on. Not good for like a retirement company. The reason y I say its not good for a retirement job cuz o/o training get the first loads, then o/o then company drivers, now if u want to be a trainer then it would be great for u ."
good,I was driving over the road and I actually liked it until I had to be out a month at a time and only seeing my daughter once a month. I couldn't do it any longer.
good,"Recruit Leads are responsible for the drivers that their group hire. I still hire drivers, but I am over a team that covers different regions. Each driver that is contacted, I have to make sure their paper work is in order, their legal status are cleared, their back ground checks are correct, and that their training is taken care of. "
good,"This is a typical cold job but it was a good experience, I had some great co-workers. The hardest part was really the standing for the most part"
good,"Muy divertido"
good,"Keep you busy, do your job and they dont bother you. Very big on safety."
good,Now swift is a very nice company to work for if just starting out driving. Because will get all the right training over the road with them.
good,Driving over the road and being away from your family for weeks at a time can be very lonely
good,I worked as a company driver I loved my job. I enjoyed being over the road.
good,"Start out in may of 2011 with a 6 months plan to leave, long story short. I'm still with them, but looking for a change. It's a great company for new drivers starting out"
good,"Just do your job, be safe on the road and always deliver on time. If you do your job the correct way and drive safe the job becomes a lot easier. I have no complaints about the company."
good,I learned a lot at swift I think its a good experience job to start off. management is good  and the work place is ok. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and going home the hardest part is figuring things out when your quancom don't work
good,Ay muy poco descanso y rutas muy largas peligrosas
good,Before joining Swift it seems I only heard bad things about them but I was very surprised to find it to be a very good company. Never had a problem getting home when I requested. I only left because I had an local CDL job come open. Good company.
good,Soy buen chofer responsable y trabajador con disponibilidad de horario
good,I enjoyed the travel and the equipment was kept in good shape. I saw many places and learned several new skills. I also enjoyed my boss who was willing to work with me on any problem.
good,Swift Transportation has been a part of my family for many many years. Great place to work for and have a career with. Easy environment to work in. And easy people to work with.
good,"Great place and amazing co-workers. I enjoyed the training and very good at taking care of their employees. OTR driving is a stress on family, but they accommodate to your schedule very well."
good,"Swift often times gets a bad rap, but for me it's been a very good company. If you are willing to work hard Swift has plenty of miles and freight. My Driver Manager is awesome and we work as a team! If your lazy and want to be VP of Operations in two weeks don't work for this company or any other for that matter, lol."
good,I truly consider this job a home away from home. I was able to maintain a high standard of being totally involved in my job while meeting DOT standard and laws.
good,they gave you a chance an tryed to help as much as they can again starting pay not good
good,SWIFT is great for the entry level driver.  The pay is bad at first but scales up nice at the end.
good,"productive work place with relaxed environment,team work was good,managment consistant."
good,"they always had loads ready to pick up, most of the time. They would try to get you a load, if you were able to deliver early."
good,Be positive and you will reach high goals. Gain great knowledge in Transportation and leadership skills.Great Pay for the family.Mostly no touch freight with this Company.
good,If you're new to the game make sure you have a good trainer that's at least two years of Driving Experience play they don't have at least two years under their belt don't hop in the truck with them and even then make sure you talk with the trainer and make sure you can get along with them and if you are a guy's First Student make sure you get another trainer go with somebody who's a more experienced trainer experience trainer
good,"I would recommend Swift to anyone thinking about Driving trucks for a living, They have quarterly earned bonises based on miles safely driven, not a bad place to work for."
good,good place to work as a odd fault like anywhere else work colleges ok managment ok early starts some heavy lifting but if you do the job right it's not so heavy
good,i drove for them and as long as i did what i was supposed to do i was fine. i did my job and meet all my goals. never late never rushed never had an anccident in a little over 3 yrs stayed in same company. great with customers. not and average looking women driver. i stayed fit when can i traveled arcoss states and my bonus was having free time and ate the best foods that my boss paid for. thank u
good,"educational while fun at the same time i got to see new places while driving for swift with a good drive manager like i had she had my back"
good,Drove and made deliveries. From Ontario to Tucson Az. Driver manage was easy to work with. Dispatch made it easy had a dedicated route. I was 100% on time pick up and on time deliveries.
good,"They kept lots of work, in multiple states, they had the best, latest equipment and the best training process in the industry. They always worked with you to make sure you had ample home time."
good,"Excellent if you just want to get started in transportation. Least barriers of entry as a planner, CSR, gate clerk or driver manager. You will be great if you learn the industry on your own as well as with OTJ training. Workplace culture can be family oriented, depending on your ability to mesh well with others and take the good with the bad. Hardest part of the job is adapting to some new ideas being implemented from rough sketch to final process. The most enjoyable part is overcoming those processes and being able to excel in your job. They do provide online training and other opportunities to learn and advance in your career."
good,"Swift is a great place to get started in the trucking industry."
good,"Loved working for this Company . Well managed, good opportunities, good maintenance program reliable equipment.  They reimbursed well for all out of pocket costs accrued."

good,"nice place to work with would have worked out better to get off the afternoon shift, I like my foreman and most the people on my shift. Most of the time the job is good."
good,"good company to work for  "
good,Driving from state to state to deliver loads safely and on time. Performing pre-trips and post-trips. Ensuring the safety of merchandise. Wide open road!
good,Its an okay place to start out at. I wouldn't stay there for to long. There is no engine or trans rebuilds. They Hire an outside Company to do that instead of having us trained.
good,"its a great place to start in to trucking good gate way to a long term commitment,they even have good long term if you put ur mind to it with great bennies ."
good,"A very busy front lobby, many vendors and customers thru the day. Very happy employees many have been here many years. Co-workers are very pleasant. Hardest part of my job is saying no to a room reservation someone requested and is not available."
good,"A hurry up and wait type of job, does help you learn to mange time an learn to meet deadlines, most of the people are nice if they are having a good day, it does seem like management feels like their more powerful than the drivers even tho they claim the drivers are the most prized an have all rights to the world i enjoyed it because its a kinda work at your own paste job with some cases overall its pretty cool if you don't mind being away from loved one and your home state for 3 weeks out the month.."
good,"worked on trailers , air bags , air brakes, and abs systems do wheel seals wheel bearings, s-cams, alignments, welding, use cutting equipment and other time help work on trucks electrical system they used my tools a lot that they don't have there. I learned lot like different types of components that can be install and have the right tools to do it . management is great and they stress a lot about safety all the time and got some certificate, I picked up quick. co-workers are great to work with, I can get along with very well ,good communication. hardest part of the job none , most enjoyable , knowing getting the job done right every time, and I can do install ABS systems in less the one hour"
good,"SWIFT TRANS ; is one of the ""Better""truck driving companys  to drive for; "
good,Work was different everyday drove all over the united states. It was hard to be away from home for the long periods of time but you learn to get use to it. Management was good for the most part anything you needed they were on it right away. Co-workers were great people were friendly so were customers. The best part of the job would have to be the traveling.
good,Great Experience.
good,"I was not there long but from what I saw SWIFT was not that bad, the trucks are too darn slow, but the equipment is nice and clean."
good,work becomes easier as time goes on.  Meet new people each day. You don’t have a exact schedule. Pay wasn’t the best but depends on you and how focus you are hitting those miles.
good,"I've learned a lot working with Swift, as a driver and as a person. The managers gives you the miles you want. Even during the slow season, like working locally moving trailers."
good,Had great experience in swift they increase pay so that is a big plus new equipment and are everywhere with terminals all over the country if you are a student i highly recomend swift
good,"Had steady loads was able to be home when I needed was always able to get time off when needed and they worked with me when I was sick"
good,"I had an awesome driver manager. It was my second time working there. Everyone was always great to deal with, our fleet manager was always active and involved. They had even helped me pursue being an owner operator. I always had loads and stayed moving. If I was having an issue they were on top of it."
good,I had a very positive experience with Swift Transportation and only left to pursue a job with better pay and more frequent home time. The fleet managers were always very supportive and tried to keep me driving as much as possible
good,Good job that will always have work and can get you to all different 48 states with never waiting too long for your next load. The dispatchers and driver managers are mostly nice and respectful
good,"For the most part working with Swift was a really great place to be.  Minor ups and downs as with all companies.  "

good,"Good place to work. Wont get rich but good job security. Great equipment. Many options--local, shuttle, over the road. Yearly raises. Performance bonus"
good,Great company that care for the employees. If you have a concern they listen. Awesome management that knows your name and face they don’t treat you like an number.
good,I really like working there. I just had to move . I had found a better job. They are a family oriented company. I plan on going back to work for them.
good,"OTR days were no more than 12 hour work days, started with mentor on the road for first 200 hours driving for the company. Easy going management & easy/flexible to work with +shower, laundry, food, & tv at terminals. Enjoyed long hauls especially at night through the country learned lots of ways to handle tight parking & how to maneuver through tight areas with my 49ft-53ft trailer like in cities including the traffic & how to avoid city traffic. "
good,"Iam working hard and safe driving all day to get more experience"

good,"I really enjoyed working here, I had a great experience as a  phone operator, like all my past jobs the learning experience is very satisfying. I would highly miss Swift Transportation."
good,"always moving. bad pay depending on what you do, good driver managers, nice trucks. Swift training is not worth the 4,000+ dollars. Id would go to a different outfit for the training."
good,I loved Swift Transportation and would go back when I am ready to.  Most of there management is great and the people you work with are lively for the most part.
good,I definitely enjoyed my time while I was employed at Swift Transportation. Great work environment. Management dedicates themselves to working with the employees and creating that enjoyable work environment. It was great getting to know some of the drivers that are employed there and learning some helpful tips and also teaching them what they can do to make every trip a safe one. The co-workers are friendly and knowledgeable and assist you with acquiring the skills and knowledge you need to perform routine tasks required for the company. All around great place to work. If I had the chance to go back I would. I would definitely recommend this establishment to anyone who asks.
good,"I enjoyed the line haul/ shuttle run which was 4 on two off rotating. Was home everyday. This involved operation of commercial equipment. Met a driver swapped equipment and return to drop yard, nothing to hard about it."
good,"Well cordinnated company"
good,"Great starter company, been with them for a short period of time and I don't really have anything bad to say they have great office workers around the terminal in Phoenix, AZ but pay is low and slow trucks but hey everyone has to get started somewhere and swift helped me better then crst ever did."
good,I love working for Swift. They are great with getting you loads. They are also great with getting you home time when you REQUEST it. Management is okay.

good,Working for Swift was a very great opportunity to gain the experience needed. I was able to venture the open road and learn the 48 state accessible buy Truck.
good,"If on dedicated run, makes for good work week. Most managers are very supportive of their drivers. Home time is given when needed, with no questions asked.  Very little down time when during slow periods."
good,"good dispatchiing, great place to work. terminal easy to find, lot of cross country driving for teams. no forced dispatch"
good,"Good place to start a career, friendly staff, great advancement opportunities"

good,fast pace 5 stars great place to work. enjoyed working there and enjoyed working with all the driver that was on staff.
good,start the day loading or unloading and then over the road drivining state to state

good,"At the job i'm at now i work with Swifts cafe"" and i work the register for 8 hours talking to truck drivers and getting to know them. In my prior job i worked with Senior citizens in a retire home as their security i answered phones alarms to help the resident out did data entry and i worked real well with others and get along with co workers as well. the hardest part of the job was seeing them move on"
good,Very adventuresome with beautiful scenery! Work was easy and I felt right at home.
good,"Learned how to drive a Semi-Truck & trailer; Management is excellent; worked well with co-workers when seeing them; traveling in winter in mountain areas; The most enjoyable part of the job is traveling to different states, had been all over the US"
good,Don't listen to other truckers when they speak on swift.  This is a huge company with lots of new drivers. Just pay close attention to your mentor and your surroundings while driving.
good,Safe environment to work new things that rise from 8 hours a day to ten so you don't have to work weekends and more home time with your family doing the holidays
good,"I have been with Swift for 4 years now. I've been on the Target dedicated account for 3 and a half. I have nothing bad to say about Swift. It is a great company with great pay if you will stick it out. They have drive cams in the truck and are sticklers about followng distance (6-8 sec.) and stopping behind the white line at lights and stop signs. It's hard to adjust to at first but becomes second nature. They are simply trying to reduce the number of accidents and tickets. If you obey these rules and stay off their radar when it comes to safety issues you will go far and can,make really good money."
good,"Driver / operator good company long hours lots of driving and I moved town so could not stay with company."
good,They have good trucks I drove in a 2016... They took care of me on the road...seeing the USA was exciting an lots of fun...lots of good friends an worker's I met...
good,"Swift was the best place to work by far. They are always recognizing employees for their hard work. the pay was also great. However, the management was horrible. Lots of politics."
good,"I Love working there , unfortunately the management dint help enough make grow the department . Team work , friendly co-workers."
good,"Stick it out.Swift WILL take care of you.I am very well versed of the ins and outs of trucking.From what I know have seen and experienced Swift is well above average so far as trucking companies go.Stay safe,professional and dependable,and any man or woman can enjoy great success at Swift.Pure and simple."
good,"I love my job, swift gave me my license, helped me support my home and I've been promoted 4 times in 4 years. I'm still a casual driver yet work great hours in the office supporting those like myself. I love it. My boss is my friend thanks samica ! I love working with my target team as well"
good,"Overall Good Company, Drivers not paying attention to what they are doing is what makes them look bad all the time. I have had the opportunity work the whole upper 48 states while working at Swift."
good,"Fast paced training, but they show you what needs to be done. Listen to your trainer, and always remember, SAFETY is always number 1! Company could be more relaxed on their no idling rules."
good,Swift is a good company to work for. For my position as driver leader I felt I should get paid more. Swift started me out as an ECT(extended Coverage Team) in Intermodal and started me out at a fair wage. Have been with Swift 11 years and it's really not a bad company to work for.
good,great place to work good people as well the only thing is that the training was vary poor and the lunch area was always  full at swift I was able to do hands on and do havey lifting
good,"This is by far one of the greatest experiences I have ever had while working.  From the drivers we served to the support throughout the organization nation wide, I have found life-time extended family members.  Training is second to none.  Workers are the greatest.  Management is the Best!!!  Had I not found my wife, married and moved  to Chicago, I would still be working there.  The organization treated me with utmost dignity and respect!!!"
good,Fast paced environment. Must be able to back the truck and trailer into desired area for loading and unloading. Pay is good as long as the wheels are turning.
good,"Good job security, Good compensation as an Independent Owner Operator. Overall good company: despite their reputation they are not bad to work with. AS with most things in life it is what one makes of it."
good,Working with drivers and managers from all over the country.  Solving problems for customers.  Pleasing both management and clients.  Thus making company profitable and aid in growth.
good,First job for CDL's.  The company is a great company but pay rate isn't great for team drivers. I'd recommend Swift for first time driving company.  Very nice dispatchers and staff.
good,they will teach you on the job and there is always chances to further your career in this company. i would srongly reffer this to many young techinicand fresh out of school
good,I had a great experience here with Swift. I always had loads and always made it home on time when I requested home time. Managers were always there to answer questions.
good,if you can learn fast you will fit in.if not you'll have to learn to speed up but they do help you to figure things out if you look like your stumped and its ok if your nervous
good,If you're not accustomed to life over the road is not for you is hard to be with some one and still be out there for months at a time.  It's a good job if you love to travel.
good,"Good comapny to start with, especially there traing classes very profesional and very respectful company. The best is there equipment very good and good miles."
good,One of if not the best company I've ever worked for not complaints from me.I got to travel and see the nation with this company. They have Terminals in most states if not two or more.
good,Very clean and fun. Worked for only 5 weeks. Learned a ton of valuable information that I can apply to my future job. Did oil changes and inspections.

good,its a hard life but fun and rewarding..not alot of home time. great equipment and dispatchers lots of miles. wold have stayed but for family issues..
good,Found school to be very professional and informative. Never had a problem getting loads long and short. This has been a great company to work for.
good,"Reviewed, verified and processed student driver applications. Scheduled transportation, medical physicals, and new work assignments."
good,"I love seeing the students face light up after they overcome what they feared was impossible,going from scared of the truck to truck driver.Swift is strong on safety and provide you with information on how to be and teach safety.I love teaching driving and backing skills. The great thing about it is I,m being paid to do it."
good,"Great place to work, steady home time whenever you need it. Great program to start as an owner operator."
good,"Excelentes condiciones de trabajo con muy buenos beneficios para el empleado, como ser grandes descuentos en carniceria propia, mutual con gran cantidad de variados productos y muy buenos precios,atencion medica en la empresa etc....mi trabajo consistio en repartir mercaderia en pequeños y grandes comercios de la ciudad y de diferentes puntos en todo el pais.Me lleve como aprendizaje gran experiencia en el manejo de camiones asi como mucho conocimiento de rutas y ciudades y a su ves el contacto con la gente y el manejo de relaciones comerciales.Lo que mas me gusto fue la independencia que tenia para desarrollar mi trabajo, lo mas dificil fue cuando la empresa decide cerrar la transportadora quedando sin empleo y los trastornos que ello conlleva."
good,"Great training and experience. Enjoyable time spent understanding other drivers from a wide range of experience. A little difficult dealing with other motorists on the road as many do not know about how to drive around trucks, my overall opinion is that I had more fun and memorable moments driving cross-country in a variety of terrain."
good,"Procesos de trabajo no marcados "
good,Trainning new hired drivers to preform the duties of their job.Learned how to inspire student drivers to perfom at maximum performance levels and continue what i had taught them to have successful careers. Hardest part of the job is staying out on the road for months at a time. Traveling and seeing the countryside is extreamly enjoyable.
good,  Treasury Management and Expense Controller.
good,"I went to Swift straight out of driving school and for someone of my caliber, the company trainers that I trained with were very knowledgeable and impressive. Other drivers were friendly and helpful. Management was fair and tolerated my inexperience until I got it right. What made this job most enjoyable for me was the willingness to teach and expose me to so much so quickly. Unfortunate for me at that time was my inability to balance my home and work life. The hardest thing for me to do was to part employment from this company."
good,"very good it was good experience for me after truck driver school,"
good,as a new driver Swift transportation gave me every opportunity to learn interstate trucking if their was a problem they were quick to solve it
good,"create orders call vendors for appointments, track loads for customers, keep customer happy onsite for vendor. Hardest part of the job tracking the trucks contacting the drivers to find out why they are late for pick up or delivery, explain to the customers the delays.  funniest part is speaking to the vendors setting up appointments with them."
good,"Diagnose and repair trucks and trailers, including preventative maintenance, inspections, repair to air brakes, tires, steering and suspension, and electrical system."
good,"The upper management is approachable. The schedule is easy to adhere too. I have nothing bad to say about Swift. I don’t like the dash cams in the truck, but they can make the driver a safer driver."
good,If you are looking to get into flat bed and work hard this will be the place for you. They have a good training program but like all thing they need to redo the class.
good,"Swift is a great place to learn and grow.  The company is always changing for the better and I can not say enough good things about them. Whether you are a driver or office staff, you will enjoy your time here."
good,Great place to start your career. What more can I say. Honestly 150 characters? This is quite a laborious process to simply try and apply for a job...
good,A typical day would be the doping and hook of the trailers. Swift management would keep their drivers happy by keeping their word. The work place culture was always safety first. The hardest part of the job was training but the most enjoyable was the training.
good,"Great management, relaxed setting, easy work. I would typically start off my day picking up from a customer. Deliver the freight to its destination, then repeat."
good,"With Swift being a training company, and one of the largest trucking companies out there it's great it gives potential truck drivers a opportunity to drive long haul,  people who are looking to get on the road. Swift puts back into the company and has continuous training for their drivers, State-of-the-art equipment for training even though the industry is constantly evolving. Along with a fleet of newer trucks every year."
good,"The driver trainer was a great instructor to drive with. Assisted very well with converting from military trucks to civilian trucks. The other drivers were good also, to drive with."
good,"I would contact vendors on cost savings put together a power point presentation on why, when and how. Finding quality material and asking vendor to negotiate a cost saving program. Presenting the presentation and program to the floor managers upon approval or needing more information was how the day would go. I learned to be more professional with speaking levels of management terms. work culture was very professional and working as a team was enjoyable."
good,"Work for 5 years with Swift Transportation,great company with flexible hours and great management, very friendly working environment, i am in charge of the Trailer shop, as Supervisor and have always had a possitive attitude with others, and assist in any way i can."

good,"Very fast paced, long hours, highly stressful but good pay. "
good,"The division I was in was very to work in.  There were several members assigned to the team.  This made it very easy to exchange ideas.  The team concept also helped to get problems solved quickly.  In the department I was assigned to, we were always finding new methods and implementing them.  It was a very progressive environment."
good,"Very fast paced. You need to know your stuff! There is room for advancement, from technical to management. They constantly upgrade hardware and software to be on the cutting edge."

good,"I arrive early, see whats going on that day.  See if there's anything I  can help with,talk to others while waiting to clock in.  I thinkthat the hardest part of drivinga truck is you never know what  others are going to do while they're driving.  I love todrive and meet new people  out on the road."
good,"Good management and mentor. Good company to start out driving with. I love driving but this company did not give me enough miles."

A typical day at Swift transportaion is helping internal and external customers with their needs. Ive learned alot from the management through out these years, the positive notes ive tried to make them better and the negative notes i avoid doing to my emplolyees. The hardest part of the this job is reducing turnover."

One would appreciate this type of organization because it reduces the stress of keeping track of your hours of drivining, on duty and maintaining your 70 hour clock.

good,Swift Transportation has it's own repair shops and cafeteria at select locations along with it's own fueling facility. Owner/operators & Company drivers can fully utilize all these facilities.

One of most wonderful aspects of working for Swift was that I never felt alone or hopeless.  Any problem that I'd ever encountered had a solution, and help was just a phone call away.  Swift Charities is a God send!!!  I say this only because they blessed me when I truly needed them.  Working at Swift taught me about the Supply Chain System and Logistics that the university could never prepare for.  I tip my hat to the many wonderful Drivers that deliver on-time nearly all the time."

good,Swift is a good place to work for. they have a good financially sound platform. On a typical day as a OTR driver I would drive for 10 hours. The cultural is good and so is the people. The hardest part for me was being away from my family. The enjoyable part though I had the ability to see the country.
good,Worked a high demanding dedicated account in Chicago. Very challenging for a new driver.  I would been more successful if Swift would have not thrown me into such demanding and difficult route my first night alone.

I am not sure if they do tanker or not you would have to ask management. Anyway, they will train you to get your cdl, and they could put you into a truck in as soon as i think 8 weeks from their driving academy? Someone please correct me if I am wrong on that.

It gave me great pleasure doing my work to the best of my ability. It was so rewarding for me to verify the information that I had to have in order to see that drivers were hired. One of the hardest things was having to review the driving records and discovering that a person was not qualified to be hired.

When I went to work for Swift 12 years ago I had no knowledge of the transportation business. Swift gave me the opportunity and I learned a great deal. Everything from dispatching to DOT regulations to how to read BOL to safety. My coworkers have been there for many many years. It felt like a big family. There was someone always cracking jokes and that made the surroundings very fun. The hardest part of the job was taking a day off. Because when you came back you were super backed up plus the work for that day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.

Very rare I'm forced to take a 34hr reset unless the load has time to stall out. No forced dispatch here. Make money as much as you want too.
