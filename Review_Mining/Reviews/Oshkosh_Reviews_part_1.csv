rating,review
bad,"You’re just a number working here there’s no support working the off shifts. There’s tons of favoritism on all 3 shifts at the Shippensburg facility. A husband & wife run the show on an off shift & they both have ganged together more than once to make other team members life miserable to the point several have quit, which was their alterative motive. Upper management does nothing about it!"
bad,"Unless you are not an African American, you want be discriminated against but if you are then it's possible that they see you differently than others by not giving you the same opportunities."
bad,"not good, head over expects way too much from employees. But remember you still have to be customer focused. The take the fun out of helping the customer shop. The company is way too serious for a children's store right down to dress code"
bad,"This place is a joke!  VERY POOR management and leadership.  The typical day starts with about an hour of workers  wandering/ talking  on their phones and horsing around.   The production speed is just above crawling speed.  Most workers  ""are just trying to look busy"" . There is NO MANAGEMENT accountability .  They expect you to use your own tools, but don't order them or have them ready for use.   The waste of supplies is also unbelievable.   MGMT makes false promises they NEVER deliver.  Didn't ever see  that Management has the experience to lead or train.  The team leaders would leave without direction, tools or instructions to workers... therefore they are left to ""look busy over and over"" when in reality they weren't. Mass layoffs at every level are common which should say something about the management style.  The poor management and direction with this company made it hard to want to go back and work another day.  Too much horse play, gossip and  back scratching going on here!"
bad,"The company acts like they are progressive and take care of their people first but they do not.  The Oshkosh Defense department Human Resource team is an embarrassment to the profession as they are immature, cliquey and manage based upon popularity rather than fairness and objectivity.  The JLG division is far more professional."
bad,They treat the union employees as Expendables if they get injured at work they deny the injury and say it happened outside of work or was a pre-existing condition. They treat the coordinators as pawns  don't plan on having a good work life here.
bad,poor management they did not treat me fair just all round bad place to work.they targeted people never listened to more experienced people based on there jobs.
bad,Employer completely mis-led me to believe the salary and travel for this employment. Managers hired their own family members and some spoke to you as if you were dirt.
bad,"Hourly rate was not fair, too much overtime.  Was working 12 hours a day including weekends.  No job advancement, once you start working you will be at the same position for ever."
bad,Terrible job. There is no set Pay scale. 50-60 hour work weeks. Terrible health insurance. The pay is higher than some but not worth the stress. Would not recommend a job here to my worst enemy
bad,"Extremely sexist. I can't even begin to explain..."
bad,"They love to lie to their employees, Record breaking profits year after year but did away with Christmas bonus after making everyone think they were getting one. They also make you save your vacation days for shutdown week. The Orrville location upset so many people after announcing the companies shutdown that they have to install metal detectors and hire armed guards to deter angry employees. never seen anything like it. 600 people out of a job many of whom have worked there for years and bleed for that company. SICKENING. JLG = jokes lies and games"
bad,"They are closing their doors in Sept  so there is no future a typical day would be to come into a crappie  ran like dirt place ,the company onlyou cares about making money for the  corporation they make you work  7 days a week after they tell you they are closing the facility down,stay away from this place"
bad,Would not recommend this job. Very unprofessional work environment insides this training center. The management was very poor and insulting to the employees.
bad,The full time employees were not helpful in training the temporary workers. The line supervisor was never present during the shift.
bad,"this place is just one contradiction after another. They focus on appearance only. often referred to as ""Jokes, Lies and Games, Janitorial Learning Group and Just Lying Guys"". They paint a really nice picture during interview, but once you work there you find out that everything was a lie. Poor management. They'll do whatever they can to screw you out of a raise and if they cant find any reason they will make something up. They ""say"" that they care about their employees but do nothing at all to show it. All they care about is pushing products out the door. They ""say"" they care about quality yet there is absolutly NO quality control. After 2008 the place went straight down the toilet!"
bad,Management is a joke. The work is not bad. But HR doesn't do jack. High turn over rate because of management
bad,The Pay and Benefits are Good. The Safety program is retroactive. The management was young and inexperienced and not very accommodating to suggestions. Human Resources is very unprofessional and unorganized. Co workers were helpful but the more senior they were the less helpful and/or caring they were.
bad,"Oshkosh Corp South Plant Production is Union and they give jobs to union people who are not qualified - they need more education, experience, but these people are protected by the union. And the rest of us are not considered because of the union even though we are more educated and exererienced."
bad,"Alot of work to do and not enough appreciation for doing it, this company closed stores around the holidays with no placement for the employees."
bad,"I worked for Pierce for several years and when OTC stepped in, nobody was safe. They put their people in the places they wanted and then pushed the people that were good at their job right out the door by holding medical FMLA against attendance."
bad,"From my first day there I experience dissension and animosity from the direct employees. They felt cheated that they should answer a question. My predecessor was forced out because she believed in what she was doing was right and was chastised for it. I made one lousy phone call outside for privacy and got shown the door, while direct hires have verbal wars in the office dropping F-bombs! If you report bad behavior from one of the directs to their. manger, you get the door. Not a friendly and stable place to work! This place is off limits to anyone who has an once of self-respect in them!"
bad,This was one of the worst jobs I ever worked for. They wouldn’t let you have any days off. If they did they chose them for you. It was extremely long and boring days. I worked there for a while and was so miserable I decided to give my notice and the manager literally harassed me over the phone and verbally attacked me. Like please it’s a minimum wage job and the manager was fake and rude.
bad,"Poor management decisions, management talks from both sides of their mouths. Management and union can’t get along together. They hire bosses that treat people like idiots. Horrible quality process along with quality managers, try and change things every 6 months with no clue of what there doing. Want to work weekends because company can’t manage people. No accountability held for workers. They hire outside companies to run our payroll and screw everything up ."
bad,"I worked at JLG through a temp agency from June 2015-end of July 2015. I loved my job! I started training for 3 weeks on first shift which was great. I had no problems with anyone and management was great. Once I got placed on 3rd shift, things went downhill quickly. There is really only 1 maybe 2 supervisors on 3rd shift and several line leaders. It's a free for all on 3rd shift. The men on 3rd shift are extremely perverted, especially the line leader for the 400 line. I had an incident with not just  harassed but I was  assaulted by a male employee and I was suspended for it. I also had several complaints about the line leader and supervisor involving the line leader  harassing me and other women and how both the line leader and supervisor handled my situation. Nothing was done about any of it. They wouldn't move me to another shift to get away from them or even to another area. Don't work here on any shift but 1st where there is plenty of supervision to watch your back and if you do choose to work here on any other shift, don't complain about harassment, especially if it involves management, because YOU will be suspended and nothing else will be done about it. Had it not been for that, I would still be there because I genuinely loved the job I did."
bad,they lie about everything. problems do not get resolved. they hire you for a certain job and you end up doing 20 other peoples jobs. the pay and the health care are unfair to people with skilled back rounds.
bad,"they stress quality but let major defects out the door. very little support from engineers, supervisor or leads. figure it out/make it work mantra. safety is low hanging fruit."
bad,"I was promised a promotion and had unbelievable praise on my work but when I missed some time for being ill, I was basically replaced. Expects priority over work life balance."
bad,"The general manager there does absolutely nothing and is very rude and unhelpful to customers and employees. The environment without her around is usually very good, though. Everything is well organized. I loved all of my coworkers, they made it very fun."
bad,"Poor management."
bad,"I worked for Oshkosh for a short period of time, and all I can say is to NOT work here. No matter if you are going to be salaried, or hourly union worker. The culture bred at this place is absolutely horrible and this comes from having 20 years experience within manufacturing."
bad,"They tell you you'll work 4-tens, turns out you'll work 4- 12's and a mandatory 8 hour shift. Other employees screw with your tools. I was there for one week and moved on."
bad,"Just seeing if this will work this time; last review didn't! Do Not hire with the MIXER division! Run by Idiots! Tours & meetings, No results! They fix things till Everything is Broken!"
bad,Corporate leadership is severely lacking and people are leaving all the time because of it.  
bad,If u like money great place to work but if u want time off not a good place mandatory every weekend almost no free time to spend with family or friends even when slow they made u work weekends
bad,"""People first"" is not a reality in Clearwater. Service Depart. supervisor doesn't talk/give instructions to new assemblers,it happened more than once."
bad,"Great place to work if your not a slower learner, if u don't mind being threatened by other employees because management does NOTHING about it! As long as u don't make a mistake because your trainer gets PO'd about it and won't answer any of your questions or even speak to u at all. If u don't mind being talked about and laughed at instead of being offered help if you're struggling with something. If u don't mind being shown ONCE if AT ALL how to do something then being expected to KNOW how to do it even if you've had literally NO EXPERIENCE doing this kind of work whatsoever! There's an extreme amount of waiting around which makes the day go by really slow. If you don't mind having MANDATORY 10 hr. Days and Saturdays. If all of this appeals to u then THIS is the PERFECT place to work!"
bad,If your looking to make money there is an abundance of mandatory ot. Not much time for family or free time outside of work. Machines are very outdated
bad,This is the most boring company you will ever work in.  My boss had been there 40 years.  Just a very boring and dead place - and the area of WI that it's in is just as bad - a boring industrial area with terrible winters.
bad,"No doubt the worst place I ever worked.  Unless you were in the click you were never safe.  It didn't  matter what your work was like.  Talk about the good old boys club, just awful.  What you hear about the company in the community is true, don't go there unless job security isn't important to you.  Never saw a company with no ethics at all"
bad,"Loved the first month or two of working here, until I switched to offshift. Management is very poor, lack I communication. Work 7 days a week constantly and lied to about weekends being mandatory. 10/10 would not reccomend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"altijd hetzelfde werk"
bad,"Just a number, lack of direction, only out for the company, employees bend over backwards for minimal rewards. Relocates product lines a lot which drives turn over rate high."
bad,I already wrote a review for this company. I do not like the environment at all. the people act like children with all the gossip and playing on there phones all the time.
bad,"Excellent pay and benefits. Working at this company requires a different balance of work ethic and morals than I was accustomed to. The politics within this corporation make for a difficult work environment that affects all employees from the shop floor to upper management. If you want to work here, leave your opinions, humanity, and morality at the door. Plan to work harder, not smarter."
bad,I do not recommend going to work at oshkosh Corp unless you just want a pay check and don’t care about quality your time and having goals and achievements. Management has ruined that place with greed and lies. If it wasn’t mainly government funded contracts it would be out of business by now. And even that is close to ending at times when the government comes and inspect processes.
bad,"The job started off as okay but within two weeks in it started to go down hill. The mangers and some of the employees were rude and disrespectful, and they dont know how to talk to people or have patients."
bad,"Over worked - underpaid.  They start you out at decent pay, then they make every excuse in the book to not give you a raise.  Meanwhile, you have to train the new people they hire at a higher rat of pay. But then they don't get raises and eventually realize that they are now training people that got hired at a higher rate of pay."
bad,"The company is very reactionary about problems or safety. Quarterly results drive decisions regardless of what you are told. Before considering them look at safety reports and ask yourself if you can do this. "
bad,"I was told from day 1 to leave and find another job from at least 95% of all employees I came in contact with.  It's a sweat shop that pays nothing.  But, the people that put up with it are cool."
bad,"Family owned business that is very difficult to work for"
bad,"I had alot of great co workers, management doesn't listen to constructive feedback.  Great benefits.  If you are looking for a job where you will be heard and appreciated, go elsewhere."
bad,Bad company to work for. Management moved people in stressful positions. Managers abused employee.s by threats and job assignments.The culture union. Hardest part communication. Nothing enjoyable
bad,Very low pay for the amount of work they expect.  Upper management constantly trying to push jobs out the door.  With all the rush a lot of these jobs end up coming back for rework or employees are flown out to the site to fix the mistakes that should have been dealt with before the job left. All management is worried about is pushing jobs out the door so it looks good to Oshkosh for the month.  Once they get to the point where no more jobs to push forward then they start looking at having layoffs to cut back on costs. This company needs to be more concerned about the quality of work they are producing and giving customers unrealistic dates they know they can't meet. Overall there are some good people there but there also some that should have been terminated along time ago.
bad,"Very cut-throat environment. In the office, it was all about who you knew. Some people worked there for a few years with no promotions while others received a new promotion every 6 months. Tons of ""managers"" who didn't manage anyone or anything. Very political. They hire a lot of veterans (which is really awesome!!!), but the military way of doing things shows up at work a lot and not everyone responds well to that ""my way or the highway"" type of mentality from their supervisor. Saw it cause a lot of friction more than once, and supervisors weren't willing to adjust in order to successfully work with employees. Work-Life balance is only a thing for Directors/Plant Managers on up. Lots of talking behind your back and then surprises in your annual review. There's no feedback during the year. Union/Management relationship is very poor too and makes it difficult to get your work done or focus when you're busy playing chess all day with the next union move."
bad,"My day begins without input from employees on how our ideas could work to complete a task. I have learned how to work in an environment that I have not been treated the best but made the best of what was offered. Management is hard to work with do to turn over of supervisors. Example.. 4 supervisors in the last 6 months. "
bad,"There are politics in every organization, always.  I must say that I have never seen an organization where people are so fearful, it forces them to look out for themselves.  People you think you can trust you can find out too late they are only using your trust to benefit and protect themselves.  Employees survive there either keep their heads down or are good are using/attacking others to make themselves look better.  Really too bad because there are good people there and their products are meaningful."
bad,The company payed good.Mangement and workers in a union enviroment did not get along.Every floor worker is walking on egg shells.Not a good place to work.To much non job related stuf between union and company. I really liked the the 23 people i was a team leader for.Them guys I would go to bat for anytime.They really cared about the quality product we put out unlike most of the oshkosh workers.
bad,"They will overwork employees to the point of injury and claim the injurys did not occur at the work place. Fabrication department is known for muscle tears and strains from pushing employees to meet unattainable production numbers. Your 14 paid vacation days, 5 of them must go to the company's set shut downs."
bad,"The company has a good benefits package, but the starting wages are very low. You get reviews twice a year, but if you do not jump through every loop you will not get a raise. The last two reviews I was given were given by two very new supervisors that were not even with the company fo half of the 6 month review period. Also, job placement and advancement is based upon who you are related to not what you know. The positive is that they have been paying tuition reimbursement while I worked there.Low pay and Nepotism"
bad,"poor management, manager was not even well trained."
bad,Hired as a welder worked for 15 years as a welder been through three work related back surgeries ended up with a disability from injuries. Company fired me for performance because of my disability than offered me a job with lower pay. Disability Harassment and Discrimination and there is nothing a person can do about it. I wish I would of thought twice about my job. Lost my skilled trade because of it.
bad,This is a company that is good for new employees to the field of Purchasing.  I would not recommend this place for skilled professionals.  This is a good place to start.  Teaches you expediting processes.
bad,"Oshkosh Defense is a very fast paced company that encourages their employees to continuously learn. Stress levels are normally very high as our customers create deadlines that are extremely tight. As an engineer, you will gain knowledge in all kinds of mechanical systems, electrical systems, pneumatic systems, etc. The coolest part about this job is the product. I truly enjoyed taking these trucks apart. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management for unrealistic expectations. Overall, this is not a bad place to work if you are trying to learn and grow your skill sets to move on to another company."
bad,Started working there as a test technician. Was hostile work environment from day one. Being there under contract the non union employees did not want me there. No help to learn job. Said something to management which just made things worst. Worked there about 6 months and finally had to leave.
bad,Company has no room for advancement and they keep on laying off.  Doesn't seem like a place to grow. Plus I want to pursue a career in criminal justice.
bad,"Typical day at work was over loaded with work and not enough staff. I learned how to open and close the store, Count out draws, and stock shipment."
bad,they don't have very good ventilation system in the building
bad,"Oshkosh Management has just this year started to roll out a corporate wide QMS and OS. There is discontinuity between business segments and even within locations inside of a business unit. The focus is on getting production numbers above all else."
bad,put parts away with a forklift and also picked parts off list to be sent. learned how to pick parts. managment was good at first then after main supervisor went away to another shift whole job went downhill. Good co-workers but bad management and made the job very hard to keep wanting to go back the next day. hardest part of the job was putting up with the supervisors. best part of my job was driving the forklift putting parts away
bad,HR only values degrees not experience. Little advancement opportunities.
bad,a typical day starts with the first 15-20 minutes of people wandering around talking. Then they do it again atleast 10 minutes before any work stoppage. The idea there is to just look busy because there is not accountability. Most people work just hard enough not to get yelled at.
bad,Terrible supervisors and Terrible Union. Clicky personal and backstabbing supervision. Lower senority employees moved around before they can understand there jobs. Overall a terrible place to work you just deal with it because of the pay.
bad,I love the job of being a break press operator  I take pride in hard work but Iowa Mold &Tool was a hostile work environment  for minoritys. Its like a buddy system in the warehouse if ur not originaly from the area u often have a hard time omong fellow co workers.Beside that it's a great job
bad,This company loves to promise you the world but in reality they just plan on screwing you over. It is a rewarding job as you get to be apart of building vehicles for our Military but Management has their own agenda and they will screw you over so they can get ahead.
bad,"Poor management and terrible communication.  Overworked production and fabrication employees.  Job pride is not as strong as it used to be, and products are suffering due to poor moral and lack of management support.  Your peers are fun to work with but it is very difficult to advance within the production side of the company, as they are adamantly a non-union company, so there is barely any protection from poor management and they work on the good ol boy progressive system, they say they don't, but they do."
bad,wi started at oshkosh corp. it was a nice place to work . After five years managers were really bad just ask any production employee
bad,A great mission to ensure that the troops were better protected against IED’s.  We improved the performance and safety of the MRAPS.
bad,a good place to work. No cafeteria and demands 50 hours per week. Oshkosh business systems are not current.
bad,Oshkosh Corporation is a Fortune 250 company but lacks clear vision and leadership. Its a company stuck in 80's and legacy leaders who have been with company for 2-3 decades are the real hurdle to company's growth.
bad,"I worked for a staffing agency to work at Oshkosh Defense, and in our review meeting, we were all told (this would be one of many things) if we were sick, use our judgment since no-one knows ourselves better than ourselves. In my third month, I got slammed with illnesses (all doctor slip notarized and even E.R. confirmed). I always called to let the right personnel know what's going on at Oshkosh Defense as well as the right personnel at the staffing agency I worked at. Everything was apparently o.k. till I got back to work. There I was told that I need to turn in my badge because I never called in (which was a blatant lie). Then to find out the reason was due to me missing work even with the doctor slips. So the company supports management with their tainted/hypocritical decisions. The company also claims that attendance is a priority but that fluctuates depending on which manager you talk to. It's a good paying job (that's for sure) but you end up falling into some sort of dramatic gag real whether you want to or not. If you make it into the union (don't get me on that one) count yourself somewhat lucky, but still, that doesn't always mean you're safe."
bad,"Overworked, un-valued, and unappreciated.  Management are not there to support employees and only look out for themselves.  Management and HR do not care about the person and only look out for their jobs."
bad,"Good work/life balance. You have to be prepared for the structure that you would find to be true with any major corporate environment, but they have a solid focus on innovation and product development."
bad,"Currently work for Pierce manufacturing, I honestly love the day to day tasks and challenges of my role.  It's the culture and deceptive upper management that ruin it. You see the companies true colors after a while and it's ugly. Every employee is just a number to them."
bad,"-Poor location"
bad,A lot of overtime it was good pay not much advancement cutthroat people lots and lots of overtime it was getting too long of a drive after all them years
bad,I spent 8 1/2 years working with this company and the longer I stayed the harder my personality became. Very difficult to speak with management regarding working environment. More worried on bottom line and not how we get to it.
bad,I had zero good experiences...management consists of kids interns that know everything..just ask them.
bad,"Pierce builds great products and most of the working people are friendly and fun to work with. Floor and office personnel work well together however the office is a very tough place to work. Upper management is top heavy and has excessive infighting, politics, and backstabbing between the various departments. Communication across layers of management is very poor. Corporate culture is military like, you take your orders and keep your mouth shut. "
bad,Mznzgment not good but it is steady work so have to give it that
bad,"It’s very hard to get time off. You work everyday for 10 hours a day, and then they take away your holidays, and want you to work. They have no time for bs."
bad,"The pay was good but without a Bachelor's degree you can't advance your career."
bad,"The Leadership Team is completely in touch with the business. This is by far the most employee friendly company that I have worked in. Professional, hard working, top notch employees."
bad,"I'm getting layed off in june, but otherwise the job duties for the positions I held during my time there were good."
bad,Hours were cut severely with no explanation from the manager as to why. I continued to stay in contact with management for better hours with no support from them.
good,Bad benefits and bad training. No proper PPE for new hires. No acommodations for people with disabilities. No room for advancing to first shift in short time..
good,"Ok place to work if you can ignore the day to  day distractions of people carrying on & acting as if they were still in kindergarten."
good,"All said and done at the end of the day its just a factory job, normal factory bull.  great pay but the insurance benefits are lacking.  it seems as they are scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to new hires or its the younger generation that just doesn't want to work/ cant leave the high school drama behind.  "
good,"The work asked of you is okay, but dealing with the over stressed and angry management is the number one reason for people to quit at this company."
good,"Calestenics , overall meeting of cost effectiveness, quality, morale job assignment for the day.  Identical tasks are performed different in other departments. Be your own boss.  Take your own inventory. I will give you all one point for gossip!"
good,"I worked 90-hour weeks to proofread military vehicle proposal documents. It was a lot of work, but great experience and would recommend people to do at least one contract for experience."
good,"A typical day of work involved arriving to work 30 min prior to shift. Brief employees of the days production, and short coming of any parts. Attend 3 meetings per day with management to discuss part shortages, product completions, and team goals. The rest of the day you spend chasing part shortages that either are on hold or being shipped or transferred from the warehouse in Appleton. You end up sending a bunch of trucks off the line that go into rework, cause of part shortages. At the end of the day you feel like you didn't accomplish anything. Upper management doesn't communicate with you. After all that you get to stay 30 min later after shift to track parts, fix Kronos (time keeping) and send your production manager a list of stuff you couldn't complete cause of shortages."
good,"I have worked in many areas while employed at Oshkosh Truck. I started as a 107/Prep and Trim where I hung part to be painted. I was then given the chance to test truck cabs for proper alignment this was a 304 position. I then bid on and was awarded a position as a 201 Assembler, and moved to another one of the plants. This involved installing parts on the trucks, also some assembly work before installation. I then bid and was awarded a position as a 301 General Assembler, this is more involved in working on the entire truck as well as troubleshooting and repairing problems. Best part of my job is the co-workers we work very well together and have fun most of the day. Nothing that I would consider to be hard after spending long nights overseas in Iraq."
good,"Poor upper management, inconsistant, poor judgements and decisions. Not consistant with a large corporation."
good,The basic environment of Oshkosh Truck Corporation was very one sided between the union and the company. The company seemed to have very low regard for the employees.
good,They dont train well at all and their managers are misunderstanding and uncooperative. I had a trainer who would be gone most of the day and leave me without instruction.
good,Nothing to add about working at this company.  They had a job force reduction that resulted in my job being eliminated.  A good place to work while I was there!
good,A lot of forced overtime.There is no set schedule of pay or benefits. The newest hires have a dramatically different pay scale (advancement schedule) than people who were hired at least 5 years ago. Almost no vaction for the first 3 years.
good,"Management tries to run the weld shop like an assembly line."
good,"PROs: Pierce has allot of excellent dedicated and exceptional people on production floor and in office. The work is interesting, constantly changing and can be very demanding. Pay and benefits are good."
good,Every day is a new surprise. Agenda unstable
good,"As a contract buyer you will have lots of opportunities to earn overtime at a good pay rate and most of the time you will have lots of autonomy. On the other hand, your job is really simple and can get boring and monotonous. There is very little opportunities to develop yourself and you'll get the impression that you are there just to do your very simple job and nothing more."
good,"Oshkosh has systemic middle management issues. The problem is that people are only willing to solve the easy problems. No one is taking a good, hard look in the mirror and taking the initiative to do what is necessary to really make good lasting change. Turnover is becoming a problem, and all management can do is apply Band-Aids."
good,Management should really start focusing on the development of their people instead of looking for external candidates with a better education.........
good,"Good pay, strong union, great benefits but job security was only their if you had seniority. Stess level is very high day to day. Only two speeds very fast or very slow when slow often sent home."
good,"good money"
good,A new push for a People First culture makes Oshkosh a desirable place to work. Not all members in management are embracing the change which is causing those departments to fail.
good,Management is always after you to get their numbers out while you try your best to put out a quality product. They sometimes would give up quality to get their numbers. We (production employees) do our best to work with what we got to keep up with managements expectations. The guys I works with are a great crew with solid values and make work a more enjoyable place.
good,You are given the ability to work as hard as you want. When you slow down they will replace you. If you are smart you will leave before they use you all up.
good,All in all not a bad place to work. You make good money but not very challenging for the mind
good,Used D/A (Accu-Pulse) welding process to weld galvanized and military grade armor.
good,"Oshkosh is not an overall bad place to work. However, management is never on the same page with one another. I like that OSK gives young people opportunity, but it does come with a price. Many inexperienced managers do not know how to effectively manage."
good,People first mantra that is all in writing and in their brochure. They dont live up to it. Mandatory 10 and 12 hour days mandatory Saturday's. Constantly told your behind schedule in daily mornibg meetings. Not enough good leadership in Clearwater location. Awesome product that you would be proud to say you work on. High turn around on employees no recognition for doing good.
good,"Good job environment , ability to understand customers and the company. Very short break wasn't allowed to finish meal. No holiday pay, work on holidays."
good,"work environment is very laid back jobs are pretty simple to preform,seasoned workers are very much set in their ways,and do not like to help newer employees"
good,Le falta mas cultura sobre la calidad y poner a la gente mas enfocada sobre el valor de estar en una ensambladora que tiene un alto índice de demanda de trabajo como de seguridad por ser grúas de trabajo.
good,"Management stresses how valuable employees are, yet, are willing to eliminate positions in order to meet short term financial goals regardless of the impact to employees."
good,"my job title was a assembling jlg booms for the 600aj lifts.  i performed necessary visual inspections of the product including grind, drilling and fab work. i also installed hood as well."
good,JLG is like high school. You're either with the cool kids and don't have to worry about your job or you're getting screwed over because of favoritism.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Oshkosh, but it is not for everyone as there was and is still very high turnover.  Job security does always seem to be an issue.  I thought highly of the senior leadership during my time there and the company makes a lot of interesting products."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was my colleagues and learning from them. Learning new jobs and different variety of work and the benefits were good.
good,"currently my production line is under employed and I am working a position on line instead of inspecting or testing offline where i can further my knowledge in mechanics, I am always looking to further my skills and at this point in time i feel as though they are being held back"
good,"Government contractual work.  If no contract, no work.  Work on only one type of vehicle so limited in aspect of what facility can actually do."
good,"This company is filled with great people who are the reason this company succeeds.  Upper management is comprised of a ""good 'ol boys club"" that needs to be cleaned out.  They have little to no business knowledge and were mainly hired for who they know.  They are incapable of making a basic business decision, mainly out of fear they will be wrong."
good,Solid company still trying to find the right mix for the large products flowing at a slow pace.
good,"Management needs A LOT of work. Would not listen to people building the product, would see methods fail regularly because of not listening to workers. Had mind set they can change everything so processes would change without needing to be or taking something that did work, and make it fail. All about numbers. The hardest part was the toll it took on a person, physically. When you felt your repetitive job take it's toll on your body and asked to be moved, they would not move you, causing more physical harm. I always took pride though in what I built, so that was the most rewarding part. Knowing what I was doing could save someone's life despite all the other challenges we faced on a daily basis."
good,"It was a basic distribution centre."
good,"I enjoyed working for Oshkosh Corporation. It is an amazing business and the products that are manufactured are top-of-the-line. Issues arise however with tremendous amounts of turn-around. Employees are often running 12+ hours/day and there is a lack of recognition. I was unable to make many lasting relationships because every couple months, there seemed to be a complete wash and replace in the positions around me. I enjoy working in a fast-paced environment, but  in order to be successful, you need a team of well-versed, connected employees."
good,"Don't waste your time working here. I enjoyed working for Oshkosh truck, because of the people and I enjoyed my job. As soon as you are happy with your job, they will move you to a different job or building. The Management does not care about the employees or their family. They would throw your under a bus to save a dollar. The amount of money that is wasted in this company is sickening."
good,"They boast that they are a people first company, but yet there is nothing they do to actual support the people first movement. Company is only concerned on their number of units they get out in a day and not about properly staffing the work areas. I worked alone in a 2 person station and was supposed to keep the line running building radiators. first shift had 2 people, but yet I was told over and over that there wasn't a need for 2 on 2nd shift. 3 to 4 radiators were what we were suppose to build in a day, meanwhile, while i was trying to keep up with the line, I would build anywhere from 8 to 10 in a 8 hour shift. Over worked and under appreciated."
good,Well trained on the loading and the unloading of trucks using sit down forklift as well as learning how to use and RF scanner and inventory system for the company.
good,"Good place to work, but the hourly rates could be a lot batter then what they are. Easy to get along with the other employs there. and a lot of over time if you want."
good,Basically from the time you are hired at Mcneilus you are expected to work overtime at the mercy of the management. I believe a 45 hour work week should be the maximum hours a employee should have to work but we are expected to work 50 to 55 a week.
good,"Long days,most times could be very stressful.I learned a lot about myself and my ability to advance my welding skills.Management was usually hard to get anything done with.Co-workers were fantastic.Hardest part of the job was working with management.Most enjoyable was the welding itself and good co-workers."
good,boring and lots of over time. nice if you are in a good department. management can move you at any time. not family orientated. the pay is good but the health care is not.
good,Flexible Job but Work/Life Balance is bad. There could be more flexible work schedule or better hours. If accepting a job make sure to ask for additional PTO to start out.
good,"This is a wonderful place to work to acquire lots of overtime and hours. The amount of personal time, even on weekends is hard to come by. The turn out rate is also high, but you can acquire a career here. "
good,Each week requires you to push ahead at full throttle to get the required amount of work completed.  Knowing that the final product will help save lives is rewarding.
good,This job was hardworking and fast paced but I enjoyed that the most. The people I worked with were fun and i did like the job but it was a long drive to work and I was working a lot of overtime so i had no time to see family or friends with the drive and hours.
good,Great pay and benefits but we are all numbers. its just a truck factory that the union does well
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers face when they came to pick up their fire trucks.
good,enjoyed the ability to build military vehicles from the ground up. Also enjoyed the co-workers that i worked with in stations or teams.
good,"The place is very moderate. The work is very easy, I enjoy kids and help assisting the parents find the right sizes for they’re child. The store is very organized"
good,"The work is difficult, but rewarding. The benefits, especially the PTO, is phenomenal. There are opportunities available to advance. Overall, it is a great employer."
good,Good people. People first attitude. Safe and clean work environment. Gave support need to do work. Pay not up to par. Good leadership and management. Easy to talk to about anything and willingness to help
good,Good opportunity to advance within the company. Growing revenues but benefits plans are not as good as they should be. Good working environments for most people.
good,"layoffs are fast and quick without any warning or on job notice. lacks personal feelings for others, work was some times boring because of lack of work load and direction from time leaders and other senior personal"
good,"A company that strongly promotes continuous improvement and 5S principles, but is very much stuck with an aging management group that has been in charge for 30 plus years and are not willing to make the changes necessary that justify their doubling of production in recent years."
good,Worked an average of 55 hours a week assembling cab and its components. It was a clean place to work and had some good people to work with. I left to get back into aviation and relocated to some where else
good,"A typical day would be to start by discussing forecasted deliveries with the plant manager for the month so that I can project the current month's income. Another big part of my day was fielding financial questions from other departments, as well as from my group."
good,"Typical work day consists of problem solving to get things to work and some custom fabrication. I learned some new skills and new ways of thinking to fix something. The hardest part of the job is the hours, second shift hours are long and can be tiring and you dont have much time to get stuff done before work."
good,Oshkosh is a good company to work for. The culture in the work place is work hard to meet the goal and if everyone works hard and the goal at the end of the year is meet everyone gets rewarded.
good,"Kewaunee Fab is kind of outdated but the work is steady and secure. All in all not a terrible place to work, would recommend to any one looking for a good job"
good,"The store encourages every shopper to sign up with Rewarding Moments, which can be a struggle sometimes since customers don't like sharing personal information (even though it's just an email address.)"
good,Oshkosh has a unique culture that requires you to become a part of the old boy network .  Loyalty and quirks of some of the executive staff were somewhat unique
good,Safely drive my forklift outside to the tire area.  Then go and get a tugger and make my rounds to the lines to get empty carts and find out what tires they need for the first machine.  Go back outside and hop on the forklift to put the needed tires on carts that i will then tug to the line.  Certain lines need other parts that i too go and get.  In my spare time i clean outside.
good,"never worked here. no idea why INDEED thinks so but it dows."
good,Oshkosh overworks their employees.  The job itself is okay but they have shortages in areas.  They will find reasons to not give raises. The hours are okay and uniforms are provided.
good,"Not climate controlled, but was in FL. so not all bad. the company overall did well for the employees. the benefits where on par the the companies in the area maybe even a little better."
good,"A typical day on the shop floor at Oshkosh Corp. involved a range of assembly tasks on an assembly line.  Manual installation of components in an assembly station to gradually assemble a complete vehicle.  Each vehicle may be slightly different, but when working as an assembler a persons task remains the same on each different vehicle.  Repetitious work that eventually fails to challenge a person, therefore becoming dull and monotonous."
good,Jerr-dan corporation was the second manufacturing employer that I worked for. I learned many things there that I currently refer to when solving problems in the workplace.
good,High stress environment with opportunities for advancement.  CEO is highly ethical and is always willing to go to bat for his employees.
good,"travel to customer location to perform duties, meet great people, never work at the same location for more than that day. work on your own."
good,sand trucks and take off part for final paint and umask trucks and put part on after they were painted. learned the parts of cement and garbage truck and where they go when the final paint is done and the holes to hook up to manually turn dumb with air compressor
good,Dirty place to work. At times work load not very strong. When work was slow they had layoffs and then forced overtime when they needed to get caught up.
good,"Made great money, but the management treats you like you are still high school with over exemplification of rules  .  There is a ""no respect"" relationship between production employees and management."
good,The majority was worth while but the employees were often counter to the company. Management was usually unable to understand skills needed to run a weld shop. Co-workers often worked hard and were ok to be around. The best part was knowing where the finished product ended up and it inspired to keep workers on the lookout for higher quality.
good,"inventory control"
good,"The work was very interesting but at times not challenging. I did not learn much more that I already knew. I have many years in Engineering and was treated like I was in high school. The management was good and bad. Some managers were very young and immature. All my coworkers were young, except for some very few that worked their most of their career there, but they were hidden, not in Management roles. The hardest part of the job was not being allowed to do much beyond daily or weekly tasks - not being able to feel like you have some ownership in your role. The best part was the benefits. So if you want to do day to day tasks, be led by young people with master's degrees and just collect your pay . . . they value education more than experience. Good for a first job."
good,Dig right into my work and do the best quality work i can. the hardest part of this job is putting out consistant quality work.
good,"McNeilus Truck and Mfg. is an extremely fast paced environment faced with the challenges of some growing pains.  It can be challenging to recruit and develop a high potential team in a very rural environment.  "
good,"Steady work throughout the day, fast paced environment overall generally a save atmosphere.  Most people look out for one another.  Hard to move up the chain of command without having a degree and being in 'the click'. Very clean work environment generally 8 to 10 hours 5 to 6 days per week sometimes 7 days. Teamwork would be considered a 6 out of 10 in most cases, accountability can lack at times. Assemblers are expected to go search for parts and expected to do part of managements work load."
good,I really liked my job here but the work load and production demands made things hard at times. My job depended on the contracts retained by and awarded to Oshkosh Corporation. When the workload was high things were good but in the last couple of months the workload declined greatly and many of the workers there were laid off in multiple rounds.
good,Welding parts for military vehicles while making a nice wage. Good steady job and for the most part a decent place to work.
good,"Good environment, good people. As one of my first jobs, I learned a lot from there, especially customer service."
good,"At Pierce I worked at the front sales desk. I greeted customers, answered phones and worked on miscellaneous projects. Hardest part of the job was that it would never be a permanent job for me. Most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people from all over the US."
good,Although a smaller locations this was a good company to work for.
good,"-nice people to work with and collaborate"
good,"A typical day at work was never typical.  Anything could change day to day - be it a floor plan, new manager, termination, displacement, equipment, etc"
good,didnt like the hours but good pay. i put parts together for military vehicles.
good,"Becoming more diversified, some managers put emphasis on work-life balance."
good,"Fabricate bumpers, ladders and conduit ports out of aluminum. Build from ground up disaster relief vehicles with single or double slide outs. Assemble news anchor vans inside and out with technological instrument panels related to desired use.   "
good,"I deal with suppliers to get quotes on parts we sell and parts we are looking to sell in the future. I came up with many process improvements that we have implemented. One process now take 1/3 the time it did prior to my involvement. The most enjoyable part of my job is my project work, where I get to problem solve and implement processes that save the company time and money."
good,"It was a good job as a contractor but family time was not the, pay was good, all though it was a rough life. this is not a job with a person with family"
good,"Hard working, effencent, common sence, work well with fellow employees, communication skills, willing to learn."
good,"Good people to work with. Management driven hard...push this intensity down to all levels of the organization."
good,Oshkosh Corporation is an organization the knows where and what their strengths are.  The government contracts they receive allow them to strive as an organization.
good,"The shop was busy, fast pace. Enjoyed learning the Heavy duty truck industry. a lot of computer work, data entry, flow charts and ordering parts. Work with large corporation and city's fleet departments, scheduling repairs and calling with estimates."
good,Not a very fun place to work when a employee always had to be looking over shoulder to see if they were going to get wrote up as when it came close to a contract end for the company they would look for reasons to write up and remove an employee
good,"In this particular store it was kinda every person for themselves. I took on the role of training other associates, and helping them grow at the job. We would receive a lot of shipment and had a small backroom so we were constantly moving things around or reworking the backroom to get everything put away."
good,"production welding"
good,"Typical manufacturing company."
good,"Oshkosh Corporation is a great place to work.  Salaries are good and they have a robust benefits package.  However, if you look towards upward mobility you might want to look elsewhere.  The management teams from 20+ years ago are solidly rooted in the company and have formed alliances and bonds that are not easily broken.   If you are not in the 'old-school' club you are not welcome and are seen as a threat to the older schools of thought.  In all my years there I never got an offer to get a new job in a new city, an offer to get promoted to a new position within another segment, or anything of the sort.  I did get a promotion, which came with zero training, zero support from the managers and very little guidance on what the hell I was supposed to do."
good,"Nothings stands out about my time at Oshkosh.  It is mostly military and large trucks.  Excellent product quality, workers really care about final product."
good,maintain all of facility machine repairs and anything to do with replacement of lights and bulbs.. these are things that i enjoy doing. learned to repair different type of machines than i have worked on before.
good,The management of Oshkosh is very solid and well focused.  They hire quality people and the work environment is positive.  This is a company with a solid future.
good,Oshkosh Corp. provides me with a broad scope of responsibilities across four highly distinct business segments. Many new business development efforts ongoing consecutively which presents challenges that require flexibility and highly adaptive mindset.
good,"Most of the workers are lazy and complain. I feel it can be a better work place if the environment was more appreciated by the workers and if they were more motivated. The management is lacking in attention to the workers, tools, and proper production. There is little disciplinary action toward the workers and there misconduct. The attendance is extremely strict with little understanding for medical issues and personal life, but the attendance policy is tolerable. There is a lot of communication between the team leads and supervisors, but most of the communication is either too late, unnecessary, or misconstrued amongst the leadership."
good,JLG says they were about quality of the work but it was more of the numbers you could get. Each day became more stressful. I loved my co-workers cause they were dealing with the same problems as me from JLG. The most enjoyable thing about the job was I was able to weld everyday.
good,Decent place to work if  +5 years experience. Not much room for advancement locally.
good,"I show up early. have some coffee, talk to a couple people about there day and get ready to start my day before shift begins. My coworkers for the most part, I enjoy being around and enjoy working with. I get along with almost anyone. I really don't have any hard time with my job of choice. I love being a welder/fabricator.  "
good,no typical day as schedule depended on up coming trade shows
good,Factory life is not for everyone also with having three different shifts although there are a lot of different shift to cater to the lifestyle you may need
good,"This is an average manufacturing job. Benefits are good not great."
good,If you have good work ethic you will work out fine at Oshkosh Corp. You have to be a take charge person and just get things done. Systems are less than desirable but get the job done. Had some great people working here with an interesting top secret book where there A players are kept.
good,I was a temp so I don't really have much I can say to review Oshkosh Corp. I enjoyed the people I worked with.  We always had a good time getting our work done each day.
good,would like 1shift. to hard to move in the company.The people are nice working there.
good,"Good paying job considering it's basic assembly work.  People you work with are decent.  Some managers listen to you and are great to work with, they often quit or get fired.  Other managers are a pain in the butt, they often get promoted."
good,"I loved OK until my team lead pulled the rug out from under after my software testing duties on the mutii-purpose striker vehicle (auger, or plow, or broom) had concluded after 3 months. "
good,"A typical day of work consists of an 8 hour shift. I worked night shift so I worked sunday night through Thursday night. I had off Friday night and Saturday night. The hardest part of the job was staying up all night and working, and it was hard to sleep through the day. The most enjoyable part was working with my co-workers. The management was very good and I learned how to work on an assembly line"
good,It was a good place to work it had its perks just sucks to work weekends and saturdays good placement great people good environment easy work free lunches
good,"The people I worked with in Orrville, and the main office in MCConnelsburg, PA were great to work with. We had a lot of fun, and it wasn't ""all work and no play"". Would like to come back in under my former boss."
good,This was a contracting job after the military. The pay was decent but worked 12 - 16 hours a day. It was hard work but paid well.
good,"I am currently employed in Shippensburg the work is not bad other than im filthy dirty from all of the grease this really isn't my cup of tea but it pays the bills, you have to start out now thru a temp agency which is extremely hard to deal with, so if you have children use the days you have to miss wisely or you will be looking for another job...like I said the work its self isn't horrible mostly its the temp agency.."
good,The pay is nice out of the gate if you have experience in such work. One down side is the amount of mandatory overtime. It has been nearly every Saturday for over a year. It's hard to balance family life.
good,"The company is not a bad company and the work is reasonable unless you are in the peak seasons. Work is not extremely labor intensive. However, the pay is very low and if you live anywhere outside of the small mountain communities or if you have a family, this is not a job that you can sustain."
good,great company to work with except management has no clue what they're doing good overtime hours great schedule. Typical day is a regular mechanic day except too much favoritism from management team.
good,My most enjoyable part of the job was assembling parts for machines. What I have learned is that the company has really terrible health benefits.
good,"Is working on the computer and learning to adjust to everyday changes with the receiving process. How to do tower audits and to train new employees."
good,Ohskosh Truck was an ausome job I didn't have to work swing shift it was straight 2nd or first. I loved the job because picking parts was a very physical job.
good,"really hard at first, but after all the paperwork, etc it was great. Excellent pay and benefits, room for advancement from within. great people to work with. could use improvement in the hiring/ training process"
good,"N/a, no comment, nothing to say, just gonna type words because need 150 to submit. So here we go. Just a few more words now almost there.....and done."
good,"Recover the store keep organized make sure customers are okay keep an eye on Register so customer aren’t waiting long "
good,"Great company with products that elicit national pride.  Be very careful which business units you decide to work, as some are modern, well funded with solid processes and technology.  Others are stuck in the 80s, underfunded, with horrible cultures."
good,"As a machine tool technician the task varied from day to day depending on which machine was in need or repair, or preventative maintenance. From working on robots,cnc, and various other equipment learned inner workings. Also received additional training in robotics,cnc, and crane repair, from the companies that produce the equipment used in the facility. The hardest part was getting the work done fast enough to keep production caught up. Most enjoyable was seeing unique issues of equipment and figuring out why they occured."
good,"The job that I did it really hard labor."
good,"If they would allow someone to be hired into the company in order to advance it would be better."
good,"Oshkosh/JLG has a ""bumping"" policy which is unfair and biased towards its employess. all in all a great company."
good,This place is not bad to work for. Except for the fact that wright now the future does not look good for job stability.
good,"Job security was an issue at Pierce, it seemed like we were laying off employees and taking pay away every other quarter!"
good,I'm on an assembly line so you do the same job every day... week after week...month after month. You wonder how long before it all ends with the war ending....450 to get laid off January 2013 that's not good... probably more in the near future as the war winds down.
good,Great environment and people to be creative around. I've learned so much about manufacturing and continuous improvement.
good,Oshkosh tries hard to promote work life balance.  Which is great.  However the 4 segments / divisions within the business have their own work process and own managers.   When IT needs to work with these teams for a single solution its an uphill battle on getting things done.   Hardest part of the job is at times its frustrating on how long a process takes to be implemented.   When they do an reorg.  Its like they dont see the big picture on what you and they should be working on.  Its a mess on getting these key things done.
good,This company is on a journey to becoming a people first organization. They have made numerous changes to ensure their purpose comes through in a way that creates meaning with their team members.
good,I enjoyed working at oshkosh truck.  the work was interesting to me and I would have stayed at the company but had to leave to handle situation at home.
good,Working with the people at truck was really good.  Immediate supervisor was good and treated employees with respect.  Advancement oportunities were regular.
good,Very quick pace. All PPE was provided. There are many perks to working there. You have a specific time frame to complete your task. I would weld there again.
good,"I mean if you like children you'll be good, otherwise it will slowly make you go insane and hate certain seasons, and make you not want to have kids of your own"
good,I enjoyed working at Oskosh Corporation because of the new and exciting products the make. I also enjoyed working for my manager and with my fellow employees.
good,Lo que mas me gusto es que te dan la oportunidad de desarrollarte libremente cumpliendo tus objetivos y crecer profesionalmente.
good,"Coworkers are friendly, dedicated and patient."
good,"Good Co-workers, and work environment. I learned Different tools to help me manage time on each job to get the most work done in a day. Management had some miscommunication issues, but over all good."
good,If you a family this is not the job for you. Always on the road or out of the country. Hard work and long hours working on trucks an military equipment.
good,"Standaard magazijnwerk, goede opvolging en fijne werkomgeving."
good,I was a temp employee and it sounded like the person before me had been there a very long time with no permanent employment in sight.  I took a different job because of this.  Other than that I enjoyed my time there and wish a permanent job had opened up.  I also enjoyed the work that I was doing.
good,Very interesting work and always a challenge.  Newer management has made it difficult to communicate or grow.  Daily work has turned into a daily struggle.
good,Large exposure to a lot of technical areas. Provides great exposure to many disciplines.Allowed balance of work and personal life.
good,"good place to work"
good,it was a good job to get my feet wet with a factory setting enviroment.
good,"Overall good company, management and work life were good. Overseas contract."
good,"On a typical day I would get a list of customers that needed appointments to fix their equipment. I would contact the customer for a good time to perform service. I would then drive to the customers location with parts and anything I might need to fix their equipment."
good,"A typical day at work includes readying yourself with tools, parts, and hardware to complete a particular phase in the assembly of  a variety of truck cabs within the allotted time frame."
good,a typical day at work I come in and install vehicle length of air lines in the front and some trucks both front and middle of the trucks.
good,"The record pace of production meant for nearly every day being busy...but a ""good"" busy."
good,"A telecommunications comany subcontracting for charter communications responsible for installation and service of TV, Internet, and phone services."
good,built military vehicles and was able to work multiple stations
good,"10-12hr days, 6 days a week- sometimes 7 days a week.  Got to work with people of various cultures.  Work enviornment was stress-free.  QA supervisor was always very supportive, level-headed, friendly, and approachable.  Learned about different vehicle systems."
good,Repairing military trucks in reprocessing dept fixing hydraulic and air leaks installing part shortages and fixing defects found by product delivery inspectors.Constantly learning how to fix or repair defects with the trucks always something new.Management is good.Work with a bunch of great guys.not getting frustrated when same defect continues to happen.Working together as a team to produce a good product and have fun doing it
good,Always took care of employees. One of the best OCONUS jobs I have had.
good,Good experience seeing the occupational nursing side of things. Wish I could have gotten more hands on experience.
good,I was able to experience the occupational nursing at Oshkosh Corp! It was a great experience just wish I was able to get more hands on experience.
good,"De acuerdo a mis 4 años de experiencia trabajando para Oshkosh puedo observar que es una empresa que busca la excelencia, y la etica en el ambiente de trabajo, se preocupa por la seguridad y la calidad de sus productos pero principalmente busca un hambiente laboral sano."
good,"Working as a manager at Oshkosh Corp you will be working with all areas within the company. A day in the life as entry level management is both exciting and very fulfilling. There are definite times of pressure and stress, as well as frustrations, You are challenged daily for new process improvements. Reports on overhead, manufacturing rates that need to be meet. The culture within the corporation is one of people first. They realize their biggest asset is the people they have working there."
good,Greatly enjoyed and appreciated the culture at this company during my time spent here.  Lacking timely opportunities for advancement.  Extremely team oriented environment.
good,"typical hours for my position 7 AM - 5 or 6 PM Monday through Friday. No work required on weekends unless a critical project needs extra attention."
good,Fun place to work because of the customers and their children. Next to no room for advancement and they never give reviews but expect a lot of training. Hard to give the commitment to the company the way they would like with little hours and no advancement.
good,Una empresa donde las promociones no son de acuerdo al conocimiento y mal manejo del personal administrativo
good,"good place to work, i worked at the jlg in orrville. i loved my job but pay sucked, started getting slow and laying off and moving people from shift to shift."
good,I have been able to really work my up through the company at our location.  My supervisor has been great at leading by example and showing me new ways to do different projects.
good,"Allows you to understand what parents are looking for. "
good,"Good place to work, overtime usually available. Good people to work with. Room for advancement in the job. HR has good communication with the employees as well"
good,It was a good place to work you got worked a lot a lot of hours good people tho got paid vacation after a year and some personal time. Fun work very interesting I learned a lot working there.
good,Worked as a welder for 4yrs and it was good until I moved to a better position in the company and was given roles above my pay grade to which I brought up to my superiors and then let go.
good,I learned to work with a diverse group of people. I met some of the best people who I can call friends and other types of people. I learned to use many different types of equipment. I enjoyed the hard work most days.
good,"It is a great place to work. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help you learn anything that you do not know. Work conditions are great, everything is kept very clean and organized. Management is always willing to listen to anything that you have to say. They are always looking for great ideas."
good,"I lead and manage a group of offshore FEA engineers by providing service in product verification and validation.  Communication is critical to ensure the information is not lost so the fidelity of end results is useful."
good,"Every day started out with a stand up meeting, this gave us direction and expectations for the days work.( good management)"
good,"Typical day presents many challenges to overcome, many are overcome as a team and the rest are overcome individually. Learned a lot about our U.S. government, The Army, and The Marine Corps. Management changed a lot as I was there. Currently I am on my 23rd boss in less than 4 years of employment. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that the product I am building will save soldiers lives!"
good,A typical day would consist of working a variety of projects and tasks. Coordinating new product design with production.
good,I came in at a bad time as they were just undergoing a corporate restructuring and it was quite chaotic the entire time that I was there. I was also working through a staff agency so days off were different around the holidays.
good,"Employees care about company and products.  Strong branding of products in the industry cultivating a strong employee moral around the delivery of solutions that cover military, emergency and municipal products."
good,"Worked with both defense and commercial vehicles.  Defense side of the business has a very tall hierarchy and decision making can be very slow at times causing project timelines to be very short with very high effort.  Worked many late hours to ensure timelines were met (16+ hours a day).  Seemed to be an awful lot of chief engineers, directors, and low level VPs that did not like to communicate ""truthfully,"" with upper level management on project status which at times created a unreasonably hectic work environment.  But the products were amazing and you could never forget who you were making them for."
good,Good place to work. They are very clean and all about safety. If it wasn't for them closing the Orrville site I'd try to be hired into the company since I'm currently a contractor.
good,Great place to work with some excellent changes in the pipeline.  Oshkosh has a multi-headed behemoth of a dragon on their hands with their legacy systems but are taking the necessary steps to slay this dragon.
good,"work was enjoyable coworkers fun to work with,sometimes finding parts was the hardest part of the job.i learned how to read blueprints."

good,"I enjoyed the time I spent at JLG. It gave me an small insight to what I could do as a career. Most days, I spent do the same thing, but I enjoyed that. I like learning why things are made the way the are and updating their work instructions allowed me to do just that. The people I worked with were great and very welcoming to ideas to make the workplace more efficient."
good,I loved the company. loved the quality of the products. the benefits were great. the staff was great. the sales they provided each week was great. I had a great manager guiding me and teaching me how to become a better leader myself.
good,"as a materials coordinator I was in charge of many work assignments, taking materials to production areas and warehouse storage. shipping overstock items to warehousing. and making shure  other plants materials needs were expidited"
good,"JLG isn't a bad place to work at, it's just the corporate environment that is detrimental to the workforce with inept management (the company focuses more on post college degree instead of experience), high focus on productivity at all costs, lack of connection and understanding with the hourly workforce."
good,Good place to work for the money. Management are very young and don't have the experience to make the best decisions.
good,"This is a good place to work, with a management team that is dedicated to the company."
good,Shift starts at 6 am and ends at 4 pm. I focus on continuous improvement.
good,"Great place to work, if you have the right manager. They do expect you to put in well over 40 hours per week."
good,I really enjoyed working there. If I didn’t have family issues I would still be there. They told me to come back when I could. I felt needed and appreciated.
good,"Because of the broad vehicle product line, there are opportunities to work on different things: fire engines, refuse trucks, cement trucks, tow trucks, military trucks, scissor and boom lifts, telehandlers, mobile broadcast media centers, and more, all with the reputation of being top notch.  That means that the engineering is top notch. This is the challenge of the work."
good,There are great benefits with a flexible work schedules! Senior / middle management could use some work as the company is currently switching to a 'people first' culture but it's truly hard to see this change on mindset within the middle management team.
good,A typical day at work is working the register and putting stock out. I learn where new stuff is all the time. My manager is a great person I can always go to.
good,"Great place to work. Large pay increases. Option for over time. Clean, well known around the whole. Been in business more than fifty years puts money into keeping everything great looking."
good,Not all areas are treated the same.  Some areas experience gender bias (i.e. in the truck building business only males understand about building trucks; male dominated).
good,"Oshkosh Corporation is moving to a people first culture.  They are working towards flexible work hours, dress for your day attire, and understanding that employees have lives and families outside of work."
good,"Fast paced, if you dont mind hard work with no personal life, this is the place to go.many days with many hours.Safety concious company wwith many employee perks. birhtday meal with gripe session included."

good,"Great place to work at.  Good pay but hours were long sometimes.  Some jobs require longer times than the allotted time, but was eventually fixed.  Workers were great to each other, which was nice."
good,God people to work with. Team leads are not always the best but some are good. Work was not monotonous and you had the ability to move around to different areas.
good,Management was able to get a ping pong table which was great for all employees' health. Ping pong tournaments were set up. Moral was boosted around the office.
good,Wonderful place to work. The money is ok could be better. The atmosphere at work was awesome. Worked with great people and friends. Most of the supervisors were easy going also.
good,"Great company to work for, has a real ""family"" like atmosphere. The pay is great, the benefits are average. I would say that overall this is a really good company to work for."
good,"Work on assembly lines,in different parts of town.Got well compensated for the work you did. Some areas the work was easy, and of course some areas you had to bust your but."
good,A great environment especially after i had my son.My day would start by ringing up customers and getting their email for promotions and other discount which is not offered in stores.I would check fitting room and remove all items that were left.
good,"Work in oshkosh is interesting and requires a lot of "
good,"A typical day at work is normally 10 hours long. It is challenging physically and mentally, but their is the satisfaction of building a quality product. I do get a sense of pride from building rails that I have cut, punched, welded and buffed. "
good,"I really like working here, just need to pay more for the work I do. Work a lot of hours always overtime, they feed you good, clean place everywhere."
good,"Safety training, mechanical training, tuition reimbursement, good benefits, very structured."
good,Production line assembly work. Many different job duties.
good,Great place to work if you like Call Center atmosphere. Very fast-paced and the day goes fast. Managment is friendly and helpful. The people there are super nice.
good,Positive and inclusive culture on a global scale.  Executive leadership is  accessible and interested in hearing from associates.  The new headquarters are amazing.
good,I loved working at the JLG warehouse unfortunately they announced they were closing our facility so I had to find another job. I really enjoyed working for this company.
good,"The day can be hectic if behind on work schedule. Every day is busy, you have to read the options to know what equipment is installed on the cab. Then you check the cart to take an inventory to make sure you have all necessary parts, and then install."
good,"Me encantaba el ambiente de trabajo que se vivía. Me encantaba mi trabajo de soldador, simplemente es el mejor trabajo que jamás haya yo tenido en mi vida. "
good,"There are a lot of good things happening at Oshkosh Corporation and there are many opportunities. It's a large company and depending what area you work in, your experience could be completely different from someone in another area. This is unfortunate and has to do with old school managers who don't quite get the culture Oshkosh is developing. However, for the most part, you will find the company is truly people first in their culture."
good,A typical day consisted of too many meetings. I learned that the overall business planning was not as strong as it used to be. Management became less open. The work culture was all ways make the best product. The most enjoyable part of work was the co-workers.
good,Love my team and the environment and the product but very underpaid for the responsibility and expectations. Don't seem to favour promoting internally over hiring somebody new
good,"It's a stable company with a People First culture and flexible working hours.  Employees at Oshkosh are proud and overall loyal. However, there's this feeling of constantly working in a reactionary environment. Improvements tend to be made slowly which is probably one of the most difficult things to deal with."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. Work environment is rather constant, and the people I worked with all got along and there was a team spirit and comradery there. A few small irritating things, like how they do the holidays and vacation days, and sometimes there are miscommunications between shifts, but not huge issues."
good,I loved the guys and girls I worked with. I just felt a change was needed. I didn't see any potential for advancement. I would go back in a heart beat. I went off to reinvent myself but now realize I had a pretty good thing there.
good,i have learned how to work with a  diverse group of people and management was always very approachable i enjoyed working on new thing every day
good,Typical work day is assembling booms and other parts of the JLG lifts. I learned how to build a JLG lift and how they operate. The management is good. The co workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was the lack of work they had and the lay off periods.
good,As an intern I was treated with respect and given real responsibilities. The environment was welcoming and encouraged team building.
good,"They treat employees great, and have competitive pay and benefits.  I've worked here for 7 years and can't complain.  It's very busy, but the people are very nice."
good,"I was very happy to be working at Oshkosh Truck. During my time in the military I drove the same vehicles the Truck produces. They where powerful, safe and reliable. Unfortunately I have become disabled and unable to continue to do my job there unless they can find me an easier job that meets my medical restrictions."
good,"I have learned to drive many different vehicles in my prior jobs, I have a CDL-BCD and will be happy to get my class A if needed when hired. I get along with everyone and am a very hard worker. I think the most enjoyable part of my jobs were the opportunity to learn new things"
good,none stop working makes days go by fast. fast past great co-workers.
good,"Good company with a diverse product line."
good,"I have done more difficult work for less money.  Too much drama from local union leadership, and too many unkept promises from management make it a trying place to work safely.  However the pay was outstanding.  Promise of new work never happened,"
good,Overall a good place to work. Small company owned by a large one. This is a union shop.
good,Throughout my time at Oshkosh corp I was challenged with different projects that were used to expand my knowledge and grasp key ideas. The work environment is very friendly.

good,Jobs at this place vary and it is a heavy duty manufacturing setting. Work environment was pretty relaxed and there is a diverse work force at this company.
good,Working at Pierce Manufacturing helped to develop my interest and build my knowledge of fire engines. This knowledge will be helpful as I aspire to become a volunteer or part-time fire fighter.
good,Oshkosh Corporation is a rapidly growing company that has numerous projects on their hand. They will always accommodate your skills to fit a job for you.

good,Fun job. Easy going management. Good discounts. When working overnight management buys lunch / snacks.
good,"Seeing the development of the process and product as you aid in both. Both fun, and challenging."
good,"High turnover rate with leadership and team members at certain divisions.  Continuity was lacking because of high turnover rate and it significantly impacted production, moral and camaraderie.  Corporate offered great leadership, but divisional leadership was retractive."
good,This was one of the best jobs I've had. Working in distribution was a very relaxed job. We got everything done and worked quickly but it was very rarely stressful. The way they handled the company wide layoff and the factory shut down was not the best.
good,"It is a very people first environment. There is a pretty good amount of transparency up to the highest level. From what I saw, they were great at allowing a work and life balance."
good,Es una empresa que comienza en México la cual tiene muy buen hambiente de trabajo y te brinda apoyo para el crecimiento laboral y personal preocupándose siempre por la salud y el bienestar de los trabajadores.

good,"Oshkosh is one of the best companies I've worked for. They are loyal to their employees and they offer good benefits to employees that are able to showcase their ability. They also offer lots of opportunities to advance within the company if you are willing to prove yourself. They are growing as a company, and they are constantly changing in an industry where there is a lot of demand to meet the needs of government and private entrprise."
good,"Very rewarding internship with very loyal and caring employees and management. "
good,"The environment at Pierce is a very energetic, focused, dedicated, and fun place to be. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and enjoyed the management as well."

good,Company with consistant growth and unlimited potential. I have learned a lot about culture change and building processes into areas where they do not exist. Oshkosh has top tere leadership and really gives you the feeling of family.
good,"A typical day depends heavily on what your job requires. It can be difficult and easy. As long as time is used wisely, the job becomes easier and quicker despite its difficulties."
good,"Working for Oshkosh Corporation was a great experience. The day to day experience was unpredictable and fun. I looked forward to arriving at work to see what the day had in store. Working in the IT field, you never know what you're going to have going on. The mystery and sense of duty was very fulfilling. Each person took a turn doing rotational duties for the week. This helped to get everyone up to speed with the current processes and procedures at the Service Desk. The leadership at the Service Desk were very flexible and willing to work with you on many different levels."
good,my work day was starting out being breifed on what needed to be done and tring hard to do this and much more if possible we start by doing every thing to build truck from frame up to a tow truck and for me it is never a challenge to do that i also had to solve problems that arised in the day that others could not plus all phone calls with trouble i took care of in most parts and when i was a secuirty gaurd i did my rounds to make everything safe for all and check for fires and make sure no fires and everything was locked up

good,I feel it's a good place to work if you have a good Bose. It's a large company. There are good and bad boses. I've  been working there for 14 yrs. and feel they do a good job for veterans. They do a lot for there comunitiy.
good,Clocking in at 630a.m. We then make our ways to our designated area where we hold daily safety meetings before starting our day which help us refresh our memories for potential hazards as well as inform us of recent incidents within the company. After which we get to work. I along with my partner assemble and install topdoors for waiste trucks using overhead 2 ton cranes as the parts aren’t lightweight once assembled. Once i had the routine down there wasnt much to worry about as far as difficultys with the job more of just always being sure i am safe and my partner/surrounding areas are safe. The most enjoyable part of the job is our access to scissor and vertical lifts which enable us to instal tailgates to the truck and allow mobile access to the top of the trucks for installing top doors which comes with an awesome view of the facility i work in.
good,I enjoyed coming into the office every morning knowing my work was valuable and I had the support of my colleagues when needed.
good,"Easy to work under, pacing was perfect, the amount done each day was always above standard which is a bonus in my eyes. The early shifts were lacking a bit based on people having just woke up. The easiest part of the job was handling things on my own honestly. But it was fun. Never a dull moment."
good,Solid company to work for. Focus on helping you develop your career. I left because my internship ended. It has been a while since I worked here.
good,"I loved working a JLG I had a awesome group of friends, a awesome trainer and everything. id deff work there again it was awesome"
good,The different segments of the corporation offers individuals opportunities for growth and advancement if desired. The challenges are numerous and provide professional experiences in multiple manufacturing areas.
good,"A typical day at work was enjoyable because I like working with my hands ,and being challenged with different problems.I learned that if you are a strong team member and your team is strong there is nothing that cant be overcome.I believe management was good at making the shop safe and productive as possible When I was there the shop had almost three years without a accident.My coworkers were and still are strong team,with a large amount of knowledge.The hardest part was not job,it was dealing with the heat of summer and the cold of the winter.I think the most enjoyable part was knowing that our warriors would come home safe because we built the safest vehicles possible."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I was disappointed when the union had to renegotiate and all temp to hire employees were let go.
good,Updating MSDS online
good,"Majority of leadership is very helpful and willing to listen. Find it difficult to find career advancement on the non-production side without a masters degree."
good,"If you want to advance and are willing to put in your blood, sweat, and tears, you will be rewarded.  Do not; however, expect to get your cake and eat it too - you will likely not have a good work-life balance."
good,"probably the best placed i have ever worked.  Shop was clean, tools organized everything you could ask for in a job.. Never had a problem with management.. id go back in a heart beat.. it was unfortante for the layoff"
good,"Great place to work. I learn to manage a civilian warehouse, had co0workers that make the job fun to be at work, there was not really any hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part is that we all got along very well we work as a team."
good,"A typical day at work, come in get your schedule during the five minute stand up, report back to your designated station and start working. Learned a lot on how to work with others as a team. Co-workers were great. Hardest part of the job was the climate factor. Mostly the heat though. Just stay hydrated. Most enjoyable part of the job was the atmoshphere of whole plant. Great job, great people, great work environment."
good,"Enjoyed working with the staff at LMI I found them helpful, high energy and work oriented an excellent group of people. Further established my capabilities as being a team player as LMI is a team based facility. I was able to learn new skills which I can utilize in any facility that I will be hired in in the future. The hardest part of the job was building the database of drawings which were to be used on the plasma table I found to be tedious but interesting as again I was able to acquire a new skill to carry forward into my future career opportunity."
good,"Great company as far as benifits etc., but going through changes now"
good,"I really enjoyed working the projects, the level of collaboration and team work made me feel there was nothing we couldn't accomplish.  I hope to return there very soon."

good,"Oshkosh and their sister segments deserve the high praises they receive from customers."
good,"They are very loyal to the employees. The money is okay. Very good work history building job. It is like an extended family.If I didn't travel 170 miles a day to get to this job, it would be a more profitable place to work for me."
good,"Everyone here is happy for the most part, and willing to help if you fall a little behind. The benefits here are outstanding, once hired on, they will pay your entire tuition, though good grades are required, naturally. My experience at JLG was a very positive one, and would love to go back."
good,"Like any other job, it is what you make of it. I worked here only 18 months and was able to advance in my roll on more than once. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers as they were very respectful and willing to teach me new tasks so that I could be more efficient in my work. The only thing that I was unhappy with here was the layoff. I felt that this was the company I would have retired with many years down the road. I would love the opportunity to get rehired permanently."
good,worked on my feet all day using air harness and various tools to assemble military vehcicles.  I learned to complete work in a timely manner to keep up with the line.  The management was fine.  I miss my coworkers very much.  The hardest part of the job was when R & D always wanted to change things around in my work station.  the most enjoyable part was the pride in knowing that the vehicles were building were used to save the lives of our military men and women.
good,Created reports for upper management each month along with other various tasks.
good,great company to work for because there is always room to advance to higher position
good,The best part of the job is learning culture. The readiness of older employees to teach and train others. Management is fine and dedicated except for a few rotten eggs which is found in any successful organization
good,Oshkosh is a great division to work in. Allowed me the opportunity to expand my service to the country as we supplied our armed services. Highly recommended employer.

good,"Oshkosh does a great job of balancing work with time off.  As a leader they also offer me a great deal of autonomy on the job. Oshkosh's only area for improvement is in base salary.  They do, however, have a very good bonus structure base on company performance."

The toughest part of the job at times was getting a clear answer or getting my parts at times.But the environment was friendly and everyone was willing to help."

good,"i thought that this would be it, the company that took me to retirement. Great job awesome company . The hardest thing was second shift and being a single parent. Overall, even with the potentional layoff id reconmend this company to anybody."
good,you know what is expected and you show up everyday to focus and meet those goals. All the tools needed for you accomplish that goal is provided. Time flexibility is the typical corporate policy. Large umbrella company so your value is by your badge number not your skill set.
good,"I worked with great people, who where limited in their ability to make good decisions by corporate overseers.  the local HR at McNeilus was a complete joke.  They were puppets of corporate and could/would not make any decision on their own."
good,Oshkosh takes great care and pride in their internship program.  They give their interns responsibilities normal to their full-time employees and are always willing to provide any assistance needed while working.
good,Great place to work. The management was nice and helpful when you needed them. there were times during the year where the foreman would buy us lunch due to our excellent work. There was room for advancement with the company. Almost like it was a second family to me.
good,Loved working here mostly because of the people I work with.  Pay was a bonus. Felt proud building trucks to protect our brothers at arm overseas.
good,Good company with on job training. No long term employment opportunity. Eight hour shifts with overtime opportunity. A safe place to work. Hardest part of the job was changes in product and quality control. Most enjoyable part of the job would be the flexibility of job class.

good,Good place to work and Christian environment. This company cares about its employees by going above and beyond in the assistance of workers.
good,I would work for JLG again. I had personnal reasons for leaving. It had nothing to do with the company or management. It's a lovely place to be employed.
good,A very relaxed place to work. Nothing too stressful to deal with. Manager is a very nice guy and other employees were friendly as well. Overall a good place.
good,Excellent company and culture.  Great management team and support is given all of the employees in this corporation.  Relaxed and friendly atmosphere that really is an enjoyable place to work in on a daily basis.
good,This company is a great place to learn and grow. They focus on education and training. The welding portion of the manufacturing can be brutal but the trade off is there.
good,"It was a very repetitive position (accounts payable) You keyed invoices all day long, answered messages from vendors and also worked on vendor statements."
good,"People are easy to get along with. The work is really easy. When you have ladders to paint, it makes the night go by fast. You learn something new everyday and you always stay busy."
good,"The company has changed for the better in the last decade or so.  They strive to be the best, and are working towards OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program."

good,"buena experiencia adquirida en el area de pintura enmascarado, preparacion de superficies, y pintado electrostatico."
good,"I was a lone person in this office. First thing in the morning I would check the Bank, and see what was deposited from the previous day. Then apply to my excel copy of the AR so it is updated. Make my calls to customers, from 1 day overdue, and enter my notes in JDE. Do follow-ups on any issues that exist so they get resolved as soon as possible. Connect with the Parts dept to see if the reruns will be authorized for credit. At intervals I would create new customer files, and update them with D&B reports where needed, and any information I can find on the customer in the web. "
good,"enjoyed working with management and co-workers."
good,Oshkosh Corp is 100% dedicated to their customers.  Not speaking for all divisions but the Airport Group that I worked in was one of the best small team of managers I have worked with in my career.  Working with people you consider your friends makes the daily rigors much easier to handle.
good,At this job I learned to follow instructions on how to read blue prints and wiring diagrams. I found the people to be very team good team member. The job allowed over time which I liked very much.
good,A typical work day is endless. I was always the go to guy that gets things done. and always communicated well. Which lead to a heavier workload. I learned how to handle various personalities and opportunities. Management means well and have solid skills in direct company aspects. But still do not have the full understanding of what it means to have true leadership. Very family oriented. The hardest part was the lack of support or push for accountability by upper management. The best part of the job was every time the team came together as one to conquer a common goal.
good,"This company offers excellent benefits and pay with chances of advancement given. I also noticed that people who have difficulty with the job in their department are offered another position in another department that was more suited to their needs."
good,My time spent with JLG was enjoyable.  This was only a temporary assignment lasting 90 days.  In that time I became proficient in working 3 different areas of the SkyTrac Industrial Lift manufacturing assembly line.
good,The job was fun to work at. The pay was great. The management was kid and friendly. A safe environment to work in. Would work there again.
good,"Antes de abrir se hace un aseo general de la tienda, y acomodo de las prendas por modelo y talla, se atendía a los clientes conforme fueran llegando y si no las vendedoras van atendiendo por dos."
good,"JLG is a great place to work. The people are VERY friendly, and are willing to help you. A typical day at work on the electric mini scissor lifts is you go in through the side doors, clock in, go to your assigned line, then you want to try to get there early so you can prep your work station, then you have a company or line meeting. Then, you go back to your station and get to work. You get three breaks throughout the day,and you can talk to people in your station.
