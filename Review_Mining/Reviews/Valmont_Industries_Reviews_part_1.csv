bad,Bosses don't value employees and hr in Farmington Minnesota controls everything when they have no clue what's going on at each plant. And supervisors talk about drinking and doing drugs when the bosses are on vacation.
bad,Hrs change all the time. They work you to the bone and expect you to smile and work the weekends. While the boss and office staff takes it off and they deny you time off. What a joke of a place would not recommend this place to any one ☝️
bad,If you work hard you get treated bad. If you looking for a place to hangout Valmont in Jeffersonville is for you. Worst management EVER! Don’t work there! You will do everybody job while the lazy ppl get a free ride and a raise. Valmont in Jeffersonville Indiana is the worst place your teeth will black but it’s ok. OSHA said it’s alright to breathe😂
bad,"Valmont closed its doors because the management was horrible and totally incompetent. Things happen for a reason and they got what they deserve. I was treated like I was a inmate in a prison, violence was encouraged by management. We were told to go out back and resolve our issues like men. Not a good work environment."
bad,Pass this company up immediately.... They always complain they don’t have money or are losing money.  But end up buying new office material instead of heating units for the cold winter and fans for hot summers & constantly having you work unnecessary overtime !   They generally don’t care about employees lots of favoritism no fair way to advance your career.  Oh and make a mistake one time you will be on a final notice then fired !  Please looking for a good industry job go to the oil field or something .
bad,"If you are looking for a welding job in the Chattanooga area, there are plenty of places in the area to find a great job. I highly recommend staying away from Valmont. I didn't realize exactly how horrible the job was at the Jasper location until I found my new job. Valmont (Jasper) is poorly managed, has a horrible HR department, and hires supervisors who have no clue about the job. The pay is decent, but there are better paying welding jobs out there. Trust me, I found one. You can kiss your family time goodbye, as Valmont will run your life once you are hired in. I was told by numerous employees that there was no future at Valmont, get out as soon as you can because it's not a good place to work. I wish I would've gotten out sooner, because now I have an easier job, making a lot more money, with numerous weeks off for holidays, and exceptional benefits and rewards."
bad,"This is the most crooked and one sided place I have ever worked there is osha violations around every corner like the roof leaking and extensions cords and wires running through the puddles. The management is terrible they will mess with your pay every chance they possibly get. And will not listen to anything ideas you have to make production better because ""we are just factory workers""."
bad,No it was not a fun place to work and they ate racist against white people I had to be on stress and anxiety and depression meds just to stand working there it was the worst job I ever had I have never had a job were I felt bad for being white
bad,the company is run like a sweat shop. no care for family responsibilities. just about production deadlines. safety and health concerns are not a factor either.
bad,Was lied to and misled from day one. Was told i was just a welder and didn't have the intelligence to be asking questions. Management acts like the money for employees and improvements comes out of their wallet.
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance - company expects you to work when they want you to work. Zero balance."
bad,"That place is the single worst place I have ever worked at."
bad,"A typical day at work: "
bad,Its full of liars and greed filled managment. They lie to your face about anything and everything. Managment does not have a clue about anything and they mandatory Saturday's but don't allow you to use vacation on any Saturday they could care less about you. Just about everybody in the shop has had enough.
bad,"low pay when compared to other dealers in the tri-cities area. Long hours, poor management, very insuffiecient use of personell and time. Micro managed from the top. "
bad,"As QA and NDT Level II with an AAS NDT degree, I thought I could make a career out of Valmont.  A couple months in, I knew I had taken the wrong job.  There is no 'quality' here.  NDT is a joke here and not compliant.  If you are in NDT, you know what I mean..the things that go on here are not to code and we all know what that means in the real world.  If something is rejected, production (or anyone really) can  just rip the tag off and send it out.  I have rejected products, outlined repairs and then found the product out in the lot with no repairs and the reject tag GONE.  Write another tag, it goes back in...within the day it will be out in the lot again, not repaired and reject tag GONE.  They also let non NDT people perform some of the NDT against all standards.  This cheapens what I worked so hard for (my NDT education and certifications).  Why work hard in NDT if they are going to let any Jack of the street do things they can't do and know nothing about??  It's like letting a secretary stand in for a doctor...NOT SMART."
bad,"I read these reviews and it's obvious which ones are fakes put up by Valmont themselves.  Every day I worked here was pure h>ll.  It's nothing but one big clique and the production floors & equipment are dangerous (Seriously), filthy, no one cares and people at all levels just do what they have to just to bring home a check."
bad,"I worked in the Quality department at the Brenham facility. As I have read in other posts, the recruiter will paint a wonderful picture of what the facility is like....and that is the first lie you will hear, but not the last. This place will promise everything they can to get you in the door, but it runs off of a buddy-buddy system that is corrupt and incompetent. I have actually stood on the production floor and rejected product and had the facility manager tell me to pass it out the door and sign off. Everything is production bound and this facility couldn't produce a quality product if they tried. Their quality department is hamstrung at best, with lazy leadership that is constantly bullied by production. They cannot keep good help and if they get good help, it doesn't usually last long. Most employees that stay only do so because they are close to home. The management is two-faced and laughable. The floor leads are custom fit to their chairs and just as incompetent. The safety program is an absolute joke. Training to build product is normally done by trainers with less than two months experience building the same product. Unfortunately this place is all about bottom line, which is unfortunate because there are a few good people left there. As a company though, Valmont is nothing I would sign up for."
bad,"Management Bonus, that is all they care about. Terrible Company. Lack of adequate training, building and equipment falling apart. OSHA really needs to be more involved."
bad,Stay away from Valmont Barrie location. They are going through a complete rebuild and are essentially a new company with no processes or management. Employees are left to fend for themselves with no direction. High turn over currently no senior staff left. Management does not take the warnings from employees seriously and are brushed off. Stay away.
bad,"plant manager at that time,good guy, most workers good people,"
bad,There were days when the fog from the acid tanks would just be everywhere you worked. You couldn’t breathe without your lungs hurting and coughing. Management there didn’t care and even said it was harmless. Which is ridiculous. Pay was okay but not for all the dangerous stuff that goes on there. It seems OSHA hasn’t gone out there ever. One of the worst places I’ve worked at. And they would make you work overtime. You didn’t have a choice unless you wanted to be fired.
bad,"Every Employee in Carsonite has been there 10+ years , they harassed me from day one. I reported  nothing was ever done . The only change that happened is I Started getting watched, by HR, Nasty looks from upper head and everything continued until I decided to leave. I've never experienced that level of unprofessionalism in my life. Line techs gossip, supervisor  gossips, HR gossips...there is not a solution to any problem there had you not been there as long as them. I dont reccomend this place at all!."
bad,I worked very closely with many of the managers of all departments. This place is extremely cutthroat and the managers will throw you under the bus as much as they can if it means keeping themselves out of trouble. Their attitudes towards applicants and their employees is disgraceful. These managers are so two-faced it's pathetic. I was actually planning on quitting this place before I was let go so they saved me the trouble and I was only there for about a month if that tells you anything! I have nothing good to say about this facility.
bad,"LOTS of Overtime.  Poor Managements.  Work environment resembles High school clicks  if you dont fit in well then, too bad.  You will be dogged.  No notice on working OT.  They do not care about family time even though the talk about it."
bad,"The place in Folsom, NJ has felons who currently who there, your in the elements(cold weather without proper heating), work near the kettle and breathing those chemicals,, no proper shelter!"
bad,"Do not apply here. Unsafe. Unclean. Cut throat."
bad,I was fired after 20 years with no severance pay or even a thank you for my service. The new management at Valmont is all about the numbers. They talk about caring about the people and wanting to keep the experience in the company but when it come down to it they will fire you for petty reasons. HR pointed out to me a number of times that Nebraska is  fire at will state and that is what they did to me.
bad,"Having had several years of regular painting and sign painting experience I did not have a clue as to how difficult factory / industrial (assembly line) painting would be. In the hiring process no one seemed to understand how to communicate the difference between regular ( residential - commercial) and (interior - exterior) painting. They simply wanted to hire people to fill a position without regard to the person's experience. The pay was lower than what was offered by equivalent manufacturing businesses. Once hired, the foreman who was in charge over me did a poor job of explaining how to carry out key tasks that would determine a successful outcome of the job and ultimately me as a painter and employee."
bad,"This company is one of the worst I have worked for, all they want is more more more and they don't care how they get it. You are told you have to work every weekend but they are trying to hire more people to help cut hours but when the hire more people they increase your hours forcing you to work the entire weekend. The management are never here on weekends while their out golfing and spending time with family you are here working making money for the company so they can get their dividends. No stock options available, management only hires people who they know personally. No opportunity to move up"
bad,Comppany has been ran into the ground for years. Finally got new management but to far gone. Typically work 60 to 70 hours a week. No family time. When you get ahead management adds more work. Bathrooms ate so nasty employees rather use bathroom in the woods
bad,"This place will be presented to you as one big happy family.  Nothing is further from the truth.  Human resources is clannish and dishonest (they play favorites and bury the truth in matters), management is poorly executed and workers on all levels are simply used and laid off at the slightest marketing whim.  Instead of taking care of workers, they put them on “corporate welfare” (unemployment) & then when they want them back, they snap their fingers & expect all to jump and be loyal all over again.  They offer trinkets and shallow things to employees and then say they have a good culture – it’s all bull.  The FORCE you to contribute to their charities and if you don’t you will be blacklisted (to them charities are just a contest to get their COMPANY noticed – just a game & look at us type of thing).  Your ideas & experience is not valued here and if you have occasion to talk to senior mgt, you will get “stepford wife-like” conversation that is tasteless, meaningless, and bland.  This place is all that is wrong with employers - disloyal to employees and users of people.  Sort of like a little communist spot on the west end of Omaha."
bad,"If you like to be micro managed to the ""N"" degree, this is the place for you.  The Human Resource representative is the least professional representative I have ever been associated, including the way she dresses and customers come through the office at times.  Good luck to anyone who accepts this position."
bad,"This place has a lot of management. Problems, the one in Jasper Tennessee. They feed u good to get u in door, then starve u to death afterwards!!!"
bad,"The HR guy paints a pretty picture, but I realized what a mistake I made while still in ""training."" They absolutely do not care about their production employees. They cut overtime constantly, but if you are in the clique you'll get all you want. Lied about what I would be making. In less than a three month period they hired 200 people and only about 20 stayed. Layoffs every couple of months. If you're management then this is a good place to work for, because you don't have to do your job, you can put it off on someone else. The only people happy to be here are them and the leads. The leads don't know anything about fitting and only one of them can really weld. But they don't do anything but sit in the lead office and play on their phones. They don't even want to fire you they will treat you horribly and make you do odd jobs around the plant so that you can't claim production hours. They make people quit so they don't have to worry about paying unemployment. In over a year we haven't gone more than a month without an accident except 66 days one time, so the insurance is higher than it should be. Stupid schedules, my family life has gone down the drain since working here."
bad,It takes years to advance unless you are in with the Upper Mgmt .  No minorities in Management roles.  Positions are decided on before they are even posted.
bad,Not a pleasant place to work.  Management does not care about employees.  Poor scheduling in plant leads to sudden overtime demands.  Too much playing the blame game and not enough solutions to the problems.  Management plays favorites and very little room for any advancement.
bad,The day-to-day business is okay but this is not a place for any kind of advancement.
bad,"On the production side you have job security in structures division, but that is all. Management is terrible like most companies. Most lead men can not lead to save their lives. A buddy system is in full effect and it creates problems. No opportunity even in a fortune 1000 company. The healthcare is good and premiums are low. 401K has 4.5% match, but it takes five years to become fully vested...terrible. Not a career oriented company. No training. Very unsafe place to work. You will be stuck at your job on weekends...almost all of them."
bad,"Injuries almost every week and safety gets pushed aside over production.  Even plant manager put employees in danger just to keep production going.  Poor structure and poor safety mindset.  Under staffed at all times for years and a high turn over rate because management puts production goals on the shoulders of employees by requiring them to work until finished.  Most employees work 15hrs daily and plant requires 6 day work weeks for up to 6 weeks straight at times.  "
bad,"Trained with multiple people, all with variations of how they do things, often contradicting others.  Then management would come along to tell you you're doing it all wrong.  Management was abrasive and aggressive with one even throwing a tool to express their frustration with method used (due to contradictory training)."
bad,I enjoyed working here for the most part. The company has a lot of file members and friends of family members working thete. Lots if backstabbing and underhanded things going on.
bad,"Low pay when compared to other dealers in the tri-cities area. Long hours, poor management, ineffiecient use of personell and time. Micro managed from the top. Some really good employees, but moral is very low. A certain group of people get better pay and advancement opportunities, regardless of knowledge and experience. Very ""clicky"". Has out grown current manager."
bad,If Valmont wants to attract and retain talent some serious changes need to be made. It is a very successful Company in terms of stock price; despite poor leadership. There are too many managers and VPs and not enough people who actually do the work. The culture is very traditional and old fashioned. They claim to welcome new ideas but will quickly say you are negative or not a good fit if you suggest changes or improvements. They have attempted to move to a shared services model but it is not successful because of the silos in each of the divisions. There is so much waste and duplication. Poor leadership has caused significant turn over of very talented employees especially within HR.
bad,Valmont is good Benefits Planning if work to do and good job for you to work at work is very fast please and you can get  Heart big on  safety it is a good  Company to work for
bad,"I don’t know how it’s legal to work people 7 days a week!! Be prepared to work constantly. There is no family work life balance here at all. Management cares less about you or you family. It’s all about production goals and money. Management gets the weekend off so it doesn’t bother them. I wouldn’t mind working a lot if the job itself was better. You will be working in a non temperature controlled environment.You halol Pay is good and with overtime you can clear a 1,000 per week. But that comes at a cost. The culture is very oppressive from top down. Enter at your own risk. If u need money really bad might be a good place for a bit. at a 834 degree kettle which is really fun in the summer. And if you"
bad,Valmont Tulsa used to be a great place to work. Newer management in recent years has ruined this place. They no longer care about the employees only about numbers. We used to set production records in a relaxed work environment now only to be micromanaged and the numbers have suffered. They've taken away all the perks we used to have and replaced them with more rules. The morale is very bad. Even long term employees are looking for other jobs.
bad,"answer phones, learned how to email customers. my co workers are great"
bad,Hoje com.essa.nova gerencia esqueceram dos funcionario
bad,they absolutely do not value employees they work you to death and don't care about your home life and family life. All they care about is their bottom line and they will drop you like a bad habit if they start to get slow
bad,"If you're in Quality, they don't care. They are about production. They have no integrity. The management is horrible. They work you to death and it seams day by day it gets worse. They wont live up to their promise on paying people. The only thing positive is there is much work as you can handle."
bad,Management shows favoritism and pay is not very competitive. Also management is inappropriate and rude. Its hot in the summer and cold in the winter. You work sometimes 60 hours a week for montjs
bad,"Overall the work skills you get from this job are pretty good, but the environment and some management wont let you become more than what you are..its all bad attitudes and too much envy"
bad,"My job is to run shop floor. I have to make sure the material is clean and properly tagged for the shipping dept. I also operate the overhead crane, and forklift."
bad,"Doesn't matter your experience or how good you are."
bad,"Good pay and benefits, terrible management. Lot’s of favoritism towards employees who have family working in the office. No room for advancement and poor working conditions."
bad,"Management says they care about employees, however they only care if you get hurt. They dont care about your family or any time you get with them. They do not care if you are sick or hurt just show up."
bad,"Management was always changing.  Good safety practices. Good money, but it can be up to 12 hours and almost never having a weekend off.  Workplace Culture is Very Bad.  Training is less than desired, good luck and keep to yourself.  Revolving door for employees, but you get to meet new people that way.  Strict attendance policy.  Layoffs and, or you can get fired if you aren't a good ole boy.   You are just a number that is used up and replaced by another number.   Around Valmont is a chain link fence with barb wire.....To keep people in? or people out?"
bad,The worst work home life balance I have ever encountered at a job they expect people to live here and do not care about there employees your just anumber to them
bad,"Good Workplace, good benefits, salary is satisfactory, hours vary however. No per deim is offered or provided. Management is very disorganized in most cases."
bad,i turned down 10 other job for this so i could be home with my kids. the 2nd shift is run by a kid whom is a bulley and if you stand up to him you will be with out a job ! its not a place for someone who has been on the road for a long time the games that the bosses play with the workers is not fun
bad,"They say they are family oriented but they are not, you work every weekend and never have time for a life.  The benefits are good and the pay is good but be ready to give up everything to work there, especially your values.  Your opinion does not matter, you are a number, if you speak out against them they will fire you.   They constantly lie to employees in the meetings, say we will get a bonus and then give us $36.00!!!"
bad,Low wage an slave work always want more then a person can possibly give the new manager pulls up in a Ferrari an everyone else that does the hard work doesn’t even make minimum wage... sucks!!!
bad,Small town facility with small town politics. It is laid back and more southern. Would not recommend someone not from the area to seek employment here.
bad,Irrigation Supervisor does not know what he is doing and is out of touch with the production workers.  Targets individuals and does not lead by example.
bad,"the big bosses had us working 10 hr days 7 days a week for 6 months."
bad,resive the workorder end fit end weld i learned how fit the co-worker are nice
bad,I worked the evening shift. I learned alot about shipping and recieving. I enjoyed my managers and coworkers.
bad,Don't work there selfish  people no great management at all  supervisor  show favoritism  environment  just not work friendly  at all alot of pointing finger people  don't work as a team
bad,"This place abuses mandatory overtime when they get behind, it becomes the normal quick. To like the tune of 50 hours a week. It makes having a life outside of there hard."
bad,this is a good paying job. but a real cheap place to work. expect employees to do a 2 man job at a fast pace. this makes the experience here horrible. hostile.. but they pay well and the benefits are also good
bad,"Can be a very fast pace for a inspector. Many times many pieces would finish at same time and require your approval. Could feel over whelming trying to keep up, rarely get ahead of game."
bad,Its a pretty good place to work i just wish things were more organized like there were times some of us had nothing to do so they rode aroun on the golf carts while the others worked but besides that everyone there is social and helpful
bad,"I worked there for nearly 3 years. In that time my name was on two separate training lists and never was i offered the classes while people hired before and after me were. Management plays favorites and will believe theyre buddy over a loyal and hard working employee when a false complaint is filed. Was made to operate equipment I never received training to properly operate and was written up when mistakes were made from a machine that was known to run poorly 98% of the time. Which is honestly sad when you goto the line and see some of the welds they let pass inspection by new hires and ""experienced"" welders. I weld better with my eyes closed then half these people do with a brand new hood."
bad,There is a strong division between management and workers. Espoused values differ greatly from enacted values. Little reward for exemplary work.
bad,Not to concerned with you or your family.  Very large company and publicly held so very concerned about the numbers and how they look to the board and stock holders.  When the economy is not booming there is always a looming lay off.
bad,Company is going in a direction that is not the right path. Too worried about it's shareholders than the employees. Leadership is not open to listening to its employees.
bad,"Arrive to work, immediately attend a daily meeting, where you are told the companies information about the previous work day and then followed by a reminder to stay in your area and work from buzzer to buzzer. I stay busy and I've learned a lot about the industry from my coworkers whom are all very easy to get along with, which is probably the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job is putting up with the management of that company that treat the shop as a modern day sweat shop."
bad,WALK AWAY DONT EVEN ATTEMPT TO PUT IN AN APP HERE!!! This place will run you into the ground make you hate your life and have you looking for another job in a week
bad,Management is sneaky in hiw they do stuff. Workers will throw people under the bus. Not a good place to work the pay is not worth the job. The enviroment is very hot and no breaks are given.
bad,"Loved the job and most the people were ok, but the department supervisor was terrible.  Lots of male type favoritism and not enough individual type recognition."
bad,I would go to work and get hassled as soon as i walked through the doors. Work was fun when the manager was not there. Everyone else was really nice. The work consisted in maintaining machines.
bad,"Great place to work as far as pay and benefits. Management is OK,  working 7 days a week is not ideal and very taxing on family life, it's mandatory in an on and off decision with very little notice. Hard to plan time with your family because of this."
bad,Valmont Farmington not a good place to work.  Plant manager would always walk around drinking coffee  never doing a thing. Poor skills and never any company  support. When plant did good he took praise. Went plant did bad it was all employees  fault.   Would give you pizza party when they make you work 6 days a week and 10 hours  a day.. not worth  it.
bad,I worked the night shift for 11.50 per hour. It was hard work I was capable of doing. The hardest part for me was most likely working the night shift. It was hard for me to be able to fit my life around my work. It was a really good place to get forklift experience.
bad,"If you are planning on being maintenance at the west point galvenising plant. Do not,  you will be overworked and harped on by management on an almost weekly bases. Go work at valley they have a better management structure and a fair workman per job ratio. If you work at West point galvenising as a Maintenance Technician you will be doing the job of three people and tell you that you are required too. There's your Warning."
bad,"working with a blow torch learning why the poles you see outside looks shiny because of the zinc.  heavy lifting. watching where the pipes of steel was began to lower down to. we worked on stairs too."
bad,One guy told me when I started to run and don't look back should have been a clue then. Don't want to spend money to fix anything so everything is run down and old.
bad,"Only upside was compensation with benefits and random free lunches. Loud, busy and smelled at times. Not a fun place to work, but depending on your job title, it was either always a busy and fast-paced day or the opposite. Supervisor was kind but seemed to be doing his own thing. Balance between job/life was okay because earlier hours allowed to go home early."
bad,"After position became unnecessary, i was terminated with no chance for lateral movement."
good,You get hours and get paid well. The health insurance is really good. But you dont have a life working for valmont. You work mainly work 6 days a week while managment wont wont come in.
good,"I was only with Velmont for a short period of time, I learned how to use a ceiling Crane and shag Truck. I had a great supervisor that I was able to take direction from and learn quickly. The hardest part of my job was getting used to working 3rd shift. I was not fond of heights when I started the job, but learned that it was not that bad working high up in the air."
good,"Temporary position, management was helpful in learning process."
good,"Required to review the product and correct any deficiencies. Constantly moving to make sure the required amount of product was ready to be picked up and moved off the location. Supervision is very tight but for good reason only because you are moving at such a fast pace, when it gets late in the day it is very common for more over looked areas to come up."
good,Good place to work. The shift I was on had really good people to work with. Everyone cared about what they did and took great quality and pride in their work.
good,"it is a hot, or cold dirty place with hard physical work and alot of it.  The people are generally good though.  It is a good place if you dont have much experience"
good,"Learn what you can and leave. It is a good place to work but management and morale is shut down quickly. It went from an awesome place to work, until it turned into a prison with cameras and whistles."
good,"Valmont was a great place to work when i first started but so many changes in the last 2 years in tulsa plant i see a decline maybe even a lay off. The new plant manager doesn't value hard working employees ive seen him fire one of our best fitters for checking the time on his phone. This fitter would often work through his breaks stay late or whatever he had to do to get poles fitted to be welded if it was a hot job. Now we have a replacement fitter in his spot who cant do the job. This plant manager has a chip on his shoulders and if upper management dont control him its only a matter of time before he brings the plant down. Ive also heard him tell guys ""im not sure if i shoukd keep you"" management shouldn't talk to employees like this. Now moral is down and so many people are looking for new jobs including myself."
good,Hard place to work for.  Worked there for almost 17 years but management is horrible.  Company makes policies and management don't follow them.
good,"• Responsibilities to managing the day to day operations of the means of transport of UPS, FED-EX, BAX Global, ABF"
good,"Valmont has really good benefits. However, managment is horrible. They do not listen to employees for tool improvments or efficiency improvments. Majority of time had to wait a week or more for new PPE, and parts to run line, or wait for days on daily consumables. Plus management did not care about quality of product."
good,"I really enjoyed working here. I had a good team with me, and we put out a lot of material through the hot and cold months. The pay was good and defiantly worth all the hours we were putting in. I personally would never go back due poor management."
good,Once highered on it was an ejoyable experience but noticed each week a new set of people would either quit after 1 week of work and notice an alarming amount of drug users on job site which made the position uncomfortable to work in.
good,"One month after starting there has been talk of closing the plant.  As a whole, production improved and deadlines were met to circumvent this but every month it comes up again and again..."
good,"It was great up to the point when I fell ill and my manager accused me of being on drugs- NOT okay.  Also upon receiving a promotion, the customer service employees treated me like chattel and no one trained me adequately. Ridiculous."
good,"Just look at all the other reviews, all the same management stinks ! Everyone used to like it yrs ago but there is something new or changing every other week ! The employees are expected to work without any joy like a bunch of lifeless robots ! No bonuses and no appreciation!"
good,"The Los Angeles site has a lot to evolve still. Management is not so great, great people not so great supervisors. Supervisors need to take some classes on how to treat general workers."
good,"7 days a week, Plant runs 24/7. Good company to work for if you are looking to work all the time. Management needs to look into balance of work/life balance."
good,Good place with great people. Company focuses on continuous learning and development and will provide financial support to develop employees. Workplace culture and benefits could use an update.
good,Exposed to elements. Never really sure what hours you're working. Sometimes management will not listen to experienced personnel. Scheduling erratic and confusing at times.
good,High turn-over of employees within the company is very likely due to lack of knowing the different divisions and listening to what the hiring managers want.
good,"Its a great place to work,other than some of the management decisions. Also the rate it takes to move up is rather slow goin. I would recommend to younger work force."
good,"Hot work environment,pay is better than average they stretch before work. Too much going in & out for such a little building . dangerous work environment"
good,"7 days a week,  sometimes 12hrs a day on an off shift,   the pay is good,  but for what the employees sacrifice for the company,  the pay rate should be doubled.   "
good,"I performed my job to the"
good,"Every day is something different.  The culture of Valmont, trying to find a good fit in the International market while maintaining our presence domestically."
good,Great pay and would have stayed for a long time. The management here is horrible. The worst I have ever seen and HR is not any better. Went on vacation and had my hours approved by a supervisor only to get home and find out that my supervisor never actually put my name down in the book like he told me he did. They pointed me out for a no call no show that never actually happened.
good,"I was a fresh out of welding school applicant. I was accepted by the night shift supervisor. I was not accepted by the people who had no school and thought they were gods gift to welding. Their training was not great. Expecting a lot who has no practical experience and with little training on what they expected. Pay wasn't bad. Overtime was crazy. Working 4 10's already and then required to work up to 6 days certain weeks. "
good,"Valmont is ok but not that really be helpful financially for me, since i am receiving only a monthly salary of 200 aed. Boss is ok wokrplace are ok too"
good,"I didnt personally enjoy all the things that go on at Valmont. The management likes to throw you under the bus, for anything especially something that your supervisor may get into serious trouble for."
good,"Way too much mandatory overtime. You basically spend 3/4 of your life here. The expectations get higher and higher as times go. Employees are frequently moved around in different positions depending where the workload is."
good,"Many intelligent people to work with. Good health benefits, better than average time off, and decent pay scale. Lacks modern technology in programming and IT support. Little room for advancement. Many layers of management."
good,This job is great for the person who wants to work seven days a week. The pay is good but the headache that comes with the job is very stressful.
good,"Good company, has some areas to improve just like every organization"
good,Employees are friendly. Many have been there over 20 years. Workers are dedicated and focused on their customers needs
good,"it was a very good job, very poor managment, very unorginized"
good,It’s a ok job  It will teach u a lot about the process of hot dipping and cleaning steel also and getting too meet new people I worked at this job for 9 years
good,"Place is very smoky so you should wear a mask most of the time and at times it is very uncomfortable with all your protective safety equipment. However, it is challenging fabricating different structures."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in. Small office and quiet. Training was great. Always someone to help you no matter what. I  would like to have worked from home because of my condition but,was not offered. The people there were very friendly and loved to have fun."
good,"Overall not a bad company to work for. Benefits are decent. You do work long hours and management doesn't seem to care about you, your just a number, but that's everywhere you go now a days."
good,"Valmont isn't a factory so much as a sprawling campus.  Each building ends up as a small factory in itself.  I worked in a CNC shop and it had a small shop feel.  Run primarily by a lead, the supervisor would show up once a night.  The jobs weren't physically taxing, but there was enough of a challenge to keep the job from being a boring drag.  I would still be there except...they lay off every year.  I was told only those who had been there 10 years would survive the lay-off cut.  One of my biggest regrets is not accepting the recall after 6 months, but that's the point.  Who can afford a 6 month layoff every year or so?  Good culture, good job, relaxed management style, and lots of lay-offs."
good,"Fast pace, in the hot summer and very cold in the winter, no help. Sometimes you have to skip lunch just so you dont get behind thur out the whole week.  Very harsh atmosphere."
good,"Pay was good, healthcare and benefits were good. Work hard and keep good attendance may not mean a long career. My shift manager was awesome. Advancement opportunities felt very limited unless you lived in a certain region. Shop staff was ""disposable""."
good,project coordinators were not supportive of a team work environment. management had no control over the situation. The work load was feast or famine and coordinators would take other coordinators work.
good,good place to work if you love the steel plant culture and stress of management trying to get the product out the door or the up and down hours if you do go work at valmont
good,"ok place to work-people are not very friendly-working conditions are minimun.  hours are great, benefits are good.  work monday thru friday schedule, no weekends unless required OT."
good,"datas e metas pré estabelecidas."
good,"Quality welders, clean shop, and plenty of work. Under qualified personell leading the way in the Quality department but as long as you bite your tongue and learn to get along you'll have a job here for as long as you need it."
good,i worked for this company at two different locations  i worked at the columbus nebraska plant and at their tulsa oklahoma plant the nebraska plant was great
good,Only reason I Left valmont because the pay wasn’t enough plus I found I better job that pay more which I needed because the area I live at is very high in that job didn’t cut it for me
good,"The pay is top notch. However the management team has no clue what is going on, and it is a very disorganized place to work. Be prepared to work 72 hours a week"
good,"Thank God I had a great ( Manager ) for the last few years there.  After company was sold in 2008 things did go good for a while,   and the last years there, too many corporate managers not knowing what the right hand is doing."
good,"This review is a non biased point of view,  and is also not wrote with harsh emotions, just facts . Valmont is good for what they pay.  ""Exceptional pay"". The work is fairly decent and is very stable. If you get on weekends , it's not to bad as well because you have four days off to do what ever you like, example: school, family functions, and so on . Also their 401k and benifits are not bad either, and the employees are what makes this company stay afloat .  "
good,"this was a decent work place unfortunately it has shutdown, they looked for the best type of self-starting and production driven persons, they paid decently."
good,"it was hot in the summer depending were you were welding in the shop some of the area,s had air flow and some don,t and cold in the winter with all the doors being open and closed all day every day."
good,enjoyed work and most of the people I worked with. My manager was fair and good to work for. collecting data for engineers running test and fabricating experimental fixtures were done on a typical day
good,very relaxed atmosphere no heavy lifting got to sit most of the day assembling there product good hours not much overtime hours worked in a non climate controlled wharehouse
good,"Maybe valmont has other departments that have a much better work environment, but I worked in what they call Mid-size, when i bashing the company as well as the management. We would have machines that would break down constantly with a maintenance team that would slap a band aid over it and when I would question that, the other employees would say yep thats just the valmont way, and that I picked the worst department to work at, I was hired as a seam repair welder for second shift, I was trained for it on day shift for a couple months and when I moved to evenings the had me running the machines and the other monotonous jobs that no one else wanted to do, 4 months they had me doing that. apparently that was the norm for newcomers but it was never explained to me before I accepted the job that thats how it would be. Keep in mind I have a degree in welding technology, and they knew that I could weld. When I would confront my manager about it and how long it would take me to get over to the welding side he didn't have a clue. we worked 7 day weeks and we even had a guy in upper management tell us ""If we could have you guys working 8 days a week, we would."" we had 2 10 minute breaks with 15 minutes to eat our dinner. It was all about production production production they could care less the last time you were able to spend time with family. I once had a coworker tell me that once he worked 6 months with not one day off. I know for a fact that the only reason any of those guys worked there was the overtime pay and benefits, most of them made it obvious they didn't actually care for"
good,"A typical day for me was usually working alone on a specialized task. I worked in a separate building in charge of minor maintenance on product(s), data logging/data entry and making sure it was ready for shipping. I learned quite a bit of information, however, most job specific knowledge isn't applicable outside of the workplace.I did on the other hand gain vast experience with various tools and machinery. The culture of my workplace changed drastically within the few years I was employed from relaxed to immensely oppressive and depressive. The hardest part of the job was definitely working up at the 834 degree kettle area, where product was coated with molten zinc, or the weeks on end without time off. The most enjoyable part of my job to me meanwhile, was the workplace relationships/ friendships that I have made in the process."
good,Nice place to work. Plenty of overtime hours to be had. Get to meet a lot of good people along way. If you can stand the elements then this is a nice job.
good,"get poles from straighteners, put poles on machine, run machine, make sure poles are high in quality, put poles on a finished cart, the co-workers make it fun to work there"
good,"I don't know actually how this company is now, it was three years ago i worked there. at that time the place was okay to work for. The hours were good and my co-workers were okay."
good,"If you want a factory dead end job, than this is the place to work at. The Plant Mgr & Plant Supervisor are clueless on how to utilize manpower and they have no course of action regarding production planning. All the workers are treated and looked upon as minimal paid dummies, with no futures, thereby trapped in a job they truly hate."
good,Valmont is a diverse company with room to grow.  Management needs some attention but other than that is was ok.  Daily activities as a mechanic varied depending on the project or mechanical breakdown.  Company was just implementing some lean practices when I left; and from what I observed their will be a lot of changes being made.
good,"A large facility work day."
good,"All breaks observed, not much in the way of social atmosphere.  Family oriented.  Picnics and social gatherings for families. Hot working environment."
good,"Management always wanted more, more, more. They were always raising the numbers of what we had to get done, but was way understaffed, causing all shop workers to work crazy hours (mostly 10hr days, 6 days a week. Sometimes 12hr days, 10hrs Saturday, and occasionally Sundays) and hardly have any free time to spend with family and friends, or just to enjoy life. I enjoyed working with co-workers, we all got along."
good,OK lack of leadership compared to amount of employees on floors
good,"Good company with hardworking people.  I enjoyed my experience working for Valmont, but felt like this division received little attention from the large corporate office in Nebraska."
good,"Worked 2 1/2 years as Human Resources Representative. Handled all office work, did some interviewing for managers, scheduled drug tests, called applicants, handled orientations, took care of all paperwork, held benefit meetings, data entry, filing, switchboard relief. I operated the press machine for 4 months, learned to operate the CNC machine and worked in the Storeroom for 4 years. I operated an overhead crane, jibb crane, forklift, hand tools, hand sander, pallet jack, sand blaster. I inventoried and inspected product. "
good,"Pulled product, palletized product, shrink wrapped product so product could be shipped out on trucks. Inventoried product on a weekly basis. Management was nice. Co-workers were okay. Hardest part of job was handling very heavy parts. No cranes in building to help with parts. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting together smaller parts to be shipped."
good,"I really liked this job but was dissapointed that I was released after missing 3 days from being ill. Although I provided a doctors note and WAS legitamately ill, I was released for missing 3 days in my probationary period."
good,Good place to work. Worked here for 2 years before relocating.
good,Most weeks you would work 60+ hours.  Most people work most weekends.  Great place to work for a younger person due to relationships between the younger people with similar lives.
good,Seems like everything worth working here for was taken away. They wont let you advance. And pay raises are a joke. It used to be a great place to work
good,"Upper management isn't the brightest crayon in the box. The recent changes have seemed to bring down the moral of the employees. Corporate would be wise to intervene and see the real reason for the failure of production numbers. Most of the employees I work with are great. Of course like every job it seems like anymore, you have a good ol boy system. These employees are the untouchables and seem to move up the chain fast. Some supervisor's need to freshen up on their leadership class. If you have an emergency and don't want it to be known, don't tell them. They gossip more than the Real Housewives. As far as pay and benefits, it's probably one of the top companies in the industry. I really do enjoy working here, but this company could be a lot better with a new regime running it. Until them, you just got to keep your head down, be seen and not heard. As an employee, you have no good ideas."
good,"With an accountant as a general manager, it was stressful communicating the day to day operations within a manufacturing environment.  Valmont is hiring at a fast pace and productivity and quality was heavily impacted due to the high amount of trainees."
good,"Fellow co-workers were wonderful. Participation with company events was possible. They were willing for you to learn new software of which I have used every working moment since I left in 2005. Pay was okay, benefits were good and it was a place that did have humor.  Having several management changes was challenging, but found a way to get through it. I'd consider going back."
good,"Valmont is a decent place to work good benefits and good pay, but not to much time for the home life, especially if your working nights other than that good people and good bosses"
good,"Very typical factory setting. 10 hour days with one 20 minute break and another 10 minute break. On your feet all day. It can be tough, but it is a good job to  have. Making great money after 3 years as well."
good,Valmont is a good company to work for.  The pay was good and I enjoyed the work environment and the people I worked with. They have great benefits and also got bonuses on  occasions.
good,"It is manufacturing so they monitor our production, requiring us to reach or meet certain daily goals. If we do not we are susceptible to Personal Improvement Program."
good,"Friendly work environment, lots of teamwork, smoke free work place, great benefits , opportunity to invest in stocks and bonds. alternative shifts to fit life type."
good,working at Valmont is cool but the work is hard and the pay is okay. the managers is okay and will help you anywhere they can.The work hours is not that bad either.
good,"Good overall, just have to be aware of your surroundings. And always play it safe. The atmosphere was not the cleanest, but that's normal with a machine shop."
good,"Build, repair and weld out utility and electrical power poles utalizing plasma cutter, and flux cored mig welder. Supervisors would constantly walk around asking questions for hours on end and then get on your rear end about not producing. Each employee had an assigned station to work at."
good,"what I do for work is pretty simple, I have the long days and good days meaning.... easy days, what I do at  this company is deal with a lot of steel material, I kit up the parts meaning I get whatever material is needed for the fitters, The fitters are the people that lays out the pole for the parts to be fitted on to the pole correctly, from there once the pole is done being fit, The pole moves to a welder but before that the pole has to pass inspection before weld out."
good,Great place to work but human resources manager will harass you over nothing. They'll also assume you're on drugs when you act different. I loved it until they harassed me for 6 months straight so I quit. No job pays enough to put up with harassment even by management. After 2 years I hated to leave but had no choice.
good,has been a good place to work until recent management changes that have taken a huge impact on overall moral and employee relations. Communication from management to employees has become less than desirable and job security isn't as certain as it once was.
good,Job was hot. Fast paced . people I worked with we're good. Very safety orientated. Plenty of hours to work. Hours were good. Time went by fast. Supervisors were good
good,"Manager is not engaged at my level so other team mate and senior did what they wanted to and when it was brought to the manager level nothing was done. So I did a lot of sitting and doing nothing, team mates excluded me from the decision making."
good,Wonderful people great opportunities to grow in life great benefits for you an your family takes up a lot of your time but is very cooperative long term job
good,"There was new management when I was employed there. My position was newly created and wasn't approved with the New Controller who thought he could run everything.  I worked 18 months and was laid off due to the 2008 recession.  I found out about 6 months after the lay off that the new CFO and Controller were fired. "
good,"management isn't the best around,they do not care about their employee at all. no warnings,immediate termination. the pay is good but the company isn't for its employees"
good,gained a lot of experience hours in MT and UT. this would be a great place for a tech fresh out of school. the management could help to take their employees into account when making decisions.
good,"I have worked for Valmont 27 years managing multiple functional areas; from drafting, engineering, IT, product development, human resources, merger & acquistion, and marketing."
good,The benefits are great. There are a lot of opportunities for overtime depending on department. There is always an opportunity to advance or cross over to other departments.
good,"Long hours, Mandatory overtime, working 7. day weeks at times. Safety was a concern everywhere but poorly implemented, leading to alot of injuries and even deaths."
good,"Company had a very good training program, and they believe in team oriented programs. Most management worked well together but their are a few they are looking out for them self. They also make judgmental decision that are not true and don't give second chance to prove them wrong.  Overall the amount of time working for them I enjoy working for them."
good,Its a nice place to work.  They leave let you do your job and as long as you are working the leads will let you work at your own pace. Pay is good for the work.
good,great place to work if you like working outside. the people I worked with were fun and lively everyday. the part I enjoyed the most was getting to learn how to sand blast
good,When I was hired I was told that I would be working 4 10s with occasional overtime on Saturdays. Turns out they ment 6 10s with an occasional weekend off. Sometimes had to work 12 hour shifts and sundays. Company is under staffed with welders and overstaffed  with bigwigs.
good,Some management is a joke and when problems arise they turn a blind eye to it hoping that it goes away. Otherwise great benefits and plenty of overtime and hours where pretty good
good,I have worked here for the last 3 years and have learned a lot about communication towers and dot sign structures great people to work with but it is a very fast paste invironment
good,"Entreprise très agréable, lieu de travail est magnifique et l'équipe très agréable."
good,loved it worked with amazing people as well as meeting new people and i also learned alot that benefited me in the future. really good job to work at .
good,"Good interpersonal skills learned"
good,"Great place to work, everybody gets along and management, works with you well in getting the job done right. All in all, its a great place to work at."
good,Great place to work. Great wages. Great incentive plans and beautiful network of people. Easy work to handle and the teamwork makes things run smooth as possible
good,"Always something to do, Supervisors are great always there to lsten to you, love where they make you stop anything you are doing to do 10 min exercise."
good,"A typical day consist of working with many teams within the daily operations to adapt to quick changes within the work area, adjusting to customer changes and demands upon request and meeting deadlines."
good,"Valmont Industries is a very diverse, well-established company.  It is a fairly large company with several locations around the world."
good,I enjoyed working as a fitter/welder but wanted to move on to bigger and better things in life and start making more money.
good,"My current typical days involves constant communication with customers and shipping department. I take and enter orders to be put in the shipping schedule. "
good,"I got my drills for the work orders and did my P.M. on the drill or Mill,I would train new machinist on either one some times and at times We were the ones that planned out what jobs were to be doing that day as foremans were few and far between the managers were always hard on them but I am a self starter so I didn't really care I got along with everyone there pretty much."
good,hard workin people person who like to  get the job done n also helpin my co workers
good,Great Co. at the time. Full time employment. Factory exsperience.
good,osi sent me here then this co. hired me on permenatly because I was a great employee.
good,"Day is very basic, come in organize my morning, then get down to the task of the day. "
good,"I worked in a nasty, smelly, dirty, smokey, and noisy environment....with some of the nicest people on the planet.  Most everyone pitched in to help others, joked around (within reason) and generally made the work more bearable."
good,Lots of different things to do on a daily basis.  The culture of the Maintenance Dept. is great boss and great people to work with.  But like most companies there is always that divide between maintenance and production which makes everything hard
good,I learned a lot about metal fabricating here and also I was able to pass on my knowledge to help others. Valmont becomes your family and your loved ones at home only see you sleep.
good,"This job is perfect for a single work aholic, you can expect to work hard in all kinds of elements, zinc smoke from the kettle, it's always at the least 15-20 degrees hotter in the plant than outside, It is an open end building on both ends and the wind during winter can cut like a razor, You may be ask to move from one department to another when they are short handed or assigned to several jobs to cut cost for the company. The management is willing to be helpful to you as long as you are dependable and hard working. Job commitment is a plus, The hardest part of the job is the switching of shift hours. you may work a week like this Mon.-Sat 8hrs a day then the next week Sun-Sat 12 hrs a day, then if production requires it you may work Mon-Tues 8hrs Wed-Sun 12hrs. A normal sleep schedule is often out of the question, which will make you tired and rundown and you may not always be able to think on your feet. I often think of it like the military. So if you can handle all of this plus the fact that the company has always tried to reach 100% Quality and Quantity and Safety since the day the doors opened, but are not too willing to buy the right equipment or hire enough people long enough to be trained properly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits packages and quarterly and yearly bonuses, as well as frequent breaks for long shifts."
good,"They offer a decent benefit varieties for the family. "
good,"Weekend shift is nice. Work 36 hours and get paid for 40 then have the whole week off. I liked the pace, you get rewarded for working harder than the rest."
good,"You never see the Production Manager. If you have an issue, it's like talking to a wall. The people on the floor I worked with are amazing people and I've made some life long friends."
good,"Review of emails and production schedule for any customer needs, production problems and quality team issues."
good,"Great paying job, takes a while to move up in some departments due to management and the people in place. Overtime is usually there every week or you can work other areas to receive overtime."
good,"The main part I hated was driving an hour every day to and from work. I always worked night shifts, because it just always seemed easier to deal with when I had daily things to handle. The management was excellent 15, years ago and then it just fell apart from the top down. In the beginng it's all good moving spot to spot. Then you get stuck with office personnel that doesn't know the safety and people get hurt. I loved the insurance Valmont has but when they layedoff the hole weekend night shift, that was just a big mistake."
good,Great place to work at with great benefits. Very good pay and coworkers are fun to work with.plenty of overtime. Good criss training and advancement opportunities.
good,"Good place to work good money and benifits.good people to work with ..some of management are more worried. about themselves then the employees,make for a hard place to work!!!!!!!"
good,"Valmont offers a Welders dream come true;"
good,Got a chance to learn how to weld in an industrial environment. They often had BBQ's just for appreciation of their employees.
good,"boa  empresa , pagamento sempe em  dia alguns benefícios,mas "
good,"Good Company, they are very big on helping the United Way. The benefits are good for the family. enjoyed working for them"
good,Productive work place with great people to work with and enough work to keep you busy.Great benefits and insurance and company parties for employees at the end of the year with prize's give away at the door.
good,Its a fast paced job...alot of room for advancement...very hot and hard working environment but if your used to hard work its normal to you...........not so good management
good,"Good Lean Certification Program and Global Gemba Academy."
good,It was very fast paced at times. I also had days where it was very slow. Overall I enjoyed the job. There was a competitive atmosphere about the job. I wish this job would've been permanent.
good,"Valmont takes care of it's employees, and has taken very good care of me for the last 9 yrs.. A great company to work for. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Enjoyed working for Valmont frrom employees up to Management.  It was a very busy day. Enforcing Policies and Procedures on a daily basis. Hiring, on boarding, time clock."
good,I have been able to learn a lot about business to business sales and the people that I work with are very professional.  I also appreciate the flexibility for family functions.
good,I acquired this position through a Temporary Staffing Agency and enjoyed the work very much.  Working at Valmont gave me job experience that helped in my college classes.
good,"travail en 3/8 assez contraignant"
good,I would not recomend Valmont. Run from their global headquarters in Omaha NE. They tend to dictate from a distance. If one plant is doing poorly and determine that they need to lay people off they will lay off in all plants with no reguard for the amount of busniess each plant is doing thus leaving some facilities grossly understaffed.
good,There are great opportunity at this company just take's time an effort as all good this do was laid off do two cut backs even though I was let go they still continue to help me in my personal life because there a family oriented company
good,"It is hot in the summer and cold in the winter.  Working there you feel like you are all working in part for a common goal, which is very rewarding.  Maintenance and Production work well with each other."
good,Stepping stone job. Was too many two faced people. Random UA sucks..zero tol.. blows....Was a great training ground.. Learned how to operate. A crane..
good,typical work day on the job is you are welding on various size poles on rollers using multiple positions an wire 1/16th an .045 using fluxcore and mig procedure.
good,"The work is hard. Though the pay is worth it."
good,This job was a great employment opportunity. I had to relocate and Valmont did not have a facility where I moved. Bummer. The only difficult part was the long hours during busy season. 50-70 hrs a week. For me it was ok but I didn't have family so that could be tough for some. Overall I would work for Valmont again any anytime and I would recommend them to anyone. Great benefits with profit sharing and plenty of OT.
good,Excellent company that really cares about it's employees. Great opportunities for advancement. good pay and benefits. Plenty of locations to work at. Values education.
good,"it is a decent place to work.  Good people, excellent benefits, and good work hours.  If there was a Valmont in Lincoln I would simply transfer but that's not the case."
good,"Started in HR and had the opportunity to grow to a General Manager position over my 16 years there.  No place is perfect, but I really enjoyed working for Valmont and the opportunities that it provided me."
good,Many different areas to work in. I got to move around allot. Management was great to work with. The hardest part of the job was being challenged on my decisions.
good,"Can be demanding at times, but allows workers to advance. following rules and regulations is a must in this environment in order to keep job. you may work overtime when needed but will also need to shorten hours worked if market dies down. 32-48 hours is a good way to look at this."
good,Management was unorganized always changing out orders. Order deadlines were cut short and was pushed hard to get order out on time. Working 6 days a week was stressful and hard to get a weekend off.
good,"I've worked with many different people at Valmont.  They have good benefits and the personal are easy to work with most of the time.  I've been at different locations in the shipping area where I work at.  I've built crates, bagged poles, and put various items on poles.  Also, I've learned how to drive a forklift at Valmont."
good,The management at Valmont was fun and motivating. We were able to have fun without deviating from our responsibilities.  I also learned a lot about the steel industry.
good,"After high school this is a good job, but room for advancement is very slim. The language barrier prevents some employees to get to know each other better, also the work environment is very dirty and hazardous to your body in the long run."
good,co-workers are awesome. management needs improvement.most enjoyable part is working with the other employees. this is a great company with awesome benefits. really relaxed atmosphere.
good,"aprendi a trabalhar em equipe e operar máquinas, fiz amigos, evolui como pessoa e profissionalmente, não tinha dificuldade em realizar nenhuma tarefa dada, sempre muito atencioso aos equipamentos de segurança, minha e dos colegas, diretores e chefes agradáveis."
good,"great bunch guys to work with preformed there job with great skill it w"
good,"VERY safety-focused, lower/middle mgmt will do all they can to help you, constantly numbers (production) focused."
good,Consistently ranked as a Top facility for Safety and Production. Often visited by other Industrial Leaders as a standard for manufacturing / Industrial Excellence.
good,I like working at Valmont because they're very flexible with your schedule. They have very good benefits and treat people good. Overall I like working at Valmont because I can they have different shifts and flexible schedules.
good,"The job pays pretty good, the people"
good,Good working environment with opportunities for advancement. Company that has  the desire to grow organically and with acquisitions. Not uncommon for an employee to spend their entire career at Valmont.
good,Great place to work for. If valmont wasnt closing i wud work there till i retired. Unfortunately thats not the case. Was a great place to work. Good bosses and good people.
good,Great place to work.  A real team effort and plenty of opportunities for advancement.   Very cutting edge on lean and quality is number one.  Core values are exercised every day.
good,"A lot of face paced office work for the entire floor of about 70 people including sales, drafters for light poles. Answering phones and filing, copying and putting catalogs together and working on spreadsheets."
good,"Great place to work. Always improving around you, just not much helping you improve. Pick and choose who they tend to help move up the ladder. Place where you do not get much time off."
good,"Estoy muy orgulloso de haber trabajado en esta empresa, y sobre todo haber formado parte de un grupo de personas excepcionales y ser tan buenos compañeros todos, donde el ambiente de trabajo no solo era divertido sino agradable y tambien serio y responsable. "
good,"Valmont in Claxton, GA is a very family oriented place to work.  It is like a small family where we look out for one another.  The job flow fluctuates with demand and pole orders so it is hard to say exactly how many hours you may work.  During month end and closing, I tend to work a few more hours than 40 a week."
good,I liked what I did when I was they I walked and cut the cable they used to build concrete poles it would been better if it had walls or at least fans to hot in summer to cold in winter
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a brief meeting prior to our shift, group stretching (because it required much physical labor), and then reporting to our assigned stations. It was quite tedious and repetitive so it taught me to focus on the details and quality of my work, while making a concerted effort to produce at a high rate, as well. Management was passionate about their work and their employees. One of the difficulties about this job was, at times, keeping up with the speed of production that was expected. My fellow employees and the lessons learned from this experience were by far the most enjoyable parts of my time at Valmont."
good,They best part of the job was the crew and lead man and Forman. The Hr department is a joke tho. The  production raises need some tuning. I know of a couple guys that had there numbers way higher then the level to be a Welder 1 but there excuse for not giving them welder1 pay was they hadn't been with the  company long enough so moral and production drops until they qualify under hr's standards not production standards. Anyways a great crew but hr and couple other issues in the offices need to be addressed
good,Starts with a warm welcome at the reception and followed by the colleagues. Best learning at Valmont is team building. The management is very transparent and there is no barrier for communication in any department from shop-floor to the management . I found a brilliant team players and buddies at work.
good,start the day reading e-mails then lining out day for crew. co-workers are mostly good we work together to get job done. Supervisor is good to work for. management well seamed ok till they told us they were closing plant. My job is a learning job we have equipment that is one of two in world. the most enjoyable part of the job is making machinery work at its best and the people. The hardest pat of the job is being the only Electrician on the shift and keeping every one happy
good,A typical day at work.Grinding metal hanging metal up.Taking metal down off the rack painting them over again.
good,"Fast pace working environment, learned how to weld, be more efficient at work."
good,"willing to train"
good,people were great to work with . Supervisor was cool didn't hear much unless you were lazy. very hot in the summer and 7 day work weeks start to take a toll on your family and other lifestyle activites
good,"The hardest part of the job was to ensure that when you look at an order and a set of plans, you identify everything that you need to supply for the customers.  The number of complete structures, any accessories, length of bolts. things like that."
good,"A typical day as a Kit Lead would be to first review the incoming and outgoing orders to project the people I oversee work load and to arrange the order in priority bases.  After that I begin communication and transporting to other areas of the company. While completing these task I also helped the team with orders and monitored their work progression and time efficiency.  The best part about my job was being in leadership and effectively structuring my building to work at it's best and high potential and seeing the customers and other pleased with the production.  The most challenging part was overseeing people with various personalities and conflict resolving and  working and effectively communicating with the males and females I was overseeing.    While it was challenging, it was still one of the components that I enjoyed and taught me to be a better leader."
good,"I love my job but very upset, I have over 100% production every week and still get denied for a promotion and a raise. Very disappointing, I work extremely hard to not get some kind of reward so their for looking for a new job"
good,I liked workint for valmont . It was nice to work for a great company and have the perks of insurance and  401k.. would go back to the job if i could but at the moment there isnt an opening
good,Nice culture.  Very balanced and the co-workers have personality. Pretty relaxed atmosphere and definitely not stressful.  Nice small town location so you don't have to fight the traffic.
good,Give a call set up an interview let me show you what i can do I highly believe you will be very surprised just looking to see what's out there and hope I can be part of your crew
good,"Worked there almost 3 years, just like any other company it has its ups and a downs. but overall they have great benifits and great pay. so if you can handle hot summers and cold winters its a good fit for you."
good,"Everyone got along well.  No job was too big.  Learned a lot about safety.  Really enjoyed meetings that was provided everyday for employees to discuss matters at work, which caused everyone to communicate and understand what needs to be done to get the job done"
good,"Excellent to work with the other employees.  Company relocated from Mona Vale to Prestons, hence that is why I am not working with them anymore.Worked on contract for them for 5 months from home."
good,Most days were challenging and that what makes this job exciting.  The only reason I am no longer employed with Valmont Coatings is that I relocated to Arizona.
good,"After working here for 2.5 years I would say the training I have recevied is invaluable going forward.  It was not an easy job.  There were lots of problem solving involved and many fires had to be put out but I learned to work under pressure and solve problems quickly and efficiently.  What I learned from Acme I was able to utilize at Valmont in anticipating problems before they occurred. This has been a great opportunity to learn new tricks and see another aspect of the manufacturing industry.  There are a great number of dedicated, warm, and fun people at this organization and lot of what I knew from my previous employment I was able to utilize here as well.  The company announced that it was closing this faciltiy so we won't be here much longer."
good,"A typical day at Valmont was fun. I was fortunate to work on the best shift (most productive) and gained knowledge as well as new ""tricks of the trade"". While we were pushed to be more and more productive hard work didnt go unnoticed. I loved the swing shift with opportunity for overtime. So I got to spend time with my family. The culture at Valmont promoted a team mentality and family values. There was always clear communication between management and employees until it stopped when our shift was asked to pick up the slack of our counterpart shift. We were asked to work alternating 5 and 6 day work weeks but ended up working 6 and 7 day work weeks. Other than that Valmont is a great place to work with advancement opportunity."
good,Job was very friendly and used all my skills. Working at this job I learned alot about galvanizing steel and how to safely handle to steel without damaging the product or hurting myself
good,"Every day was about the same, with some days more challenging than others. I learned how to work together to get the job done. Management was informative, and the work place culture was interesting. Hardest part of the job was implementing the new changes, while the most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of acconplishment."
good,"Great management, great team workers. Its also a great environment to be. I learned a lot working there. Great benefits and alot of opportunities to move up the ladder."
good,"Had a great HR Manager, taught me a lot. Great mentor. He made the job enjoyable. One of the best jobs I have had. Great benefits, promotes from within. Global company."

good,"I worked for Valmont  2 years. First it was the paint department, which isn't to horrible. It is inside but hot in the summers and chilling in the winters. Lots to learn if you want to advance. Then I did shipping. I do not have a kind word to say about that department, so I won't say anything. All and all it is a great company to work for."

good,"Arrive 20 minutes early everyday, hear and apply the best customer service at all and every point in my employment, able to get along with all co-workers. The hardest part of the last position was working in the 100 plus degree heat, best part was the communication between the co-workers and company appreachation"
good,this was a great place to work I enjoyed the people and the job.
good,I loved my time at Valmont. This is a real career. Working here made me feel like i was back in America again. This job gave me hope in my future. Stan Courtney was the best boss i've ever had. This company keeps it's promise to hire good temps. There's always room for promotion at Valmont and everyone gets a fair shake. All your tools and PPE are provided for you. Coworkers treated me like i mattered. i was proud to wear my work jersey outside of the shop to let everyone know where i work. I'd be proud to work there again someday.

Going through warehouse checking inventory, I've learned all my specific duties from my co-workers and management. My manager was very easy going, laid back, understanding, and was very involved with our crew. The best part of the job was that we would have fun while we were getting our job done. There was no negativity or tension with anyone. We all got along of course there were the days were people were frustrated with customers/orders and such, but the job always got done."

good,The company was interested in engaging with their employees.
good,"In my position at Valmont, being able to multi-task is a must. Taking care of the welders and keeping them welding is first priority. This contains gathering parts needed, loading and unloading with an overhead crane. Secondly, the welders need product to weld, so it is also my job to make sure the aluminum poles are punched for hand holes, routered, cleaned properly, and that the bases are expanded onto the poles before giving to the welders. Throughout the shift I am delegating tasks to other welding assistants, verifying that what the welders are working on, are the orders that get fulfilled first and so on throughout the week. I also determine what and how much the welders are welding on a daily bases and at the end of the shift input that information and numbers into excel. I am assisting up to four welders per day. What I have learned from my job at Valmont, is knowledge in welding and aluminum manufacturing. My experience with management has been great at Valmont. Even though it is a manufacturing warehouse the upper management works hard to keep their employees safe while also being productive. At Valmont we all work as a team and my co-workers have made it an enjoyable place to work. The hardest part that I have been able to overcome is working in a warehouse environment with predominantly all male co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is the challenge that it brings. Both physically and mentally. I also enjoy being able to train new hire employees. Lastly, I enjoy knowing the products that we manufacture are able to be seen around my town and other cities as"

Benefits are fantastic, pay is well, they watch out for us, they feed us nice dinners from time to time.  The bosses are easily accessible and take care of us.  All I can say is the upper management out of state, well, they don't have a clue what's going on and should rely on the staff that is there every day doing there job and know the employees and who to trust and to not."
good,"This job was fast paced but safety procedure were a high priority."
good,I loved working there. I got to work. I knew what was expected of me.
