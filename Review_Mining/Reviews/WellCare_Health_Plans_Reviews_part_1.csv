rating,review
bad,There's little to no room for growth and if by chance you are promoted don't expect a huge salary bump. Care coordinators at competitor insurance companies make more money than managers. Administration is a joke as well. Not a great company to work for if you're building a career.  It's literally a stepping stone while getting an advanced degree.
bad,Extremely disappointing. Management was horrible and they never promoted. Nothing was ever resolved. Lots of favoritism and lots of unhappy Physicians
bad,Incompetent management sleazy practices practices that go against the center for Medicare and Medicaid services guidelines incompetent human resources I expect you to take a person off of a good insurance plan to put them on their plan
bad,"Wellcare hired quite a few temporary nurses with the promise that if you worked hard they would try to hire as many of us as possible. After we helped them meet their quota, they told us that they would not be keeping any of us. I was so disappointed. I put in a lot of extra time with no extra pay. Such a horrible way to treat people."
bad,"I wouldn't wish this place on my worse enemy.  Run, do not walk, to the nearest exit.  You have been warned."
bad,They do not appreciated their employees. Not enough raises to their employees. Awful place to work. Long hours and not enough time with your family. Ok training. They do not understand that people with Children have emergencies with their children. If you have to leave you may not have a job the next day.
bad,There is a ton of favoritism and management is unfair. The company has recently been bought out and things are changing faster than anyone of them can keep up with. I suggest you wanted till after the merger to make sure you still have a job.
bad,"I was told that I would receive lead support. The leads were given to people who were friends with management. You are only paid $500 for car allowance and that amount is taxed heavily, leaving you to pay for gas and extreme wear and tear on your car and miles.  Office environment is messy and everyone seems to be miserable, unhappy and hate their jobs."
bad,"The worst company training I have ever experienced in all my 30 plus years as a Registered Nurse. Please read the reviews!!!"
bad,"the management there is has NASTY personalities, they lack integrity, copious amount of brown-nosing, management extremely incompetent and that's why more than half of each day is spent in meetings."
bad,"Too high expectations, micromanagement, treats nurses like children, Punishes if don't meet expectations.  The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.  They put RN's in a position to potentially lose their licenses; They make Care Managers who have had no experience with Behavioral Health manage people who are suicidal and have no idea how to deal with them. "
bad,"Stressful workload, poor management, poor morale. Managers are lazy and put the overflow on the workers, who are already drowning in work.  Run don't walk far away from this company."
bad,"This company is a joke! Not only do they treat the members & providers like dirt, but they treat their employees just as bad. I'm sure  WellCare Health Plans, Inc. can place 1st in 'Worst Places To Work"" every year. WellCare Health Plans, Inc. exemplifies qualities of how not to run a business as well as the 'Appeal to Tradition' fallacy. Every technological entity that you will touch at  WellCare Health Plans , Inc. is outdated. Furthermore, this is the least innovative workplace i've ever encountered. During my time here, I had the opportunity to witness shoddy praxis, which in turn taught me to take the inverse approach with future job duties. Moreover, being in the most minimal  thought-provoking environment, my collective intelligence may have dropped by 1 or 2 IQ points. In fact, I did establish a passel of relationships with co-workers from various departments that I miss conversing with, but this was merely not enough to alter my sentiments of how much I loathed working there. The management at WellCare Health Plans , Inc. was subpar. I could personally go to ANY fast food restaurant chain and find better management. Especially the management in Provider Operations. You can learn from them. Learn how to be unproductive, unprepared & unprofessional. "
bad,Horrible mgmt not good horrible horrible horrible horrible. I would not recommend this company to anyone especially with the horrible mgmt. Insensitive.
bad,"The place was not great it was in Paris, TX the facility was infested with bed bugs, the area was uncomfortable to work in. I alerted the managers of the problem and the wouldn’t fix it. They jus kept working in the bed bugs. Also for a 8 hour shift we we given only a 30 min lunch break which we were being paid at $9 an hour. Just terrible leadership and organization."
bad,"Management is a joke and the culture is very high school . "
bad,"Empresa ruim de se trabalhar, não recebi meus direitos"
bad,This company had the best training and the best training environment. I moved through various different departments and did not have to be afraid to ask for help. I could depend on my company to know  my overall production at all times at my desk. They never ignored my overall contribution to the company. I trained all pharmacist and employees the main service of the job. I truly enjoyed and had passion for the job I was doing. I loved helping people with prescription because that is a central core value of our life when we get older and need someone to talk to....
bad,"This was a contract with the possibility of full time"
bad,"Very bad atmosphere to work in. No open opportunities for growing within the company. Everyone gets treated unequally. None of the employees are heard. Every opinion, thought given is pushed to the side."
bad,"Management has the largest turnover of any Fortune 500 company ever. I had 6 different supervisors during my employment there. Nurses were micro-managed to the extreme."
bad,I handled the newborn department and trained all the incoming employees on my team. I was never compensated and never acknowledged for all the hard work that I put in. The current manager is a terrible manager as she does not lead her team instead mocks other employees and comes in when she chooses. Morally I could not stay at this job as I don't get involved and it was so clicky that I had to leave. Just because someone has mastered something does not mean that he/she is going to serve as a good manager.
bad,Nothing good to say VPs and  Directors will cut your throat and  backstabbing. Can’t trust Human Resources  You  can’t trust anyone and must watch your back. Politics . Just work  and leave. People work hard and they are gone next day if they don’t like you.
bad,Horrible place to work... Overworked underpaid.. They don't care about office employees. Hippa violation.. Negligence to patients... Rude management...
bad,Very poor provider network and no real heart to change it. Very little support from home office generating leads. Hardest part of job was generating enough leads to make sales goals. With a poor doctor and provider network it made the job even more difficult.
bad,It was definately and experience. The overall company is great. As anywhere things could be better. But thankful for the opportunity. It was well worth the wait
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone applying there they have the worst communication skills I wouldn't want anyone else to waste their time the best thing to do is get your certificate and leave
bad,I was very disappointed with this company as they offered no training to staff. I understand that they are a new company but they could have been more supportive to new staff
bad,This was not the work environment to use my skills or attempt to grow.  Decisions could not be made which bread stress.  There was not a good company culture.  They outsourced a lot of jobs.
bad,Poor Management and no direction.  Terrible processes and zero guidance. Combative team members and lack of management support. Terrible systems and no direction to make any process improvements.
bad,"i have 4 years working at southern, i have learned so many things, first of all how to be patience. Patience with your job, being a medical assistant is not only taking vitals and drawing blood, is about creating a relationship with each patient by showing empathy, making the patient and yourself feel comfortable in any situation. The hardest part of the job was having multiple specialties in one day, beside a medical assistant i was also the medical receptionist, i had to register, take vitals, and discharge a patient. I will not say i had the best relationship with my co-workers because i take my job very serious and i do not go to make friends."
bad,">Receiving client schedule"
bad,I was hired along with several other people  (15) all doing orientation /training  that we were not paid for until we reached 40hrs which was nearly impossible being there were not enough clients to care for.  Was eager to be able to help those who needed it but was let down when nothing was available.
bad,Wellcare nashville is the worst company i have ever worked for. Its not like the wellcare offices in other states. This company does not keep employees longer than a year. Most will leave before training is over. The supervisors they have havent even been there a year because of how they treat/show they value their empolyees. They state you have opportuniy to receive raises but the management will team up and try to find every reason to not provide you with a raise when the time comes. The only handful of people who have been there over a year only received 9cents as their raise. Theres no opportunity for growth unless you would like to just become a team lead or supervisor. It has the worst management. The supervisors are micromanage and the customers you deal with are very unhappy because of this company.
bad,"Where do i start? At first (as with any job i assume) its happy fine and dandy. However as time goes by (not a lot of time btw just time) that's when things start to go south. Depending on which branch you work at you will be working practically by yourself. If you work at the other branches there will be other techs but it will be SUPER busy and stressful. You will NEVER get off on time. You'll be lucky if you get off close to the time you were supposed to get off. Not only will you not get off on time but you WILL NOT i repeat WILL NOT get paid overtime ever. Don't worry however because you as the tech will not be getting screwed over by yourself, the other pharmacists and techs will be getting screwed over too. So you won't feel used alone. :) Its a good place to get experience and test your limits. It is not a place to plan to stay. I have to say at the branch that i worked at the customers were THE BEST. They made working there bearable and even some of the pharmacist. I loved my customers and some of the pharmacists. As I said though it is not a place to stay. It is a place of experience."
bad,"not able to interact with others expect your client, no salary raise or benifits, helping out the client is a good feeling because you feel you did something nice for someone else."
bad,The company has management that does not protect the interest of field agents. It was frustrating because the product offered was not competitive enough and the sales goal was too high.
bad,Helped assisted member with Medicaid with their eligibility status sent out id cards and changed providers for them
bad,"Wellcare was one of the worst employers that I have ever worked with. Management did not value your opinions and stated ""That is the Wellcare way""."
bad,"I have learned a lot at WellCare about HCC coding requirements and find it a fun place to work, good work environment . Have met some really great people and we enjoy each others company and are very supportive of one another."
bad,"I enjoyed working for wellcare health plans; however, I know it would have been a better experience if I wasn't contracted by Teleperformance USA in Augusta, Georgia ---this place has a very high turn over rate and one employee was fired for eating a honey bun."
bad,"A wonderful place to work, very dedicated team working for common goals.  Support for upper management."
bad,WellCare of Texas leadership is reflective of an unprofessional manner. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,The pay is below industry standards. Human Resources does not exist. Management gives merit increases based on who they like not performance.
bad,This company is horrible. The management is horrible. The hours are horrible. The scheduling is horrible. There is no room for advancement. The employees are treated like dogs. I cannot wait to leave the company and find something better to do.
bad,"5 years in service and it's getting worse. The mere fact that they want to expand their clinic (to have additional branch) has been a priority. The management is out of focus to think that, rather than expand, why just focus on their currnt branches and make it a good renivation. Machines are not in good conditions. Ppor marketing strategies. The health workers their are just staff to them. So please don't even try to seek a job here. Low salary and too much stress because of the management."
bad,Company rather have new hires then keeping the people they have working. Think well about leaving your job to come here. Just to request a day off it is difficult.
bad,"The women managers are always competing with each other and they have no back bone! Alot of jealousy and envy, especially if your education supersedes management!"
bad,"I have never worked in such toxic culture, he is not there for employees. My manager wouldn't reply to my or my teams emails for up to a month.  She abused wfh policy, was never around. Very retaliated atmosphere. Manager was sleeping with a man she hired, never was reprimanded. Never have performance reviews."
bad,"All I can say is, I should have followed my first thoughts when I interviewed and decline any further interaction with WellCare. HR was horrible from pre-hire until I was planning to move on. I hadn’t resigned and my position was posted. Poor leadership. Poor structure."
bad,"I do not recommend this company. The trainer was very unprofessional, taking personal calls during training, and extremely rude, and incompetent. Director inflexible, and manager afraid of upper management."
bad,"The training was irrelevant to the position I had been hired to perform.  My supervisor had me start to see patients two weeks before the other trainees. The person identified for me to shadow never did the assessment and only spent 10 minutes with the patient, then could not sign onto her computer so did not show me how to document.  I was no my own after that ""training"".  "
bad,"Refuse to give P60 , P45 and references to anybody who wants to change the job. No paid holidays. Cheating with mileage. Must beg for every pay slip. Dishonest."
bad,I would get patients constantly complaining about being put on hold when trying to call the office. CNAs can often be place in very sketchy situations like wrong addresses that were never updated running around in circles until management finds out whats going on. Compensation is poor; $10 an hour but only while inside the house which you might go for 3  hours and have 2 houses😡..... pay per mile doesnt even being to cover what you actually spend driving from place to place even working more than 40 hours pay was miniscule at best very frustrating.
bad,Provider Communications under the Operations group is poorly managed by a VP and Director that do not care about his employees. tons of favoritism and lack of business Direction. Unethical practices are common and work life balance is minimal. STAY AWAY!
bad,Awful place to work.  As a nurse all they want is for the nurse to cut and paste and produce . The manager was awful  and her boss allows her to mistreat her employees .  She refers to them as children and has outbursts at the Chicago office where everyone can hear her.  Stay away if you are a nurse she is awful and no one is holding her accountable.  She is over the nurses working remotely who report to Tampa office.  They are looking foe a lot of nurses the training is nonexistent and they don’t care.  I am a seasoned nurse and the stress and humiliation was off the charts. stay away find something else not WellCare.
bad,"I worked with Wellcare via temp company. I immediately recognized if you didn't fit in the ""picture"" you were already a target for dismissal."
bad,They treat contractors like dirt.  Very political.  Very silo'd.  Your success is dependent on others that don't care about you. My friend was fired there.  He found out when he tried to logon remotely to work on a Friday night.  Classless.  Managers are a bunch of political animals that will cut you down in front of everyone to prove a point or get revenge.  They plead guilty to cheating Medicaid.
bad,"unstructured environment, poor  management staff. untrustworthy , dishonest, treat employee bad. manager come work with liquor on breath. terrible work place"
bad,"There is a level of expectancy towards changes within the work place as there is growth and in order to improve services. However, my work environment consistently demonstrated disorganization and confusion. Management were belittling to their employers through their mannerism in body language and verbal attacks. Hence, the team of nurses were left feeling  scrutinized, disrespected and humiliated."
bad,I would NEVER refer anyone to work for WellCare. Sr. Management allows favoritism to occur vs promotions being based on performance. HR/Employee Relations doesn't follow up on complaints either.
bad,"Worked as both a temp and a full time employee for over a year. Problem with management, HR, computers and unrealistic expectations. "
bad,"Wellcare goes through employees like water. There were 40 people in the training class and fewer than 8 made it past training. Employees are temp to hire, but most quit during that time frame. IF they make it through, they have to re-apply and go through a 2nd 90 day trial before they are hired! So they go 6 months--half a YEAR-- in temp status with no benefits. Every single minute of the day is scrutinized and reps have to submit an""exception"" form, accounting for any minute they are not on the phone. Reps are constantly criticized over calls for the most ridiculous reasons. They are given a weekly ""report card"" analyzing every second of every call."
bad,"WellCare lacks integrity, ethics and professionalism.   They offer no diversity in senior leadership, operate under racist beliefs, all while targeting the diverse population to make their leadership time wealthy.  They have a revolving door and don't try to retain good employees.  They bait you with the ""potential"" bonus but haven't paid bonuses in quite some time.   They are losing contracts and the FBI should be looking into their practices.  Upper management will lie and throw lower level employees under the bus to save their own jobs.  This company is simply HORRIBLE.   They pile on the work, offer no support and have no processes in place."
bad,"This employer had over a 75% staff turn-over rate, the organisational culture was very toxic and the management structure is very top heavy and fostered a culture of bullying.  I would not recommend this employer."
bad,"As a Complex Care Case Manager, I collaborate in the process of assessment, planning, facilitation and advocacy for options and services to meet a member’s individual benefit plan and/or health needs while promoting optimal, cost-effective outcomes. My case load consists of Medicare/Medicaid eligible members with complex medical conditions and co-morbidities such as Diabetes, CHF, CAD, Asthma, COPD and Mental Illness. I make referrals as needed to an extensive network of health care resources such as Primary Care Physicians, Specialists, Therapists, Hospitals, Rehab Centers and community resources.  I am proficient in the use of all Microsoft Office software: Window, Outlook, Word, Excel, Access, Power Point as well as several health care programs such as Case Tracker and EMMA. I have been train on Interqual and Milliman Utilization Management tools. I work on a computer/Internet daily, switching between multiple programs and screens for more efficient time management. I have been a preceptor for new hires."
bad,"Management in certain regions lacks knowledge. Micromanaging supervisor who lacks critical thinking skills. Due to direct supervisor being unknowledgeable staff members suffered. Certain staff where chosen as favorites. Unethical behavior by staff members. Work life balance was not offered to some staff members. Daily changes to work processes that do not make sense.Worst "
bad,"Nothing is as it seems. The corporate cultures is to get as much work as they can out of the employee while they give as little as they can to the Members. Its all about profit!  Management is unethical, Supervisors are abusive and Human Resources ignores the problems. Turnover is high, burnout even higher and their greatest gimmick is appearing to pay well, but creating expectations that can't be met without 10 to 20 hours of overtime a week. Case Managers are exempt and getting no overtime, so Wellcare breaks labor laws and gets away with it."
bad,This is mainly for the results companies in Lakeland fl. They don’t preform thorough background checks or drug tests. They don’t ask for proof of high school education or equivalent. Management is unprofessional and ethnically biased. They put that you will make 12 an hour starting pay but once hired you only receive 9.50 hourly. All supervisors have their phones on theproduction floor which is a HIPAA violation.
bad,"Toxic culture in the office. Bullying, favoritism,  and overall dysfunction in management staff made for an extremely stressful work environment. The job itself was not very difficult but the management made it miserable."
bad,"Cliques, gossip, managers talk to you in a degrading manner HR too!!!! Micro management, if your 3 min late from lunch or break due to their system issues you’re held responsible JUST RUNNNNN"
bad,"Do you like to work under Extreme micromanagement? If so, this is the place for you! Doesn't matter how well you do your job, you will be under a microscope."
bad,"There is a lack of respect and professionalism from office manager. She yelled at the nurse, in  front of the rest of the nurses. They say they will call clients back and do not, clients are wondering if they will receive services. I had to call my client several times to let her know i wasn't coming."
bad,"Absence of proper training. No flexibility and understanding during personal hardships. Incompetent, cold and indifferent management. Rude and humiliating coworker. Stay away- my health severely deteriorated and I even was hospitalized because of high stress levels in the team, daily humiliation by a coworker and lack of training which lead to hard hit on my wellbeing and health. I can't wait till last day here so I will never see the disgusting teammates face anymore. It's a nightmare in my life which  really hope is coming to an end. I don't wish these sufferings to anyone that's why i'm sharing it all here to warn kind people from getting into aggressive inhumane atmosphere."
bad,"The absolute worst job I have ever had. Training is nonexistent. Management is so in over their heads. It’s revolving door. If you have any sense of professionalism, compassion, or common sense, you will be unhappy here."
bad,"I love working with my clients, I been with them for 2 years! the hardest part is the company I work for! they don't have it together! and they can pay a lot better!"
bad,"Worse than Game of Thrones, meaning management is deceptive, manipulative and unprofessional in all respects.  Avoid at all costs at least until present management is gone."
bad,"Poor Management, low morale, and absolutely no support from upper management what-so-ever. There are better health insurance organizations in the Tampa Bay area that have better compensation and overall work culture."
bad,its like high school with adults all the supervisors are terribly biased it doesnt matter how hard you work if you dont kiss up you dont move up management sucks and it depends on whos buddy you are as to which rules you have to follow hated that place
bad,No job security. RFP and this will be over. I do not approve how management does not help with employee relations. It seems like the director do not have a backbone.
bad,"Upper management does not support you nor is there room for growth. HR only supports management. The sales department management team is unprofessional. Upper management has affairs with staff and promote them into positions they are not qualified for and HR overlooks it."
bad,The benefits are extremely poor. The company suffers from a lack of communication and functional areas operate in silos.
bad,"The company is only focused on the enrollment aspect of the business. This your typical sales environment, numbers, numbers, numbers, but it doesn't strive on customer satisfaction. The company has a very poor corporate structure and the management needs new leadership skills. The overall experience was very stressful."
bad,There isn't any pay raises and management favors people as well. There isn't any advancement in the company at all. The communication between management and the employees isn't great either.
bad,The change in management was a very bad move. The manager didn't know her job and what it took for us to complete our job. Too much micro managing. No opportunity for advancement. You were penalized if you stated to anyone there was a problem within your department.
bad,"I was so excited to work there and everyone I knew that did, loved it.  When I got in there it didn't take long to realize that you get what you want based on who you know, not your qualifications."
bad,"They pay pennies and the want a lot of experience.  The worth part of it is that upper management doesn't care... If you have an ounce of common sense that is count and use against you..from the manager, the Director and the VIp of the dept they don give a S about there employees."
bad,"Not worth it. It’s one of those case studies that concludes that it does not matter how much you get paid it is not enough for the work, stress and horrible folks who run after the next bonus and will do anything and I mean anything to get it. I’ve worked at fortune 200 before but there is something rotten here"
bad,"I didn’t get a chance to work here and I’m thanking my lucky stars, I didn’t. I went on a job interview and the people on the panel interviewing me had a chip on their shoulder, they had no idea what to ask as if they had just started their position. Turns out, they were brand new to their position. Very unprofessional. The atmosphere was the least bit professional."
bad,This is a terrible place to work. Morale is low and there isn't a sense of community. There is little or no opportunity for advancement and the same people keep getting promoted over and over again. Management takes all the credit for your work and is not willing to acknowledge your efforts or pitch in and help out. No teamwork and all departments work in silos.
bad,Horrible environment. Monkeys run the circus. Constant change of management. Management prefer the liars and manipulators. Even lower  management is not safe. Micro managed and under mined.
bad,Poor Management  with  entrenched members in key positions that keep the company from becoming much more then what it currently is. Current brain trust is abandoning the company for better position at other companies.
bad,"Discriminatory pay between males and females. Shady compliance standards.  Terrible work life balance and inhumane work hours expectations for salary personnel. "
bad,"WellCare pays well, but because of the hours you have to work as a management employee, it's not enough.  The expectation is to give give and give some more of you until you are running on empty."
bad,I worked there for 9yrs and decied to change departments boy what a mistake that was. I have never been written up before I went to the appeals department and was fired a year later for a BS reason. If you are not a brown nose tattle tail then you will not last in the appeals department and don't let me get started on the management  they are worthless and have no clue how to run a department and treat there employees also the HR department is worthless to they do not support the employees it's a shame because they got rid of one they highest producing in employees in the department because I wasn't a butt kisser and problem starter. So my advise to anyone that is looking to work for WellCare...DONT DO IT
bad,"Worked here for 6 months, during these 6 months I suffered from stress, anxiety and other health complications. Management is horrible, they do not know how to do their jobs and expect you to do it for them, especially in the credentialing department. Anyone trying to apply for this department, save your self the stress and don't do it!"
bad,Typically want and demand more than possible without working 60 hours per week. Try another company.This is a huge mistake
bad,"If you are a caring person THIS company is not for you, they will decieve you at the drop of a hat, and they show overt favoritism ."
bad,WellCare could be a great company to work for but that hasn't been my experience. There are so many issues that are simply ignored by all levels of management. This is the only place I've ever worked where most of the employees are waiting to post out in hopes that the whole company isn't screwed up.
bad,The Wellcare Jacksonville NC office was very disorganized. The manager was hard to get in the phone and when she was on the phone she was very rude to clients family member and workers. Did not find coverage for scheduled days off and was very difficult to work with. I did love working with my patient and the pay was great.
bad,"With the Centene acquisition, let's hope they get rid of the Lead Gen team in Tampa. They are useless and always passing the buck onto other teams, finagling excuses for why nothing gets done. Deadlines are never met and our team is stuck because of it. The manager treated my friend like sh*! for being a responsible employee and taking the initiative for wanting to learn her job. Hopefully this acquisition will take care of the employees who have been there for years and simply exist to get a paycheck while ignoring and penalizing new hires for their talent and experience."
bad,Leaders are self motivated and self-serving. This is the most disorganized and unprofessional company that I have ever encountered in 30 years of nursing.
bad,"I along with several others were laid off in January 2019. Here it is 6 mo later 450 applications, I still haven't found employment.  This is traumatizing and just terrible! They gave us a 2 week paycheck and that was it! No warning! Its horrible as I am a single parent and would think as a permanent employee within the UM dept that we would have been treated way better than we were.  Just Terrible!"
bad,"No work life balance.  Case Management is salaried and they expect you to work overtime in order to meet their highly unrealistic expectations.  Way too mangers and supervisors but that’s just because they like to micromanage everything you do, down to when you can take your vacations.  Highly recommend staying as far away from case management as you can.  Have heard better things from others I. Different departments"
bad,Absolutely no work life balance.  Would receive emails and text at 11 pm.  Our staff was cut in half when Wellcare took over.  It was impossible to keep up with the paperwork that you were expected to do.   The atmosphere in company was to throw someone under the bus before you ended up there.   Went to employee relations  for help and was told maybe I should call mental health line.
bad,"This company is about as employee friendly as a Georgia chain gang. Expect to be worked to death with insane deadlines and impossible, nonsensical quotas. Training is a travesty as in you are set up for failure from day 1. Quite literally it is the Tower of Babel in respect to using criteria data sets for pre-authorizations - everyone citing/doing something different. No two clinical personnel were ever on the same page. Non-clinical types making clinical decisions (!!!???) I had forged a career of cleaning up inappropriate decisions along with other people’s messes. "
bad,I will never give recommendations to anyone to work here. Upper management lies and hr backs than up without doing their homework.Wellcare likes to layoff employees that are in fmla. Wellcare needs to learn their laws.
bad,"You are paid per visit and expected to case manage over 60 patients, many hours spent on documentation on patients you have not seen as weekend nurse admitted and putting orders in for your patients as lpn are not allowed to do this. Scheduling is such that rn only do oasis events and lpns get all the regular visits they will have 20 patients a day while you have 1 and the pay is based on pay per visit but this is considered a full time job???"
bad,"Although I think WellCare strives to be a good company, local management gives them a bad name. The leadership is very poor and benefit consultants are set up for failure. There is little in-office training, and if you struggle to make your numbers, you are weeded out instead of encouraged or assisted to increase your sales. "
bad,"Communication is confusing and difficult to aquire; difficult to get people to show up for meetings; no real, consistent support from upper management"
bad,Wellcare need to better there management team and leadership. The company on a hold is poorly ran and not managed properly.
bad,"Worked with this company over 2 years. A lot if politics in the manhattan office and favoritism. The nursing staff was excellent however many of the supervisors do play favoritism and in spite of the zero retaliation policy. They will "" create"" something to pay you back for a complaint to the higher ups in the company."
bad,We lost the state funding. Jobs were terminated. I headed a team of 24 reps The job was challenging. The company as a whole is a great company to work for.
bad,"While in training I was just put next to another representative to shadow, however, they did not explain what or how they were navigating the system. I was thrown into the position and left to fend for myself.."
bad,"It's all about production,  production, production, how many Authorizations you get done in a day, the phones are constantly ringing back to back. Provider offices are supposed to fax or send in request via Web however they do what they want and call in with their requests and that's why the phones are back to back constantly ringing! Everything has to be written up to medical director which takes time to do.. And you are rushed and stressed to get your work done plus answer the phones! You are micromanaged to where they schedule your lunch and break times! Insane! High turn over, nobody stays long in this department long.. They either quit or transfer to another department."
bad,A typical day at work consists of taking inbound calls from members. The hardest part is locating the correct depart for the random calls that come in through the queue.
bad,"Its a nice place to work for some people. I found that the HR team was not not very supportive when I suffered a violent attack during my time working there. I saw many people who got promotions for just being friendly with upper managment. When I was harrassed at work my manager wasn't helpful nor was the HR department. I faced retaliation and suffered from panic attacks while working there. Like I said it's a ncie place to work for ""some"" people."
bad,"The Baton Rouge office is proven to be non supportive and unorganized. The training that you're told you'll receive during the interview is nonexistent for the field, especially as an entry level consultant.  However, you are offered compliance modules during the first two weeks. You're also expected to do unethical things to ""write someone up.""  If you are expecting support from upper management - don't expect it. They will set you up to fail by placing you in unproductive areas and not offering any solutions. If you question their behaviors or their constant promises that aren't kept - expect backlash through write ups, dissension between other employees and ridiculous requests. Quite frankly it's a job position where you make your numbers and go home and try to be as stress free as possible.  Providers are also pulling out of the network and it's affecting the enrollment process."
bad,"Work load heavy, mandatory overtime with short notice. Micromanagement is strong and very present, breaks are not long enough nor is lunchtime."
bad,"Make promises they do not keep, overwhelming working environment, very stressful, salaried position that pays 40 hours weekly however you work at least 60 hours weekly just to keep Up with your assignments"
bad,"In the beginning this was a great company to work for, then management changed and moral is low. and a very stressful environment to work under. The pro for working for them is good benefits and good yearly compensations."
bad,"The staff there is unfriendly and rude. They verbally abuse you, and supervisors give out personal information to other employees. Since working there I have been in a fist fight and I have had to get a restraining order on another co worker. I would not recommend a dog to work there."
bad,Management is beyond unprofessional. They need training for management to help understand your daily routine and what’s is needed and expected!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Monitor and evaluate incoming call volume in a call center. Responsible for balancing and allocating incoming call volume with the hardest part being when call volume was extremely high and trying to allocate calls in a very short time."
bad,"This was definitely a challenging position, but as I previously said I liked to be challenged at work. I'm excellent at multi-tasking as well as good organizational skills which was an absolute must with this position. It was non-stop from the moment I walked in the door to the time I left. I answered all incoming phone calls, handled CAP billing, interviewed all CNA's and PCA's that applied, while ensuring all the scheduling was done also and without error. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I could call a patient and tell them I've found and aide to come out and help you and I could hear the relief in their voice."
bad,"Worked for Wellcare for going on six years. Observed multiple unfair, hostile interactions between middle management and staff ."
bad,its community sales job ...helping uninsured ..... stressful work ...prob. not suitable for family person. 
bad,"after being sanctioned wellcare retained its top employees, after getting the green light they laid us all off. They kept employee's who were related to them. They did not pay us the retention bonus promised."
bad,I like the people/staff they are very accommodating. My supervisor is cool and very hardworking. I had a good experience in this company most especially dealing with the customers.
bad,"Very busy, healthcare. Insurance is not good. They are very unorganized"
bad,"dont go here. Your benefits get cut the  same day you leave, and false promises are given. Their training is awful.They lack staff.Everyone is on their on here."
bad,"The company on a whole is great, the people they put in place as managers, do not listen to their workers."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is doing 2-3 marketing events, no matter the weather (cold/ hot/ rain etc.). You are valued according to what you produce. If you don't make your numbers you are threaten to get fired."
bad,"WellCare does not pay well or even competitively for the amount of work, HIPAA compliance, or lack of flexibility. I don't participate in the benefits plan because there is not enough pay to afford the benefits."
bad,"The company has very poor leaders and changes so much there is no mission. The cut throat culture leads to clicks like high school, and there is little honest direct feedback given. Though the company preaches otherwise. Also volunteer time is like a sales pitch and is pretty much forced on staff."
bad,"The company poorly communicated with clinicians/RNs.  There was favoritism within company.  Pay was good but required driving to remote areas/other counties, which added tremendous amounts of miles on my car.  They did not offer any pay raises, additional support."
bad,Very very poor management in UM Care coordinators and very very poor management overall. Supervisor think they can say anything without consequences. They don’t follow up. They don’t even know the processes. They will set you up for failure if they don’t like you.
bad,I would go out to visit patients in their homes and fill mediplanners and med dispensers and I also would educate on medications.  wound care wound vac and administering IV antibiotics.  I would do a full body assessment and determine if pt needed further eval and talk to doctors by phone and if need be send to ER.  The problem with this company they offered no benefits  I paid for gas and phone and wear and tear on my vechile and they offered nothing in return.  The best part was spending time with the patients
bad,"Too many bosses, no care for their employees. Too much favoritism. You will hate your life if you work for wellcare. Very unprofessional company that only cares about making money and not about patients or employees. The only reason wellcare is a 5 star company is because they change the oasis assessments to verify pnt improvements."
bad,"Pay is slightly better than average. Stress is low. But the price one pays is mind-numbing. People who work here are morons who spend a month on their Halloween costumes, Nobody really knows what is going on and management is secretive. A top-heavy corporate culture with no excitement and dead-end advancement opportunities. People guard their phony-baloney jobs like a mother bear. Good for a few months (they do offer overtime) but you will die slowly if you work here for more than a few months."
bad,Laid off after 2 months in the company. Mangers didn’t care about my family or lack of income if I’m laid off . I tried to reach out to my manager and she ignored my calls. Very hurtful.
bad,They expect too much from their employees and refused to at for the hours worked. They had trouble paying their employees without the checks bouncing due to lack of funds in their bank accounts. Some of their doctors were unreliable and caused employees to quit due to their over-demanding issues and rude comments to the medical assistants.
bad,Day started with a quick team meeting with your Manager. Job function was to enroll families within the health plan. Create/ attend events to educate potential members about the benefits of the health plan. At the time there were 6 other plans offering additional benefits to families receiving the All Kids Medical card. 90% of the job was independent but however you were able to partner with someone on your team. The hardest pat of the job was trying to convince a person the join the health plan after they have explained the issues they've had in the past. What I enjoyed most about my job was educated those less fortunate and being able to truly help those in need.
bad,"I was hired for a particular position, but they didn't receive the contract they were suppose to, HR rep asked me to resign from company and I refused. So they made my time at the company miserable."
bad,Hope you like being called in the middle of the night when three people are unable to connect to WIFI. No work/life balance. Managers hire and promote friends over more qualified personnel.
bad,"WellCare Health Plans provides an excellent service to people who need it.  It also takes everything you have to give and more and does not respect the work life balance."
bad,I enjoyed managing my staff of 24 and always learning new things.
bad,HIGH TURNOVER! Highest turnover I personally ever witnessed. None stop MANDATORY overtime. Favoritism and unfair treatment. The high turnover should be a sign that something is critically wrong but it apparently is just business as usual. 90% of the staff is new because everyone who has been there 6months plus has either quit from burnout or Transferred to a different department. Keep in mind you must work in a position 9 months before you can transfer
bad,WellCare is a managed care company based out of Tampa Florida. They offer the are a bare minimum for the Medicaid and Medicare advantage plan products in terms of customer benefit.
bad,"no real formal training, also becoming top heavy with upper management. HR department understaffed/undertrained. For a large corporation still working with a 'mom and pop' attitude. IT department is 3rd rate, unable to keep up with system enhancements"
bad,Poor Management and lack of communication. Does not provide flexibility and low staff morale. High turnovers due to the lack of flexibility. Great co-workers!
bad,"Manager blamed the failure of the project on consultants even though the business had many years of failure with this annual business process. At one point I had 7 days to complete a database before the deadline and I was not provided with data for the database until 4 days after the database was due, so of course the project was late."
bad,Immature IT Department Development with a lack of IT Governance.There was a lack of IT Strategy and alignment with the Business. There was high turnover
bad,Management will overload employees with work so burnout happens often and company wide. Many employees are too stressed to enjoy work and home/work balance is unheard of.
bad,"The job in itself was ok, the training could have been done better, was not very informative, they didn't seem to want to help very much when it came down to it."
bad,"I was a contractor at WellCare otherwise if you are regular employee you are not treated with respect.  Employees I knew in IT and other business areas felt unappreciated and were expected to do more leg work than contractors and make lower salary.  I would never become a full time employee at WellCare and avoided their offers.  If you are of the right 'culture' meaning not a US born citizen, then you are treated very well there and have opportunities, otherwise you are just a cog in their wheel until they decide to force you out or have a dept wide layoff.  They have layoffs every other year and have lost a lot of good people being replaced with less desirable workers.  It's terrible how this company has gone downhill just in the few years i was there.  Stay away from WellCare unless you are a contractor - then work the hours, take the pay and run to a better company."
bad,I get my job done everyday. I learned to read claims. the co workers are workers. the most enjoyable part of my job was speaking to my customers. the hardest part was none..
bad,"Family friendly, management could be better, need more people instead of one person doing multiple jobs"
bad,"Hard working and Flexible"
bad,"Case Management (telephonic) from home is nice...for a little while. The lack of human contact, that one would have in an office setting,really matters. In addition, this position would be improved by having CM's visit the clients. "
bad,Management not really in tune with what should be done to help employees move forward. HR is not really helpful when it comes to advancement.
bad,The employees are wonderful to work with. The management can be difficult and make you feel like they feel threatened by you and seek to stop advancement
bad,"Very high paced days, must be on the go from early in the morning until daily quota was met."
bad,"WellCare was not interested in promoting from within but rather maxed the budget on new hires who were not qualified for their positions. This leaves the employees who have the experience and have been there to pick up the slack, even if their own pay and title is significantly lower. This creates poor morale and the feeling of being less valued. Mid-level management is not empowered to make this right."
bad,Very very poor management in LTC Care coordinator area and very very poor management overall. Supervisor think they can say anything without consequences. They don’t follow up. They don’t even know the processes. They will set you up for failure if they don’t like you. If you are not a favorite you are mirco managed and extremely stressed. You will be made to look incompetent. Manager without any compassion.
bad,"I work at Teleperformance for WellCare"
bad,"As a Field Case Manager, I was given 64 cases from the start. Most of which were incomplete and out of compliance. They do not assign cases in your living area. I covered Hudson, Union, Middlesex, Bergen, and Passaic counties.I live in yet another county. I spent so much time on the road, there wasn't much time for documention, hence, working 18hrs/day and weekends to catch up. Time limits to complete assessments. Simple assessments took about 4+ hours to complete. Yearly assessments 8+ hours. When you have to see patients every 3 months, it's way too much. Computer systems constantly going down."
bad,"Stressful, management is all over the place, nothing is as it seems! You will be laid off/terminated without notice, with no valid reason. Assistance is lacked in a business plan to help you advance in the company. Favoritism is at a all time high, so positions are given based on who you know and not what you know."
bad,If you don't mind a supervisor that comes in late and leaves early on a daily basis. Along with being treated like a child with reprimands. Also the playing of favorites then this is a great place to work.
bad,"The best part of working here was working from home. Otherwise, very stressful, poorly managed, and no employee appreciation. The interview wasmisleading."
bad,"This company allows you to work your hours however you like as long as you have 7.5 per day or 40hrs per week.  The downside is that since everyone works different schedules, it can sometimes be difficult to communicate."
bad,"A lot of strong leadership titles, without the skill backing. Leadership does not seem to listen to the concerns of the ones that are actually on the  phone with the members and taking calls from providers. The hardest part about the job of knowing how to be successful, but no support to make it a reality. Very threatening environment."
bad,"WellCare has an HR problem. Hiring and development of associates is immature. Interviews don't target skills, they instead focus on personality. This has led to a company full of nice people who can't do their job. "
bad,"The Tennessee office for WellCare is only for health services. Unless you have an RN degree, you have no options to move up with the company. It is a dead end job. The company only cares about their CMS star rating, which is only 2.5 out of 5 stars by the way, and cares nothing for the growth or the morals and ethics of their employees. Don't waste your time."
bad,I really enjoyed working with patients in a variety of settings.  The company does not care about or care for their employees.  Very numbers /money driven.
bad,To many visits daily has compromise quality of care. Company takes on to many clients for the money with no concern for staff. If you want to finish these visits and chart in the home you will find so many of the staff are cutting corners to keep management happy.
bad,"They are micro management at its worse. Its all about the numbers, not what is best for the potential member. They are smart enough to ask you to do unethical things verbally, not written. They create a hostile environment, playing staff against each other. They create an atmosphere that seems to set you up for failure and if you question them you immediately have a target on your back."
bad,"very stressful work environment, expectations set you up for failure, huge turnover, hard to keep employees and supervisors constantly change so you have no relationship with upper management."
bad,"Poor management, promotions are based on favoritism rather than skills. Work load is heavy. High turnover rate. Coworkers are experienced and hard working individuals"
bad,"Over all has good potential to become a stellar company. However, they have major issues with organization and protocols and too many forms to fill out for everything. There doesn't seem to be any"
bad,Do to the frequent changes in executive management it has created a culture of survival of the fitness with middle management.   Supervisors do not contribute to improvement as they are very robatic in responses and they do not question illogical directives. There is no voice to the associate staff workers. Constant change in processes. Poor to no communications between departments. Members are constantly complaining about misinformation when enrolled into their plan and lack of service from their plan.
bad,"I do not recommend, there is mass confusion on every level."
bad,I worked with providers to help solve any issues they may have been having with any claims or education.I would travel to different locations to assist as needed.
bad,"The business partners are great to work with and knowledgeable in respective subject areas. The business personnel are friendly and easy to work with. The business teams work hard to compensate for the IT department's poor performance, IT management ethics and lack of accountability."
bad,"I worked for DME and the boss was not approachable, she never had a smile on her face unless you were tattling on someone to her and forget if you asked questions that was a NONO....The money is good but not worth the evilness in this place. I think corporate needs to reevaluate there staff. Its unfair and discriminating. It does not pay to be nice and do your job. If your not involved in drama your not in."
bad,Could have states streamlined states  to one specific nurse   area.
bad,They pay was great. I had a cubical and There was a gym in the building.
bad,"Over 25 years of consistent professional experience in the insurance industry also advertising combined with administrative skills. Call centers and outside sales, B2B. Strong background in administrative enviornments and coordination of office administration and information management."
bad,learn as much as you can and then develop a plan to leave. Take your skills and knowledge to another organization.
bad,"The local office has good people, but management has been poor. Ethics have been a problem -- fined by government regulators. And there have been problems with sales commissions being accurate. Upside: Outside sales people can set their own hours and earn good money with just a high school diploma."
bad,"Daily stress for several years. If you are perfect you can advance. Very difficult to keep up with all the changes  Very boring and unsatisfying work. Felt like a robot. No personal satisfaction. Very high expectations and difficult to meet. If you like staring at a screen all day, you’ll be fine. Must meet a quota of denials. This job is very bad your physical and mental health. A lot of unnecessary busy work that keeps healthcare cost high and CEO’s rolling in money. Soul-sucking job."
bad,"Managed by intimidation....enough said! Instead of training....just do it! I need to say Associates mostly awesome, management.....poor, poor, poor.....manager spent time taking selfies for social media and intimidating workers..."
bad,I worked as a care manager for the pediatric population and loved the work and working with families of complex needs children. I learned a lot about available resources and how to identify needs.
bad,This is the wrong company. Wellcare home health. It is a home health company not an insurance company. Work life balance is poor. Pay is great. Management not willing to train properly.
bad,While working at WellCare under contract it was apparent tat WellCare doesn't value their it people as it is majority contracted so that they can easily fire the contractors when needed.
bad,it seems as though the day to day operations at this company are a struggle. Beyond the confusion there is a huge disconnect between management and the employees
bad,WellCare is a fine company with growth  opportunities when it comes to management. Human Relations doesn't respond or follow up with their employees which allows Management to set their own rules.
bad,"Good company if you need a flexible schedule.  Wellcare offers cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first aid training. If you are a floater, they provide driving mileage pay."
bad,"Micromanaged by lower management. Little/no training education, Job Work/life very unbalance. change the position/ salary/ location not with the agency"
bad,"The pay is not bad for the little amount of skills and work required but this is not an enjoyable job. There are mainly two reasons for this that I observed: 1. The management is not great. They have unskilled and unqualified individuals working in management positions that really shouldn't be. 2. The position itself is just not enjoyable. Your answering calls from people who are angry because their services have been cut, or because we no longer carry their provider, or whatever the issue may be and there isn't really much you can do about it."
bad,"Very innovative company and it's great helping clients get jobs in a global market. Everyone is professional & positive to work with. The relaxed work environment allows working remote sometimes, which was awesome for saving on gas and on bad weather days."
bad,"Very stressful work environment, poorly compensated, unreal expectations  mid-level management ok, upper management difficult to approach, location is convenient"
bad,working for wellcare was changeling as Wellcare was on the bottom of the pole as far as Medicare Advantage plans . It was very hard to sell for members as the other Medicare Plans .
bad,Your personal experience with the company will depend on who you associate with in the company.     Great managers in other departments and locations.
bad,"I enjoyed the time with most of my coworkers but the culture is not one I would recommend. Wellcare is Interdependently dysfunctional meaning instead of catering to it's members, departments are only trying to cover up mistakes and blaming each other for the companies shortcomings."
bad,work with customers translate from spanish to english for the pharmacist. i learn how to work with the new casher machine. also i learn how to work with the computer. i enjoy my workers we were very friendly. enjoy working with them.
bad,The company is too production oriented and the workload is too much for the amount per department. The company has great benefits but there is too much favoritism on the part of the Supervisors and Directors for advancement and promotions.
bad,I feel like this company could be a great one if the teamwork was there. They value production over quality of work which is unfortunate.
bad,I did not like my job it was boring and unchallenging. Attempted to change positions numerous times however to no avail. Company gives rewards such as gift cards and free lunches often.  Easy work but long days.
bad,"•	Assist in Daily Living Activities( Mobility, Toileting, Bathing, Dressing)"
bad,"Management is not good"
bad,"Hard working sales people, that work under management that barely work at all."
bad,"Although I enjoyed the job itself, doing sales assistant duties and running an entire office as the administrator on site, the manager at this job made it very difficult to stay. I enjoyed helping the sales representatives and customers very much, and I enjoyed getting my work done on the computer, of being in charge of making sure the office ran smoothly, and the work hours."
bad,"Extreme problems with management, no one in this company is on the same page. Its a good business but needs better leadership."
bad,WellCare's management does not support the associates and the culture is that the management team is fully supported by HR so they do not have to adhere to the behavior model.
bad,CMS has a lot of improvements to make. The company overall is a good company but CMS is a new division of WellCare and doesn't quite have it together yet. The caseloads are ridiculous and some of the duties the care managers are doing are administrative and need to be deligated a different way. Because care managers are in the field some of the goals and duties are unrealistic. The department could stand to restructure the model to make it more conducive to better productivity and work-life balance. The potential to be good is there but not yet.
bad,They are unethical and unprofessional! Their training is extremely unorganized right now and they can’t keep up with the high volume of members that they have taken on with their new contract! They have unrealistic expectations. Management doesn’t know what they’re doing. Everything is all over the place and changing constantly! High turnover.
bad,Stressful Merger with horrible acquisition management. The credentialing department is under new horrible management. I would not recommend working there until they clean their act up.
bad,The job atmosphere is very stressful and management is not good with helping employees when needed. The communication between management is not very well.
bad,Opportunity to increase my health care experience. Enjoyed working with several experienced health care individuals; Operations and Health Service teams.Internal organization changes impact business support and growth opportunities.
bad,"Worked with some very caring and compassionate people, but it seems management is focused on the numbers not the care.  A typical day in our office would be to take on 20-30 new referrals, with not enough skilled staff to care for them.  Phone calls would have be placed to referring MD offices to get new orders for OT evals either the next week or the week after.  The same with PT/MSW/psych nursing, etc.  Love that my clinicians truly care about their patients, but hate that care has to be delayed until openings in clinicians schedule allow another eval or visit."
bad,As the company continues to grow so do the challenges to keep up with the growth.
bad,"I am working for this company out of need only at this time. Hired beneath my experience and pay grade, with no room for growth or development based on the above."
bad,"Like most large companies, there are areas that are not held accountable and cause delay and additional work. However, it's a reasonable place to work. I personally did not have a good manager. He was controlling and egotistical, but that did not affect my decision to leave. I left because I received a better opportunity with new technology."
bad,"I worked a 12 hour shift for Wellcare, Partime and Fulltime. The daily work schedule was relaxed. I enjoyed Private Duty Nursing. The scheduling was good. The hours were long and I didn't always get out on time."
bad,"When I first began working at WellCare, I thought it was going to be a wonderful company and a little at a time, I have come to realize that they do not care about our patients. They are all just a number to them. I spend long hours on the road and long hours charting."
bad,Could be a great place to work but senior management has a shoot the messenger mentality.  You won't go anywhere if you aren't friends with senior ledership regardless of skill set.  Women don't do well in Infrastructure.
bad,Had one of the worst work experiences here. The environment was dull and the whole experience was one that I would want to forget about. Luckily I went to college and was able to forget about this entire job experience.
bad,Upper management makes lots of uninformed and unrealistic expectations.  Technology is ages behind which makes for more difficult documentation and poor audits. Raises are weighted heavily on audits and never on how you helped serve the members or the differences you’ve made.
bad,"""Pass the Buck"" should be this companies slogan. Because no one knows the answer, they just pass on to the next incompetent person. Management is terrible."
bad,"Management doesn't "
bad,"Wellcare is a government sponsored health insurance company,and provides comprehensive care management to members which is an excellent service-However the case load is unsustainable case for a 40 hour week, poor technology, and a constantly changing business structure."
bad,"The more hours you work, the better they perceive you. Quality of work does not matter. Back stabbing is rewarded, cronyism is preferred. Single parents beware."
bad,This job does offer a salary with great compensation along with gas and mileage reimbursement. Downfall is the management will let you go if you are not making them money Regardless of all the work you have done for them and all the months you exceeded your quota.
bad,"this creates a chaotic, unstable environment in terms of training and performance standards."
bad,"Supervisors, Managers, and Dir of Clinical Services all believe humiliation, bullying, and smart aleck attitudes are the way to ""manage"" staff. Consistently overworked, embarrassed, and one email will have been cc'ed to at least 5 others! Worse than ever!!"
bad,I subscribe to the philosophy if you have nothing nice to say......
bad,I loved my clients but the management was horrible one of the managers were sweet & humble but the other had a very nasty attitude and was very rude but I loved my job I just want a better environment to work
bad,Promotes work-life balance...expectation is to work long hours and no way to refuse.  Promote advancement and professional development - none to be delivered on.
bad,"There is a great deal of variation between departments in how the company is to work for. In my department, people were over worked and underpaid with few perks, while elsewhere it was much different. Our management was very secrative and underhanded, while pretending to be transparent about everything. For instance, there was a big change that directly impacted our workload, which was in the works for over a month, and departmental management did not see fit to inform us until 4 hours after it had gone live. There have been other cases where people were brought on or let go without any warning or preparation taking place and everyone is left to scramble as to how to manage the workload."
bad,"At this company, you have to ask the right questions in order to get the information you need. It isn't just given to you. You need to be prepared for change and long work hours.However, there is a sense of teamwork, which is nice. You must follow all the rules meticulously or be prepared to be called out on it,"
bad,"Management changes like the Florida weather.  It is unfortunate that nurses in CM and UM are struggling to care for members when their mangers are stretched so thin they cannot come up for air.  "
bad,They don't value their good employees. Quick turn around. Able to request PTO. Leadership will target certain employees. Love the work but management not so much.
bad,Best part of the job flexible hours for work/ life balance.  Coworkers are friendly.  No room for career growth.  Company is mis-managed and un-organized.  Great for someone who thoroughly loves sales and will work very long hours and in bad neighborhoods to gain them.
bad,"Morale very low among entry level workers. Awesome co-workers. Company policies are not enforced equally, some middle managers enforce rules in accordance with company policy while others do not. This often leads to some workers feeling that they are been unfairly targeted."
bad,My best day at work is when I resolved the members issue in a first call resolution and they are happy with the resolution
bad,The job started out ok but became very stressful towards the end. I love the company but the work was very hard and we didn’t have a Supervisor for a while. So there was none there to support the Sales Team.
bad,"They really don't care enough about retaining good employees. They really don't give you the tools you need to be successful in the job. You have to be resourceful and call around to other people to work there in order to learn your job. You have to be your own advocate. Everyone looks after their own rear ends. HR is very punitive for the slightest things and wants to milk you for as much as they can squeeze out of you. I was very happy for my first year there but when the management started to change, it went downhill pretty quickly,"
bad,"Wellcare does not care if they have bad manager.  as long as manager production is high, they dont care about how manager manages. Most rep lies. Most employees cannot say the truth due to fear."
bad,Lots of very smart people. Leadership does not know how to leverage that talent. Lots of waste. Trying very hard to grow membership.
bad,Did not work there for too long but liked it. Very easy environment and great time management
bad,"When the company wants you to leave they put you on warnings.  This way, one can no longer come back to the company nor sue.  This is their way of ""Layoff"".  One dept. put 6 full-time employees on warnings!  My director never talks to anyone in his team.  The manager is a suckup. They want to release experienced workers to bring in less costly contractors.  Immigration reform is about to change the playing field."
bad,I used to love working for company but they have been going through alot of changes lately and have lost alot of good people. They work you hard and dont take things in consideration until people are upset in work place. They put metrics in place but can not tell you how to meet them. The supervisor are clueless.
bad,"always something to do, but i loved being able to make a difference in a clients life.  Co-workers were always nice. The hardest part was not receving enough pay."
good,People that perform beyond their scope is not recognized. No true diversity in management or upper level management beside people from other countries. Employees are not provided tools to advance within the company across all scopes. It's extremely difficult to obtain useful training tools and workflow process. Management is to tell you they are there to help develop your growth but that's not true.
good,. company had good consistent hours with terrible pay. They have bed bugs that made the environment very uncomfortable to sit down and work. The advancement in the company is slim i have a bachelors degree and asked for an opportunity and they say that there isn't any available positions all the time.
good,"Work in any other department BESIDES Grievance.... Long hours, high stress and poor management. Same issues go on for years and nobody does anything. Guidelines are not up to date and QA, lol is a joke."
good,Would be better if benefits improved. There is no separation of paid/sick time. All your time is used for either/and or. Its an okay place to work. No set structure in management.
good,awesome coworkers is just their is no good organization no actual time on been off but of all is ok
good,A good place to learn Medicare will train well must meet your sales goal because after the third month you will be fired.  But they tell you this when they hire you.
good,"Be prepared to deal with a mind-numbing workload, and excessive hours.  This company will suck your personal life away until you have time to barely eat and sleep."
good,"I loved this job but at the time, the company didn't have many close clients, they were too far away for hourly wage that they were paying. The staff was nice and I enjoyed the clients I had."
good,I do not wish to disclose my experience with this company. Great Co-workers. If wouldn't like to go work with this company.
good,Good work environment only thing that lacks is the professionalism of the management there's none. No feedback on how an employee is doing and lack of training they except you to pretty much know everything of the top of your head.
good,"Learning the full aspect of insurance coverage's, Medicaid and Medicare. typical days  consist of Fluctuating calls between member/providers needing assistance with their respected issues."
good,"If you had a question on a claim or doing other duties, (especially on my team) there is nobody else to assistance unless you can get a co-worker to. the supervisor is to busy all the time and the manager is as well."
good,"Highly recommend any issues be taken directly to HR.  With the Centene buy out, it's all up in the air.  The people coming in are not of the same mindset as those in leadership roles.  The Centene ppl are not open to questions nor are they concerned about how they come across."
good,"Policies are constantly changing, yet you are not kept in the loop. Reprimands for not following a policy or procedure that you didn't know existed. Very archaic software that crashes. At lower levels, the staff are good. The higher you go, the less they seem to care about actual quality care or work. All about volume and statistics, not actual satisfaction and outcomes"
good,"If you want a promotion or lateral move in this department, you need to know people. There is a lot of favoritism. If you can produce, a lot of things are overlooked."
good,"I think it depends on the dept.and mngt team you work for that will define your experince. My personal experience I cant say I had the most honest,  transparent,  or employee supportive managers."
good,Job culture is pretty decent.  I've learned a lot about the back end of health insurance by working claims. Being on production can be stressful. The job culture is decent.
good,I was trained for 6 months and had to find ways to review the training modules to keep busy as nurses with my title were not allowed to go live (travel to medical providers) and teach the physicians on Jan.1. There was much chaos in the switch from the Dept. of Health and Human Services for NE Medicaid to the 3 insurance companies now handling Medicaid. So I never really was able to perform the job I was hired to do. My manager micro-managed me constantly and fabricated lies about me that had no truth in the accusations. It was quite stressful. The director was wonderful but she did not intervene when I was falsely accused. She has since also left the company.
good,"Unbalanced work load among clinicians and teams.  Some only complete 4-6 cases per day and others are required to do 25-30 or more. "
good,Utilization review nurse is a very busy position with a case load of at least 80 cases.  Everyday was a stressful day when dealing with families loved ones and trying to help them understand their benefits.
good,"Wellcare is a very fast pace environment,  opportunity for frequent overtime.  Wellcare offers an abundance of advancement opportunities.  Very people oriented many company sponsored events for the employees."
good,There were many times I would go to work and clients wouldn't even know I was coming and management wouldn't answer the phones. Time sheets were lost a few times and random deductions were taken out of paychecks.
good,"WellCare is a company with great potential but they can't get out of their own way. There are a lot of smart people there but I learned most are more interested in their own personal agendas to do what is best for the company. They talk big but their actions are small. Culturally they are a mess. Perhaps it was the department I worked in, but based on comments from those I worked with in other areas, very few ever had anything good to say. My time there was miserable and I was happy to leave."
good,Great benefits and salary. Hard work. Isolated work environment. Extreme amount of red tape and extreme amount of paperwork Lots of duplicate work.
good,"Wellcare was constantly trying to improve the company. They implemented new programs a lot. "
good,"It was pretty comfortable. I learned a lot of things about the medicines, insurances etc. It helped me gain information about the various medicines which should be prescribed to people with a particular problem. The hardest part of the job was to settle down the issues and payments with insurances. The most enjoyable part was that it never remained extremely hard to work anything out."
good,"My new manager was a micro-manager so I didn't get a lot done."
good,"Low gas compensation,has to use my own vehicle. No benefits"
good,"More emphasis should be given on people to who wish to overlap shifts, made to do our prestigious customer care. We have out-dated computers and technology. More access  to physicians"
good,"Wellcare is a good company to work for. However, I wish they allowed more work from home opportunities. They care about their employees. Great employees."
good,"Job was great until new sales director wanted to do things unethical for more money. I couldn't do what he was asking my team to do, in changing clients plans for a higher paying plan, lie about getting doctors/hospital and other slick things."
good,I contracted there for three years under operations umbrella the management has a lot of behavioral issues in which they chime on in the interview if they see you are doing work well and but they don’t like something about you NO MATTER what you do they want hire you my last manager didn’t know jack about what her staff is to do she had temps distrbursing work the department just started  4/1/2019 she listened to hear say stuff fire you for NO REASON she show FAVORITISM to dis one temp she CUSSES like a sailor She call meetings when she hear gossip about her WellCare ain’t monitoring her there’s no security in the building where she is to all this effects let’s start a class action I need five people to get started
good,On a contract here. No idea why I was there. Didn't use my skills at all. Bad management.  Pay was ok. Not a great place to work but not really bad either.
good,it was a good place to work. My workmates where friendly.The company only do once a month so that allowed you to be more focus in your job. The manager was very friendly and understanding.
good,"Not enough staffing at the corporate level to handle ongoing issues.  Infrastructure has not caught up with growth."
good,"The company has a potential to grow with more professionalism and individuals with talent. it is a great company because they provider opportunity to many on developing ones skills however, the culture of the people is poor and that is what brings the company down. nevertheless, overall great company to learn new skills."
good,"Supervisors have their favorites, who get the overtime and bonuses.  Just because you have the skills it doesnt matter, you wont get promoted unless management likes you. Raises are annually and are mere pennies. like an extra 25 cents an hr."
good,"Good old boys club mentality."
good,not quite the nimble post IPO company from 12 years ago.  The pay is appropriate as are the pto.   The 2018 health insurance benefits went up by over 50% and they eliminated the HRA plan.
good,"Unfortunately, the company only hires temps for just a few projects especially, during HEIDIS. The company, only hires people they know due to the company pays employees for referrals it's political."
good,Must have in depth knowledge of CMS guidelines for medical claims. Pay is marginal for amount of work that is required. Management needs improvement. Culture and moral leaves something to be desired.
good,"Its a job. Not the best job but a job. I have been within the operations portion of the plan since I started and I honestly can not say I have seen any improvements within the last three years as in management , department morale, wage compensation and environment on floor. I recommend if you are looking at WellCare as a future employer stay away from Operations."
good,The branch that is located in Nevada has sold out to many CVS/Pharmacies and is mainly operating as a long term care and compounding facility.
good,"12 hours working time a day,good to learn more about taking care a diet food of patient.enjoying with my collegue,when we have more patient its a hardest part of the job"
good,"Amazing staff, administration is rocky."
good,"Every day is very different.  I manage a team of 5 from sales, marketing, call center to forecasting, budgets and executive meetings. I have learned about finance and budgeting in this position.  The executive leadership team is a great group of people.  The hardest part of the job is that there is no organization or processes, so managing and working through that daily.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work wit."
good,Working for WellCare management did not work with the employee's. They department was not flexible with employee's. We were not allow to speak to our co-works.
good,"To much micro management, they expect you to much out of you to learn a program that they don't even know to much about."
good,"Helping consumer make the best decisions with medicare advantage, Helping them with product knowledge"
good,"This is a Call Center which is VERY fast-paced, which I don't mind, but I don't feel as though my training was well suited for me. Each computer I trained on had issues and I could not successfully be trained and management knew about my issues."
good,Come in greet direct reports and coworkers. Pull up and check time cards to ensure direct reports did not arrive late.  On a monthly basis complete one on ones. At the end of the year complete annual reviews.  On top of daily tasks complete online training.
good,"No benifits...  no pto , HR dont keep their word when they promise when it comes to them paying you more after 30 days. Some coworkers were funny and nice it we made it a good fun place to work."
good,I’m really not sure what you say about this place because I have not been there long enough to make a decision just yet however I don’t feel management or should I say select management put people in successful position to succeed
good,There are pros and cons for working with WellCare  I believe they will close all offices in Houston and move them to Tampa FL  Tge opportunity for advancement is absent
good,"Had a fun and challenging experience. They had very good activities for you to volunteer, and give out to the community.  The people that you work with are the best."
good,"WellCare boasts about diversity and inclusiveness however this is somewhat hypocritical if you are an employee with a permanent disability . Made several attempts to apply for permanent roles, no accommodation was asked about for the one position I was interviewed for, the remainder I received no response from HR. WellCare is the only major health insurer with no score on the Disability Equality Index (Anthem, Aetna and Centene all received scores of 100).  Message to CEO Ken Burdick, you have a lot of work to do to make WellCare more inclusive, and this is critical to understanding the needs of the members we serve."
good,Working from home was the best this company had to offer me. WellCare is an insurance company so they are structured on productivity with most of their employees.
good,I left wellcare because it just wasn't enough pay. I couldn't see myself being able to provide for my kid making $8.25 per hr. Over all the clients are awesome.
good,"A lot of nitpicking and favoritism, if you do not kiss up and lie then you can't advance. Not conducive to helping you advance and learn more things, want you to pump it out. All numbers"
good,Every supervisor viewed their work as priority over everyone else. Every project was considered to be done asap. Supervisors don't communicate with each other or their team but they always expect everyone to be on the same page.
good,"I learn precert for authorizations, also i had to write up reviews for MD also process denial for medicare and medicaid. Inform members of denials from MD."
good,The Atlanta office serves as the Central office for the Georgia market. There is never a dull moment in this office. It is the largest of all the Georgia offices. There is an abundance of room for improvement amongst the leadership.
good,Typical work day is very busy with financial analysis and research. Present information to Management that don't understand financials. Work life balance is great. Advancement in the company is hard because HR is not up to date with job openings ie- accepting resumes or canceled or already filled jobs.
good,"Doing a lot of paper work and computer work all day long. I learned to be organized work efficiently, effectively, with a lack of resources and space."
good,"Coworkers work well together and are wiling to help each other out "
good,"The Rocky Point office I work in has an excellent view which helps the day go by when in the office and not in the field. The staff is very interactive, and the director over the Provider Relations is awesome."
good,"The Management is ok at first, but the company is outdated. There is too many people running the company. There is no benefit except really bad health insurance."
good,"I worked for WellCare for less than a year. The operational side was a complete disaster, however some of the management worked accordingly"
good,On a typical day at work we are usually busy; about  50-70 calls a day. I've learned a lot of medical terminology. My co workers were awesome. We also helped each other when necessary.
good,"I enjoyed the jobs I did but did not enjoy the work environment. I had 3 positions there one after another. Pharmacy call center was first. I enjoyed this position but the money  was better in other departments. I went to Member Escalation Team in which I gained knowledge in other areas of Medicare/Medicaid concerning DME, Billing, Claims, Policy and Cancellations."
good,I really enjoyed my first 2 positions there in Pharmacy and MET.  Job work and life balance was not good. We had to have all our grievances checked at the end of the day. These people worked late. So you could have come in at 7 but they  might not get around to reviewing your work until 9 pm. Therefore you had to stay. There was bickering between the coordinators and the reviewers about what was correct and what wasn't.  There was a lot of gossip which made things distracting.
good,"set up at different locations, trying to help individuals and family with health insurance. educate clients with information regarding health insurance and their coverage. the hardest part of my job is that I have to go out and look for location that i feel I would be able to help the most people, and some locations may be outside. The most enjoyable part is that I manage my time and location."
good,"Doing my daily routine, this is the typical day at work.  i learned how to serve and communicate well to my clients, I learned different kinds of job because in my previous job, all employees are engaged in multi-tasking job that is why I have to push myself to do the job not because I have to do those but because I want to learn.  The management is supportive.  My workmates were so nice to me because we treat each other like brothers and sisters."
good,Well Care needs to provide more nursing to provide superior nursing care. Not enough staff to handle proper patient care.
good,"Sanctioned more than once, job security is not firm here. Market and Sell HMO Medicare plans for wellcare"
good,"The pay is awesome, but the distance was terrible. There was a very high turn over rate for technicians. There is no room for growth in this company."
good,POOR management without appropriate skills or motivation. No respect for the skills. experience or knowledge of its staff members
good,"high stress, high inventory, short staffed, poor management"
good,A good place to receive knowledge and experience; you get to know what you will and won't tollerate.
good,"A typical day usually involved back to back phone calls of angry customers asking questions as to why their Wellcare insurance policy was interfering with their billing, coverage, and medications. The insurance policies in all honesty were not very helpful to the people who needed it most, but from that job i gained a wealth of knowledge in customer service that has helped me in many other jobs."
good,I started to work for WellCare they saying tab be a good company at first but as time passed my opinion on that changed as organization communication and overall work quality declined
good,"the people locally make this company.  they are great."
good,"this job really pushes employees over the top with meetings, reports, and non project related items.  good culture for employees, but management can be a challenge"
good,Decent compensation but be prepared to work long hours and weekends.  Company struggles with culture and leadership issues but overall is growing and offers opportunity if you can fit in.
good,if you are not into kissing up you will not make it. It could be a better place to work with better management. great moral when management involved. but gotta be a great kisser up
good,"A lot of favoritism to get advancement.  Does not promote hard work and energy."
good,"Working for Wellcare was a great learning experience for me.  It taught me to understand what it was like to be in the corporate world.  I would recommend working for them, they have great benefits."
good,"This is not an ideal place for millennials and intellectuals. The company culture is very old school.  Middle level management is also severely lacking skills, development, and talent. The company does offer good pay compared to competitors."
good,I don't feel like posting this but its kinda forcing me to. Wellcare is corporate and cold. Advancement is rare. Managers are meh. Workforce is consumed with correcting each other's mistakes.
good,"Company is very fast paced and changes occur frequently. There is some lack of communication, but slowly improving. Company is all for the employees and truly tries to keep them happy."
good,"I enjoyed my tenure at Wellcare a good company to work for. I started out as the first hiring manager for the Houston market which was a start-up. Wellcare has give me the opportunity to grow both professionally and personally. I've seen the company struggle and grow. The hardest part for me was to many changes in leadership. The culture was driven by the work environment which could be stressful at time being in sales. I enjoyed the people part of the job, helping them to develop into successful employees."
good,The job in itself was a rewarding and pleasurable job.  Management needed additional training in some areas. This was my 3rd time working with this establishment.
good,"Total years at Wellcare was almost 10 as I left in 2013 and went back 2015. It is a good company, but some management areas had lots of room for improvement. I don't feel that my full potential was appreciated enough to move to the next level."
good,Management was very poor in this office there was really no support from management .  This office can us a more caring and involved manager that is willing to work with the staff.
good,"I will be going on 10 years working at Wellcare and management is not interested in working with you to get to the next level."
good,"They are ok to work for.  Doing home care, I get to choose my patients and hours.  Sometimes it is a mental and physical challenge   doing this type of work.  I have learned that everyone is different and must be treated accordingly.  As long as you do your job to the best of your ability, management is there to help anyway they can."
good,"After being excited to work for a great company, I thought. Their starting pay was great,  flex time and unlimited overtime from home. But they have VERY HIGH TURN OVER!  Just when you get comfortable they have major layoffs each year."
good,This is a job that gives your the knowledge and skills to help you find a more suitable job. Not long term at all. I would recommend this for kids coming out of high school.
good,"My typical day begins my accessing my work from an excel spreadsheet. I am responsible to make adjustments, refunds and release holds from medical claims that have been submitted by institutional and professional providers . Working for a managed care company there is never a dull day. You are always challenged to use critical thinking skills."
good,"I learned a lot in Wellcare Clincs when it comes to Medical Terms."
good,"typical day was productive"
good,"Its a place full of challenges but i learned a lot, different lessons: personal & professional. The management tries to improve especially in the field of processing documents concerning the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, my co workers are so nice to be with: friendly, flexible & easy to be with. The hardest part of the job for me is during labor watch & the most enjoyable part is during the onset of delivery..."
good,I wouldn't return to work their. After I had a painful surgery the company fired me. I didn't feel a great deal of support after having gone through a painful time in my life.
good,WellCare is a good place to work overall. Micromanagement is a Con
good,This job has tough job security. They lay a lot of people off randomly with no notice.
good,A typical day was not good. Day shift could have done more than they did. I did not learn anything. Management was hard on some workers and some workers were not treated fair. Co-workers did not always work together. The hardest part was trying to survive the night without a fall or incident. The most enjoyable part of the job was off days.
good,Company provides flexibility in work day as well as working environment.
good,"WellCare is a dynamic company that allows a lot of autonomy, but also has opportunity to become more organized in its processes. Someone considering working here should be flexible, can adapt to an ever-changing environment and constantly shifting priorities, and work with a variety of staff levels."
good,"lots of driving and dealing with angry customers, management was okay. hardest part was dealing with angry customers and having to use my paycheck to keep my car running. most enjoyed part of the job is letting me just work."
good,Great company. I've learned a lot. Looking for other opportunities at this time. Ready to move up the ladder and make an impact in a company. Looking within the company and elsewhere.
good,Focus of work not realistic and processes constantly changing before it can be determine if previous processes are going to work. Management constantly adding to workload and not giving consideration of other activities that are important to manage care needs for members.
good,Empresa Boa porém o salário um pouco defasado pra categoria
good,"Flexible schedule.  You must be organized and know how to manage time well. There is alot of flexibility, but you should be careful because you have a monthly quota to meet and you do not want to wait to the last minute."
good,"Management needs training on work ethics, Diversity is not acceptable amongst the staff, which is sickening. Some staff is over worked and others not working. Nothing is done about the mishaps like it’s normal."
good,"Wellcare does pay you well, but have to work 60 plus hours to be successful.  The on boarding process and NH Training sucks and you don’t get a lot of support from Management unless you are good with office politics.  You have to learn how to do your job on your own and meet all your deliverables with minimal guidance.  Each department works in silos and doesn’t work well together.  wellwektogether at all to accomplish the mission."
good,"stressful environment, room for advancement and competitive pay. Management is poor and the communication is not that great. Would be better if they had better management"
good,badge in walk in your correct areal log into your computer clock in log in screens and screen capture. Answer calls all day back t back only 15 and 30 min breaks and lunches if you go over your lunch you will get written up poor communication this is Teleperformance as well. always making changes without notice. poor management.
good,"Worked with good people. The company has terrible training  - no training at all, but then expected to have an excellent performance.  They hire horrible managers, who do not fit in with their team. This manager did not do HER job, was a slacker! Don't get it, how these type of people get into management positions! The company overlooks these things. HR doesn't help at all, as they support management. Therefore, associates are left out in the cold - no one to support them. WellCare states they care about their associates and their well-being, but it is not so. Very stressful environment, no room for advancement, and no training to help you to be successful within the company."
good,Great management team. Good Medicare advantage product. Compliance was a top priority and that is a good thing. Increasing quotas and decreasing opportunities for bonus pay was the downside of the workplace.
good,"Overall, it was an okay experience, however they had too many rules and regulations that didn't make sense. If they treated employees better, there would be less turnover, in my opinion."
good,"Great place to work, met a lot of great people.  I had a great time working here, interacting with the people and truly trying to help in any way I could.  For that, I received a lot of great feedback, which seemed to have fallen on deaf ears."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wellcare due to the relationship with my coworkers. They worked together as a team. "
good,"We had to develop our own territory, often working out in the environment to promote the company, the most enjoyment was the satisfaction to educate and assist  Medicare beneficiaries."
good,The company overall is a good company and they will invest in their people. They have had a number of lay offs over the years. Its seems they cannot manage the budget effectively. So they lay people off.
good,"Needs New Management, we have people in place that do not know what they are doing, and its really holding the company back. The company is moving in the right direction, but management is critical."
good,No one is ever on the same page. So many discrepancies on how to perform your job but the expectations are quite high. Constant turnover. Management does not listen or understand their department as well as the differences within the group they supervise. There is too much demand from too many people who do not coincide.
good,An average day at work was 12 plus hours. Lots of meetings and real work was actually done after hours. The management showed a lot of nepotism and growth was not really encouraged. Constant change in upper management
good,"It was pretty easy once you got the correct training , they sent emails every day to update you on the changes They had changes every week so I can say that was the hardest part of this job just trying to keep up with what is the new to process a claim. The work place was quite and friendly oriented , they will go out there way to say hello and to help out when needed. Best part about this place was the showed appreciation with nice and  fun things to do for the company"
good,"To much back stabbing, i really dont have much to say about the job. I did my job got paid, and thats it, you think they are helping you, then you find oyt they are not"
good,"Depending on what area of the company you work for really colors your experience.  Management needs to be more up-front with associates when it comes to critiques, rather than finding out third-hand when there's an issue."
good,Decent company to work for. High turn over rate in some departments. Will give you plenty of hours if available which was nice. Ideal for someone whom is flexible.
good,"not the best i have worked at, too many in leadership and not a lot of knowledge from management, too many get promoted because of who they know not what they know, great building & gym but I could do better so i did"
good,"The company as a whole is a great company to work for, the people are really nice,  I really did enjoy the customers and the job itself , very good challenges , to keep one's mind sharp. Lost of fun activities on Friday and during the months"
good,"Great benefits, good pay, no career path for LPC or LCSW Clinicians"
good,"WellCare is a company that pays well, but is heavily flawed. Among peers, life in WellCare is fantastic. People hired are generally high quality employees, and I've found it easy to get along with most I meet. With regards to impact on personal life, security, advancement, and especially management, however, the reality becomes a bit murkier. "
good,A typical day involves learning new things and being able to adapt to change quickly. The way things are done today can change before you leave by the end of the same day.  The staff is great and the management as well. This job can be overwhelming at  times and very stressful.
good,"used my skills to excel with WellCare health plan. Being an Consultant to help Medicare beneficiaries to maximize their Health care decisions.Implementing and developing future sales through marketing relationships with business, churches, referrals, senior living facilities, physician offices, etc."
good,"Job recognition was poor"
good,"This company is my first experience in UAE. i had lot of good ad bad  moments here.i learned how to live in future life.but now having big"
good,"This company has many different job opportunities where you can learn all aspects of the insurance world. Nurses, pharmacy, customer service and many many more are available within the company."
good,"Recognized as a dynamic, results driven leader, with extensive experience in Government and Group sponsored healthcare. My career background has been in Customer Service, Training Delivery & Content Maintenance, Management and Operational Auditing. A catalyst and problem solver with a flair for identifying opportunities."
good,"WellCare is a high volume, fast past, demanding environment;  this type of environment enables you to be able to learn a lot and be exposed to many facets of the business."
good,Good company overall; Senior IT Management makes decisions to save their own skin rather than thinking of the company.
good,"fast paced work environment that makes you very alert and give great attention to detail. management is very laid back as well as the atmosphere. co-workers are very polite and eager to help. the hardest part of the job is coming in every Saturday and the most enjoyable part of the is you can learn valuable assets, such as Microsoft, excel, and gain customer service experience"
good,Typical Health Plan. Nothing more or less to say about that.
good,"As with any health insurance business, environment is fast-paced and self motivated."
good,Big campus now broken down into satellite offices.  Campus still remains and with a big cafeteria. Has a revolving door policy. Expect average life of 3-4 years. Will write employees up on performance warnings when they target folks to leave. It's their way of telling the employee that they either need to move on or they will be moved. It's very drastic times that call for a proper layoff - if a lot of people of to be shed all at once for immediate cost reduction.
good,Nothing spectacular or negative to say... Place calls to hospital discharge members to determine if any needs exist.
good,"Fair company to work for. There were great employees, and direct management teams. The upper management were on another level. not so employee friendly."
good,"long hours, opportunity to learn something new, but company has a high turn over. Section Directors don't have autonomy, but are micro-manged by VP's."
good,a typical day at work - good
good,"Nice place to work until you have a bad regional VP. WellCare has the one team approach. But, when your senior leadership does not support that core value, work becomes difficult."
good,I have no complaints nice place to work they are all about family everyone tries to help very supportive and welcoming also room to learn new things is always open.
good,I loved my co-workers. Anyone I have interacted with internally in IT is usually very nice and great to work with but it's a different story when working with people from other depts there is definetly some kind of stigma. I have noticed a lot favoritism here when it comes to internally hiring/promoting least in IT. Company is really bad at communicating widespread changes/issues.
good,"It's okay for a while but after a month or so it is just not worth it anymore. The pay doesn't accommodate with the pressure they put on you. I don't like it anymore. The health insurance isn't really that good. If they just paid a little more, everything will be better."
good,There wasn't much to do. And it was to loud. Nice people to work with and not enough time for breaks or lunches. Awesome trainers but not enough training equipment to use.
good,I worked here four years I only got two raises. This job is very demanding they have you traveling morning to night and if you don’t drive over 60 miles a day you don’t qualify for a company car. Which makes your personal vehicle needing maintenance regularly.
good,I would work for them again. The experience was great. Management was always available to assist. Only downfall is they hire a lot of temporary workers  instead of  hiring full time employees.
good,It's a pretty good place to work considering that I got to be at home.  I am a work at home Customer Service Representative.  I take inbound calls from members and sometimes it's very nerve racking because people can be so rude.
good,"•	Educating seniors and the community about Medicare products and generating enrollment leads & referrals.  "
good,"As a new employee (office staff)  they don't explain that you have to ""earn"" usage of your PTO.  They say you can't use it in your 90 days, but don't mention that if a holiday falls within your 90 days and the office is closed that you don't get paid.  Making it impossible.  For example I started in November and my 90 days won't be up until February.  That being said I don't have access to PTO or any payment although the office is closed for 3 holidays.  Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.  I will have to work long hours in order to get my time, around that day or go without."
good,"I truly appreciated my direct manager; however, corporate seemed to be inconsistent. There was low morale at times. Overall, my main reason for leaving will be due to lack of advancement,"
good,Loved the team approach. Enjoyed meeting new employees and sharing new experiences. This company is very proactive with employees. The hardest part of the job was having to resign.
good,over work employer never satisfied. positive aspect of the job in the  RN case management position you are able  work from home. Benefits satisfactory.
good,no interested in reviewing this company...did not see advancement opportunity....unequal management application of rules...managers I worked for were all fired
good,"Due to the volume of work, difficult to find time to enjoy the work day or engage your team members.  The hardest part of the job was the inability to get things done in a timely manner due to the inefficiencies of the workflows and systems. During my time at the company, all decisions were made by Corporate which slowed down the process and created backlogs."
good,"Extremely overwhelming environment to work. Employees are over worked and not enough time in the day to finish their tasks/projects due to meetings that occur all day long. Management points fingers and constantly blame employees. In this department most employees and even management have serious attitude problems and extreme rage. Also, there is no such things as training- be prepared to learn on your own. This particular department is horrific if you have a family because there is no work life balance. If you don't have a family and have time to work 17 hours a day you can learn a lot."
good,"A company that pays employees well.  However, I feel management lacks integrity/ethics.  During my time at WellCare, I felt that management was much more interested in profits and less interested in patient care."

They do a great job at hiring and everyone is very supportive of each other. "

good,Day starts with the daily enrollee list to enter in the database and the timeframe in which it needs to be completed. I learned to have better time management and to obtained a better set of communication skills when dealing with unpleased customers. Management was rarely present which makes feel like the trust is already built between employee and employer. The most enjoyable part of the job has to be interacting with patients over the phone where one can hear their story and try to help their situation better by a click of a button.
good,Nice place to work. I have learned a lot while working at Wellcare.
good,Teaching members how to self-manage their chronic diseases and see clinical improvement was very regarding.

good,"WellCare is an amazing company that truly cares about the member experience. The ability to work from home and have a work life balance is great. WellCare cares about career growth. Most of the associates are kind, honest, hard working people. The leadership? Not so much. They need to provide better and more timely communication over why decisions are made."
good,"Working hours were flexible (between 6:30 am and 10:00 am entry hours). Possibility to work from home. Training was sub-par, needed more structuring. Learned attempting to multitask, the ability to switch tasks in short notice and getting back to previous task. Learned time management. Workplace culture is friendly, lots of celebrations. The hardest part of the job was filling the production quota (number of cases closed per week)."
good,There is always work to be done. Never a dull moment. Healthcare and Wellcare is always changing.New things to come. Great people to work with. They try to keep employees happy.
good,"The leadership at the top is great, however the vision, and inspriartion does not trickle down.  What should be a great working environment/culture is totally the opposite"
good,"I started off in the pharmacy operations department as a pharmacy technician.  Standard desk job, not a lot of room for advancement.  Management needs improvement, in this position I felt underappreciated and leadership did little to help anyone advance.  However, the company does provide tuition reimbursement and much higher pay than retail or hospital pharmacies.  This allowed me to finish my masters degree without having to take out too many student loans.  I eventually obtained a position in a different department and found the leadership to be much more interested in helping me develop my skills and provided me the training and tools necessary to work more efficiently."
good,"Each day is different and when there is a change in the day's assignment, the expectation is to get the work done no matter the challenge without getting any overtime."
good,"I worked with senior outreach organizations to establish a positive relationship within the community for those seeking help with Medicare questions."

good,my only reason for wanting to leave no opportunities for advancment and it seems as thought management stick together when you have a complaint against

good,"Great environment with awesome coworkers. Various chances to learn something new, and company activities each month."
good,The training at Wellcare was phenomenal.  Everything you wanted and needed to know about Medicare was instilled into you.  Managers were great and would do anything to help within there power.  The hardest part of the job was consumers didn't know the name Wellcare and to try to sell a product from a name they didn't know was difficult.
good,"very friendly work environment."
good,"Although it's a good company to work for, I feel like there is too much separation between Wellcare and Exactus workers.  One area of the building some employees can go in, and others you can't.  No one tells you where is off limits to whom. Good company, just a lot of micro-managing going on."

good,"The product quality to start and build a fair portfolio and compite with other similar products is not there , car expenses and OT are paid but the lack of a good competitive product it makes it hard to build a basic business portfolio to work with due to the fact you have to start from 0 and there is not an strategic market development to back up the efforts."
good,Job advancement not typical and low pay for high demand of work. Management is not always supportive. Great hours. Weekends off. Main reason people stay. Great benefits!
good,"The management in WellCare is somewhat disorganized and there is a feeling of being bullied at times in order to meet company metrics. "

You set at your desk and you do your job and this is what you do and don't look over here and it does not matter if you have skills that can fix a much needed issue they are having, if you are not in that department and that is not in your silo then they would rather have the problem than let someone fix it that is not in the department they think should be fixing it even though they have no one in that department capable of fixing that problem.  It is really hard to have a certain set of skills and talents that and not be allowed to use them."
good,"It was really great. The best thing was the people. This is a great job for anyone looking for sales or office, then this is most definitely a great place to be."
good,Only worked there for a short time. The company went through layoffs. I enjoyed the training and getting my insurance license. The pay and benefits were excellent.

good,It was a great place to work for and the floor supervisors and the people you work with were great. The pay was excellent. But they decided to outsource our dept and let a bunch of us go.
good,"It is best to come in off the street and be guaranteed a fair salary instead of advancing within. It is sad, i love the company and the managers I work for, they make it worth wild working here. The HR dept has high turn over and everyone knows how horrible the HR Dept is."
good,"worked on claim issues, love to analyze problems, and come to a resolution. Like the feeling of achievement."
good,It was short lived due to Obamacare I was laid off. I would still have the job and with Wellcare had this not happened. I learned how to be more independent. I also learned how to approach people better and gained more confidence in sales.
good,"Great company to work for however, there is no work life balance esp if you're in IT or associated with IT. But, the pay and PTO is great!"
good,I would say overall this company is a great intro to the marketing field. You are trained by the book on health care.
good,I loved working with one on one patients getting to know them and their families. the pay was not enough for that line of work. but over all I loved working for them
good,"My typical day at work would consist of assist irate members with the plans, billing, authorizations, and dealing with providers."
good,"Advancement opportunity is slow, but and excellent company to work for. Many positions posted often, but must be employed over 1yr to qualify for transfer. On the job training is scarce be ready to train yourself for the position you get hired to do."
good,"A typical day at WellCare can either be a breeze or a headache depending on your role with the company, as with any job. I've learned a lot of different skills and roles while being at WellCare and have learned a lot about myself."
good,"the more hours you work the overtime is ridiculous, they don't paid the overtime by the Law, need better management and support to the employees, don't like it"
good,"A typical day at work is visiting different providers and assisting them with any questions they may have on care gap reports that I provide.  These reports show Quality measures that need to be addressed and also shows current HEDIS and STAR rating.  I also assist with any claims issues they might be having.  Also assist with contracting issues.  I am their contact to the company, so I assist with whatever they require.  Wellcare also incentivizes providers for meeting quality measures.  Part of my job is to help the provider maximize his/her incentive by providing quality care to our members."
good,Just make sure to stay vigilant and you will keep your job. great company to work for fair pay and very fair benefits. only complaint would be that the health insurance is less than desirable in my humble opinion.
good,Team environment and great support system. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting current and perspective members.

good,"The job is great but the management is awful."
good,"Typical Corporation. Great benefits, but very disorganized at times. I really liked my co-workers and my supervisor. They were the best part of the job. It was a production based position so we were very busy and at times. Typical work week hours ran between 40 - 60 hours a week. I feel the hardest part of the job was not having my trainer onsite. The same time period that the 4 week training course had completed and we got put out on the floor, the trainer for our team moved out of state and was telecommuting."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in in the morning, booting up computer and doing data entry and sometimes making phone calls. An hour lunch break and pot luck for Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays."
good,I work for a temporary job so I am looking for something permanent.  Some times you have projects to work on and some times its so slow for weeks that it gets hard to kill your time.
good,Company structure was very demanding.  Reward came from helping people as Management was lacking.  No real opportunity for advancement.
good,The company overall is a great place to work. Management in certain departments do not follow the company's core or ethical values.Employee's are great.
good,"management not put together like it should be, they are not a family oriented company, everyone is for them selves the upper management, the best thing was working with great employees"
good,"Benefits are great but management is not the best. Workers are also nice everyone tends to get along. Pay was also nice, the pay didn't always match the work though."
good,WellCare is a good company overall but it does not offer any good insurance. The co-workers are great and they are passionate about what they do. The fun part about the job is learning how to process authorizations.
good,"Provided accurate and appropriate information in response to customer inquiries."
good,"The department I worked in had great colleagues. Work was challenging and consistently overwhelmed, No work/life balance. Management was corrupt. If you were friends with a higher up - you had job security. If a higher disliked you - watch out, no matter how amazing of an employee you were"

good,"organized management and loving co workers, great asset of learning, patient care and safety, the hardest part is dealing with insurances and reluctant patients, but enjoyable when a life is cared for or saved"
good,It was a great learning environment but with limited room for growth. Unfortunately not much job security. I sat in my cubicle and spoke with members about their insurance policies. I investigated third party liability cases and helped to train others to do the same. The team I worked with made the day enjoyable. We did lots of team building activities.
good,"Nice place to work if you have the right manager. Can be very demanding, Seen positive changes as of late to create work -life balance. Growing rapidly."
good,"Workplace culture is evolving.  Many last minute process and policy changes, creating undo stress. Large acquisitions in short period of time requiring fast paced adaptation.  Leadership is very good. Not advancement opportunities outside the corporate headquarters."
good,"I am currently a contracted worker. However, it is a nice, cool, calming atmosphere to productively work with-in. I would accept a permanent position."
good,"The job was through Teleperformace not actual Welcare, If I was the work environment would possibly been better and more structured as well as professional."
good,HR is broken in every possible way yet the company continues to prosper; from talent acquisition to talent development & all points in between.  Sad really.  This place could be great.
good,"If you are in the right department with the right management, WellCare is a wonderful company to work for.  Otherwise it can be a nightmare.  The company has great benefits and wonderful people to work with."
good,"Workers are not payed an adequate salary for the amount of work that is required. Very high turnover rate for employees and upper management; however, there is a great amount of team work."
good,It has been a generally positive environment.  Lack of advancement opportunity.  Minimal training and no mentorship opportunities for young engaging talent.
good,Wellcare cares about their employees. One of the greatest joys is the wonderful co-workers within Wellcare in multiple states

good,I learned a lot from my experience at WellCare and was able to grow quickly. There are many different departments you can advance to and grow depending on your skill set.
good,"Wellcare itself is a good company with good salaries and benefits and good community presence.  My experience there was mostly positive and I gave a lot of blood, sweat and tears for them. I was repaid with the boot from a new manager and yes, my opinion is biased."
good,I learned a lot in the trainings and working  with people. I met a lot of people who showed me the health care business. They train there employees so that they will be able to be successful.
good,I enjoy my job but there is no advancement to grow within.
good,This was my first full time job. It is a good place to start. It provides  training and advancement opportunities. I learned a lot regarding health care and gained many working skills that will help me in the future.
good,I worked with claims/collections and also spoke to patients regarding their claims.  I also worked with high risk pregnancy cases as I worked with one of the nurses who helped patients.
good,Wellcare was a good place to work but no room for advancement.  Learned a lot and the team is good to work with.  Traveled to Tampa was also good.  It is a fast pasted and stressful environment but teamwork makes the difference.
good,I have no complaints about WellCare.  The culture is great but advancement in salary is difficult. You must have exactly every single requirment on the job description must be met to move up.
good,Supportive management and coworkers. Need to be able to work with minimum supervision and  be productive to earn the trust of department leadership and thrive.
good,"I worked with this company for a little less than 1 year, i can not say that i regret working with the company but I had to advance in my career. My manager was very supportive and encouraged flexibility"

good,"A typical day at work was very busy, I was taught  how an Doctor Audit's were done and interacting with the doctor's, the hardest part of the job was leaving and the most enjoyable part of the job was learning and doing the job well. It was a fun working  place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how personally grow and develop. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them."
good,Nice people to work for and the patients were great! They treated me equal to everyone else. I learned to work fast and manage my time while my duties were met.

This application allows the functional users to complete the workflows and provide them with information related to business areas such as Members, Claim, Benefits, Providers, Groups, Service Requests and Communication Events."
good,"Worked with individuals to educate and enroll them into Medicare/Medicaid Plans to help them with their healthcare needs.  Gave them lots of options and little to no cost to them."
good,"They were a good place to work.  From the time I arrived until the time I left, I enjoyed my work with patients, taking their vitals and assisting them with daily living activities."
good,I think WellCare is a great company but I hated what I did. It was a temp job but I had to make outbound phone calls.
good,"Starting pay is good, but raises after that not good, no bonuses unless in management position. Training is not great, but they are working on improving it for new hires."
good,I loved being a Marketing Outreach Specialist. I did not work from the typical office; most of my time was spent out in the community being relationships with potential clients and community partners.
good,"customer service was easy the clients only wanted to enroll into the services available to them. claims department was a little bit more complicated, you had to manually review claims that were under or over paid to the provider"
good,I feel best to work in this in company.I had many challenges and got lot of appreciations. Learned new technologies in this company. A memorable place in career.
good,A typical day at work involved completing daily authorizations for a team of four nurses whom I loved and had a great rapport. I learned their system rather quickly. I trained new employees which also gave me great joy. The hardest part of the job was favoritism from management to certain employees. The majority of co-workers were really nice and helpful with the work. We celebrated each others birthdays which made the job enjoyable..

good,They were able to keep me busy with lots of special clients. The scheduler was always available should I problem occur.
good,"A good  place to work with, but it does not give me a job stability that I need.  For now it's ok I am still relatively new with them,  still waiting ."

good,I had a good experience there i loved all of my patients and i made a good relationship with them the team was also awesome and very helpfull i met very amazing people
good,"Driven by numbers, the focus is lost on the associates. High micromanagement and Managers and above are untouchable. Growth is based on who you know, unless you are a consistently exceeds. The company expects a lot of OT, but then blocks the calendar for PTO. They drive corrective management and not much coaching to improve errors. They provide LinkedIn to learn, but with high demands on production, this is only an option during personal time. Casual clothes environment, paid holidays, but require volunteers or mandated. If you come to do your job and not get caught up in company politics you will do fine. Great pay."
good,employees showed a sense of helping hand to each other. very enjoyable working with other people in providing their medical assistance in their annual physical examination.
good,"The Management are bias but in general the work is a laid back job and flexible to have personal time. I like my job because it is not stressful. I am just unfortunate because the new manager that i report to doesn't like black unlike whim i used to report to before. This current manager is just seeking for a loophole to get me out of the door. But on a positive side, i have learnt a lot of technologies while working there which is good for me moving forward"
good,"Enjoy work with the company, and learned a lot of things with wellcare infotech llc.,"
good,WellCare is a great Organization. I enjoyed working with everyone there. The QI department was small and therefore mostly staffed by contract nurses for HEDIS related projects. Management was very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions and assist everyone involved in the project.

good,"Great company to work for, lots of room for advancement. There was a lot to learn, and support from your team. The industry is ever changing, so there is no room to get bored. Many people will work here will stay for to long term if you are looking for a long time home, this may be the place for you"
good,"Was very excited to be working for the company, and I bring much passion and enthusiasm to the table. I was blindsided when I begged for more than the meager training I was receiving and was fired for apparently being too candid regarding the lapses of onboarding and training. I was clueless - humbling experience, not even a word of encouragement or redirection, just termination. Would love another chance but the door slammed shut."
good,I enjoy working at WellCare. It has helped me to grow as a referral coordinator. I have been in the Intake department for my whole WellCare career and am only looking to be closer to home.

good,The company is down sizing and closing the mail order pharmacy.

good,"My work day was very busy. I learned time management skills and how to be a road worrier. My co-workers were great team players and  as well as dependable when having to complete team deadlines. I was very comfortable, I just went with the work flow. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with for the most part great, trust worthy people."
good,"Even though I am required to meet a monthly metric, I am able to work at my own pace, with very minimal supervision. I have learned a lot more about both the Medicare and Medicaid market, and continue to sharpen my medical terminology and telephone communication skills. I work well with my fellow coworkers, Case Management, and closely with my Manager. The most difficult part of my job is making contact with a prospective member, due to constant phone number and address changes, so I do a lot of added research. I enjoy what I do, screening and reviewing possible cases, to help prospective members start the process in applying for Social Security disability and Medicare programs. I work with Providers, Hospitals, Case Managers, and other areas, as a team effort, to best assist our members with helpful programs, offering good customer service."
good,"I have learned a lot and experience a totally different side of healthcare while working at WellCare. I have learned the different ways in which Pharmacy personnel can positively influence the health care system and help their members at the same time,"
good,"Great way to make a substantial amount of income however not a very organized organization overall. Operations did not work well with sales, sales did not work/communicate well with upper management, Provider Relations hardly brought on new business nor did they have a priority to."
good,WellCare has provided me with the opportunity for professional growth and internal mobility.  The company culture of work/life balance with flexible work schedules and telecommuter opportunities.

good,"As a in home aide for home care I was able to have flexibility in my schedule.  Going to work day to day wasn’t a challenge at all.  My supervisor was one of a kind. She really understood each side and was there through any ups or downs I had.  She was patient, sincere and one of the best bosses I’ve ever had.  A true advicot for their clients.  Well Care is a wonderful company but the pay is not enough to live."
good,"Great Perks. Good mentorship. Positive environment. Healthy Work environment which promotes great interaction among peers/coworkers. "
good,"Wellcare was a good Organization to work for. However, since I was a contractor my long term employment there was not an option. I would recommend this as a viable employer."
good,Enjoy working at Wellcare. I work from home. My direct boss is amazing. Upper management isn’t always receptive to advancement. Have for the most part enjoyed my career at Wellcare
good,"Provider Relations Representative covers a vast of responsibilities. In a day's time I can go to a provider's office to educate, pick up and deliver reports, and give any additional information to better the communication between us and the provider. I answer member calls regarding bills and concerns, make demographics calls, notate in a software program, fill network gaps, gather information for contracting, investigate claims issues, and work with others in our Network."
good,"Overall, WellCare is a good place to work at in Tampa area. The work environment is not very stressful and there is a good work-life balance. Benefits are not that great but they are not bad either. Good HQ campus. Rapidly growing organization but top management needs to make changes accordingly. Issues/challenges with visa sponsorship only down side."
good,"It's a good place to work. A growing company with a lot of potential advancement. The pace is fast and the company has some maturing to do still, so things are not as efficient as a more mature organization. Politics can be brutal once you're into the leadership circle."
good,"Communicated with Providers via inbound calls when a Provider needed to obtain an inpatient or outpatient authorization."

I provided on-the-job training to new hires and facilitated MA seminars and new member orientations. I enjoyed educating and providing healthcare services to Medicare beneficiaries."

I learned that peoples attitudes can and do change once they know that you can make a difference in their lives. Management was the best...I will commend the HR,r she was and is the best. I really did not have co-workers to work with, and the hardest part of the job was to say good-bye at the end of the sessions. The most enjoyable part of the job was working the hours and keeping a steady paycheck."

good,Very mission amd value driven! Opportunities for advancement and great senior leadership. Dedicated to customer satisfaction. There isn't a lot of tunrover.
good,This is a great company to work for providing you have the right management.  There are many flaws that are addressed but no sense of priority.  If you are not buddy buddy with people there is zero chance of progression.  I am not that type of person therefor I don't see a lt of progression in this company for myself.
good,WellCare has been a great experience. Career opportunities are yours for the taking. Rewards and acknowledgements are provided by the leadership team. They are very transparent.

good,the company that i used to work is one of the better  clinic i must say from their services doctors facility and even their staff. i really enjoy the days that i am still working there. they give their employee a chance to learn and improve themselves by letting them experience different medical technique in other aspect of the clinic. like me because of eagerness to learn things aside from being a clinic nurse i pursue myself to learn how to extract blood from the patient with the permission of my superior and guidance of our medical technicians and gladly accept the chance to be part of drug testing team where i used to be an authorized specimen collector and encoder. as i look back those days i must admit that each days are really challenging from the moment you received your patient till they leaved the facility all your knowledge skills and patients must always present esp for those people who does have a very short temper a lot of patients is needed. but still in the end of the day i am happy and contented knowing that there is someone whom i help with regards their health issue. though i need to resign so i could pursue my career in other aspect of healthcare service and took the chance to take the nurse licensure  examination.
good,"It is a workplace for people looking for job work and life balance, so most co-workers are friendly and job is quite secure. However , if you are looking for higher compensation with a career ambition, it might be not the perfect fit for you.

The Director was businesslike, however was open to hear your concerns. I arrived on the job between 7:30- 8:00 am (depending on my workload), got my cup of coffee, turned on my computer,and began to assess what I needed to do for the day. I usually had to abstract and review data from 360-400 electronic medical records per week. The hardest part was completing your weekly assignment when you had a multitude of interruptions, (ex.questions from other co- workers, meetings, etc) on a daily basis. Most of my co- workers were not just friendly, but helpful. I learned how to remain calm when you were multitasking, and meeting deadlines, because after all it's only so much you can do in one day. I enjoyed the potlucks we had during the holidays."
good,"Productive work place, intensive training and knowledge of Medicaid and medicare programs, which I enjoyed because I can apply that knowledge to numerous other positions."

After the job returned it would be reviewed for accuracy and quality. Within the process a purchase order request of the cost would be sent to the vendor.
