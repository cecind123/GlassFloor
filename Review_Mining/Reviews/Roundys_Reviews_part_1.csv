bad,"Probably the best thing they did was close the Pharmacy, District Manager not in touch with reality, worked my butt off, alone, no outside support. Left totally upset with the practice of Pharmacy!"
bad,"I was to be a pharmacy manager in a well staffed pharmacy.  After 3 weeks my allotted hours were cut and my full time staff pharmacist was pulled to be replaced by a part time prn agency pharmacist. "
bad,"If you want to save your mental health. Don’t work here. Especially the one in Oshkosh. The management is rude and don’t follow your avalabilty at all. You’ll always asked to be cover shifts on your days off. The pay is impossible to live on. The discount only works on certain items- if the managers even remember to attach it to your account which they didn’t for me. Poor training. If you apply ask a cashier, prepare to be a bagger too and you might be forced to do carts as well. You only get 15 minute breaks every 4 hours you work- if you have a good csr they will give you 2 if you work 7 hours. But if you work any less than 7 you only get one."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work. You will have no social life. The managers are hateful and mean, the company doesn't care about it's employees and only care about putting money in their own pockets. Zero opportunity for advancements, pay sucks, long hard hours just to get yelled at. Half of the company's rules don't make sense. Raises rarely happen."
bad,While working there it was a very fast pace job that had times and details that were on a strict time frame.  The roundys brand had a total of 5 distributions centers and delivering to most mid-western states.  Unfortunetly it's no longer in business and not servicing the grocery stores
bad,"Beware Men from Kroger bearing gifts.  Kroger is full of management that is only out for themselves, no work/life balance, no caring for employees and their home life.  Kroger corporate will lie about the color of the sky to get their way and walk over their employees without a care.  Roundy's is gone, Kroger killed it."
bad,"This is no longer Roundys but Kroger. They are a bigger grocer than Walmart and it shows. I would rather work at Walmart than a Kroger owned company and I've been at both.  Roundys was a great company to work for but Kroger is destroying it. The policies are outdated and the way they treat the ""cattle"" I mean employees, is modern day slavery. They are looking at completely removing cashiers and pricing coordinators this year so if your looking here look elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend any job at the store level."
bad,"Management feigns underatanding and forgiveness, then punishes mistakes you make as a new enployee. They do not give proper time to grow, in any way whatsoever. On top of that, they are not forgiving while you are in training (11 weeks), even if there is a death in the family and you need time to grieve, plan, and move on, they instead find an excuse to fire you."
bad,They will cry and complain about pointless stuff. The assistant s.d. is a crybaby and if you try calling in because you are sick they won’t let you. They yell at you for stuff that is out of your control. Tell you to suck it up when you call in. And bash you to other employees in the store
bad,Great environment but it is very poorly managed. no consistent hours and scheduling. low pay and no consistency. I've worked in 3 different departments and never received any pay increase.
bad,Been there two years and went from getting too much overtime cause they couldn’t retain people to not enough work to get a full 8 hours. Kroger standard for selection is unreasonable.
bad,After roundys bought Copps Food Center they went down hill.  Bought in there own management and changing things.  Went from a scratch bakery to a thaw and bake
bad,I walked thru out the stores to prevent theft. The hardest part of my job was detaining thieves.  The most enjoyable part of my job was walking for exercise. I learned how to strength my detaining tactics.
bad,I've been employed here for many years. The management has been in slow decline. It's a good place to start working but I'd never recommend it for the long haul. I've worn out my welcome and I'm ready to move on.
bad,"I’ve worked for this company for going on 3 years now and it’s only gotten worse each one. When I first started I loved the job but since the rebranding to Kroger this place has gone down hill. The new rules make no sense, management doesn’t do anything to help their staff, and raises rarely happen. There is never enough staff to compensate for the work load so we are always behind, then get blamed for being behind by management. I wouldn’t recommend working here to anyone that wants more than a temporary job."
bad,"While working for Roundy's Corporation, I effectively met the needs of my customers by providing supberb customer service, going above and beyond to assist them with their shopping needs, party planning and menu selection."
bad,This job is hard work and not worth the pay. You work from sun up to sun down and only get 2 breaks. They have a very high turn over and not much chance for moving up in the business.
bad,I don't have anything positive to say about Roundy's/Kroger. I would only recommend that a person work at this location if they are looking for some fast cash and looking only to get in for a summer job while at school.
bad,I worked here for a little over two years and kept getting screwed over. My availability kept getting screwed up as well as taking days off. When I went to the schedule person about this they basically didn't care. I put in so much work here and felt like I wasn't appreciated as much as I should have been.
good,unless you are a manager there is no possible way to make enough money to live comfortably with family. union did little to nothing to help. they care more about money than employee well-being.
good,"While you would assume that being a Kroger subsidiary, would make Roundy's and exciting and fun place to work, it sadly has a culture just the opposite. There are many silos within the organization, that collectively hinder team work and innovation."
good,The distribution center where I worked was sold and closed at the time when I left. Had worked there for almost 15 years as an associate and as a supervisor.
good,The order selector position is physically demanding and the rates that the company has set are hard to achieve without sacrificing safety. The other employees are decent for the most part although some of the regulars are a bit stand offish. High rate of turnover.
good,I only did it for the pay and hours available but it is a rigorous and hostile work environment . Management was poor and it takes years until you can be hired on full time.
good,This place is rarely never swamped. You can expect to work 50-77hours which is required. The coworkers can get really segregated. The equipment you use to be able to do your job is falling apart. Safety hazards upon every turn.
good,"They will hire any warm body that walks in the door. That means your co workers could be really nice or really strange or who knows. You will never make any money here as a line worker but if you just need to have something to do and dont care if your paid decent for the work well then go for it. Management is good for the most part but hey they are getting paid a living wage. They work people hard especially in deli and customers dont care and are rude if you don't jump while your doing ten things at once. In the bad areas of the city they have security in store that pays 10 bucks and trust me this is a dangerous job for what you get paid. Just think of all the dangerous people you will try to stop for stealing, .. for ten bucks. Your life and 10 bucks. Do they care.. 10 bucks nough said. Maybe deli is not so bad. Slice my meat so thin I can see through it, no thinner, the other girl new how to do it,Blahh."
good,"Compensation and upward mobility, limited, good Brand, adequate employee discounts, most difficult employment limitations otherwise good culture and fun workplace environment."
good,Happy with position enjoyed training new managers and starting up new stores and departments. Very hectic at times during holidays but enjoyed what I did.
good,After Roundy's was taken over by Kroger as expected may changes for corporate employees.  Many job cuts and not certainty for future.
good,"supervisors did not care what kind of music was being played , very loud for every body to hear. dangerous place to work,people there do not care about the next person.most enjoyable part of the job was quitting time whenever that mite be."
good,Good paying job but hours and and job performance is crazy. Benefits are also great coworkers are okay management is not all that good. The unit they have is okay but could do better
good,This was a part time job experience for about 18 months which I can say that I really enjoyed the people I worked with or the customers I help.  I am glad for the experience.
good,Not much challenging work for an IT professional who wants to grow and learn. Very old school culture. Worked there before Kroger bought Roundy's - could be totally different now.
good,The job is very hard on your body sometimes. picking up heavy boxes at times. The fast pace environment makes the body really tired and stressed. Some of the people are nice tho
good,The manager was very flexible with the work hours and very helpful and professional. What I liked about working at Roundy's was that it was fast-paced which kept me busy until my final hour. Majority of the customers and employees made it pleasant to come to work. I would refer Roundy's as a nice place to work.
good,"A typical day at work involves high stress, and a difficult union environment.  Overall, the distribution center is run with a lack of communication resulting in a high turnover for both union associates and supervisors.  The hardest part of the job is not walking out on a daily basis."
good,"typically work 2-10, stock dairy products for 6 hours then face department for 2 hours. Management is pretty laid back but can be strict at times. Good environment for a first job. The hardest part of the job is lifting up to 30 pounds and the most enjoyable part is working with your fellow coworkers."
good,Fast paced
good,Overall not a bad place to work. however due to the lack of strong leadership in key areas it makes it difficult to maintain consistant quality of daily operations.
good,"Fast paced and never boring.  Many 16 hour days and 7 day weeks.  I enjoyed the company sponsored events, golf tournaments etc.  Good advancement opportunities."
good,"Unforunatly after being bought out by Kroger the company became less of a good place to work for."
good,"I love to order select . Roundys was a good job for me working through Capstone Logistics. I was on the travel, I came home because it was more convenient for me to have the same job where I live."
good,If you cannot work retail hours this is not the job for you. The work is fun and fast paced. Roundy's has undergone a lot of great changes since being acquired by Kroger.
good,Copps/Roundys were very customer oriented and put customer service first. There were always plenty of employees in each department to help assist customers.
good,"Helping to cut select meats for customers and greet them always with a smile, while being professional and courteous at the same time, working quickly to get to the next customer."
good,Keep your head down work your butt off. Slip up a little or have a bad couple of days get written up for percentage. Is union seems to provide some protection for the somewhat lazy.
good,This is a great place to work if you like hardwork and fast pace. But you have to maintain a precentage and that came be hard for even the fastest of people. They are very big I’m wasting company time but are willing to help to an extent. I will apply there again when I’m able to.
good,"A typical day for me was in looking over my work area ,making sure all sale items are full. Stocking what needs to be stocked while checking dates and rotating the product. After all product is full I go through the steps on the gun involving item mark down , residual scans , and ordering ext."
good,People would race each other on similar orders and it was really a fun place to work. It is a union job that they protect their employees. I would definitely go back.
good,Great work environment where everyone works together and gets along.  Working on average 10 hours a day with a guarantied break.  I learned a lot about customer service and product management.
good,No longer in operation.  This company is out of business and this review really has no bearing on any current or future job prospects as no manager that I had worked with is available.
good,"It's a very productive and fast paced place to work. The management team works well with its associates in regards to shift changes attendance etc. However, 2nd shift conflicts with your outside life. Sometimes you have mandatory overtime that may be 1- 3 hours extra a day."
good,Management is helpful and accommodating. Work place feels easy to get used to and co-workers are easy going. Interaction with customers seems to be a main focus
good,"It was okay.  It involved a lot of hard work for little pay which I thought was a bit unfair.  However, when I did floor sales and samples I really enjoyed interacting with costumers."
good,I Would  work for roundys any time. They helped me grow with learning better communication skills that helped me in the long run with my career. With the  skills  I have learned I will  be able to use in every  day life
good,"Excellent place to work, excellent benefits. Monday thru Friday hours, friendly employees, fast paced environment, excellent salary, unlimited overtime,"
good,I liked my hours and how I chose them i just didnt get a lot. A typical day at work was slow but it'd have rushes when it'd get very busy then die down. What I liked most about my job was seeing the different people come through my line. Also my co-workers make it all the better to come to work. Everyone was very friendly and caring.
good,"at my time at Roundy's I was taught too respect others, work safe, work hard, be on time, how to dress for cold and hot condition, that everyone has equal rights"
good,"When arriving to work and before clocking in we would have to get dressed in our freezer jumpsuit and pick up our headset then clock in. After clocking in we would right away head to the the floor and jump on a pallet truck and make sure that our pallet truck had enough battery charge to get me through the whole shift. After having to give the pallet truck a short inspection before use we would have to set up our headsets to pick up our first order. Once we were ready to start work we would load pallets on our truck and began collecting perishable goods from isles of the warehouse. management was always on the floor in case of any emergencies or difficulties encountered on the floor. The co-workers worked right beside you performing there won job duties but also would assist you if help was needed. The hardest part of the job was keeping a certain time percentage of 100% or higher of order completion, if any lower your job could be at risk. An enjoyable part of the job was working along side really good management."
good,Be ready to work!! Overtime is high in demand. Great people to work with and socialized with. Paid is very nice and with overtime is time and half. Incentive programs is also available too.
good,Be on time and make sure that you have enough sleep for the next day . Pay attention to everything they teach you because you will need it And smile .
good,Roundys is a goo place to work at I did great there I was the only girl in the freezer and was kill my percent daily as I got better my manager seen it and gave me the permanent position ASAP !
good,"In my experience – This was a good company to work for. Every area of the organization was open to suggestions, so you had the ability to create your own opportunities and follow through with them. ."
good,"Typical day: As a stocker I would receive my daily assignment and goals and stock throughout the day while assisting customers and other employees if needed. As a cashier I would get my register and and clean my area and check out a high volume of customers and merchandise while providing excellent customer service. As a customer service rep I would receive my register, process lottery purchases, process money orders, answer telephone calls, and direct calls if needed, receive mail, make overhead pages, count down all other cashier's drawers, maintain and clean work area, and close down customer service station at the end of the night. I learned excellent customer service, while keeping calm while in high stress situations, and many technical skills. Management was very professional while maintaining a friendly atmosphere. Coworkers worked together when necessary and kept a friendly, approachable atmosphere for customers. There was no hard part of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the many different customers daily."
good,Nice clean environment.  Fun staff and great customers. Great management and flexible scheduling perfect for high school students to earn some extra cash
good,This job was fast paced and demanded to complete orders in a timely manner and a specific time.  The management was great and they motivated employees.
good,its a very great place to work but the company supervisors when the heat comes down on them they panic and take it out on very ppl that make the company thrive
good,Is a nice place to work on it offer job opportunity for everyone and offers part time for those who are still at school so they can work on weekends and have some extra money for their goals.
good,"- on a typical day at work i will us usually get there early so i'm able to get a good working forklift after i receive my equipment i would proceed up to my locker and get ready for the day.. i work in perishable so i usually wear a lot of clothing then after that i would proceed to go to the pre-shift to see how heavy our work load is for the day...after the pre-shift i will sigh into my computer and follow my work screen as it give me different locations in the warehouse so i can receive different product and scan them with my RC gun and place them were they need to go in the warehouse.."
good,Long 12 hr days pushing and pulling bins and lifting between 5 to 50 pounds making and packaging food products then shipping them off to there designated areas.
good,Everyone there was so sweet and professional. Very great place to work. Pay and hours were good. The produce manager was a bit of a d**k head but other than that everyone else was great!
good,work was filled with young adults around my age. may environment comfortable to be in. worked well with my school scheduled and was understandable for call offs i needed.
good,Great company with great benefits the bosses were helpful far as advice for completing jobs efficently. The hours were good and the people were friendly
good,Its a fast pace  environment you have to bust your butt put the pay is great.the benefits are really good as well and every year you get a raise no matter how you perform that year.
