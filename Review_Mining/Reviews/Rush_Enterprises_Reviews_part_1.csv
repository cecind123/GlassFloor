rating,review
bad,Don't believe what they tell you.  High turnover.in all departments.   Sales Management is a disaster.  Management violates ethical work standards. Don't believe the lies.
bad,The management is a joke  They have no clue on how to run this location employee retention is a joke as well  manager has no idea on how to deal with customers
bad,"Treated unequally. You can work your butt off and not even get a “good job for your hard work.” "
bad,"Working here is like working with little tattle tale teenage girls. Lead techs spend more time sitting on their behinds then working. They make you charge your own parts out, open your own repair orders. And they give you little time to finish your work. They play favorites. They harass you, supervisors put super glue in your hair."
bad,"Don’t work there, company promises things and you never get it. Management is a joke. If you don’t know a skill don’t expect to learn anything. Non-competitive wages"
bad,Place is a joke if you ain't in the managers little circle you starve. Also had to deal with racial comments and belittling your ability to get the job done
bad,"service department manager has no experience, parts manager has no experience,parts counter people have no experience. The only place I have ever worked that routinely runs out of oil, grease, coolant, atf, brake clean, oil filters, ect. The equipment receives no maintenance and frequently is inoperable. Working there was miserable."
bad,The company does not train properly. Had one week of training and they are expecting me to be as fast as a level 5 tech. Boss does not give raises that he promised and will alter your hours if you do not call him out on it. When you get in the company they will not set you up for success.
bad,"will starve you of work when there is a lot of work. poor leadership, too many good ole boys in shop... no proper training, safety is big issue......."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone. The company only promote yes people and cutthroats. I figured after being gone from the company for years the culture would change but it has not.
bad,"Worked in office and had critical health problem, put on LOA while in hospital, called when able to return to work received termination papers next morning."
bad,"Terrible environment, unprofessional, racist management.  Do not waste your time unless you're a Hispanic male you will have problems, women are extremely caddy."
bad,Don't like to cheated on the hrs I work and under pay.no  travel time flat rate not paid right .past work from someone rework I end up fixing and then blame I was to long
bad,Due to management trying to run the shop like it was in the middle of downtown instead of a rural area the shop lost business.  Overworked and under appreciated.
bad,"Worked in Accounting for 1 year, 6 years in warranty back when it was only like 45 stores....I loved the work I did but my bosses were two faced and there was way too much favoritism.... It didn't matter how good of a job you did because the only way to be recognized was if you were a brown noisier. "
bad,"This company is the worse! Broken promises by management! Poor pay and even more poor benefits! Alot of brown nosing going around at this company. The parts driver position is runned by a two face unprofessional manager who don't know anything about being a manager and is only good at micro managing and sitting on his lazy butt and not doing anything all day unless he needs to just so that he can pretend to look busy. He claims to have years and years of manager experience but it doesn't show because he is very ignorant and treats his workers like poorly unless you kiss his butt. He goes around telling people your personal buisness like a female. He has all the time in the world to be on his computer checking to see where your at on the GPS tracking system instead of actually working. He's a very manipulate and sorry excuse of a man. If you do decide to get a job here and especially for the parts driver position I suggest you take notes and cover your butt all the time because he's the type of person who will deny everything when you bring it up to him and will say to you ""I don't ever recall telling you that."" He acts like he's your best friend just so that you can open up to him and tell him things about you and that's his way of using that against you and pretending that he's such a great boss but at the end he's not. He's always on his phone either playing Pokémon or on Facebook or all kinds of stuff while he's on the clock. He really has no clue of what he's doing and instead of doing his job duties and responsibilities he throws them to other employees to do and that's"
bad,This job was a waste of time and very racist. Always was judged based on my size/color. Would not refer anyone to this place.
bad,"hated this place. not professional at all . very judgemental people here.abhdbdfjfnurhfunsdkmkfnngklsmd;admad"
bad,"Management at this company will tell you what they want and how they want to make things better... They will task you with making changes, but as soon as you try they wont back you. They promote little people with degrees to run high intensity dealerships, these managers are poorly trained and have no idea how a truck dealership works. Warranty fraud is a daily event as well as undisplined technicians having there butts covered on bad repairs because they are ""too valuable to lose"" they lie to customers with some elaborate story about how the truck really did need 10k in work done to it. I hated this place it was the most stressful job i have ever had.... I would not recomend this company to anyone, unless you enjoy being miserable on a daily basis!"
bad,A typical day at work is to start the day 30 minutes early ready for trucks to roll into our shop and handle all their necessary maintenance needs no matter how long the hours. I feel that I can learn from the bottom of the maintenance level and rely on that lower level to stay sharp and up to date. I find that the hardest part of my career is the fact that we never stop learning and our industry is driven from advances in technology. I find that the most enjoyable part of my job is when we as a team find the problem to the customer complaint that could not be found by one person; it took a team to come together to find the problem.
bad,"Left GS12 government position for an opportunity with Rush to only find that after 35 days ""due to company realignments"" was terminated. Lousy SOBs. Seriously deficient ethics at high levels. Read the responses...""good old boy,"" and ""who you know."" In the end, the company is profitable and can be a great place to work but buyer-be-ware.  Take a look at their facilities other than their HQ, which their HQ is awesome. Most facilities look like ma and pa's back yard we fix'em you break'em yuk ah yuk shops. Good luck."
bad,this company does not take care of any of their employees. they also talk down on their new employees
bad,"it suck•a typical day at work"
bad,"Wont never work there again rude to people, overcharges for repairs"
bad,"The overall company is good but the Doraville, Ga. that I worked at has poor management."
bad,"Management does not care about employees. Also does not have any idea how to run a truck shop. Does not know the value of good qualified people. If you work hard and do your job, you get treated badly. Be a suck up and don't do your job right, and get what ever you want."
bad,"Unprofessional, and blatant favoritism. Treated you as though you were completely expendable and worthless."
bad,"The old manager was great but the new one is a different story. You get paid flat rate which means if there is no work, you don't get paid. Manager is running business off which means that everyone's pay is being cut but yet he continues to hire new technicians. When you put in your two weeks notice, he just tells you not to come back. He doesn't care about the workers or their families. Belongings also just miraculously go missing and rarely ever turn back up."
bad,Culture is terrible. People are jealous and envious of the work your doing and will do anything to jeopardize your work. Worse than middle school. Avoid Rush!!!
bad,"Management is terrible. They micromanage and are very unprofessional. They speak rudely to the employees and the customers. They have preferences withing the employees and management are instigators, they turn employees against each other"
bad,"Be very careful when applying or wanting to work for Rush.  Everything is controlled by corporate. They might tell you you have holidays off but last minute corporate will say it's mandatory to work your holidays and you have to cancel your plans. Rush also expects you to work as many hours as they need to make budget at the end of the month.  If you are planning on applying make sure to ask about end of the month budget and what is expected."
bad,"Cut throat environment and a bunch of men who respect nothing women can offer.  Was not a nice place to work, undermines the employees to do things that are not required to do."
bad,"Mainly, the entire management staff has absolutely no respect or consideration for an employee who is the sole Warehouse employee at a large truck company, which receives upwards of $50,000 worth of parts and essential equipment per day, incoming and outgoing."
bad,"Worked there for 2 years and never saw management do anything. Ran off the good service writer for another that knew the upper management. Shop foreman was a joke and knew nothing of trucks. Had a ""formula"" for raises that screwed everyone. Was promised $3/HR over two years and got a dime. Be cautious and negotiate pay up front. Benefits are terrible and they do indeed take time from your flat rate pool."
bad,"Their corporate office is in Texas, so other states' locations are merely sets of numbers rather than actual people. No matter how well the branches and their departments do, it is never enough, and more is always expected and added on"
bad,I would not recommend this Company. Poor local management. To much multitasking goes on to many hours. In admin type positions they keep you at work many hours past salary agreed times as to keep from having to hire more employees.
bad,"If you are thinking about working here, DON'T!!!  If you already work here, LEAVE!!! Everyone is always complaining, mostly about the pay, and people are allowed to clock on any work order at anytime without doing any or all of the work because it's unsupervised. If by some chance, you happen to catch someone doing this, nothing is done about it. I caught someone doing that twice. the 1st time we both got a written warning because you aren't supposed to share your pay and hour amounts w/ other employees  and the other person got to keep the hours and money. 2nd time, I didn't say anything, I just didn't do the work and apparently neither did he. 2nd written warning for me, money and hours for the other guy. I guess that is how the shop manager ""Makes it up to you"" for the previous jobs you weren't or partially paid for.. This place is a Joke!!!! You never know if you are going to get paid for your work or not, and you can't even ask about it because then you get blacklisted and you are certainly not going to get paid correctly or you are only going to get jobs with low hours and lots of work. in the end you have no recourse to reclaim any of the money you are owed."
bad,"Management is the worst I've seen, It's very divisive and just overall bad moral. A revolving door, every few months it's all new faces, don't waste your time."
bad,WAYYY too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Constant threats of being fired. Our work is never good enough. They won’t let us take off even though we have vacation days. The surrounding dealerships have way more to offer customers yet we are supposed to beat them with customer service. They can’t even keep a full staff and cut corners. They don’t train you and expect miracles to be performed. They also ask you to find applicants to work their because they can’t keep anyone. It’s a huge joke. The CEO pockets a percentage of sales so the markup is high on everything they sell compared to competitors. Good luck.
bad,"Management is terrible, co workers are drama queens, the entire place is a joke!  Working here was literally like being in the most dramatic soap opera ever created. Racism from Hispanics towards non-hispanics is horrible. Really poor  excuse of a dealership."
bad,Everyone has a not my job mentality. Management is out of touch and manages by spreadsheet only without any idea of what is actually happening. Sending emails calling everyone team is not management.
bad,Everything looks really good when they hire you on.  Then after you get settled in they start changing your job description making you do things that you weren't hired to do. Management hides behind the paperwork to justify everything.  Don't forget at the end of the month you have to make budget and you have to work at least 12 hour days for the last 3 to 5 days.  Health insurance is very expensive and does not give the benefits that they say.  And the most important thing if it wasn't documented in an email it never happened.  They let other employees verbally abused other employees and nothing happens.  I would stay clear of any Rush.
bad,"the company is based on favoritism, they are always looking for a scapegoat, horrible communication, and supervisor was an alcoholic, asst manger rude"
bad,"The company preaches customer experience, but you can't provide great customer experience if you don't take care of your techs. The pay is FLAT-RATE! please beware. Management is non existence. Organization's Culture needs work."
bad,"The pay has changed after the minimum wage changed. It used to be a flat rate straight across. If you didn't work you didn't get paid. if you did you got paid the full hired rate. now that has all changed. you get $18 and hour until you hit %100 efficiency (40 hours billed in a week) then you get your hourly rate. in other words if you are diagnosing the most advanced code or rebuilding an engine your doing it for $18. same goes for the guy doing wheel seals which doesn't pay well. the hours to complete a job are dropping (1.25 hours to lift front of paccar engine and replace engine side motor mount brace?) the tech is in charge of finding parts prices and location for all repairs and opening/closing claims through engine manufacturers that are warranty. this process only pays .4 hour max. they installed security cameras and hired a third party business to monitor techs who are now getting threats of $1000 - $10000 fines for clocking in out of uniform, safety glasses, and wheels being chocked. They do NOT give raises, if you put your two weeks in its a 50% chance they tell you to get out right then and there. The shop supplies a 50' air hose and that's it, and its not even safe (hose clamps on brass and unregulated shop air). no 1"" impact or anything like that. the only saving grace here is the opportunity to get a great resume. they will throw anyone on any job so you can get a lot under your belt fast. In three years i have NEVER seen a tech get fired based on misdiagnosis, poor performance, or damaging a truck. the other techs are really good people. no thieves, and everyone"
bad,Company had rapid growth in very short time span.  Emphasis was mainly on growth and not on employee engagement
bad,"You will come into work regretting it till the day you leave. You will be lied to constantly, overworked, underpaid for the amount of work they expect from you. "
bad,"This place is terrible for employees and customers. I would never take anything to be repaired there and I definitely wouldn't recommend working there unless you enjoy being used and no matter what you do it's never enough. Some of the worst work I have ever seen has been done there, if they break something they aren't going to tell you but you will be charged for it. If your problem is diagnosed wrong guess what ""it's not their fault"" and you will be charged over and over until they figure it out. I have seen so many people ripped off there. "
bad,First this company pays flat rate. This company plays favorites. If you are looking for training good luck. They promised that they will train you and they do not.. They will go through and train certain people and that is it. They start off pretty much everybody at the about the same rate. No matter what your experience is. Unless you're willing to suck up and kiss their butt you are not going to get anywhere. And since they are a flat rate shop they will steal the time from certain mechanics to help pad other mechanics times. The place is not worth your time. Some of the mechanics that work in the shop are good people. It's just a management there is horrible.
bad,Just another employee asking too many questions that nobody else wants to ask but are wondering the same but afraid to ask. Changes or new ideas are not welcomed.
bad,This job is not for the hard worker and people that want to grow with a company. Raises are only a quarter if your on hourly. I’m commission only and didn’t get the proper training I needed.
bad,If you are just starting out in this industry and are not familiar with how a flat rate shop works then this is not the place for you. It has a revolving door policy. If you find something better and try to put in your two week notice they let you go right there on the spot. The management is not very good and there is a decent amount of favoritism that goes on. If you get a big job to do and make even the slightest mistake you aren't allowed to do any more big jobs.
bad,"They preach training, paccar/Cummins certificates, major advancements in your career during the phone and in Person interviews however the only “training” was the first 3 weeks after being hired on, sitting behind a computer. After that they just throw you into the shop with absolutely no clue how to clock into jobs, getting parts, proper procedures, etc. you ask management and they tell you to ask another tech. Doing this gets you nowhere as you ask 5 guys and get 5 different answers."
bad,Pay is ok . At least its hourly but if you have actual grown up bills ! Look elsewhere.... insurance for a family is unaffordable and they don't care about hourly employees. They take care of the office people and management that's it . Theres no opportunity to make money only pencil pushers get monthly bonuses off the backs of people actually doing the work
bad,"youll be working on jobs if your a good diagnose person, be prepared to have jobs taken from you either cuase your off day or because you weren't on the morning shift"
bad,"New hire and first day had no bay to work out of. This is a flat rate shop and only the yes men make their hours and money, everyone else is left in the dark. Parts dept is really bad, it takes on ave 1.5 hours to get parts to you and you eat into the job time getting parts. no shop tools and everything is broken or lost. Management has no idea how to run a service dept, very young crew. They will lie and steal from you to get the jobs done, not worried about your paycheck. Guys there are making only $800 on pay period (2 week). So with big flatrate pay per hour, not getting jobs done. you lose a lot of time."
bad,"I was an outside sales rep. Learned a lot. Their training is horrible. Customer service is horrendous. My parts manager didn’t have leadership skills.  Condescending, rude, unprofessional when dealing with irate customers. There are a few salesman that will stay there forever. Co workers were pretty great and very helpful. Worked during my vacation and sometimes on my days off."
bad,One of the worst jobs I have ever been recruited for. Closed door meeting for several hours a day by management. Management is consistently pulling you in the office for reprimands on things you cannot change or have no control over. Everyone speaks behind your back. If that isn't bad and stressful enough. You're constantly getting ripped a new one by irate customers. I'd rather be homeless then work a single day at this poor excuse for a business.
bad,Started off really good working for Rush. New Management came in and changed everything. There is no work and no money to be made here. Techs are all struggling to make money and no longer have a drive to come to work. If work ever picks up it would be a good place to work. Hardest part is Flat Rate pay working on trucks rusted every where and anywhere.
bad,"i worked for rush truck center in joliet il.i was laid off,they told be to reapply.for my postion.they have two job listings for warehouse clerk.reapply still did not hear from this company.i think its my age.its been over two months."
bad,This company acts like they care for the Customer but that couldn’t be farther from the Truth. The management is a group of people that care only Them
bad,Had bad experience. We were bought out by Rush and were told we were profitable and nothing was going to change. Visit then people were being let go with 48 hour noticed.  I left before the grand closing. The way they treated our employees left bad taste in my mouth. Would not recommend
bad,"ive been working here for a while and the managers have 0 technical experience they also promise the world and deliver none of it they give you less than book time for most jobs for example i was given a job that was replace both front center pins and ubolts , replace shocks and do a 3 axle alignment  i was given 4 hours to do all of it book on just an alignment is 3.5 hrs"
bad,"Terrible place to work at. The managers do not care about the employees. Very fast pace of work. A lot of employees coming and going, high rate of turn over. That company does not pay u hourly, when u get payed, you have money missing from your pay. All the employees are stressed out all the time. Stay away from this Place!"
bad,Everyone in the Atlanta location has to be the boss. You are always wrong no matter who you listen to. They don't have anything together at all. Overly micromanaged by incompetent people.
bad,"Been at this company three years and I am looking for another job fast. Coworkers are not good; no communication between departments; no team work; boss is a idiot. "
bad,"Manager is hardly in the office.  Poor direction and a very ""clicky"" place to work.  If you weren't part of the click they made it known.  I would not recommend working here"
bad,"I have learned quite a bit form working there. I have learn how to use many different computer programs like Karmak, SAP, and was able to get more advanced in Microsoft. I aslo learned how to use outlook. I enjoyed working for them and I enjoyed what I did. I loved making each and every store happy."
bad,"Understaffed - Can never stay caught up.  Very stressful."
bad,As a piece or flate rate worker you may or may not get paid for jobs complete and it will be months down the line. Corporate office had to force management to give raises.
bad,"Company has different sets of rules depending on person they affect.  The HR department lacks consistent practices and picks and chooses who to enforce rules with.  As a public company, I’m surprised they aren’t in more litigation that they currently are.  It’s coming. Customers, employees."
bad,"Pay is based mainly on commission, commision based on monthly goal, monthly goal is set by corporate & is just out of reach. Monthly goal has been obtained only a hand full of times in last few years."
bad,"Rush is going through some growing pains. Large corporate mindset with a very small town feel amongst dealerships. Very poor communication from corporate to each location. If you like to travel, if you dip tobacco and if you are not a suit and tie kind of individual then this company is for you. They are a very large auto group and run on a good old boy system. You will get exposed to all executives if you prove yourself and work your tail off however that does not always mean you will get promoted. Must be willing to relocate to probably the worst areas in the country and put your time in at each location before you can move to the corporate office. There are a few genuine people who still exist at Rush. Those people are what make the company great. They believe in the company and that is what probably keeps the company together."
bad,"Not a good work environment. Lack of managment."
bad,"The way the shop runs and is managed needs work, customers aren't taken care of like company promotes. Process is to long for taken care of customer needs."
bad,The warehouse position is rediculous. Low pay Long work Hours. 7am to 6 or 7pm. No Roomba forse advancement. Poor management. Poor job all around. I would not recommend.
bad,"I have zero idea WHY I'm rating this company, as I had no intentions to.  As a result of it appearing to be mandatory, I can only say that my experience and education made my managers too nervous being over-qualified for the position."
bad,Rush looks like a nice place to work for in cleveland but dont. Management  doesnt talk to supervisors and communicate. Everyone is depressed due to labor times and pay. Work is fast pace if you find an oil drain or a jack. Facilities  needs some upgrades
bad,"This employer is run like a circus. It looks ok from the outside but inside is lack of management, no written processes, depends on who trains you if you even get trained. A definite ""good ol boy"" company. The son forced the father to retire and is now suing his own father! No morals at all."
bad,Was a fun place to work coworkers had smiles on buildings are in good condition wasn't hard to keep them cleaned last few years been down sizing readying for retirement
bad,Good ole boy network is alive and well. It is all about whose butt you kiss and not necessarily what is best for the company. Arrogance and  nepotism are rampant.
bad,"I sold my home in Mableton GA, promised work for as long as I wanted to work there, moved to Oklahoma, was laid off because the reputation of the shop has caused a great decrease in their customer base. Flatrate mechanic's nightmare, time is stolen from every check you get."
bad,"Overall, a learning experience of what to look for in an employer. I was not given enough time to be properly trained, nor was I ever trained thoroughly."
bad,fellow techs are always helpful when I needed help. loved working on big trucks and heavy equipment. but the place lack a good production manager and service writers
bad,"Very little communication and no idea what anyone was doing. For a billion dollar company, no training and poor benefits. In nine months, one department meeting."
bad,"They will tell you what you want to hear to get you in, then after a bit they'll back flag anything they can. The shop foreman knows nothing about trucks, gives work to who he likes. Management is chaos, when it's slow they starve guys until they quit. They are always hiring even though there's no work. And don't forget the required 7hr Saturdays for pm's. You'll be lucky to make 4hrs. Unless you're really fimiliar with flat rate you will work 50 hrs and be paid 30-35."
bad,"Only saw the money, customer was nothing more. Management only cared about making forecast. Technicians not happy to be there. Complained constantly about lack of work. Most repairs revolved around emissions. Most emission repairs not covered by manufacture warranties and typically cost thousands in repair cost."
bad,"come to work , work for a day clock out and go home . A large variety of work to do, some aspects of this company are very good.  Some of them are not so good."
bad,"Was given the bare minimum training to get by, never was given direction on how to complete certain tasks. Little to no communication from any one given employee to the next, let alone structured communication from the top down. Such poor management that it would be a joke except for the people that have to suffer through it. Management does whatever they feel like with no repercussions. The one manager had the ethics hotline called on him 5 times in a 1 year period. Every time they investigated they couldn’t find anything wrong despite stacks of evidence (promoted someone to assistant Mgr that he didn’t go through corporate for, romantic relationship with this person, only puts in 4-6 hrs per day, lies about reports to make things look better on paper, $4 million parts department that constantly and consistently does not have needed everyday parts, etc). This is only one example of how terrible the location is run. Perhaps others are better, but Gary Indiana is all about micromanaging, fudging numbers, and BSing customers. First job that I’ve ever been let go from with absolutely no reason given. I guess I was too outspoken about how screwed up the place is?"
bad,"Rush has great plans at a corporate level. Local management is caddy and to busy with their personal adjectives to care about company issues. "
bad,"Fast paced company and good benefits, can work your way up with hard work. Good ole boy type atmosphere. Depending on department customer interaction is good/bad."
bad,"Rush Enterprises has great potential to be a company worth working for.  Unfortunately, now is not that time!  Rush has expanded to rapidly, forcing them to make drastic, unethical decisions in order to try and maintain a profitable truck sales and service market.  During my endeavors with Rush within the greater Cleveland/Akron area, I witnessed and was forced to be part of many unethical decisions that lead to the termination of many talented technicians and parts personnel.  Rush pays great (with proper negotiations) and has a good benefits package to offer.  My only warnings to a person looking to make a good career choice is to beware that Rush is not loyal to their employees no matter how talented or profitable you may be for the company.  The management within Rush needs major reconstruction before I could ever give them a better review."
bad,"its an ok job but not too much work, management has too much control over your check and they have mechanic favorites making it hard to get work."
bad,"They hire you at base pay of 20 something, but in order to get your base pay of what ever they offer you need to dish out 100% effeciency to even see it, anything below 100% is $18/hr."
bad,Managers do not care about the workers and they have lost a many great people due to harassment and bias behavior. This is a corrupt company where the Human resources department is helping wipe out reports on issues. Safety is a big concern since OSHA would have a field day in these places. Only good thig is that its stable for the time being.
bad,"If you like spending your days frustrated by bureaucracy and poor management, this is the place for you! The good old boys network at RTC means questionable performers with questionable management skills will run your world. Truly a toxic environment. Not sure how the Colorado stores stay in business with the amount of financial waste they generate. I guess the other stores across the country are able to carry this area."
bad,"The culture described by the leadership and written down in their codes and  policies is  more mythological than reality.  Discipline is not consistent.  Nepotism and favoritism can be observed though out the organization..  Politics not policy drives most decision-makers at the corporate level.  There is an atmosphere of distrust between the home office and the dealerships. If it wasn't written down, it wasn't said. Verbal abuse is the norm.  The human resources department fails to address  gross misconduct if the decision is not popular. They advise on what the right course of action is, but support any decision that is made-even the wrong one. The job was great but the culture repulsive."
bad,Best way to describe this company to many leaders not enough followers. Everyone wants to be in charge and lack on communication. The manager steers towards threatening to get things done his way. Treats employees very poorly. When speaking to a higher power ther say they understand your concerns and nothing gets done beyond that.
bad,management and pay is a joke. This company pays flat rate but it does not run anywhere near efficiently enough for it to fairly pay the techs at flat rate. Every other tech had a problem with their pay every single pay period and there's no way to see how your efficiency came out at the end of the week or what you got paid for exactly. It's a scam here. There were weeks where I was sure I made my flag rate but I was not paid my flag. Not to mention management change every 3-4 months. It's no wonder they get sued every other month.
bad,"There are some great people at Rush. But, there are too many managers, too many people who drop the ball, too many people who lack accountability, and too many people that are focused on too many things other than their job. The issue is that nobody works together. Aftermarket part reps are treated as lesser staff than truck sales. Truck sales are seen as arrogant and snobbish. Inside guys pick favorites. Managers have too many things going on to pay attention to their objectives. Parts can be spotty. Delivery of parts is hit or miss. They want to claim their inventory is all makes and all models. It simply isn’t. They have too many gaps to be effective. It’s a good place if you have low expectations. I just didnt see it as the bright, shiney object they promised. My boss was great. But there were simply too many bosses that I didn’t know who did what most times. It was annoying. Rusty Rush seems to have a lot going on. He seems engaged in the company, however from what I’ve been told he’s surrounded by yes men and doesn’t really understand the issues that his company has because he’s so insulated."
bad,"Do not expect to receive pay raises in any timely manner. It is nearly impossible to receive one. There is a lot of micro-managing. It started out fairly great but now it is over flowing with micro-management. About the only way to be given any kind of training is to already have been to a tech school. Other than that, it is nearly strictly hands on training. Usually, it is hard to get the management to even barely like you. We have managers that no matter what you do, you cannot please them. It seems as though nothing you do is good enough unless you are able to make the quoted time limits, which are nearly impossible to meet."
bad,"No formal structure for career advancement. Only merit increases offers any hope of increasing your pay.  If you start off with a high salary, good luck making anything for the rest of your career.  Directors and other senior management do not believe in assuming responsibility but instead resort to blaming others.  Not a good environment for progressive leadership."
bad,You get to learn a lot and I enjoyed it as a learning experience. Not a great job for advancement. They cut a lot of corners and one of them is your pay check. You can work super hard or not work very hard at all and you chances are of of a raise are the same. It can be depressing but I truly hope it improves because the individuals that work for rush are some of the coolest people I have ever met.
bad,"Rush Enterprises is one of the leading heavy duty truck sales and service companies.  I worked at the front counter in the Service Department.  On a average day my co-worker & I would write about 25 new repair orders, answer 80+ phone calls, manage repair orders that were still active, contact and keep customer up to speed on repair status.  "
bad,"Management act helpful but are more interested in how they appear to corporate than what is truly needed by employees. Coworkers are wonderful to work with. 95% of coworkers are female so a little back biting occurs. Be quiet, don't make suggestions, follow orders without question and mind your own business and all will go well."
bad,"No work life balance and you feel like a number not an employee. Managers do want to help and see you be successful, but it's usually needing you to work more. Understaffed in most departments."
bad,"had a foreman whom liked to play with the hours at the end of the week, I would be short hours no just a couple but like 10 to 20 plus hours a week, I wrote everything down, but  still spent almost three hours of my own time on Fridays proving my hours, the last time it was 27 hours short I packed up, punched out and left...."
bad,"it was an okay job, didn't pay well enough for its hassle. be prepared to work weekends and be on call. also use your vacation and sick time before you put in your 2 weeks, they will not pay you back."
bad,Overwhelmed with work loads. Loved the actual position. Could not ask for better co-workers. Hardest part is trying to keep up. Management didn't seem involved with the actual job-maybe they didn't know how to do the job and therefore had others training for the postions. Not very clear.  Be very careful of the political/power issues between the managers themselves.
bad,Did not enjoy my time employed for Rush. Culture isn't for everybody. Must grow up around trucks and truck products. Not for everybody. There were some good people behind the scenes
bad,"Working in the shop is fine, nothing reayto complain about. The management on the other hand seems like they never have a plan for anything, more worried about their business and less worried about helping lower level employees."
bad,"The biggest complaint I had, which was expressed by most coworkers I dealt with, was the poor management and attitude thereof. The company has the potential to be a fine place to work. The health insurance and other benefits are actually quite nice and affordable (or they were for a single employee). Furthermore, I'm not a huge fan of flat rate pay, especially when favoritism is associated with it -- makes it hard to make a living. Other than those few items, if Rush could straighten management out where I was they would be a superb place to work."
bad,The manager above myself knew very little about the trucks or trucks in general. Due to this it was hard to see eye to eye with the individual. Parts were always readily available. The pay was low compared to other places.
bad,Overall work experience was not good. Management lacked organization which lead to overloads of extra work. Warehouse is very dusty and spider bites are common.
bad,"Before  a corporation bought our company we were a small business where it was a great place to work. I worked 20 years for the previous company. Our CEO, managers & supervisors cared about the employees and  helped to make our jobs less stressful. I do wish I could have learned Microsoft office. The software I used  was made specifically for my job. I enjoyed my job as I got to meet a lot of customers and venders.The hardest part of my job was getting correct information that was needed  to complete a job task. The best part of my job was working with all coworkers and learning new things."
bad,"I was very happy working at  Rush truck, they have a good environment  and also they give a lot of training with the makes that we work for like Isuzu trucks and Hino trucks. They had to make downsizing and i stayed over a year with them so  thats why I left the company."
good,"When I accepted this position, it was with the expectation that there would be two associates in the office. One of these associates was relocated to another office located in Adairsville, Georgia. I was not aware of any attempt in hiring personnel to relieve me to take my lunch break, nor was it discussed with me how I would be relieved."
good,"Positive clean environment"
good,I enjoyed the work; Company needs better management and management skills. It is about who you know and not what your skills are.
good,"poor work enviorment, not enough hours, too many mechanics not enough work, pay not equivelant to work experience,, needs more wrk new shop trying to establish itself, foreman are no help have no clue"
good,Came to work early every day to start my day. Worked and did everything needed for all locations and managers at the best of my ability. I've learned to leave work each day knowing that I did my best and it will be there tomorrow. Management does not give the recognition or appreciation to all its employees.  The hardest part of this job is coming into work everyday not knowing if what I was doing was good enough.  My manager never told me one way or the other. The most enjoyable part of this job is my co-workers and of those who did not work in my department.
good,Not a very diverse work place. Coworkers were easy to get along with. Working part time you don't get many hours. overall it was a good place to work.
good,"Typically would come to work, check in inventory, pull tickets and prepare shipments. I learned a lot about being able to multitask and prioritize work. Management was great as far as producing capital goes, but horrible team building environment. There is a lot of favoritism involved and little is done to help you grow and mold into a more dynamic individual, personally or professionally. co-workers are extremely unhelpful in most cases and only care about their own success instead of the success of the company and the team as a whole."
good,Overall a good place to work if the management issues were straightened out.
good,As with all large corporations rush has many positive and many negative aspects to it. There is a really great group of mid level employees to work with throughout the organization but once it gets to the highest level it becomes the standard corporate mindset. This isn't necessarily bad but after time you begin to question if this is the right company to continue with. That being said the original principles from the founder are still spoken of by his son Rusty but I believe right beneath him is where its more about the bottom line and investors than it is about the people making it happen
good,"Stressful place to work, at times management was so busy covering their butt and avoiding managerial duties that work was unbearable.. There was a revolving door of regional managers doing the same, covering their butt and looking to move up or on. All mechanics were placed on flat rate, turning them into impatient children when their parts weren't ready when they needed them Lack of staff in the parts department meant wearing many hats, too much multi-tasking to do, not enough time to do it right. Rush has the most dealerships and the most managerial turn over than any other company I have worked for.They want numbers and they don't care who gets stepped on to get them."
good,I had a great first few years but seen a lot of turn over and management was horrible Very busy and long days with not much upper manager support. You were thrown out there to figure it out for yourself.
good,"Typical Day of work includes getting there 30 minutes early and going over all the is available to work on."
good,"A typical day at work would include punching into the timeclock and then spend the rest of the day processing invoices along with other tasks. I became familiar with SAP and Karmak. Management wasn't supportive and it was hard to learn from them. My co-workers were a mix of hard and not-so-hard workers. The hardest part of the job was acquiring additional information for my day-to-day procedures and the company's operating policies. Although the training was very poor, I managed to learn various procedures using SAP and Karmak."
good,"As a salaried employee, my hours soon went to 13-14 hours per day. Aside from my regular job responsibilities, there was an excess of paperwork, often doing the same figures three different ways for no good apparent reason. Corporate employee distrust was to where you almost felt more like an inmate rather than employee."
good,"I worked for Rush for 7 years, starting a a Tech the first year and later promoted to foreman. The first 2 years were under great leadership. I learned from great mentors and had a bright future and looked at this company as home. during year 3, the General/Regional manager was promoted and a new general manager took over and fired or replace most of those mentors. under his management, I learned more of what not to do in this business. He turned the culture toxic, killed moral and hindered growth. I reluctantly left, to pursue goal set at that company and currently Manage a dealership service department for a Rush competitor."
good,"If the Management was better, it would be hard to beat as a place to work. The benefits were okay, Half hour lunches, the other technicians were all really cool dudes and were always willing to give you a hand with anything"
good,"I worked here as my first official big shop, was hired on as a bus installment tech which was good until I couldn't move forward to what I wanted, i did mostly a/c installs for over a year and not much of anything else camera installs here and there"
good,"The work rarely resembled the job description.  Rather than a focus on our product lines, we spent considerable time on developing an 'all makes catalog', or soliciting funds for the catalog among our vendors.  When we were working within our job descriptions, there was little lee way for personal initiative.  Management was heavily task driven, rather than goal driven."
good,empty promises /decisions come from out of state hard to get local decisions. work a lot of holidays great place for plenty of oem training very strong nationally and still growing
good,Shop has a/c and heat. All about making the company money. Employees are neglected and not respected for their hard work. Co workers clash due to the way company pays them on flag time.
good,"Shop has lots of favoritism just like any other shop. Jobs were under bid, When there’s work there’s money to be made when it slows down better hope some one likes you to get some work. Moved to mobile and the same BS they had there own Group. There buddy techs had accounts but some of the other guys had to sit around and wait for jobs. sometimes wouldn’t get a job till the end of the day. Moved to the oil field and the same thing. I was there 5 years never got sent for training but new hires got sent."
good,You get sent to ND to work as a sub for Schlumberger and you have to check in with a traveling district mgr. who only texts and dodges your phone calls. You can't book a flight on time off until the mgr approves your time off and that can sometimes only replied to days or the day before you buy your flight. It was a circus. They have no business sub contracting in oilfield. They have since fired that mgr. but their corporate help in Laredo was just as bad. $20/Hr 2 weeks on 1 off unpaid and no tool reimbursement . Phone calls rarely got returned or in a timely manner.
good,"Average company with a bigger dose than usual of that good old boy mentality you see so often in the south. They also have an almost abnormal fixation on pedantic rule sets. The types of things that serve little purpose, other than hindering productivity."
good,"Good people, nice team, terrible management. Hovering and hijacking tactics. no respect for anyone or their time. insane turnarounds. Horrible VP of marketing. Worst person ive ever met."
good,working at rush truck center was ok. The best part was working with my co-workers. Working with management was not so good. I was not the only that felt that way.
good,"To much micro managing of employees. Management tries to run the business with spreadsheets, there is no reality to management actually working with the employees. Excuses are made instead of raises given out to hard working employees."
good,"This is a decent place to work, I have learn new thing everyday such as warrenty claims with Cummins, Night shift co-workers are very helpful to each other, The hardest part of the job like any other jobs is keeping up with paperwork, It is a great day when you pull one truck from shop and pull another in"
good,There is much to learn about trucks and the trucking maintenance repair industry and this company excels in teaching their Technicians to be on the up and up on truck repair
good,This could have been a wonderful place to work but the owner had poor business sense. A controlling and untrustworthy person. The business is now no more.
good,"It was a great place to work the first 4 months. I put a lot of blame on the manager. NOT a bad guy! Just showed favoritism to his sales team, while giving the feeling everyone else is expendable/unimportant. I wish those guys the best in there future endeavors."
good,Working at rush was something different challenging and exciting for me I loved all the coworkers and there was definitely plenty of room to grow and learn the only problem was the flag hours for each job we are underpaid and when you did get a job where you had game time to make your top dollar pay it never showed up on my paycheck that was the most stressful part of the job knowing that you are getting your bottom dollar amount when you know you worked hard and earned your top dollar where did that money go??
good,"Laid back place to work. Poorly managed. Would love to continue employment here but the service side is losing work, and now I’m not doing what I enjoy."
good,"If company is busy commission if great but if business is slow then commission it is not fun,   Also have to file your own warranty claim with Cummins engine company and could be on the phone for a hour or more"
good,"Smaller locations have issues with general management, this applies to the employees as well as the customers."
good,We were required to work 50hrs a week as warehouse/parts drivers. The pay per hour was not competitive in the local industry and management was not friendly. Over worked and under appreciated. I was terminated because I refused to work 12 hours on a day that I originally requested off. Turned in my two weeks notice 4 days prior and management deemed that I was a security risk after 18 months of dedicated/hard work. Co-workers weren't friendly and show blatant favoritism. Nepotism was also blatantly obvious.
good,You can learn allot about how a dealership works and how they run them in every aspect of the company.
good,"I worked at a rush truck leasing location & if most of you all  did not know rush truck centers has different companies that you can work in. I had been working at rush truck leasing for sometime, money was ok since they would only let you work 40hrs with no overtime. No training what so ever & raises were no good. Big companies like this do not appreciate your hard work & for them you are just a number. That they soon will get rid off if things are not adding up at the end of every year. If applying here ask for good money & stick to it, do not let them promise you anything because they are not trustworthy!!!"
good,I enjoyed working in the field and building relationships with the hiring managers but felt HR was not well aligned in their support. I learned to work under extreme pressure.  I managed over 100 open requisitions on a daily basis.
good,"Rush is publicly traded. As such, the added stress of corporate life is added. Company is result oriented and fast paced. Can be a great place to work, Varies by location. 401k and stock options are very nice."
good,"This company has great compensation and benefits. Learned how to work with all types of people. Very fast pace work environment, if you like having a job that is constantly busy you are in the right place."
good,Good place to learn about the job with alot of info to pick up on a daily basis. The commission pay kills it because certain people can get high paying jobs through favoritism which can leave others scrapping to add up time through work that may not be there.
good,High paced and high stress results driven environment with high rewards. The typical day starts with handling phones on truck status updates and scheduling work flow in the shop. Training scheduling and warranty processing.
good,"Rush is not the most competitive with salary or benefits, but for such a large company it still feels relatively small fostering a positive work culture with access to high level execs which provides experiences that may make up for some of the lack of competitivness in compensation. A good place to start a career and a good place to end a career if you are brought in at a high level position. Not a great place to stay for advancing your career as upward mobility in many corporate departments is extremely limited. Leadership is passionate about what they do, and the environment is pretty laid back and flexible in most departments for salaried employees which is also a benefit you may not find at other companies"
good,"The company itself is a good establishment. The managers at this location on the other hand are unwilling to provide nescessary equipment, decent facilty, and have very little regard for your safety."
good,"customer satisfaction, provide estimates, close invoices."
good,"Assigned jobs to mechanics  "
good,"Always busy environment, afforded opportunities for growth within company.Supported by corporate office."
good,"Great work environment "
good,I started there with minimal experience and they have a decent training program. I would like to continue my employment with the company but I’m relocating and they do not have a dealership in the area I’m moving to so I have to find something else.
good,"Don’t give yearly raises, often asked to do more work and not get compensated. More often than not, won’t promote you to another position even when you apply for said job"
good,"Great company to work for, Fast pace, always something to do, I worked for this company for 15 years and have had several positions held, started as a service advise and made it to the service manager."
good,Rush Enterprises worked fast and efficiently with helping me get work. Their main goal is to help get you a job and they did just that. They continue everyday to help people get jobs and make sure everyone who applies under their services have employment.
good,It’s a good place to get your feet wet in transportation. The women in the office would play friendly until you excelled and seemed like a threat to them. Then they turned on you. There was A LOT of office gossip. The manager would essentially have them working against each other constantly having them give daily reports of everyone’s “activities”. (Snitching on people for any minor thing). Management played the good ol’boy game. Unprofessional. I would say there was favoritism but it really was just management playing the staff to get what they wanted for nothing.
good,do not get the respect that you deserve switch you to other jobs even if your  not done with job you are working on could be better if management would work better together
good,"Worked repairing chemical trucks and prepping new chemicals ready for sale. I learned to do brakes and inspections to get my M.V.I, license. At the time which was awhile back Management was fine. Liked the workplace atmoshere was good."
good,Good place to work. I started there right after store opening and there has been many changes since I have left so I am unsure of what the work/business is now.
good,Good place to work still have good friends there and will stop to se them. Must stay in con tack with customer have to up date custom twice a day .had great customer contact work with with me a lot .
good,"Rush is a corp run business with corp values"
good,"its an ok place to work, has flexible hours, only management are stressfull on you and can ask a lot. raises are given with no time you have to ask for it or youll never get it."
good,it was a decent place to work. the guys are pretty easy to get alone with. clean work areas. good group of people in the parts department. definitely a good place to work and get the experience that they have to offer.
good,"Good place to work.  Good Co-Workers. Management was ok. Fast paced environment.  I learned a lot about trucks, truck sales and how a dealership is run.  Nice big facility."
good,"Overall good place to work for, good pay and available. Dispatcher would try and over do the other mobile guys from time to time. I had my specific yards to go to and made good money for what I did."
good,"Great opportunity to learn in a business environment.  Had the opportunity to receive training in various functional areas of the business.   However, the training plan was not well organized,"
good,I get a job and  I do it to the best of my ability.  I haven't learned anything more for that they don't give me anything more that what I'm capable of. The managers don't come out on the floor to see how we are doing. The guys I work with are great to get a long with. The hardest part is that we have to work 2 wks in order to get 3 he's toward vac days. The enjoyable part is working with the other mechanics.
good,very demanding environment long hours stressful situations at all hours of the day and night. seldom dealing with happy customers as the only time they contact you is during and emergency or crisis.
good,pull parts for all three shops plus pull parts for delivery and for pick up customers. if the truck parts that i am pulling is to big or heavy i would use the stand up forklift or the sit down forklift.
good,"Job seems to be ok, more work than money. Weekends off and very little overtime. Employees are generally friendly and try to get along with each other."
good,"Great working condition, staff and management work together, organization supports the staff and management.  Safe working conditions, advancement opportunities"
good,Busy work days. Made the day go by quick. I learned about the business. Management was not very trustworthy.  A lot of turnover.  Saw a lot of employees come and go during my employment.
good,pretty good place to work employees are good people the management listens to your opinions. they are flexible with your schedule sometimes...
good,i worked as a technician on commision the management was very good about spreading the jobs out evenly…………………. ……………………. ……………………………. ………………………….  ……………………………….. …………….
good,awesome and understanding group of people that I have worked for. very accommodating and understanding in every aspect
good,"Company is growing fast and furious. Long hours, lots of travel but the end users are great. Corporate standards are high and because we are publically traded all the numbers are transparent."
good,"Receives, counts and records shipment data into the system. Matches packing list information to actual packed merchandise. Prepares packages/merchandise for storage."
good,"I love going to work and seeing everyone, and if you need help with a problem they are not scared to help in any way shape or form. just great people all around."
good,"fast pace job, delegated by customer need. centrally located trucking company with easy access to customers."
good,"A typical day at work... There really nothing typical here, this is a fast pased enviroment were the work is constanly changing, great co-workers, management."
good,"Must have patience and strong multitasking abilities. Know how to handle upset and unhappy customers. Manage core inventory for various manufactures, technicians, and front office."
good,I was allowed to run my department the way I wanted for the most part and it reflected in my numbers.  I was made to feel very insecure about my position regardless of how well I produced.
good,You are constantly on the move. More often than not there is not enough time in the day to complete all task assigned to you. Problem solving and the ability to improvise are a must. Although management treats people more like tools than people and has a disconnect with the people at ground level. Spreadsheets carry more weight than experience.
good,"Good place to work. Customer driven.Long hours."
good,"In my time with Rush, I learned plenty. I moved around plenty more. I began at one of the lowest possible positions and managed to apply my skills in quite a few seats, donning quite a few hats. I offered to extend my responsibilities and they gladly allowed me to do so. I learned their software rather quickly and was even given the opportunity to fly out of state to provide training for employees and managers who were new to the software. The atmosphere in this location is demanding and does require ones attention to be split very often. The success of meeting the steep goals is pride evoking but that often fades quickly as the joy of success is primarily celebrated at the top of the the totem pole and the bottom players are told to get back to work. Management, however skilled, seems to miss the value of their employees and their personal lives, as well as their workplace pride. The numbers, the name-dropping, the reputations and achievements, this is what matters here, and in that, Rush Truck Center Peterbilt does well."
good,Working at Rush Truck Leasing as a Technician has daily challenges that allow one to achieve greater knowledge of the equipment we work on. Plus build stonger customer service and customer interactive skills that could prepare anyone to advance into a management position if desired.
good,"Rush Enterprises has some amazing employees that work hard and are very dedicated. A typical day at work is teaching SAP processes and support during ""go live"" periods."
good,"After 5 years of hard work, dedicating myself to helping this company, I was denied any chance for a raise. Am asked to do work that I am not compensated for. Management is disorganized and communication skills are very poor."
good,Okay company to work for but not very good pay and a lot of broken promises.
good,"Very busy days when working in the warehouse. Fast pace."
good,"Great faciltiy but is not a place for a person/persons raising a family. Work is not secure and comes and goes. If you don't do any work, you don't get paid"
good,"A typical day would be: diagnosing aftertreatment problems. Rush has a very good technical advisor that we can rely on when we get in a bind. Also Rush has a very good  training system for there PACAR MX Engines, as well as there online safety training course. Management: WELL at RTLPR management is pretty new with different values than what I was brought up with, I'm old school fix it right and not have to bother with it again. Over all Rush Truck Leasing is not a bad place to work"
good,"Not a bad environment, parts took a long time to acquire which isn't good on flat rate pay (by the book). Friendly employees and helpful people throughout."
good,"Answer phones and take walk-in customers. Be able to understand what problems they need corrected and find the correct avenue to fix set problem. Issue purchase orders for service technicians, and process those PO's properly afterword. Try to get the customer back on the road as soon as possible because their time truly is their money."
good,Insurance for my son and I is $800 a month then no benefits until you reach your deductible. 401k match is next to nothing. No time and a half for overtime and now required to work holidays.  Maybe if they got rid of the stupid NASCAR team they could take care o
good,"good job experiance"
good,"A typical day would involve getting orders ready at the beginning of the day, dispatching drivers, and making sure they've got what they need. Then, receive and check in UPS and FEDEX deliveries, sort for stock, and deal with missing or broken items separately. Then back to filling orders and fielding calls once shift change happens."
good,"Slow at times, Good when there is work. I learned that experience takes you far. You need to be able to have patience. Figure out if you like to work for commission or not"
good,"Pulling parts in a warehouse with specific locations helps make the job fairly easy. Pay was appropriate for the job title. "
good,"Overall work experience wasn't bad . Rush as a whole is very good company to work for . My situation wasn't about the company more so based off workers within company. Petty and spiteful management ,so to avoid any physical altercations I decided to resign."
good,"Typical day is unloading trucks, unpack pallets, and put away in warehouse. I have learned to work with others, patience, and efficiency.The management is great they are helpful. when you ask them to fix a problem they get it done. My coworkers are fun and easy to work with at Rush."
good,"A typical day at work is usually always fun with my co-workers. We joke around and all of us get along very well. I look forward to seeing new customers and taking care of our usual customers. The hardest part of the job is telling a customer that his/her truck will not be done when promised, because of parts availability or we find something else wrong while repairing the customer's complaint. I love my customers with all of my heart and if their truck isn't going down the road, it's not making money. My manager is awesome. She really makes my job easy."
good,"Good place to work, no room for advancement."
good,It was pretty straight forward job. You come to work and do what you needed to do. Like pull parts and check then off your list then go out and deliver them though out your route. Was the branch that I worked at perfect? By far no but it wasn't a bad job. I would say overall it wasn't a bad place to work.
good,"Normally when at work, shop supplies were either in short supply or not in working order. Management was not very helpful in job advancement or development."
good,"The average day at Rush consisted of the following tasks; reconciliation of the daily cash sheets, coding accounts payable files, and answering phones. this job taught me everything I know about accounting. The management team was great and really took a special interest in me. I really enjoyed working with all of my coworkers. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning from my coworkers and getting to know them."
good,Great place to work as long you have a second income coming in from somewhere. It is a flat rate and being slow sucks. When there is work you wont go hungry.
good,"Mobile service is fast paced, but feast or famine at times. Little time for training and no time to cross train with the shop. Seems like there is a money motivation...keep running until the wheels fall off and only then can you get any help."
good,"Hard for me to give a high review since they bought the dealership to close it down and consolidate the area. Other then that, it was a very good job."
good,"Working in Rush local shop is unpredictable,some days you have a lot of work others not much. Constantly trying to get the best paying jobs is frustrating. Favoritism is a local problem in the Pharr tx location."
good,Rules are set but are flexible to the point that it makes it harder to make decisions.   Position lacks guidance and support.  There is an appearance of favoritism.  Inability to take vacation when desired due to staffing issues.
good,i had great support from management and co-workers in fulfilling parts orders as well as ongoing training to refine my skills. the best part of my job was meeting the needs of my customers and meeting new people. the difficulty was competitive pricing.
good,It was a great start to my career. I started as a service writer and became a diesel technician. I would highly recommend working at Rush Trick Centers.
good,working with the customer and employee's was good. I should have stayed there but the grass was greener on the other side. benefits were good. had good learning experience
good,Good place to work overall.Meet alot of wonderful people. World of knowledgeable co-workers and customers. Fast pace not for the faint of heart. Have to be sure of what you say cause you can cost someone alot of money if you are not sure. Would definitely recommend working there if they accommodated your worth.
good,"Come in and research and order parts for 18 wheelers, People are helpful and will help as much as possible. Hardest part of the job is lifting 70lbs packages at times."
good,"Job was a new contract for gm so the pay should have been more than what they were offering. Although I was thankful for the job, I could not take care of my family on a 10$ hr budget"
good,"Operating school busses, making repairs and troubleshooting."
good,Rush Enterprises is an exciting and growing company with a very healthy bottom line year after year. I really enjoyed my time at Rush.
good,"Poor training and lack of manager engagement, co workers are out to take your book of business. Lacks leadership you are to learn and fend for yourself."
good,Lwr Mngmt dealing with demand of upper mngmt. Room for growth but industry offered very little relative experience in other industries. Work at dealership lvl was fun to a degree. My boss micro managed me and my department to the degree that it robbed me of the ability to adapt with change. there is a generation gap in the heavy truck sales industry and the younger crowd is at a disadvantage due to the reluctance to change.
good,Thoroughly enjoy working with second shift technicians. Lots of experience and willing to teach. Management needs work.
good,Management was terrible and they ruined passing job orders out. But great benefits and training. I love the job until they start mixing management and job orders
good,"fast paced work environment. busy schedule. friendly employers, and workers. easy to have friendly interactment with customers. very organized delivery schedule."
good,Its was an good place to work just couldn't get on days. They paid little extra for weekends when they needed a driver on the weekend. One thing I didn't like was when they paid me less for long run I felt that was not fair at all so I had to leave.
good,Fast paced stressful enviroment with constant changes. Good people to work for and the benifits are compareable. Management is lacking and bodies are employeed rather than quailified personel
good,You meet a lot of different characters at this job. I have meet a wide range of people .just not enough respect for people with good ideas and current management is too young.
good,"Rush Is a good company to work for."
good,"delivered for them diseal parts to numerous companies, mailouts, answered phones, in charge of inventory. they went out of business"
good,it was alright they had there favorites and would bring you down I didn't like that to much they would give any work only if you bribed them into a work order
good,"I like working for this company. The co-workers are okay to work with, just at times should be more professional. My boss is outstanding and a great developer. While working with this company, I learned SAP software and the trucking business. This was very beneficial to myself."
good,"We had a lot of absences so people working had to pick up their work on top of their own.  That's what made it stressful, because someone was out everyday."
good,"was a good work place but promises that where made never came true, only after i informed them that i was going to leave did they offer to make some thing happen   I took one beat up service truck went out and made my on sales calls to build business.  increased to the point where they added more trucks and is now a major part of there business then transfered to austin and started up the same."
good,"My hours at Rush Truck Center are 10:00 am till 7:00 pm. Beginning January 1st my hours will change to 1:00 pm till 9:00 pm. I make popcorn and coffee everyday for our customers. I answer a switchboard telephone system and transfer calls to Service, Parts, or the Warehouse. I take credit card, checks and cash payments. I prepare a balance sheet in excel and keep track of all transactions. Maintain a spreadsheet report for Petty Cash. Create invoices for outside services."
good,"A typical day at work is busy and full of work. The time goes by quickly, you have to like working on teams or with partners if you are at an entry level position. Almost every department is made of teams unless you are advancing to management or supervisor, which is standard for a large corporation."
good,"One of the top dealerships and good pay but flat rate commission on warranty is not good."
good,Good company to work for. Fair and open to new ideas. Enjoyed the work atmosphere and the co-workers. Met a lot of nice people thru out the company.
good,Great employee/customer relations.  Employee's always had a chance to improve their over-all knowledge of the industry.  Whether in the warehouse or in the shop employee's always got along with each other.
good,The sales managers really didn't' care how the deal was made as long as it sold and left the lot.  Rules from management came and went like the weather. Co-workers where great and customers where easy to please.
good,Promising business for somebody who wants to advance in the business.
good,A typical day at work is like at any other automotive shop. I've learned how to pay attention to detail the smallest thing can screw up productivity. Management was ok like I said before if you can get in good with the managers then you'll be fine. Co-workers wasn't really all that great. I felt like they could have been more helpful when it came to teaching how to using the company job log on screen. The hardest part of the job was getting your work approved for repair to get payed. The most enjoyable part of the job were the spliffs.
good,"Brought on for a short term to complete 3 projects.  Was given a reasonable amount of latitude to complete the tasks.  Adequate resources and management support.  Evolving PMO.  Saw leaps of improvements such as similar reporting, use of SharePoint, etc. during my brief time.  Witnessed future improvement goals for the PMO that will greatly enhance the technology management."
good,Good place to aquire training on diesel engines . Offers good benefits and investing opportunities. Has mentor program for new employees who don't know the product that well.
good,Been a diesel tech for 25years started at Kenworth in the mid 90’s worked at Volvo dealership for 4yrs random shops then started at Rush I have skills in engine rebuilds transmission rebuilds suspension can do a/c repairs ect..
good,"Rush Truck Center is a very good employer I just wish they were quite a bit closer because the driving is a hardship."
good,"Rush Enterprises is a pretty good company that gives hard workers opportunities to advance and make a decent living. I went through a management trainee program and ended up working in the service department at one of the larger dealerships in Texas. While the pay is good and there are opportunities to advance and make more money, I felt that the fast paced and somewhat unfocused working environment was very stressful, and certainly not a very pleasant way to work every day. "
good,"The team I work with is very nice and friendly. It gets hectic at times but they always seem to work well with everyone.  The area where the building is very industrious, but it is not far from customer locations and is pretty close to downtown and other industrious areas."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of chasing down leads, proposing new business, spec'ing trucks and or services existing customer's needs while handling any question or concerns they may have in regards to our equipment."
good,Fast paced environment. Must be able to multi-task. I got to work with a diverse group of employees and customers. I've learned many valuable skills while working for this company and have been provided many great opportunities.
good,"I learned a lot while working here, employees are cool and easy to get along with. It is a flat rate shop so as the new guy when things are slow, most likely you wont get the work."
good,It has been an honor to be a part of the Rush family. I have found my true calling as a trainer for the SAP team. Currently I travel to newly purchased trucking location and train in both a class room and on the job settings. I concentrate on the parts sales and inventory side of the SAP training.
good,I was able to learn and teach many SAP functions.  A training work week consisted of managing a classroom of 20 to 25 students to teach users how to manage their daily SAP functions.  Then I was onsite for their SAP go-live to make sure they were able to do their responsibilities with the new software.  Co-workers or other trainers assisted in the process and lead classroom sessions of their own.  We also managed the documentation and presentations that came with new or changed processes with SAP.  Management was very helpful with the work and what needed to be accomplished for any one or more job assignments.  The hardest part of the job was having to listen to rationalizations to changes such as 'were going in a new direction' or other similar lines.  However completing the process for any one or more locations for go-live was the most rewarding part of the job in that you knew you had a sense of accomplishment into not only having shown your students all the aspects required for their job but also that you were there for them during the implementation process.
good,was a very productive workplace. friendly people and nice environment. always  kept me busy and always a good place to move your way up.
good,Rush Enterprises was a good starting point for me to learn public accounting and to grow within the company. At the time a position opened up at another company but with it would have worked out. Glad to gain the experiance
good,It was a good place to learn new up date engine equipment. Was a great place to work.
good,I enjoyed that I got to move up in the company cause of my hard work and enjoyed spending time with the coworkers and the job was always busy so you always had something to do.
good,"Great place for someone looking to"
good,"Overall this is a good place to work with lots of great people to work with. There is lots of training opportunities for those who are interested in learning. They have a brand new building, but they really cut a lot of corners it seems. They did not install a exhaust extraction system so when trucks are running inside the building everyone has to breathe in that noxious exhaust. Instead they installed an ineffective ceiling fan which does nothing but make noise. If you can get over the negative health effects then it is a great place to work."
good,Since I am mostly the only one on the front parts counter it is a little over whelming at times. Most of the customers I have got to know on a bit of a personal level. They really appreciate what I do for them. The only challenging part of the job is trying to find a specific part in the electronic parts catalogs.
good,"sit behind desk, receive vehicles as they arrive, prepare work orders. Management always willing to help with employees with personal time, if needed."
good,"Great time working at the Helpdesk at Rush; Only worked my 3-month contract. Great Pay. IT department was on the 4th floor, other counterparts were on the same floor. Easy to get help or quick answer relating to a client issue."
good,Great company with a slowing used truck market.  The slowing of the market is what ultimately led me to seek another position.  Overall great company to work for.
good,"Focus is on Technician Training and well being.  Needs to be an Hourly shop as the influx in work changes frequently."
good,"I get along with all management and coworkers. Typical work day, work 8-5, complete billing information for customers, notify customers when trucks are ready for pick up and obtain purchase orders. The hardest part of my job is when I have  assist in preparing estimates for customers. What I enjoy most about my job is my co workers. Everyone works well together and have the most respect for each other."
good,"Good place to work, good pay and good people to be around, learned a lot. Allowed to continue education while working and offered manufacturer training, all paid for."
good,Supervised daily Body Shop duties provided technical support for the production of the shop I nice work environment. The hardest part was removing cabs.
good,Typical day at work customer service and providing mechanical service and parts service. What I learned was the parts side of their products and their warranty side. Management well kept us busy and taught us how to up sell any product to increase sells. Co workers were the best and with good knowledge of the products they were selling. Hardest part of the job was changing departments and starting from scratch. And the most enjoyable part was the payoff of learning the product and knowing how to up sell the product to anyone and get compensated for it.
good,"The job itself was a good job, the people I worked with were fantastic.  That being said, travel for the job consisted of leaving Monday morning and then getting back Thursday evening.  As time went on and we ended up flying out Sunday nights instead of Mondays."
good,"A typical day at work is doing the various tasks assigned dealing with the general upkeep of warehouse parts and information. I have learned a lot about how to get along with tougher people. The management is pretty good, but the highest manager tends to ignore repeated problems of his workers and is soft when there are serious issues. The pay is good for the area, I just need to personally find a higher paying position which is the only reason I am leaving. Co-workers are generally kind, just a tougher bunch. The hardest part of the job is misunderstandings. The most enjoyable part of the job is categorizing information."
good,It’s not bad but like all jobs there’s pros and cons. You won’t see a raise for years so hopefully you’re happy with your starting wage bc it won’t change for a long time. Benefits 4/10
good,"Good company ,Good people, good benefits, good vacation and sick time once you accumulate it. Off on the main holidays. Must take all kinds of safety training on computer"
good,Enjoyed being employed by Rush. Would continue to work for Rush if family emergency was not requiring me and my family to relocate. Would apply again if status changes.
good,"A typical day for the night shift, wait for a bay to work out of, wait for parts, a lot of parts out of stock, lots of hindrances if you're trying to make flat rate."
good,They care about their employees.  Offer great benefits/401K/paid holidays even though you have to work most of them.  No complaints about company.  Caring owners.
good,I learned the most from Rush Truck Center engine over hauls to computer diagnostics and Infinity Miles as how to treat and talk to customer and explain
good,very busy in the warranty claims department - heavy organizational skills and quite a bit of data entry and claims processing fast paced and accuracy was essential
good,Rush Enterprises (formerly known as Yancey Trucking) was a great place to work. Rush offered a challenging and fast paced job with room to grow. The maintenance process was very refined and tracked the employees work and productivity extremely well.
good,"Very high paced, able to multitask, productive, quick learner of company's policies.  Able to adapt to customer's complaints and handle them in a proficient, professional manner. Strived for customer satisfaction and adhered to company's policies."
good,"would like to still be employed there but it was only part time, was able to work with my own tools and met some really nice people, learned alot motivated me to get my CDL"
good,The number of great people that work for the company make it feel like home. There are many managers who go out of their way to make sure their people succeed and have a great career.
good,Rush is a great place to work. They offer multiple avenues for advancement in both education and position. The company is well structured and well managed.
good,Learned a lot about diesel engines and time management.  Workplace culture is very fast pace which I enjoy.  Health care is good.  Pay is good and work life and home life is balanced.
good,"Come into work,proceeded to get ready for the day. The day would then start by answering telephones of customers calling for parts. Once there was a break or a time to catch your breath between phone calls, I would proceed to wait on the mechanics at the rear counter to assist the rear parts counterman. If there was anytime time that the parts phones were not ringing or walk in parts counter customers were not coming in, I would restock the parts that were sold or I would help put stock away, basically keep the parts department clean & organized."
good,"I loved my work team, but the workload between individuals was not balanced fairly. Hardest part of job was commute and was lack of motivation. I enjoyed learning and having coworkers that were willing to teach, even though they were busy."
good,"Being put in charge of purchasing and all warehouse operations, I was able to work with vendors to lower purchase points and raise productivity in our warehouse."
good,"Good place to work with great people. I caught the general manager for the Colorado locations in several lies, and couldn't tolerate such a situation."
good,"Good place,good co-workers very fast paced enviroment, great learning opportunity. Great schedule had the oppurtunity to attend college and work at the same time ."
good,Typical daily morning sales meetings then off to see customers and take care of any new potential customers. What i learned threw Rush was to expect the unexpected every customer has the potential to buy at any given time. And keeping the customer for a long term basis. Management good and very upfront on what there needs and demands for the company. For my co workers great group of sales staff well trained and different sales techniques which made it easier to sell. The hardest part of my job was trying to convinced long term customer that purchased for years from our competitor makes and model which were sold by me. And buy from what i was up selling them before. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting my customers and building a customer report that were loyal to me for years.
good,"flat rate has its ups and downs. Good company to work for. alot of bays to work out of, good co-workers and good management."
good,"During my time at rush, I received, stocked, sold and delivered truck parts. The all inclusive experience allowed for pretty interesting work days. Management was pretty great, they took the time to explain my over bearing questions and were generally available if any such questions raised."
good,"Clean, steady busy shop. Lots of company paid training, raises were average. Worked with a lot of good friendly people that I grew to know and respect when advancing my career at other employers"
good,"It's what you make it. The job can be slow depending on sales/services. usual 9-5 sometimes 8 am. Culture was pretty good, great guys to work with. Work could sometimes get slow."
good,Open up bay area and grab my labtop and r.O. And start working on the truck I'm servicing. If I get stuck working on something specific theres always technicians willing to help out. Love my job and the people I work with.
good,Fast paced environment with a growing company. Customer service focused. Good benefits.
good,"I began my job at Rush Enterprises within the Management Trainee Program, a program where recent graduates with aspirations of attaining management positions within the company can learn first-hand knowledge in each separate department. The departments are arranged into New Sales, Used Sales, Parts, Service Desk, Body Shop, and Mobile Service."
good,I learned a lot from working there and the other techs that surrounded me. It was a place that if you could not communicate then you could not progress. Luckily I could communicate.
good,Rush was a great experience to have. The culture was not for me and the product was not a product I feel passionate about. I did have a great work and life balance so that was a plus.
good,"Management was lacking when I first left Rush, but I recently found out one of the most hard working guys there took over the position. Typically on a regular day you would do vehicle on all four vehicles and forklift inspection, followed by a quick count of inventory, and a preemptive run of the mill supply run for some mechanics. Later you would pick up parts and deliver them as per managers instructions and have lunch either on the way or come back and go to lunch. After lunch you would pick up more parts and deliver them to their rightful owners and return to help at the counter, be it stocking new merchandise helping customers find items or bringing the items from warehouse. Everyone is pretty relaxed at rush, they constantly try to help you in any way they can and expect the same thing from you. I enjoyed everything about my time in Rush, it really helped me see things from a different perspective working there."
good,This was my first ever internship and I thinik it was a great experience. I learned a lot here from the workers and management. I would work here again if I could.
good,"Professional Type Atmosphere"
good,Nice and friendly staff. Supportive management. Good hours. Decent pay. Fun and relaxed work environment. Nice break room. Good location.
good,Everyday was a learning experience. The training provided prepared me for the next level. Great technicians and staff overall. Loved working on the heavy duty equipment.
good,"Working and staying busey "
good,"I have worked there 18 years and am still doing what I was told I would be doing. Things have likely changed over time, but I don't think that has happened much. I thoroughly enjoy working for Indy Truck Sales that sold to Rush Truck Centers a year ago."
good,"Fair pay for the work involved. Great work environment. Parts Department Manager, Assistant Manager and the Driver Supervisor are great people! They treat you like real people, and are extremely fair and understanding. I left only to take another job opportunity, but Rush Truck Center was a job that was hard for me to leave."
good,"Rush truck center was a good place of business, they gave me opportunities to expand my knowledge about graphic designs and started my career in graphic designs. Staff and co-workers were fun to work with. It was a good place of business."
good,"This company is a good company to work for, I was the last man hired and it goes by seniority. We have been slow for the past month or so and I not getting any work ."
good,"Loaded parts that were on invoices.. Delivered parts to over 35 customers on my route. Assisted Wearhouse pulling parts, loading and unloading trucks."

good,"Productive and "
good,"Good company and learned a lot about purchasing and warranty work , worked with great people I am still friends with and management was great, very supportive. The only drawback was the compensation for the work, it made it impossible to afford the healthcare plan."
good,Company did not give pay rises unless you are promoted. I did not feel the we can or closeness with the management. Never got the Good job statement from the management.
good,"sold parts, Delivered parts , Warehouse Manger learned a lot and showed me a lot and that cooperation just stink. management in building was great but the big shots stinks the hardest was putting up with big wigs that live in a different stat would come tell us how to run things we new it wouldn't work that's why the doors closed and also cause"
good,Rush has a great foundation of customer service and excellence and quality workmanship. They push hard to be the best in their industry and are very growth minded.
good,"Still working for Rush and couldn't picture myself anywhere else. You will never find a more ethical, moral, or supportive place to work.  If you give Rush the opportunity they will give you yours.  Rush is not the place for instant gratification but over the long haul they follow through with the promises made."
good,"If you are into FAST PACED, then join the IT Help Desk. They are a great team. You really get a sense of where you want to be within the company. It's a great company to work for and advance if given the opportunity"
good,"started working with rush it is a little difficult due to current agents have market clogged, maybe will get better hopefully will turn for the better"
good,"I didn't like the location of my office, but it was a great place to work. Since leaving they've opened a new building/shop I'm sure the offices are in a much better location than before."
good,I have never worked at a place where the days go by so fast. You show up on Monday and get out and start selling next thing you know you're going home on a Friday night.
good,"I was working as a contractor for over a year.  Never received an adjustment in pay, no benefits and no permanent hire date on the radar.  Other than that I did love the work I did but I needed something with benefits."
good,"Great Company to work for, loved the hours of work, the pay was much better than the previous employer, and the benefits were also better, except for getting laid off for lack of work, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Rush Truck Center."

good,"Typical day is meeting with other leaders to review parts in and parts out or pending."
good,I was a mobile mechanic. I traveled with them mainly in the oil field business. I worked 60 days on and 21 off so not a lots of family time. I will say that is a schedule i wanted so its not thier fault. I believe there are always room to grow in that company. I give it 2 thumbs up!!
good,"A typical day will determine what you know, what management will give you for work, how your co-workers will respond to the work, and whether or not they can do the work in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team work."
good,"Staying busy, how to manage the leasing side of commercial trucks, . The hardest part of the job is trying to stay ahead  and following the management procedure and policies to the best of my ability - since it changed constantly. The most enjoyable part was learning the mechanics of the trucking industry and the people."
good,Thoroughly enjoyed working here. Received annual pay raises as well as additional raises/bonuses based on work performance and certification completion. Work environment and coworkers were always enjoyable and sense of autonomy was great. They helped me learn a ton and develop a much better understanding of safety protocol through company-based education.
good,An excellent job with great co-workers and managers. Everyone was very helpful when it came to learning the company order processing system and learning our customer locations for deliveries. Management was always sure I had what I needed to do my job safely.
good,"Very good company to work for. Would go back if they needed me."
good,"Quick paced work environment"
good,"As a warehouse clerk, my job was not very difficult. It mainly consisted of typical day to day warehouse procedures. I learned how to use a forklift, process inbound freight, stock merchandise, and create invoices. The leadership is great, not overly demanding and fair. My team members are great to work with, they always help me out when I need it. The hardest part of the job is the late morning rush, at times there are so many orders to pull for delivery and it can get hectic. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with some of the nicest people I've ever met inside the workplace."
good,"Warranty Department has a great environment, day to day work involves filing warranty claims for each International Branch/ Idealease locations. Working daily spreadsheets and schedules for each location. Weekly posting statement payments for each claim under each branch."
good,"Fast paced, performance driven company.   Promotes fairness, excellence, positive attitudes and productivity.  Training is second to none.  A company that promotes from within.  Good benefits and pay."
good,I learned a lot during my internship with rush truck leasing. I got a better understanding of the workings of a mobile service truck and being a diesel mechanic was exactly what I had always imagined.
good,"I loved working for this company. Although it was very busy at our store here in Mobile, the larger stores were slowing down. In result there was a company wide layoff. It hurt especially around Christmas. But they did what they had to. The management was wonderful, the co workers the same."
good,The management if I must say were the grandest in which I've witnessed quick thinking and teamwork towards accomplishing goals. Their structure and organization was what I needed at that point in time of my life.
good,"I came from a fast paced enviroment that had no respect for a Parent and Family Person... Rush is great for a family Man. Great Pay Benefits, They offer 15k of life insurance for free to just work here.. Its a great job that pays very well... but its still a job and you have to do your work.. if you are a goal oriented, competitive person who wants to work in a fun enviroment.. then get a job with rush.. Its one of the best choices ive ever made... Love it here"
good,Rush Enterprises still feels like a family-owned company. One of my best work experiences ever. Great people all around. I learned a great deal working there

good,"I advanced very quickly, i have been certified on several engines and mainly rebuild engines when business is operating at full speed.  I feel like management needs a little help on keeping the shop in order.  The co workers are easy to get along with and they are a great group of guys that come to help even if its not at work."
good,Work was always rewarding and the management for the body shop can't be praised enough. The whole reason for staying as long as I did was because of the body shop manager.
good,"a typical day is reviewing parts request from technicians and processing the order and delivering the parts to the technicians."

good,"I enjoyed working with the company the people,  was treated like  we were family"
good,The company is very professional and all of the groups take pride in their work. The employees have the tools need to complete their work and are encouraged for job advancements.
good,"For the most part the job consist of preventive maintenance. Not a bad place to gain some entry level experience because it is not a flat rate shop. So, if it slows down you don't lose money."
good,It was a very professional environment but had a very open non hostile environment. Very much enjoyed working here. Loved how willing they were to help teach you something new. Everyone was always so willing to help.
good,"I would do anything from pulling part orders, to shipping parts to other companies, and recieving product in from another company. Stocking the warehouse checking numbers making sure they match. Pallet orders together. I learned how to ship orders out and DSI. Management is great, they noticed how good of a worker i was and gave me a raise. Hardest part of job was probably pulling the Big orders. What i enjoyed about it the most is because i could work 4-5 different positons and i could stay and help everyone else finish and make extra hours. I could work 20 hours of overtime and I would love it. But the people there are nice and very helpful!"

Communication with all employees is a must with Rush. They are all helpful. Knowing your area is very helpful so that you work the route faster
good,"When I worked for Rush, it started out great. I learned the accounting process really quick. A typical day at Rush was steadily busy. After being there for awhile and getting to the ladies, they became catty. It was like being in high school. They played favorites a lot with the Supervisors. The most enjoyable part of what I did was working with the invoices and keeping in touch with the stores that I was over."
good,"Rush Enterprises' business unit of Rush Truck Leasing (RTL) is a strong corporate and nationwide team with excellent leadership from the top down.

good,"During my tenure at Rush working with the executive team it was easy to see how much thought and compassion went into thinking about the employees throughout the organization.
