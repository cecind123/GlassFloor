rating,review
bad,"one of the worst or even the worst place i have work for, you at the bottom the bottom is where you stay turnover rate is threw the roof you wont last, they dont care abt there employees"
bad,"I was fired for crane operators mistake, TP refused to drug test crane guy! I was set up crew faked a lift / pick lied and said I was needed for something that was faked!"
bad,Went in as an EIT but had me going all over the place.  Worked you for 50+ hours a week but only paid for 40.  Extremely stressful and the management team is a joke.  They were only good at pointing fingers when something went wrong.
bad,A typical day at work was getting yelled at and disrespected. Upper management are clueless people. The China man is a very bad person to work with. Owner of the company does not care about the employees. He constantly puts people down and anything you say is ignored.
bad,The worst company that I have ever worked for.They do everything twice and dangerously.Safety is a joke with management.The safety meeting is held every Monday morning and by lunchtime everything the safety officer talked about is discarded and its hurry up and get it done....at any cost.
bad,"Executive management does not appreciate or support the administrative functions and employees.  They are viewed as a cost that eats into profits and therefore, are significantly under funded."
bad,"The company is effectively a one-man show, with 10,000 employees doing his bidding.  The environment of fear pervades the organization, making people afraid to make decisions."
bad,"Management is AWFUL, they will lie and deceive you with no regard to you the employee. Very hostile work environment that is not worth the money to be there. There are way better jobs out there. Save yourself the stress and trouble, just avoid them."
bad,"Management is rude, abusive and only interested in feeding their egos.  It is common in the office (and the field) to have an executive literally curse and belittle an employee in front of their co-workers.  This practice is an accepted one as they are simply following the example of the company ""leader"" who has the foulest mouth and rudest demeanor; basically if you want to keep your job, you keep your mouth shut!"
bad,Never know when weather would shut down production. Upper management didn't have a clue how to schedule the work around the weather. Always laying off.
bad,"Many of the co-workers were great to work with, but there was a great deal of bureaucratic red tape, and the supervisor was not at all supportive.   Additionally, senior management was detached."
good,Working long hours includes Saturday and Sundays. Expect day and  night work.
good,"Not an employment opportunity for long term stability."
good,"Was told, repeatedly by project management at multiple locations, that safety was not their job. Screamed at by several supervisors that it was my job, as Director of Safety, to direct the workforce in all issues of safe and healthful behavior."
good,"Start varied from 1am to 6am"
good,Great place to learn skills but not to stay long term. Employees are at times promoted to upper level positions they are not qualified or trained for.
good,Decent place if your a union member management is very hectic. Hard to stay in your trade. A lot of who you know not what you know. Some very good co workers.
good,I did not care for the company culture so I left the company.  the company is very efficient at executing work in the field and has good relationships with the unions
good,Working for this company can be easy going to insufferable. It depends on your position and placement. It's a great place to learn about the engineering side of the construction business. Typical day is a minimum of 10 hours. Can be stressful at times. Especially for project managers.
good,A company that pays well but company culture is very poor.  Don't see teamwork but finger pointing with fear of being reprimanded if a mistake is made.
good,I worked there for over three years; it was one of the best working experiences I ever had.  I worked with great people and the company was good and fair to their employees also.
good,"The environmental safety and health program, which includes 19 plus business units and approximate 11,500 world wide employee base, fails to provide an environmentally safe and healthy workplace.  Management focuses on adequately insuring its design, contract, equipment, and personnel as required by law and contract requirements but fails to practice factual accident/incident prevention."
good,"Not a bad place to work. I was laid off and it wasn’t expected. I would recommend this company as an employer, I just cant guarantee permanent work. I need a permenant job."
good,"I worked at Tutor Perini full-time (More than a year)"
good,"•	Scanning A/P invoices into Imaging system"
good,"very good company, cares about employees and their growth. some managers needed more training but overall a good place to work and great learning environment"
good,It's a job it pays the bills and if your not afraid to take on some responsibility and do the job right the first time anyone will do great . And the pay is always on time.
good,The best thing about working here is the co workers and team environment. Management is nearly non existant and standards and practices are out of date
good,Company has good working environment although there aren's enough advancement opportunities provided and therefore the compensation and increases are difficult.
good,A lot of work everyday. Very stressful. Enjoyed working with different types of machinery. The pay wasn’t so great. But kept me busy most of the time.
good,"Great co-workers, always busy, upper management has certain agendas but for the most part always trustworthy. Sometimes a lot of responsibilities are put on one person. A lot is expected of you daily."
good,"A typical day at work involve 60% user support from communications to the desktop. I have 10 field engineers across 6 states that I am responsible for coordinating their daily activities, provide escalation of issues, interfacing with regional executive of the BUs I am responsible. 40% of my time is spend on special assignments, from developing n application to negotiating with vendors for products and services. "
good,"In day you can deal with enrollments one second then filling out paperwork for an injured employee and reviewing their drug test results. Everything HR ran through our on site office. I dealt with all types of employees from construction workers to corporate employees. Our departments took care of new hires, benefits, employee expenses, terminations and anything else HR related that an employee needed help with. Followed up with any issues to make sure there were answer and a resolution had been met. I worked with a lot of people that were from out of state so I was relied upon a bit to provide New York State laws and to make sure that everything done was according to the law. On the other hand I learned a lot about other areas in America and their laws when processing certain paperwork."
good,"I love working with this company, and would work for them again if given the chance and opportunity. They are a construction company so the only downside is the job last two - three years"
good,"Productive Team Spirited Environment."
good,a workday starts at 6;00 and goes till 4:30 in the evening but good lunchtimes and very tight knight work environment. the hardest part was the body stress and long workdays with the school.

good,"The environment is ok.  Management is questionable and confusing."
good,"Tutor Perini Co., and staff were very caring and helpful to my needs. good place to work. I was assigned to do a lot of filling and data entry. I learned new ways to input data entry and much about the company. Management was very caring, understanding, and helpful. Culture wise, Tutor Perini is diverse and flexible with issues and problems needed to be solved. The hardest part of the job was my first day on. New environment, I had to adapt to the nature, culture, and the fast pace. I had to learn their way of doing things, which was all in all a learning experience for me being that it was a different company form the others I use to work for. The most enjoyable part of the job was data entry, inputting information into their system and learning about all kinds of clients we serviced."
good,Enjoyed going to work for this company. Built runway/ bridge over major highway which was interesting as well as challenging.  I was first hired & last crane on the job
good,I enjoyed my crew and learning new things.  Just didn’t like being away from home!  Never knew where work was gonna be or if there was gonna be work. Loved the pay but worked 7 days week!

good,Working with this company allowed to expand and build my clerical and organizational skills. I learned that being detail oriented and punctual are valuable traits that can be used in a variety of ways. I built and maintained professional relationships with multiple associates here.
