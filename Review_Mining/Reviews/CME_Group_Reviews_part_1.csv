rating,review
bad,"The Merc was a great company in terms of gaining work and financial industry experience. However, they treat their employees like terribly! They do not promote internal job advancement. They aren't fair to their AA employees. The only advantage I can say I received at some point was the 100% tuition reimbursement! Other than that they need to fire their entire HR staff! They need to stop allowing nepotism to flow throughout the departments! They need a complete revamp and the merge with CBOT made matters no better! Terrible company to work for! Especially if you're AA. If anyone disagrees it's because they aren't AA and therefore have not had the same experiences."
bad,Over half (75%) engineers in teams are consultants.  The workforce is not diverse - 99% of engineers are of same ethnicity.  They plan to keep only certain consultants and weed the others out with no justifiable reason and no support.
bad,Poor communication with management. Department goals are unclear.
bad,"its a great place if you just want a paycheck , very competitive , good old boy network, lacks diversity, no support , fires the good employees to keep the cliques in place.lots of turnover."
bad,"Face pace work place,high stress at times.Great location in loop.Near public transportation.Very male dominated place,lots of security.Great learning experience"
bad,"What can I say about working at CME? It's an exchange where lots of people work and do as they are told.  If you're looking to find out what it's like to work in an exchange, you should work there."
bad,"In the acquisition of our company, the CME and NY groups didn't mix well. CME has a strong Chicago culture and a strong group of folks running the company."
bad,The company has moved to a lean and mean structure impacting a work/life balance.  Recent layoffs have reduced staff significantly.
bad,"The morale was low in the group I was in because most people were doing the work of at least two people. Most people on the team had to always have their work phones on them, even during vacation and weekends, so work-life balance was highly skewed towards work. Management did not invest resources into making the existing employees' lives easier, instead adding new team members to work on new projects. Management also did not listen to the tech experts and instead pressured the team into meeting unreasonable deadlines, leading to unnecessary stress and technical debt. Deployment process was led by bigots and was an overcomplicated nightmare, creating a culture of change resistance. Talented individuals were often delegated to menial tasks because they were simply an 'available' resource. The interview was a typical coding interview but most team members were not up to par with the standards of the interview."
bad,"CME is loaded with smart and talented people...many whom will never reach their true potential due to the fact that management there is full of ""lifers"" who have never actually had real experience in the outside world."
bad,Attendance needs to be enforced management lies about advancements haven't had a raise in 3 years lots of favoritism people drinking on the job and they still have a job. Always having to check your time card to make sure you get all your money. Looks like a lot of people that are married are cheating on their husbands or wives lots of infidelity going on in this company.                   ochildren
bad,Vicious culture and not supporting if you're not aligned with the right groups/functions. When it's good - it's very good but conversely - bad is very bad. Tech makes it interesting - culture drains you.
good,The CME group has a hectic pace and requires total continuity with other employees. CME group provides a rewarding career to those who put in the extra effort
good,CME was a great company to work for especially during the IPO and merger/acquisitions of CBOT and NYMEX.  I had many great experiences with incredibly talented colleagues.  The pace was fast and ambiguous which made for interesting days.  I found my niche with project management and enjoyed the variety of complex projects I was fortunate to implement.  I've learned best practices and building relationships are extremely important to the success of projects with great communication as the foundation.  The hardest part of the job for me was actually the commute.
good,Ok place to work but constant cost cutting has everyone wonder whose job is going abroad next.  Those left have to take up the slack.  You need permission for everything so it's easier to just disappear at your cubicle than fight the bureaucracy.
good,At CME Group you are part of making financial history.  The company  is a key part of the global economy.  You are working for a company that works to creating fair markets and creating financial tools for investors to manage risk on their investments.  At times the work can be very stressful and rewarding.
good,"Build  and troubleshoot Laptops, Desktops, tablets, monitors, iPhones, Macs, androids, printers, and manage inventory."
good,A company that offers employees excellent benefits and opportunities for advancement. The people are friendly and great work environment with great collaboration between departments.
good,"Overall fun, exciting place to work. I thoroughly enjoyed the environment and my coworkers; however management isn't exactly stellar. They were given their positions 20+ years ago, and even though they lack education and the capability to use basic programs, such as Microsoft Word, they remain in charge. Not sure if it's still in place, but I also received tuition reimbursement and was able to cover all schooling costs. There are definitely perks to working here."
good,It is rather difficult to get a promotion at CME especially from Manager to Director. It is a very bureaucratic place to spend a career and many people in the organization have literally spent their entire career knowing only this culture.
good,The CME Group is a great place to learn and grow.  It offers opportunities to grow and change within the company.  They offer great benefits and other additional perks.
good,"Company pays fairly and has great benefits. Very difficult to advance unless you are part of the right group. It does not matter your previous experience and performance, very likely to find several "
good,"the culture was great"
good,"The first day I worked on the trading floor I cried. I was taught the basics and was thrown into the shark infested waters of the trading floor. It was sink or swim. I swam. It was such a surreal experience back then. To have to fight your way into the trading pit to get trading cards, fight your way back out, input trades into the system, make sure they where right and keep my brokers positions. All in a days work. I learned to not second guess myself and that I do have a sense of humor. My co-workers are great and nutty (in a good way). The hardest part of the job is not having a good trading day. When things are really slow in the trading pit, but moving in the electronic markets. The most enjoyable part of the job is when at the end of a really big trading day, my brokers come over to me and say ""Thank you, job well done."""
good,"Great place to work and especially if you can code."
good,Fast paced environment. The company is healthy and also trying to improve their button number.  They are very customer oriented.  Customers/members are top priority.
good,"Pros:"
good,There seemed to be no functional culture here. Strict management creates some stress for employees. The company is in a great location and most of my peers here were knowledgeable and fun.
good,"A Day at Work involves employees responsibilities for their assignments."
good,Entering prices into trading system in a very fast paced environment.
good,"It's a fast-paced environment with plenty of opportunities to learn about technology and finance, but staff cuts and re-orgs over the last few years have heightened the pace of an already demanding environment. Possibly things will improve once the dust settles."
good,CME Group is the world's largest marketplace for futures and options.  The co-workers are typically helpful.  The Board of Directors though is too large given comparisons to other companies of the size.
good,"good."
good,"CME Group is the world's leading and most diverse derivatives marketplace. The company is comprised of five Designated Contract Markets (DCMs). Further information on each exchange's rules and product listings can be found by clicking on the links to CME, CBOT, NYMEX, COMEX and KCBT."
good,"Started with entry-level position as a market reporter. Great experience to financial markets.After a couple years, advanced to a senior reporter/settlement analyst. This position allowed exposure to settling markets using software provided by cmegroup."
good,Compensation was good.  Benefits were good.  Advancement opportunity was good.  Technology was advanced.  Company prestige was a good motivator to apply to (and stay with) the company.
good,"Wasteful with money (because they have a lot), knowledge is kept in Chicago and hardly distributed to other offices, inform interns/consultants 1 week before contract expires of intention to not renew, data from internal systems can be sketchy."
good,"Very fast paced! Very stressful, but many opportunities to learn new technologies. Pay well, always encourage employees to go to training and conferences."
good,"Good place for stable job in your later years, not so much for fresh grad out of college. Co-workers were nice. Women's initiative at the firm is commendable."
good,"great place to learn technologies, typical work day is very busy non stop, i learned a wide verity of network technologies"
good,Tough environment but great place to challenge yourself. I would recommend anyone in technology to start their career and advance to something in this discipline
good,I was a hard-working employee who had done excellent work in all my years  with CME Group. I constantly crushes my goals and was an ideal team player.
good,"1. A typical day of work for me starts with me at work at 2:30pm, this is because I work second shift."
good,You put in a FULL day and work in order to keep company profitable.  The management is inexperienced as the industry evolves.
good,"Fun but a lot of responsibility and hard work for the money."
good,"As all the financial firm, the work is very intensive. But, the people in this company are nice."
good,Theres no time to be a slacker when your on the trading floor or working for brokers/ locals. fast paced and number oriented people with thick skin will do well.
good,"I traded for myself, I did not work for any company.  I did not like the atmosphere and morality of so many of the people there.  Money makes too many people act unethical and untrustworthy."
good,"I was a hard working employee and enjoyed my job, however, becoming onboard at CME was not an easy transition. I learned a lot at CME by working closely with the board members which included trading on E trade."
good,To corporate and not really care about their employees in the long run. Really disappointed in how the company turned out at the end. To hard to get promotions.
good,9 hours of working per day. The environment and team mates are pretty encouraging. Your learning curve increases as the development projects upgrades and use the latest industry technologies.
good,"I had a great time working there the people are great, not management, they are the WORST. But colleagues are the best. Possibly the worst people I've ever meet are in leadership positions (and they are dating, like actually)"
good,"I think that the work that Uptake does is vital to making companies more productive and accountable, but I don't think that the current corporate structure lends itself to maximizing its power.  Were it to become a leaner and more focused enterprise, I think it could have tremendous influence on a broad variety of industries."
good,"-Never a typical day"
good,"•	Daily duties include handling all administrative support for the company."
good,CME Group employs some of the most talented individuals in the financial and commodities markets.  Each day is a new challenge to innovate the market place while helping traders manage risk.
good,Learned a lot about the futures commodities market as well as stocks in general. Learned how to navigate and use Bloomberg software as well as sharpened my excel skills. Enjoyed those in whom I work with. Early mornings but early afternoons made it very manageable to work with.
good,"Worked at the CME from  October, 1978 until August, 2014 ""35"" years.  A very interesting place to work back in the days.  Later part of the years is where it became a place where you just didn't enjoy anymore."
good,"Not aggressive environment."
good,"A typical work day starts at 0630 and lasts until about 1530.  The day can be very intense - fast paced with lots of stress.  I learned alot about the financial industry, including the different markets and the different trades that could be made.  I also learned alot about life.  Most of my managers were always there for support if needed.  I always wanted to know more and they always took me under their wings.  My co-workers were nice.  The hardest part of the job was being around the negative thinking and negative tones.  But the most enjoyable part of the job was overcoming the negativity and allowing yourself the opportunity to go where you want to go.  "
good,The environment is changing- so any review I give today may not be relevant tomorrow.
good,"In terms of benefits, a great place to work. Like the army, too many generals, not enough soldiers. Their culture indulges narcissists. Their business model is a protected monopoly so the company is very secure."
good,"1. Relaxed and welcoming environment"
good,"Very Challenging environment"
good,"My experience was not the best because the articular manager I reported to did not care for people. I think she felt if people asked to o many questions she termed them as ""being too needy"". It was clear to me she did not care for her role and was just getting by."
good,"My co-workers were the best thing there. Loved working with them. Got along great. Wish I was still there. I have learned that it's not what you do there. Poured my heart into my job everyday, every minute.The hardest part was being laid off after 34 years."
good,"The Cme trading floor surely has changed! The pace isn't as fast, but with the advent of electronic trading, the climate surely has changed forever. So sad. But, we don't go to work to make friends, we have to make a good living! If we make friends, that's a bonus!"
good,Great workplace with advanced technology in financial services industry
good,Excellent workplace with talented staff and advanced technology

good,"from the days of open outcry, the CME has always been a high volume operation, attracting sales and trading people as well as risk managers from around the world to its platform."
good,CME Group is a great place to work. You can learn many things from co-workers and people at CME work efficiently. Daily workload is not heavy. Managers are pretty nice there and they helped the entry-level people in many ways.
good,"The company boasts more benefits than most companies could ever hope to. Tuition reimbursement, medical benefits including dental and vision, pension and 401k matching. The list only goes on."
good,I had a great experience working for the CME. Wish i was still there.
good,"CME offers lot of growth and is very efficient and productive at work. Salary and Management is good. But all major meetings start at end-of-day during the night since its based on US clients, So, no work-life balance is present, except for weekends."
good,I learned many different systems throughout the years I spent at NYMEX/CME.  I played a major role when the trading floor closed and all brokers/traders had to adjust to electronic trading.  I trained clerks/members/traders/firms all new systems.  Multitasking is a necessity is this extremely fast-paced business.
good,"The management service is good. I learned how to deliver inter-office mail, sign & handle packages besides my coatroom duties. Health benefits aren't so good. Because we worked thru a temp agency our days off were pretty limited. Personal & sick days off were not paid for. Only the five vacation days. A typical day at work would normally be busy and the hardest would be slow days or holidays. My most enjoyable part was my co-worker, supervisors and the friends I met over the years."
good,"CME Group was a great opportunity. With the 3+ years I worked there I was able to grow from a student intern into an Infrastructure Engineer. I met many professional and helpful people throughout this time and learned so much with both Desktop and Data center. Now, I am able to overcome many obstacles the technology world may bring me."
good,"I loved working in the trading pit.  It essentially doesn't exist any longer.  Most trading activities are conducted electronically.  It was a very high paced, high energy environment."
good,"Working at CME proved to be a great start in my career as a Helpdesk Technician. with the huge amount of users that needed to be supported, I learned to work quickly and efficiently. Work policies helped keep the work environment productive and communication with our users easy."

good,Enjoyed my career and would recommend CME to anyone.  Salaries are fair and benefits excellent.  If your willing to be challeneged its the right environment.
good,"It's like working in a locker-room, which is not a bad thing."
good,"My typical day"
good,"Good work culture & Benefits"
good,"Work can be a little slow sometimes, people are fairly reserved! Salary is on the lower side and may need updating for several roles to retain good talent. Few people are very smart though."
good,"Great first job out of college and a great learning environment, but not a lot of room for growth. Management is great about creating a work life balance, especially for an auditing role. Great coworkers that keep the work interesting."
good,"My department challenges your multi-tasking skills every day. To excel, I learned to adapt quickly to the fast paced environment and mastered all rotations."
good,Hardest part of job is knowing when to voice your opinion versus staying quiet. Some managers are vindictive.
good,Unfortunately a downturn in business after several years of expansion resulted in a 5% layoff of their employees in Chicago in which I unfortunately was included.
good,"Easy work, Helpful teammates. It was a great experience. Altogether learnt a lot of new technologies."

good,"Work was good and intresting , no issues at all doing my job, good people to work with."

good,"There is a lot of down time, but when you are busy, it gets very chaotic and fast paced. There is not much room to move in company unless you want to trade on the screen, because that is where it is all going."
good,"Good learning experience."
good,"Near impossible to move up the ladder if you do not live in Chicago. Otherwise an excellent place to work. "
good,"CME Group has a large company but does not have an overwhelmingly ""big company"" feel which is a good thing. Everyone I've worked with is really interested in achieving what is best and do their part to do so. They trust you in decision making and allow you to be a part of recommendation. They really work to keep a good work life balance which makes coming to work that much more pleasurable."
good,"I have been working in the CME group for 4 years. And CME group is a company that has good work and life balance. "

good,There was no more opportunity here to work after the banks spent all the money on tech and were faster than everyone in the business so there was no way to longer compete

good,Fun and exciting environment.  New challenges daily.  Never boring and a  great opportunity for professional and personal growth.  Would recommend for anyone looking within the financial industry.
good,In the beginning it was controlled chaos on the trading floor that showed that if I can  manage in this environment I can manage in any environment. Great people to learn the ropes with. Management was very helpful in grooming me in the early years of my career in compliance.
good,great place to learn and grow. i like how management is very hands on and willing to go out of their way to make their employees happy. you learn about futures and options very fast.

Managed an Accounts receivable project that interfaced revenue billing software with bank auto debit software, creating a zero variance factor between the software that in turn reduced auditing hours and increased efficiency.  I learned how to manage a full cycle Accounts receivable department.  Worked extremely well with middle and upper mangement personnel.  Worked well with co-workers.  Spreadsheet development was the hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was producing error free reports on a monthly basis."

I used preprinted forms and maintained legal documents.  Worked with the accounting department and the legal department.  Filled in for the receptionist

good,"Best parts of the job is the benefits."
good,"The call center I work in is a non stop stress environment.  I enjoy being in the mix of the growth and development of the company.  The one thing I learned from CME the most crucial is time management.  I deal with the markets and the traders daily and their time is money.  "
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape.
good,"There will never be an experience that can compare to the trading that was happening in the old fashioned pits of the CME.  This was a high energy and emotional experience because everything came down to the monthly P&L, driven by the daily P&L."
good,"Great coworkers, intelligent people, good management. "

good,All the years that i worked it was a fun place to work meet new people some days were fast and some days were slow .Co-workers were great to be with it was like a family we would go out have a few drinks go to bbqs movies you name it.The hardest part of the job would be 911 row call affer being at work lossing friends that you worked with for so long and now see them not by your side was hard.

good,"Every corporate environment is expected to have red tape and politics, but the focus was always in making sure I executed my role in supporting staff and management in the best way possible. Without the liberty of the management team enabling my ideas and innovation to be implemented in my role, my development and growth could had been stunted but, I was able to operate out of the box and help to standardize effective process improvement administratively in several areas of the technology division. I have learned many things from my colleagues that promoted this growth professionally and personally. I would definitely say that CME Group takes care of the employees investing in their development. As people grow professionally and personally, the company grows. Change is not always easy but doable if open and flexible.The most enjoyable times were interacting and collaborating with, not just a department, but a team working towards the same goal for the company. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, many were affected by the lay-off."
good,"Great high paced atmosphere to work in,enhanced training was offered free as an employee,wonderful benefits."

good,"A good place to work. "
good,CME Group was perhaps the best workplace I have personally experienced although I would say it is not for the faint of heart if you wish to excel and move up the ranks demonstrating the  capcity to lead amongst leaders is at minimum a prerequisite.
good,"People here work very efficient everyday."
good,Overall the CMEG is a great place to work. There is a lot to do and it is very busy. The only detractor is the work/life balance. But that is solved by allowing remote connectivity.
good,CME Group is by far one of the best companies I've worked for. Most managers are great and will notice your potential for advancement. Great benefits and they even help you if you'd like to go back to school.
