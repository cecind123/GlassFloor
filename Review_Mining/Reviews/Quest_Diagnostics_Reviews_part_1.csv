rating,review
bad,"I can not say it is Quest as a company that is bad but I will say the Staten Island division is . The manager for Staten Island I never seen such poor people skills in my life and that is why they are constantly looking for new workers people quit in groups, New workers quit within a month of being there."
bad,You can not trust anyone in n the supervisory staff or the managers to have your back in any manner. One of them lied about how I got an injury to make sure that I did not receive workers comp.
bad,Not inclusive at all. There is such a feeling of separatism in the air. Most mornings you just sit and wait for the work to arrive. Instruments and QC are always problematic
bad,"Very poor management that shows favoritism. No proper training. They expect you to do numerous jobs for one pay. No opportunity to grow, very cut throat the only way you advance is if you lie and stay in cahoots with upper management. Nepotism at it's finest!!!!!!!"
bad,"Always understaffed, manager and supervisor not great communicating  with new hires. I learned more in training than in the clinic site. they expect you to know everything when you only been there 2 days. So I just took advantage of sponging the experience and left for another phlebotomy opportunity."
bad,Management was terrible.  Always tried my best but it was never good enough. I never  was praised for a good performance. Wouldn’t work with schedule changes.
bad,It was great working for Quest Diagnostics but now is a nightmare to work at Teterboro location. Management is the worse ever at Quest...Quest needs more qualified management to run the logistics department at Teterboro New Jersey...
bad,"This is a dead end job, don’t expect to go anywhere within this company. They only promote those that conform to their toxic behavior, usually those who are white males. After the first year, you don’t learn anything and you’re expected to be a computer monkey producing more and more money. Your credentials, knowledge, and work ethic don’t mean anything to this company. Even if you meet their high demands, you won’t get anything for it, no improvement in your schedule or pay. Management constantly plays games and will dangle a carrot in front of you to get you to do what they want. They micromanage your time, your breaks and lunch, as well as your behavior. Any sign of fun is frowned upon. Might as well be a prison."
bad,It was ok until they started selling parts of the company off. The new managers changed everything. The culture changed and it wasn’t the same . I don’t recommend working here
bad,"Formally known as Cleveland Heart Lab and bought out by Quest. The company struggles to keep employees. Lacking structure and constantly harassing employees; huge turn overs. The lab manager and as well at the shift managers blame others for their lack of knowledge and has no proper training of new hires. The lab is dysfunctional, needs managers who cares for the well-being of their employees."
bad,"The director of the call center in Medxm Santa Ana does not care about her employees. They let people go before Christmas, they are very heartless. They do not care about their employees. High turnover rate. Not worth working here and end up being depressed. If you know how to play the game and don’t care where you work then this place is for you, but if you’re looking for a place that actually cares about their employees and treats them well look elsewhere"
bad,"This company is only good to work for when you need experience and have plans on moving up in the world. This isn't a good place to stay, unless you are desperate. Filled with unfairness, politics, and you apparently need to be from the Philippines in order to fit in."
bad,"You can work for Quest, but always remember: "
bad,I watched good working people here drop like flies. They dont work around schedules. They favor people. They UNDERPAY you. People get fired for innocent mistakes. I worked for this company for 3 years. Most depressing and degrading time of my life. They take patients words over your own. You're at fault if anything goes wrong in the testing lab (lost specimen). Just dont do it.
bad,Not a good place to work. They want 4 ppl to do 350 people a day. And then we get screamed at because we are not working quick enough. The insurance is awesome but its not work dealing with. The supervisor are petty and very unprofessional. Ask she wants is her end of year bonus. The regular staff members were awesome but the upper heads are terrible.
bad,"I have never felt so unappreciated,  alone and hated.  People treat me differently and I'm far behind on training because they train everybody else and exclude me"
bad,This company will have your over worked and under paid. The exam one part of it is the worst. Highly under paid and extremely unorganized. You end up paying out of pocket for office supplies because your work is done out of your home. You are not compensated for gas and supplies.
bad,Mgmt was disorganized and lacked any communication skills. Inefficient structure for a healthcare field. Commonly failed to follow necessary protocols
bad,"I have worked here for a few months yet observed countless dramas from my coworkers and managers. They're generally lazy and prefer people who are as slow and lazy as they're. They would have you if you perform well at work, trap you into troubles if you defend yourself. Managers are stupid and blind to solve the problems. Even HR staff covers for managers. Don't come here to work."
bad,It’s not bad and it’s not good and it’s a job I really don’t have too much to say quest is like any corporate job they just care about the higher up people
bad,I have nothing positive to say about his job i hated every minutes of working there. they paid terriable wanted you to deal with disrespect and racial issues
bad,"Do you like working in a cubicle, chained to a desk, with a headset for 8 hours? Do you like to be micro managed? If so, then this is the job you are looking for....."
bad,quest is a reference lab non 24-7/365  We were based in multiple hospitals and all we heard was how much money we were loosing and we needed to cut deficit by all costs
bad,"They drain you of common decency making you a tool of the machine. Expecting more from you daily without compensation. Constantly moving the goal post. Its a shame that company that spouts the importance of a life in every tube, as long as people are viewed as dollar signs. The grossest part (and I deal with stool, sputum, and blood), is asking for a credit card at the end of the draw."
bad,"If I could give this company NEGATIVE stars, I would. Horrible rude/inconsiderate/unprofessional management. Horrible work hours. Horrible pay. Apply if you’d like to get treated like s h i t and get harassed all of the time."
bad,"Great science and scientists, horrible commercial leaders that have formed a cult-like work environment."
bad,This company is very unprofessional on how they handles things. There is no real career building or growth in the company. The managers stick together & cover up for one another. The pay is horrible & the benefits are little to nothing. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here unless you’re ready to be the escape goat when an issue arrives. Very prejudice.
bad,"Terrible, everybody is on drugs. Worked with people who constantly smoked marijuana on site. The supervisor is terrible, unble to deal with confrontation."
bad,"This had to have been, hands down, the worst professional job I have ever had. If I had not worked here to experience it, I would not believe it. It  is very sad that a company could let one member of management make life so miserable."
bad,This company terminated me while I was on approved medical leave for an urgent issue.  The reason being I did not answer my phone the first time they called me.  I called back and the director did not have voicemail set up...even though he had over 100 employees reporting to him.  And phones were not allowed during my medical treatment at the hospital.  Needless to say I have the federal department of labor opening a case on them for unwrongful termination.  It sickens me that a fortune 500 company tries to elude ethical laws.  This is a very greedy multi billion dollar company that does not care about ethical operations and I have better things to do than argue with corporate HR about laws in place to protect employees.  I wish it was just me but a friend approaching 70 had a hip replacement and back surgery.  They are trying deny her FMLA because she needs weekly physical therapy.  Does that sound like company you want to work for?  Now that I blew the whistle and have a possible lawsuit I am sure Quest is interested.
bad,No possible growth opportunity. Stated not in budget so they keep you as a contracted worker while hiring full time positions to other jobs in house. So
bad,"Management has preferences."
bad,It's the worst company I ever work for my entire life I'm so grateful I no longer am affiliated with this company particularly poor management staff when you complain to HR nothing gets done. Tremendous favoritism in each department very cliquish. Management staff is deceitful rude arrogant and lazy. The homedraw department has a high turnover rate several people have quit iypeoplhave quit
bad,"Extremely hostile, clicks & favoritism of the Filipino race from high up managment to the co workers. There is no diversity/ balance of ethnicity in this lab; 10% of English is only spoken on purpose. There is so much racial division its heart breaking!!! No harmony or respect of kindness for each other a lot of fake faces. The segregation is high among all races in this lab extremely toxic!! High number of co-workers that gossip /lie to hurt other people its was awful! I never experienced anything like it; worst experience of my life. I literally would cry driving home every day. Greatest relief is when I quit enough was enough!"
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. Pay is minimum wage, the work environment is terrible. Management doesn't care about the employees at all. The turn over at this place is scary."
bad,"As a call center representative for over 10 years this is the worst place to work for !!! "
bad,"In the interview, I was told that this position was a good fit for those who have stability in employment else where, which was perfect for me. You complete online training at $13/hr (about 16+ hours worth of training total). Then you pick up events to work through an online system. I attempted to pick up 7 events once I was done with the training. All of the events were denied for pick up. I reached out to the area manager and she said when you are new to quest diagnostics as a per diem health screening RN it is expected to be denied for most events picked up. I got fed up with trying to get an event so I resigned. In my opinion, the whole process was a complete waste of time. I wanted to make other RNs aware who might be considering this position. Don't waste your time making near minimum wage for nothing!"
bad,"Difficult and toxic culture with poor senior leadership, especially in Teterboro.  Poor leaders with high turnover continue to stay at Quest and be promoted, reinforcing the wrong behavior.  Lack of decision making, and only cut front line staff, benefits, and recognition.  2019 will be a terrible year, and also worse next year in 2020!"
bad,"worst company in the world supervisors are unprofessional the have you working at site with just two techs. It’s impossible to get in touch with hr i don’t "
bad,"It used to be a decent job. New management made it a nightmare. Mandatory 6 day weeks, mandatory daily over time, higher pressure on productivity, huge changes made that went against all of our training with little to no explanations/training on how to follow through with changes. Very aggressive deal with it or leave type attitudes if you approach management with questions or concerns on changes. This would be a great place for an undercover boss scenario, I think the higher ups could really benefit from seeing the problems first hand. I had to leave because i could not justify such a harsh work environment for the pay they offer."
bad,It was great when I first started.  Too much non phlebotomy work. Perfect for bill collectors and data entry specialists. if you're serious about phlebotomy
bad,"This place was the most toxic enviroment I worked in my 18 year career.  compensation was bad, everyone was expected to work over but they didnt want to pay anyone over time."
bad,"working there was aweful, lack of training due to smokers taking 6 breaks a day, manager always screaming at people, making them cry, people were never nice or willing to help you, everything about the company I worked for was hard and nothing good about it thanks to the manager they had there."
bad,"You spend your whole shift calling(harassing) the same members that your other coworkers have called the same day. They write you up for not producing appointments/calls when they dont have enough work or members for the workers to call. Those writes up, however, can lead to termination. They will escort you out the same day that you turn in a two weeks notice, let you come in for 40 minutes then will fire you or wait until you are about to leave for the day to fire you. They promise bonuses but keep extending the payment dates. They have left hours off of checks monitored by a supervisor that smells like alcohol every day and had not been fixed. Will monitor and lie about your calls to get people fired. Will blame everything on the PCCs instead of the forever faulty system that the company uses. I am not even sure if Quest Diagnostics is fully aware of what practices have occurred/are occurring under their company name. I would never recommend anyone to encounter this place of belittlement at any cost necessary."
bad,It’s my second go and Austin group management is poor. They cannot keep good people. I feel sorry for that. Dallas area managers and crew are excellent.
bad,Hated it so much I was happy when I left. They should hire managers that actually wanted to lead through business and not their personal views and opinions
bad,Horrible boring job you were hung up on or talked to answering machines all day long one right after another and it is the most boring job I have ever had
bad,"Management is extremely BAD!!!! They don't care about their employees. They are looking for robots. The actual job is exciting. There's a lot you can learn. The benefits are great and if you get hired, you should definitely apply for their 401k."
bad,They offer a higher pay rate but it comes at a cost. The amount of drama in this company is unreal. Before I left we had multiple HR complaints open about our management team. They have constant turnover and overwork the employees that stay. It was very hard to go in there every day and it greatly affected my mental and physical health.
bad,"Incompetent management, management harassment, hostile work environment, constant short staffing. The supervisor for my territory is absolutely horrible. I have suffered immensely at Quest Diagnostics."
bad,"Learn to work with your staff and listen to them, I had a very horrible experience it was a night mare working there, I was hired for one thing and was forced to do a different thing"
bad,"I wish I can give less than one star in my ratings because that place doesn’t deserve one star rating. "
bad,these managers are unprofessional treat certain ppl like trash exploding ppl income to other employees talk about other employees dig in sharps containers for tube etc ....pour over lavender tube when they don’t have enough blood bottom i don’t nobody should get any blood work done there from what i seen employees do
bad,"Lack of communication with everyone BULLYING is top reason I chose to leave as well as management horrible, forget about talking to HR if you are a temp they will only talk to you off the record."
bad,The work place is favortism ...no possitive communication...management is horrible and it all falls on the employee....job benefits are good and the hourly pay can be better.. Could be a great place to work..
bad,Management offers no constructive criticism or positive reinforcement. The only time you see your supervisor is when they beat you up by retraining you. The company’s mission statement should be quantity vs quality.
bad,"The worse company to work for. Not a good place."
bad,"Not enough training and very cold management, it was like working in a call center where your calls are monitored, no flexibility in the position and management kept changing."
bad,Worked for this company on 2 separate occasions. Heavy lay-offs for people who’ve been there for sometime and making decent money. Rather hire  new staff and pay them little to nothing. Supervisors are not supportive and lazy. HR is a joke. No policies in place for anything which allows the Supervisor to manage according to whom they personally like
bad,This is not a job u would want to stay at. This is a job u go to if you just need something for the meanwhile till a good company come around. They want u to work extra hard and don’t pay you. The raises are like 5 cents smh. The management is bad. They don’t care about you. They pick & choose who to do favors for & who the rules apply to. Everyone at this call center is looking to leave. They make u do extra work even tho it’s not what you got hired for. Even supervisors and leads have left because of this company. No incentives at all. Only had one which they took away. And they recently just laid off about 25 people two weeks ago. Supervisors get away with being nasty because they are friends with the site manager. It’s just a COMPLETE MESS! And they are nasty with the black and white people it doesn’t even matter. Lol.
bad,Quest Diagnostics does not care about it's employees. Underpaid and overworked.  I voluntarily quit because working conditions were so horrible.  Poor management and bad business decisions.
bad,"Possess flexibility and ability to adapt to change"
bad,I didn't enjoy working for Quest.  Underpaid and overworked. You don't make enough to live comfortably. Their benefits are expensive. They aren't family friendly.
bad,You are constantly criticized. If you are a hard worker it is never recognized. You are worked like you are a machine. Company does not support you. They care only about their bottom line. Management talks about each other. They Hurd people through their sites like cattle then place blame on staff if they look bad. Employees are not happy but won’t speak up for fear of being fired.
bad,Quest's motto is put the patient first but they left out a word....what they really meant to say is put the patient's wallet first.   Phlebotomists are incentivised to collect money from patients before services are rendered through an optional program called EZ pay.  I have witnessed coworkers argue and get nasty when a patient declines as the phlebotomist needs that bonus money since pay is so minimal.  This creates a negative experience for the patient. Also the medical benefits are absolute garbage.
bad,"As a Employee Of Quest for 10 years, I can say Quest Invests in everything except its employees, Raises are awful.. yearly bonus as bad, Incompetent supervisors and Leads, Our Department treats employees as dumb and do not value opinions unless you are a favorite or a minority you have NO Advancement opportunities.."
bad,Quest Diagnostics is a good company overall but the Tucker Location is the worst. I worked there for 4 years asked to be moved up vecause of my expertise never was moved up. These folks are messy at quest. I had two good supervisors while employed at quest only two. There are alot of politics at quest. Beware of the Specimen Processing Manager and some of the supervisors those people are wicked and messy.
bad,"I have worked for quest for 12* years as a phlebotomist and I maka less than 25 dollars an hour and was recently informed that in my position I will not make anymore money than I make now!  I have maxed out.  I work so hard the patients are my number one priority and it’s really upsetting to know that I will not be compensated or rewarded for my efforts.  I feel like I am wasting my time here.  I live in Silicon Valley I’m"
bad,This company is a joke. They do not and I mean DO NOT appreciate anything you do. They are not obligated to give you a raise each year no matter how hard you work for them. I worked for Quest for five years and it got worse and worse over time. If you have kids DO NOT work for Quest Diagnostics because they don’t care about your family. If you are to become ill they still want you to work. Please take it from me a really consider your family before applying at Quest Diagnostics.
bad,They say you get paid 16.25 an hour but you don't because most of the work they give you they want you to do off the clock which is illegal. They don't compensate you for gas like they claim. Its not worth it after the one month training.
bad,"Take it from me, don’t work here!  Management is absolutely terrible!  They currently have an egotistic  Narcissist as the lab manager! Four employees who were employed at Quest for over four years, have quit since the beginning of the year! If you take the job, believe me you will be the next to quit!"
bad,My advice is that never choose quest. They are very poor. They never pay well. They just want that we work for them but we never paid well. It’s a worst company.they need to upgrade their payscale and they have to give overtime to employes. supervisor is very  bad.he just want to make money.he never think about anyone.
bad,"This place will over work you to the bone constantly adding new responsibilities on the phlebotomist it seems like every month they change up their system of how they do things and blame you if metrics don't look well, and on top of the horrible work culture they pay the lowest on average for any lab in California horrible place to work they treat you totally replaceable."
bad,"typical work day was good. there is no room for growth and improvement.  no career progress, most people have been at quest for over ten years and still doing task as the day they walked in."
bad,Quest had very poor management. The compensations for the amount of work required was very poor. The job was very unprofessional and at times dangerous enviorment.
bad,"Management lacks in good communication. They have some of the worst patients i ever dealt with, oh and the pay sucks as well. The best peace of advice i got before i started, is to get my experience and get out."
bad,They don't care about the people.  Very political environment.  Two years and you will be burnt out.  Lots of reverse discrimination.  Go to work for Labcorp.
bad,"Sit on your behind for hours+overtime (up to 4hrs). Boring. People are always quitting due to rude managers who talk to you like a child. Immature co workers, lots of gossiping.Coffee will be your best friend to make it through the night.Wear shirt and shorts because its like a dessert in that department."
bad,"The workplace culture here is tough, demanding, and employees are expected to work at high stress levels for very little pay.  I didn't find the work to be rewarding, to connect with purpose, to have collaboration, positivity, and inspiration or creativity.  Overall, I would not recommend that anyone work at this company."
bad,Your just another number! HR doesn’t care about you! Management is sorry and allowed to treat employees any kind of way! You can find a fast food restaurant that pays more than Quest Diagnostics. Test are often compromised. Anything reported to HR comes back allowing you to be further harassed
bad,"Poor management , a place that is full of politics and confusion management  are a bunch of slave drivers very very poor working conditions this is the Stuart Florida  office."
bad,nothing good to say at all employees are not respected and there is favoritism all over you try and work hard but nothing matters to mgmt you are a disposable employee.
bad,"If you want a good paying job with minimal education requirements, Quest Diagnostics is a good option. However, along with your employment at Quest, keep in mind that you must request your vacation time almost a full year in advance. You get no personal or sick time, and the company does not accept doctor’s notes for ANY reason. If you are hired and paid to be a phlebotomist, you must also be aware that you will be taking on the role of receptionist, bill collector, and supply and inventory specialist. Hours and hours of overtime are mandatory. You will get a total of 6 paid holidays off, and the benefits are extremely expensive, with very high deductible insurance plans. If you are lucky, you will get a .20 raise every year, regardless of how much you contributed to the annual revenue with your productivity, or how much you decreased the company debt by taking patient payments. You might get a rock or a single piece of chocolate as your holiday gift. Do not expect a single acknowledgement or response when you send a well-thought out two week resignation notice. Quest had a universal recognition system, where employees could earn points for a job well-done, and could trade them in for gift cards and prizes. That system has been done away with in 2019, in order to ‘save money’. Quest Diagnostics made 8 billion dollars last year. Current Quest Diagnostics employees have been fighting for a Union for many years. Quest Diagnostics pays anti-union advocates $250 per hour and flies them out, all expenses paid, to host mandatory meetings, where employees are forced to listen to why"
bad,"poor management, short staff and all over worked, not allowed to take all PTO before expire due to short staff, long and unstable hrs., Unstable enviroment, very high employee turn over."
bad,"I wish I could give this company no stars at all. Working with this company was horrible; I am a Certified Phlebotomy Technician and they started me out at $13.56.  Like are you serious?? I have a certification, not a diploma. According to U.S Bureau Labor Of Statistics, a Certified Phlebotomist Technician hourly pay is $16.22. There is no way someone with a licensed and accredited Phlebotomy certification should be getting paid $13.56 an hour. STAY AWAY FROM QUEST DIAGNOSTICS FOR EMPLOYMENT. Don't waste your time and energy there. Apply to the hospitals or go to the laboratory centers, it is better pay and more opportunities. We are living in civilized times, no can survive working for $13.56 an hour. Get it together Quest Diagnostics...."
bad,"This place doesn’t care at At ALL ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES all they want from us is to meet the numbers and thats it. They are adding more work, the patient flow has increased tremendously and!!!!! They don’t even bother to mention on increasing our salary they just want us to work work like dogs and thats it. They don’t appreciate us at all!!!. Oh and who ever enter the company last gets paid more then someone whose been there working for a long time lol this company is a joke. Not to mention the time off pay is a mission omg!!!! You work you behind  off and then to get YOUR VACATION Is like a mission impossible!!!"
bad,"very stressful and negative place to work in. managers are rude and you have stay over time just to finish the work. the manager for my roll was very, very rude. she had very short patience and was quick to anger. i would never work there again."
bad,Horrible place to work. Supervisors do not have degrees and play favorites. Special privileges given to supervisor's friends and family. Seniority means nothing at this company.
bad,This was not the place of employment for me.  It is a factory style laboratory.  I was only employed there for 6 months but there doesn't seem much room for advancement there.  Each laboratory tech performed the same assay for the 6 months I worked there.  Very boring.
bad,Stressful and required overtime hours. Lunch break was 30 minutes. Customers yelled at you on the phone. The workers comp policies arenot fair and inhumane.
bad,"I had planned on working this job until retirement.   I was hired at 14.50 and was promised a 2% raise at 90 days and at the 6 month mark.  After 90 days came and went, no raise.  My supervisor  gave me 5 different excuses over 5 more pay periods.  This company will flat out lie to you to get you to work for them.  I never got my increases and left w/o notice."
bad,"I work 3rd shift, and it's been really brutal at Quest. Some of us have been working double shifts just to get the work done because we're under staffed. Now, they make us, and new poeple, to stay until all work is done! No one wants to stay at Quest! There's lack of appreciation, no empathy and no positive reinforcements on the upper management part. Oh! yeah, we get coffee and cookies maybe. Now, we have to start working mandatory Saturdays with no time off, that's 6days every couple of weeks, rotating Saturdays. But the supervisors don't have to work 6days, for some reason, they're life is more important than us little people. It is not fair. We have a life too, we have loved ones we would love to spend time with too, just like the supervisors! This is what u call ""Corporate America!"" It's all about money & numbers. I don't like companies who don't value their employees. That is why I'm on here looking for something else."
bad,"When you think you have to go to work, you expect it to be a nice place, every day you are in trouble because they do not select the group leaders that make your life impossible, demand more and more from the hard worker. and you complain to the bosses and they do nothing."
bad,Would not recommend as a career or job they do not respect your personal time the work is extremely stressful and you are not compensated as you should be management is not understanding the working conditions are not up to code
bad,"they need to add a second shift even if its part time , the workers work long hours , the majority off good worker quiet and the rest can't do the work to the fullest expectation due to not learning and adapting to the work . which make it harder on the older employees an they take the weight of the harder jobs task because the newer employees an't pull up their own weight"
bad,The Lee's Summit location is not somewhere that you will want to work full-time or regular. It is a joke and would not recommend anyone apply for this company.
bad,When I first started I took a serious pay cut from my former job. They do not pay well. My supervisor at the time didn’t even ask me for my qualifications she was more interested if I was bilingual. Like if that was the only reason she hired me? My friend referred me and we didn’t get the referral bonus. I built a relationship with my patients and won trust of patients with their blood draw. They weren’t the issue. The issue is management not caring about their employees. I lost a child because my supervisor didn’t allow me to leave while I was bleeding 6 weeks pregnant. I told her I was leaving because my child’s care is first. My miscarriage was led up on the stress from this job and I do not recommend anyone to work here not even my worst enemy. I lost my child and I’m left with this empty void from this company’s evil and toxic energy. My supervisor was fired because of my miscarriage and the one that took after her was even worse. It’s a never ending cycle. Smh.
bad,I wouldn't recommend this company. Management is terrible and there is no room for growth. Poor raises and your over worked with barely any incentives. So its hard to be motivated at this company.
bad,"This place was awful, the management was terrible, as any call center it was not the best place to work or ever want to think of working, staff and management was terrible!"
bad,"Very fast-paced, physically and mentally demanding work for low wages and little chance of advancement for entry-level workers with less than a 4-year degree."
bad,Everything I was promised from the beginning was all a lie. They tried to make you feel like this was the best place on earth the work then once you get in the lies start flying. Other employees tried to tell me to leave but I was trying to stick it out. I should've left when I was told.
bad,I absolutely hated this job it was the Pitts working there. They were not organized at all and always reigned on overtime. The supervisor was lousy and always tried being intimidating.
bad,I did not enjoy working for Quest.  Management can not be trusted and they are not open about projects and what Quest is working to improve.  They use a lot of old technology and need to advance ..
bad,A typical work day would consist of picking up packets to be keyed in. You are to take packets back to your desk and key in any missing information and not allowed to communicate unless it was necessary.
bad,"The supervisors treat you like kindergarteners .. you are baby sat expected to stay 10 hours a day every single day rude supervisors talk down to workers revolving door people always coming and going only a few long timers cause they started years ago when things were better and 90 percent of the current staff is looking for employment else where .., the temps they hire last 1 day to maybe 2 weeks then they quit ..."
bad,"Was a temp to hire position; they treated you okay for the first 30-60 days, then a day or two before they decide to hire you on full-time, all of a sudden you are not doing the job correctly. So they would find some reason to let you go"
bad,No matter what an employee does or what the managers say if they don't like you management will mark you non  rehire. They lie to get you to resign and once your gone they lie to keep you out.
bad,extremely fast paced and stressful. you are paid very little and are a slave. the hours are horrible and are required to work 6 days a week. the location i was at was extremely busy and dirty.
bad,"Very small, not flexible with your schedule besides the fact you can make up hours during the week. Training was great. Very small call center. Food trucks come !!"
bad,"management has unrealistic expectations,low pay, and  horrible hours. Mangers do not stand up for their staff they just do as upper management said. they put undo stress on their staff."
bad,"Quest diagnostics is a great overall company but the pay horrible and mangment is horrible. u never get credit for the good things you do , but the bad things are keep on record. its very unorganized and lack team effort."
bad,very busy 3rd shift. working in the lab - unable to get approved for days off. working monday thru saturday. very tiring and no room to advance!!!!!!!
bad,I was not told this was a temp postition until after I quit my other job and started at Quest.l I have been here 6 months and they keep telling me they are going to change me to perm but has not happened. I have no benefits or paid time off. The management is young and inexperienced. There is no consistency throughout the workplace.
bad,"This is a deplorable place to work. Horrible hours, the pay is not good, and they treat their employees absolutely horrible. The management team barley knows their employees by name. Forget having a life, forget enjoying being at work."
bad,Over worked under payed. No coverage was offered. You also work on Saturdays. Very versatile  and very stress full job. Work kept piling on and pay stayed the same.
bad,I was a part time Laboratory Assistant for almost one year. I would float around on a daily basis including weekends. I enjoyed my job at Quest Diagnostics.
bad,Company did not stick with position hired for.  Job duties changed numerous times without options.  Take it or leave it attitude.  No employee backing with customer is always right.
bad,"They will uses you and spit you out. Horrible turn over rate. I have nothing nice to say about them. Just a bad place to work no matter what location you take, all managers are connected to one another."
bad,"They are super short staff, they specailize in overworking their employees. I will never work for them again. They keep workers that not worth keeping that lack phlebotomy skills."
bad,"I learn fromquest never help them they r unfair with employee "
bad,"merging with Summit was the worst mistake for Quest Diagnostics to do."
bad,"Over all rating of quest diagnostic: Very stressful enviroment, very poor management, lack of carrier advancement, not a future, the supervisor is not qualified"
bad,My short employment at Quest Diagnostics was an awful experience. Client to employee are not all great. Very stressful. They have high turnovers.   NPI
bad,"You are treated has nothing more then a warm body filling a position. They calim to have amazing benefits, which their medical is alright, the downside is you will never be given the time to actually use those benefits. The only way to get time off to get a regular physical, or teeth cleaning or anything, is to call out sick. Do NOT apply to work for this company, it is not worth your time or energy."
bad,"worst place ever!!!!!!!!!! run, don't walk away from this place. horrible leaders and horrible work place. nasty coworkers, nasty office with rodents all around"
bad,"This company is a typical factory type of any position."
bad,Quest is a reference lab with a high volume of production expected while using old equipment in a rigid metric evaluation system.   I felt that management was not involved enough with training even though this was my first cytotech job.  My fellow cytotechs attempted to bridge the gap in between their own work loads. For most of the year the multi head microscope was virtually unusable so little of the traditional training could not occur.
bad,"It is a worst company for any employee. Managment had no clue what should be done no strategy. HR team is pathetic. No body will listen to you once your resign. "
bad,"Very stressful, would not recommend this job to anyone.  A lot of work to get done in a short amount of time.  Severely underpaid with no appreciation"
bad,Not the best company to work for. They do not do a thorough investigation when trying to access a situation. They need to do better when it comes to their employees.
bad,"Worked at this place for almost 10 years and it was a rough time. The company didn't want to compensate you for the work you performed nor acknowledge any issues that you bring to light. My department was understaffed and management didn't care unless work was three days behind and you had to start canceling tests. This company never put the patient first in decisions that were made. Would I work for this company again? If the pay was way better and I was only part time, maybe. Minimal interaction with managers and other coworkers seems to be the way to go if you're going to work for Quest Diagnostics. Otherwise, it's a game favoritism and brown nosing to get anywhere in the company."
bad,There were multiple redundancies and it was very difficult to be productive in a very politically charged environment. The glass ceiling was an issue.
bad,"I don't have nothing nice to say about this company"
bad,this is the worst place in history they will fire you for no reason if you work there for years and replace you with someone they can pay less too. they save money everywhere and employess are one of them. they only hire temps and get rid of them after a few months so training is a hassle because you have to train new people over and over
bad,"The management would work employees to death if needed.  They would then take credit for the accomplishments of their employees, never even a thank you."
bad,"Too much turnover, too much favoritism.  Don't work here it's not worth it, better to find a more stable company.  The management on cards about themselves"
bad,"This is a great company to work for, I would go back if given the opportunity .They had a wonderful and understand management team. The benefits were awesome, the money was also wonderful for that time in my life."
bad,"They lie, promise raises that never happen. If you are lucky enough to get one it's $0.08 after a year. They do not value their employees. Every day threatened that you are replaceable. Unable to transfer to different positions. Your manager will say bad things about you to ensure that you can never leave or transfer. Never able to get time off, even if planned and requested months in advance."
bad,"The Lees Summit, Missouri campus is a known joke througout the community. No professionalism or basic intelligence in management creating an atmosphere of failure and negativity leading to an attrition rate upwards of 90%. No safety, no training, no consistency."
bad,"This place was a horrible environment to work in. Management also the supervisors treat employees like they work in a sweat shop. The pay is horrible. Forget ever getting sick and have to call out management could careless.  The manager was aggressive, tried to intimidate employees and was very insulting and rude. The reason they hire all the time is because they cannot keep employees long. Employees who have been with the company for 20+ years are now transferring or leaving the company because of the horrible work conditions and management. They treat employees like slaves. I hope you don't have have to use the bathroom because that is also frowned upon. This was the most horrible company I've ever worked for."
bad,"I can't even begin to explain how upset/disappointed I am for working at DLO which is owned by Quest Diagnostics. They offered me a $4000 sign-on bonus (basically bribed me into working there), not mentioning how the bonus was being paid out. I received the bonus in 2 payments which were added to 2 of my paychecks and taxed. There amount I actually received was around $1200 on each paycheck for the total of a little over $2000. After working there for a little over a year, me and 2 of my co workers decided to leave due to having health issues. Not to mention that working there is a NIGHTMARE. Occasionally, we would not even get a lunch due to the workload. It has been 5 months and we all received a letter asking to pay Quest back $4000 for the ""sign on bonus"". After speaking to an HR employee at Quest, I was told that they ""paid"" us the whole amount and it is not any of their concerns that the government taxed our bonus. Not only this is stealing, they trick people into thinking that they are receiving the whole $4000 and they have to pay back what they did NOT receive."
bad,"What healthcare? This is the new norm. Profits, profits, and more profits. It just made me sick to be part of Quest. I understand it is a business, but really? No one cares if you are a good person or you are very polite with patients and try to reduce their pain while they are stuck with a needle. No one cares how you obtain the blood as long as you obtain it and there is an insurance provider on file to be charged. The only thing important for Quest is what is the percentage of patients' credit card numbers phlebotomists enter in the computer system. Even if the patient dies due to false test results, the company will still charge the credit card for services provided."
bad,"I was shocked what a low level employer this is. They have no respect for their employees, treat them like low level job seeking suckers, and the supervisors are like ""My way or the highway!"". If you don't even slightly conform with the big corporation rules, then you are not worthy to stay there. Meetings are like a military one way briefing. The only information presented during meetings is the one that the supervisor depends on for her paycheck. There are no discussions, no time for employees' main concerns or issues about patients, just difficult to understand rules and procedures. I have to give them credit though, there is food provided at every meeting. Quite a nightmare place to work due to all the supervisor's corporate military style management. I made a mistake working for the company."
bad,"Very unstable place to work at. Before i started working for Quest, i had very high respect for the company. It is the largest lab in the US and they have many job applicants, so it must be a stable and respectful employer. I did not know how wrong i have been. Of the not so small group of phlebotomists working for Quest in the area, 8 out of 10 phlebotomists worked for Quest for a year or less. There is extremely high employee turnover. Some of them leave unsatisfied and many of them are laid off. Since some of the phlebotomists are placed to work in a physician's office, if this office changes their schedule or cancels services which happens frequently, then there might be no other place for the employee and they have to be laid off. It seems like that the company is actually benefiting from the high turnover and supervisors encourage it. Who needs people to stay longer and ask for more money or a better job anyway. Its is not worth it even applying for a job with Quest, there is nothing good there."
bad,"I worked at a busy medical clinic for Quest.  Not allowed to communicate or help the clinic because ""I worked for Quest not them!""  "
bad,Quest is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. 90% of Supervisors are not qualified for their positions in fact I was actually more qualified for supervisor position than my own supervisor. They play favorites BIG time! Constantly making you work over time & almost always short-staffed. The pay sucks. You're constantly changing policies in the way they want things done which is fine except for when they change them and don't pass the members along to their employees and when the employees don't do with their new correct way they get wrote up or fired.
bad,very cheap company. and very busy and poor management. Who think about their money only money slavery. their employees and m as ke them to work worse an slave.
bad,"very professional environment"
bad,"wack wack horrible place to work.. managers horrible!!!! lots  of shade, drama, everyone sleeps with coworkers....horrible benefits, pay, work conditions"
bad,"Quest Diagnostics is an awful company to work for, they are a monopoly, they buy the little labs and pay people peanuts to do a job that requires a lot of attention to detail.  Managers and team leads are the worst."
bad,All theu care about are numbers Not patients. They ober work employees making a phlebotomist. Do paper work draw then process all in. 3 to 5 minutes. It like working in in a sweat shop. Worst company ever
bad,"not safe to work.learn nothing,management sucks,co-workers,are sensitive,and gossip,slavery ,not enjoyed...supervisor has favoritism"
bad,I liked this position because it the hours were 5am to 1:30 pm. There was always alot to do  it was enjoyable. The hardest part of this job was the Supervisor she was not very kind to us.
bad,"If there is any chance for Quest Diagnostics to completely fall of the boat, it is to have a subsidiary as ExamOne. This place is ridiculous. It is some sort of telemarketing company, that is responsible for life insurance applicants’ medical exams at their homes. It is a good merger, because Quest has the lab necessary for testing the blood specimens. The problem is that since the lab in Louisville is responsible for Kentucky and West Virginia, hiring of Mobile Examiners has to be done in a semi virtual form. Plus, since they cannot guarantee any work schedule, they don’t hire full time or part time phlebotomists, but they very creatively call it “on call” position. This also means that they can call you and rely on you all day long, but they will only pay you if work is assigned to you and completed according to very questionable rules.  It is very stressful job. No one knows how much work will be available, when and even if there will be anything, because sometimes applicants do not show for the appointment or they cancel it. So, you don’t make much money at all. The company compensates you a very a small amount for canceled appointments, but it is not worth it and you have to fill out forms and wait for someone’s approval, which wastes more of your time. This is why they call it “on call”, because they do not want to pay you for your time working for the company. "
bad,"Management does not have communication skills with employees! Company does not care about employess. raises are rediculous,no room for growth in company"
bad,to be absolutely honest I wouldn't advise anyone to apply at this place there's a huge turn around rate due to the work production supervisors and training they will over work you and under pay you bust your butt for 8 hours and don't even get a simple thank you the supervisors are poorly trained the its like they give these jobs to anybody for a little of nothing in pay there's no room for growth
bad,paid well but run as if it was a high school. the mangers are very immature and are only concerted with covering themselves.
bad,"While employed as a temp with Solstas/Quest Labs this company has to have the lowest moral if any where that I've ever worked. Alot of very unhappy permanent Fulltime employees. The office in Greensboro,NC has alot of unfriendly employees working there. No one ever smiles. No one ever speaks to you in passing if they do it is very RARE. The lab has nightly huddles as they call it and I guess this is to pretend that the moral is so high....this is a joke. The temporary agency that hired me to work for Solstas/Quest was also a nightmare. This was my first and last experience working as a Temporarily Employee. Aerotek is a joke not a good agency to work for neither. They have a bunch of idiots working there. Very disppointed in Aerotek of Greensboro, NC."
bad,"•	Performed collections of specimens from geriatric and pediatric patients "
bad,"Procedures are ridiculous. It takes way to long to check pts in and they want it done in a certain amount of time, They had us doing way more than I went to school for. Worked for Quest about 3 years, never will I go back."
bad,"A typical day at work was to make no mistakes with patients lives."
bad,"Long hours! No life because employees are expected to be to work on time and leave when work is done. Management is rude, unprofessional and bias towards friends.  "
bad,Could have been worse. Ive worked for a lot of places that dont value their employees and this place was just like those. Goodpay if you worked overnight but the mgmt was one sided. Treated certain employees better than others. Not enough training was given on PPE and a lab tech was exposed to HIV positive blood and had to start anti-virals immediately.
bad,We had good benefits. Good working enviroment. Respectful management. Good hrs.
bad,This is a cut-throat company.  They took a good profession and ruined it (cytotechnology).  No regard for their employees at all.
bad,"Register patients, draw blood and separate serum. Also verify insurance, do chain of custodies.  Co-workers are easy to work with, management is HORRIBLE! No respect for workers."
bad,"I have over 15 years of laboratory experience and Quest is the worst structured lab environment one could possibly experience. Their revenue claim is 5B-10B yet their pay is shyte. They do not have a decent career ladder.There is no investment in employee growth via education and/or technology. And though they boast of Total Quality Management, their practice is so far away from patient first, it is embarrassing. The recent advert for a MT (Lead) at $21/hr is an insult especially considering our counterparts (RN BS) would make the double. I have earned two degrees directly related to my profession at Quest and a plethora of certificates and I have not received 1 cent or even mobility upward. The ONLY enjoyable part of this job is the patients. tsk tsk I would love to sit down and debate the pros and cons with the corporate heads."
bad,Mgmt and HR is a joke.  They treat everyone like they don't matter and are easily replaced.
bad,"I was hired for night shift making decent money and work was grand, then they cut night shift out and i had to start working day shift. I would go to work and do all morning lab draws for the entire hospital. I would then come back down to the lab and start with all orders that were being placed for all other departments."
bad,"They promise and promise a job, then right before your supposed to be hired, your fired!"
bad,"Sr Leadership had 27 priority strategic objectives for fiscal year. Seriously.  Limited market focus and understanding of organizational capacity. It was impossible to succeed.  Lots of fire, ready, aim effort and throwing people under bus when things didn't go well."
bad,"Lery was my instructor, very helpful. taught me a lot of useful information . i can use it to further my career goal."
bad,This is the worst company ever to go for Lab testing and also to work at. They lost so many of my clients speciment its unbelievable the are not sued yet. Worst customer service people in the industry.
bad,Your one person doing work for 50 people and then Supervisors when they do pop up fuss at you like its so easy to do your job!!! 
bad,"A typical day in this work enviroment can be detrimental to ones health with an over abundance of mold growing on both ceiling tiles and around air contidioning vents, when the air conditioning is working properly. Management is the most inefficiently trained group of brown nosers and yes men I have ever had the misfortune of working with. the work itself is quiet conter productive with an ever increasing delegation of work constantly handed off to others with a copious amount of fingerpointing and blaming instead of problem solving and solution management. Even when new methods to increase work production is found management is quick to find new methods to bring said means to a hault. Lack of research and worker interaction and common sense plague the facility from the ground up. No room for growth nor methods to properly educate oneself in the environment. The HR manager does absolutely nothing to protect workers rights and on a number of occasions have revieled private information with management. Compensation as well as compentency are both lacking in the work done. There are those that carry an excellent work ethic and demenure but are constantly put under scrutiny or overworked until burnout occurs. Education is deemed unneccesary for job capability. Deception and underhanded dealings are king, where workers are quick to become terminated because of personal differences. Management even employs methods to have adversity among workers. Never have I worked around a group of adults that act no different than middle school children."
bad,This is a very greedy company
bad,"Background checks are to be perform before employment and all issues should be resolved prior to start date, company allowed me to work 2 months and then discharged me due to information discrepancy about length on previous employment."
bad,I am doing internship here for phlebotomy. It is not a paying job. I am having fun doing internship here.
bad,I am doing internship here for phlebotomy. But it is a great place to work at. Also to update the medical skills.
bad,Quest is pretty much laid back and it is an accommodating position ill work for them again.
bad,A typical day at work is:
bad,This company does not care about its employees. They only care about their own needs. They pay lousy for the amount of work that is asked.
bad,"stressed, overworked, only 3 days training and threw you into the mix, management bad..overall sweatshop conditions! run and run fast!!"
bad,"Was lied to from day one from this company. Was told it was a full time possition and got to choose the schedule I wanted then when started training was told it was a temp job (90 days) with different hours and the possibility to be kept on after 90 days. Mislead. Was not told this before accepting job. Did not get paid for holidays but had to perform manditory OT and Saturdays.Received ""recognitions"" from the department head daily but at the of the 90 days was told I wasn't working out. Huge waste of my time! I worked hard to meet the goals out upon us and met or exceeded them."
bad,not a good company to work for if you have family. there is a no fault call off policy- three strikes and you are out!!!
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. Manditory overtime, weak benefits and management doesn't care about employees."
bad,"Don't waste your time with this company.  Job opportunities were presented in a way that were deliberately  unobtainable.  If you accepted an opportunity it was declined.  Can't speak for other positions in this company, only as an independent contractor as a biometric screener.  This pretty much ruined my desire to do this type of work."
bad,This was the worse place I ever worked. They mistreat you. Dont care. The moral is always low. Very unhappy going to work every day. Not a good place to work would not recommend
bad,In general the company ignores employee concerns and retain poor managers regardless of employee opinions.  The co-workers mostly get along well.  Benefits are terrible for a company that big!  Quest cuts corners on their IT and software so because it is so inefficient It makes it difficult and frustrating to perform the simplest tasks!
bad,Will drain the life out of you  low pay bad management  don’t pay you for what you do expect you to do supervisors job and not a compliant lab  stay away
bad,"Management is very unsupportive of the employee."
bad,Management is connected and gangs up on employees    They have their chosen few  not sure how they manage to keep their jobs    Quest says they thrive on customer service but truly can care less about the customers as well as their staff  which is why the turnover is so high
bad,Dont waste your time on these people.  Management and HR work together to lie and disrespect employees.  No diversity at all! I worked here 16 yrs and management kept me down and never wanted to see me move up . I believe because im Hispanic!
bad,"I'm grateful for the opportunity to work here. I was hired with no actual hands on experience. There are chances to advance your career, that's something that I would like to do."
bad,"Quest is the most unorganized place to work. The managers are terrible. Too much favoritism. They take your kindness for weakness. They let certain people slack off, while others have to carry the load.  No one can be trusted at this place. The morale is very low. Don't work here!!!"
bad,Supervisor has her favorite people at the PSC. Did not treat employees equally. Had to beg for vacation time. Horrible pay raise. Working with my coworker was ok.
bad,"It’s literally the worst place to work at. And I’m not rating Quest Diagnostics as a whole. Just the company MedXM. Management/leadership SUCKS. So much favoritism it’s disgusting. If you need help and have a question, you better raise your hand like a child because apparently we’re not adult enough to have our instant messaging  ability. We’re only “adults” when it’s convenient for them to say we are. If you have a question, again don’t count on actually getting help. That’s, unless you’re a favorite. New management is terrible. Seriously, don’t do it"
bad,"There is no manager on site or supervisor ever, some locations have “site leads” but they really are not that much more knowledgeable than the next employee, it’s just about who has been there the longest. None of the employees seem to care and even less when they know managers do not come around very often. I was there 3 years and every year the workload was more for phlebotomists"
bad,"Was not a happy place to work. Too much rivalry with co-workers and management not doing much about it. Lead mentors are deplorable, they mostly fight to get employees fired not mentor at. The company does not focus on employees and their well being at all. It's always about the money and not about the employees."
bad,"Management very intense, aggressive, rude! Low pay and long hours!  Company promotes uneducated people to management positions based on their seniority ""not on merit"" which causes poor employee moral high employee turn over rate!"
bad,"Gallop survey or employee survey is used to fire employmees inspire of telling employees that it is confidential.  Whenever a senior management is at fault; cost cutting is usually occurs to the hard working employees and not senior management. There is lot of "
bad,I am to work 30 hours a week so far I have worked a total if 30 hours in a 6 week employment period which is very frustrating almost seems like you were misinformed.
bad,"In this company is all about how good is ur relationship with the manager no matter how good u are like and employee "
bad,The company I worked for was great until quest came in and acquired it. Now we are just production units that are trying to cut costs. They do not care about their employee. They are just trying to turn the largest profit they can.
bad,"This company is all about profit.  Do not listen to its employees.  To many levels of management.  Disconnect with the field and operations."
bad,"Not a place I would suggest to anyone. So many problems starting with the work that is expected of employees all the way down to extremely poor management. Do yourself a favor and don't even apply, if you find yourself no other option the money isn't half bad but you will want to continue searching for other employment elsewhere."
bad,"Unfortunately, working at Quest Diagnostics was, unfortunately, the worst 6 months I have ever had at a job.  Upper management chose not to understand the issues the employees were having and overlooked the blatant abuse imposed by one specialist... such a shame, it COULD have been a great place to work."
bad,quest diagnostics is very fast paced. the work load is way to much for the amount of patients that are seen daily. the pay is horrible considering what you have to deal with on a daily basis and they don't have enough staff and  they over work you. your schedule is supposed to be 6-3 but most times you don't leave until 5 or 5:30 pm. they have their favorites. the management is not the best. they claim they want you to get a better education but will only work with you until a certain point. this is not a job that i would recommend to anyone.
bad,Walking into Quest was very stressful due to the many problems that goes on . The hardest part of the job is trying to stay in the company without walking on egg shells on a daily basis. The management is very poor at the company and the most enjoyable part were talking to the clients on the phones
bad,"I really rather look at paint dry than to offer any information on that place..."
bad,No supervision. Half of the staff spend most of the day playing on their cell phones  or socializing. Nothing is done to discourage this. If you actually do a good job you won't be allowed to promote or transfer since they can't loose you from your position. They need you to pick up the slack for the rest of the staff. Very bad morale and no chance to move up.
bad,"I worked at the e fowler location management horrible,there is only you and another receiver that is receiving 20 to 24 pallets with no help, all management will do is sit and watch, doesnt engage, the scheduled hours are suppose to be from 8-430 mon-fri, trust me, you will never leave on time,more like 7-9 pm but management expect you to leave at 430 which is impossible. There is another issue,where the buyer will talk to you any kind of way, the buyer is very messy,try their best to create trouble and confusion between you and the other receiver, so if you start here,please be very very careful,and stay away from both as much as possible,and dont listen to anyone in that department if it is anything negative. I quit this job with no intentions on returning,i was only there a month,i could not tolerare the unprofessional environment with alot gossip,and drama going on. I wish anyone luck, but the leadership in that department is very unethical and not appropriate."
bad,"Upon first getting hired with Quest, I was very excited. The pay arrangement that I was told about was very lucrative.  But upon actually experiencing their date and time cutoffs, you never get paid for a partial holiday that you work."
bad,the company is ok to work for just meet a lot of nice people.co-worker some times get along management changes the rules to frequent.there is nothing hard about the job
bad,I work in the laboratory at Thomas Hospital in Fairhope Alabama as a Medical Technologist. This has been the worst place I have ever worked in my life. Management is horrible. I work night shift and there is no consistancy in scheduling. The manager changes the schedule weekly.  There analyzers in the lab are around 15 years old. They invest no money in this lab. Half of the time supplies that are needed to complete task are not available.
bad,"Micromanaged to death"
bad,Have been with the company for many years .They are more concerned about cytotechnologists statistics and turn around time than anything else.Now we have to work mandatory overtime because the management cannot fix the backlog that they created.Started looking elsewhere.
bad,"Although the business model for this company is sound, the operations and management have faced significant challenges over the past 10 years that have left the company struggling to keep up with the competition. The place operates like a factory, with three shifts. Weekend work is a must here. Pay is very low for the amount of effort and technical expertise expected of the employees. There is little to no advanced training to assist employees in any meaningful career path. The management has been in place for at least 30 years, and they seem to lack the leadership to move the company forward. Staff has been dramatically reduced by attrition with some departments functioning merely by the grace of God (some departments have lost over 50% of the workers, they left on their own). Health care coverage is the most dreadful that I have ever seen. If all of this doesn't tell you to stay away, then ask yourself what you missed."
bad,Stressful and hostile workplace. Not a lot of advancement opportunity. Good benefits is turning to bad. Co-workers are good. Management are like the the olden days. They treat employees as slaves.
bad,Do up training in your position and don't receive more pay. Co workers are fun to work with. But not a great place to work. There is lots of up training and little pay and the starting salary is all of the board and some people don't have any experience and come in making more than a person who has lots of experience.
bad,Was not there long enough to review. No patients on Fridays. The office manager is the doctor's husband. Have to figure out how to do most things on your own. They cannot keep a staff. Office is filthy and there is no cleaning service. Some patients are scary.
bad,Delt with doctors and patient results.  Careful not to break company policy and HIPPA
bad,"this job is a a joke, and so is the pay. 12 hour mandatory overtime. no bathroom breaks. no talking. minus well be in middle school."
bad,"I would rather not say. My experience is mixed. As far as co workers go,most were great. The atmosphere reminded me of high school with all of the gossip and secrets swirling around."
bad,The sales department is what seems like the only department that matters. Employees have no representation or back up from HR. Very disorganized company in which there is no chance for advancement or compensation for extra- ordinary requests...( ex: Extreme amount of travel day to day without providing mileage.)
bad,Would not recommend anyone working in the Specimen Management Department. WOrst job I have ever had.
bad,"I am a former Quest employee and working there was my first job as a phlebotomist. It was the worst experience of my life! My very first day there the ""group leader"" told me the school I went to was worthless and that I was an idiot, before even seeing any job performance. I was called names daily, so were a few other employees, I was screamed at in front of patients and just treated badly all the way around. After going to HR with my concerns, I was then treated even worse by the group leader and Manager. After I was told that retaliation would not be tolerated it happened anyway! The group leader set me up and had her friends call and complain about me which led to my being terminated! I would never EVER work for another employer like this again! The management is awful and the employees there will stab you in the back while smiling in your face! The patients are treated even worse then the employees!!"
bad,"Quest Diagnostics is a ok job. It could be better, could be worse. It is nice to see that they do have alot of organized events going on to help with blood drives and march of dimes."
bad,"When I was an employee at your company, I have a bad experience;Senor tech and newly hire tech are treated differently.New tech are in process of learning experience and was written off or get warning in every error while , senior tech are exempted for any error especially the several lead techs, a reason for fast turover .Instead of training and helping me, some of the so called senior tech would say I don't know but help out their white friend.The so called lead tech after finishing there job in their dept. at 4 am would dissapear and reappear in time to clock out, instead of helping other dept.Dont we have team work here ? I worked for 1 year and was strip of my hiring bonus which was promise me when they decided I was not qualify for the job.I applied for unemploymemt butn you contested and deny me the benifit even though I contrubuted for unemployment benifets and legal case follows.Working for you is a nightmare, I am experience Med Tech and yet the manager is unaware or was aware and ignore the politics in the lab...it is who is your friend in the lab situason.I am working in a factory..quality control ?..questionable.If somebody ask me how is it to work at Quest ? I answered Quest is a factory and you deal for so called several lead techs.who worked and retained for so many years with commited errors and new tech are let go for the same reason..This is not a marketing strategy but I am telling the truth...my first hand experience.Althogh I found a job as a technical and management in a State Hospital..my advisor and consultant was a Quest pathologist whom I work directly"
bad,"I would tend to be Leary of which manager I get as some of the management staff tends to use favoritism. Phlebotomists must work many different levels of the job, insurance person, payment collector, specimen processor, phlebotomist, Data entry specialist, all while the pay remains the same."
bad,Contractors are treated as second class citizens and disposable at a manager’s whim.  No support.  Asking key questions is met with barely veiled disdain.
bad,"6 years, lack of acknowledgement, support, varying coworkers decreases teamwork perspective, varying work availability, favoritism, experienced retaliation with no repercussion."
bad,"This company hardly give days off and vacations even we suppose to have them. They hardly have coverage . Managers are awful and unprofessional. They don’t like their employees to succeed and always harass them for everything and have favorites for everything. I worked for this company with so much stress and under pressure  all the time. They want you to be fast"
bad,Quest was a good place to work. till the last year when they hire a supervisor.  He is a young guy that going to change the company{in his mind}.  He dont look in to things he just takes other people word before the employees.  He drink to many energy drink then jumps from one thing to another.
bad,"lack of communication"
bad,"They set me up for failure by not training me to the degree my position required. I was left alone to close the clinic with no one available for help when I needed it. I have no experience working in a lab, and was not told I would be working alone until my first day on the job."
bad,It is an extremely bias place to work. The people with the lighter complexion are allowed to advance easily. Positions are created for them. Everyone in the department are not given the same opportunities.  A lot of special treatment. One of the employees babysit her managers kids. She receives ALOT of special treatment.
bad,"Call center high school drama. To much competition among the other offices and derails the ultimate goal. Continuously call same people and your bonus is dependent on the completion of the appointments and providers habitually cancel their appointments most times scheduling rep is not notified, which decreases their bonus."
bad,I hate it there. There is an abundance of favoritism towards the Hispanics. It is truly unfair. The supervisors speaks to you as if you are incompetent. The employees there are stressed overworked and underpaid.
bad,All they care about is profits. Patients don't matter and employees don't matter. It's assembly line style so highly repetitive. Nothing you do is ever good enough.
bad,"Never fully staffed, supervisors used intimidation tactics, not a positive environment, very hard to get time off requests approved even when you have the time available."
bad,"They dont care about their employees your just a worker that does the job they dont have a clue, if your black they stick you in the inner city with no chance of getting out"
bad,Everything is about how fast you work despite all the things you have to do that aren't tracked. High turnover rate. Managers play favorites. Frequently under staffed.
bad,Very bad management to work for. To much gossiping between leads and supervisors. To messy. Very poor leadership. To much playing by upper management. They work ethic classes
bad,Anyone thinking about working for Quest needs to turn around and run away as fast as you can.  No amount of money and benefits are worth the stress and lack of work/life balance.
bad,They don’t discipline people that need it and people that don’t need to be disciplined are! Great pay but they’ll move you around wherever they want. Not a fair place to work!
bad,Kiss butt or get no where. Advances people with far less experience and knowledge over the people who deserve the positions. Nepotism is very apparent in the office.
bad,"This company has managers w/poor management skills. They need to be retrained cannot rely on them. They are not organized at all, they do not care about the staff. They do not do their jobs properly, want to blame the phlebotomists for anything and everything."
bad,"If you have experience working in a Hospital,  then you will not like Quest.  They expect phlebotomy staff to do the secretarial work and do Insurance billing before you draw the patient.   It is no wonder why they have a high turnover rate and hire phlebotomy staff with no experience. Also the pay is way below what a good hospital pays."
bad,I was wrongfully terminated due to health disabilities. Never was given the opportunity to advance after displaying excellent work performance. Very negative work environment.
bad,"Like my title states, the company has some really outrageous, unrealistic productivity expectations of their RSR's/Couriers. My experience with Quest was unpleasant and brief. I was extremely turned off during my training once I firsthand witnessed the unrealistic amount of stops to collect patient samples each RSR/Courier was expected to complete within a route and timeline while utilizing the ""Smith"" system of safe driving protocols; laughable, unrealistic, and ridiculous -- comparable to the saying ""You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig"". The company can push the Smith safe driving system all they want, but the fact remains they're still requiring that you perform an extremely high number of pickups relative to a short amount of time, which in my mind equates to an extremely rushed employee out there on the road employing whatever means necessary to get all their pickups completed. Ultimately, I lasted one week on the job before coming to the irrefutable determination that I was not suited to the high pressure, demanding environment. In addition; I personally found the in office personalities of other drivers to be tough talking and confrontational. I seriously was shocked and hated the toxic environment. For these reasons I did not last but a week, unfortunately, because compensation and superb benefits like what Quest offers from day one are almost unheard of these days. Even still, for me the high stress and demands of the route coupled with the mean, tough talking drivers were enough to make me walk."
bad,"I had the worst experience ever in the OKC office. There was so much hate and negativity, and when going to HR nothing was ever solved. Terrible place"
bad,"Poor management, No empathy from management. Under staffed. Communicating with manager can actually be frightening. It is a good company to work for, but management can be improved."
bad,"Supervisor was shady, lots of nepotism from top to bottom. If you didn't know someone you got no were, if you pointed out wrong doings you were punished. NO ETHICS"
bad,Very little cross training. The work pace is always hectic. Management does very little to improve workflow or department culture and it is frustrating Issues are not addressed my management
bad,"After deducting for gas, car maintenance, paper, printer ink, many hours of non paid time, malpractice insurance, increased auto insurance, and lost time between clients, I made less than minimum wage."
bad,"This is a dead end job since no career path or growth withing the company.  the only good thing i would say is  they pay for tuition. its up to you to use it or not. managers discretion is exercised freely."
bad,No work/life balance.  No room for error. Write ups for everything. Slave drivers and childish. Management too busy being bestfriends with each other.
bad,Anytime anything came up that was not covered in training the manager that I had refused to explain it she always said Oh They'll cover that in a different training class when I needed to know right then because the subject was right in front of me
bad,a very busy place we started at 7:00 am every day we had patient standing outside when we opened up. Some patient had appointment most did not .We had a meeting once a month. So management could tell us all the up dates.Quest could have been a good place to work but my manager all ways want to save money on not replacing people when they called out.So we work short a lot.
bad,This place was awful they work make you do the work load of 3 people which seems to be the things here in florida  also for what your exposed to the pay was terrible
bad,Mobile phlebotomist is the best job a person can have. No boss watching over you. Work at a decent speed. You can go I. Do your job and then go straight home.
bad,"Was not fun over load of work for very little pay. Management was not friendly, expected to work a lot for change. I left after two months, could not do it."
bad,"Quest Diagnostics I must say, has been one of the most difficult and negative companies I've ever worked for. Multiple, additional responsibilities were placed on each phlebotomy technician on a regular basis, but no monetary compensation was ever awarded for it. "
bad,"Worst morale of any company I have ever worked. People are so disgruntled and unhappy it is so demoralizing. Unbelievable that management is unaware. I would not recommend working here if you like a happy, positive place to work."
bad,"Where do I begin? Hateful coworkers, lots of backstabbing and underhanded behavior..lots of writeups for minutiae and favoritism, discrimination against me personally. I got sub par training and now I'm on the verge of being fired. Oh well is what I say. It's been an experience....not all bad ones tho. I've met a lot of nice patients and I go out of my way to be kind and accomodating but it means nothing to my superiors."
bad,"I have never posted a bad review on any employers that I have worked for before, but this one was different. At this company you are considered a number and not a person. Some parts of the policy were very unfair to the employees.  Management was not all bad, but some of them were very inconsiderate and obnoxious to say the least. Compensation could have been better, but benefits were good. I am very glad that I have been relieved from this company. It was very difficult to be effective in this position because of the criteria and expectations. We had to sit for hours trying to process the interviews to a suggested perfection expected not to mention how long some of the interviews were. This was not always easy to do because applicants are most sensitive to answering a lot of medical history questions.  No matter how hard you try it was not good enough. This position caused quite a bit of stress .The Company had a high turn-over rate. I would not refer anyone to work here. That is because I do care about people in general."
bad,"Not a good place to work if you have a family, time is too demanding and work environment is very uncomfortable! Would not recommend this job to anyone over the age 21!!!"
bad,The job requires a lot of knowledge and work without compensation to match. The mandatory overtime never ends and the company really does not care about their employees. You will have no balance between your work life and home life. The attendance policies are ridiculous. I would not recommend this job.
bad,"I Would Say i had fun and learned a lot at every company i worked for ,meaning I never had a sales expirience and and i have now including Ms Word and Power Point i learned how to treat people and i can work under pressure .The management was good in each and every company i worked for i am glad that i gained expirience"
bad,"Production standards are ridiculous. Expected to process 8 buckets containing 70 requisitions per night (7.5 hr. shift) with little to no errors. Stations are not ergonomically set up as they claim to be so be prepared for back, shoulder, and neck pain. They don't ask if you want to stay for overtime they just drop off more work at the end of your shift and expect you to complete it. No sick leave and doctors notes will not excuse any absences."
bad,"Disorganized employer. The supervisors are fine, but the upper level management is clueless, overbearing, and non-supportive. I would not recommend this employer at any level."
bad,"This place is a sweatshop. There are some very nice, very overworked techs in this lab, but they are undervalued by the current management. A couple of younger techs who think they know more than they do have the ear of the manager and the senior techs are not valued. The instrumentation is particularly poor in the chemistry department. Apparently, the manager did not even look at any other instruments and bought a huge Roche instrument modular system that is a monster. The techs waste hours on hands on maintenance! The manager is a micromanager who hasn't spent time on the bench for over 20 years, but likes to act like she knows what the techs are dealing with. She is out of touch and does not like to be questioned about her decisions. I am thankful for having made the decision to leave before I wasted too much of my life trying to help make this place better. It was a chaotic, punitive, depressive, and oppressive place! stay away!"
bad,Having worked in the medical/pharmaceutical field before found them  to pay well but very unprofessional. More about the production and how much you can produce.
bad,"Management in Lenexa is terrible.  The medical billing in particular.  The supervisor does so many illegal things, I can't even count.  From giving bad yearly reviews to flat out lying, sabotaging your career, back stabbing and unprofessionalism. Department head keeps her on and in her position, no matter how bad she treats people.  I caught her sleeping at her desk, in her cubicle.  She discusses personal matters about her crew to her friends in the company and feels that this is okay.  I don't understand how a person like that can continue to supervise people when she continually receives bad reviews from the ones who work for her."
bad,"Before shift employees walk in to sit at their desks,they are given orders to get to work right away, without a kind hello or good morning from mangement. I learned that Doctors,Nurses and Patients prefer quality of work to a rush job. Management does not appear to be happy. Co-workers appeared and sounded disgruntled on a daily basis from various departments. That alone made for a very unsavory work environment. The hardest part of the job was being treated like a machine by management. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with Physicians, Nurses, and Patients. Also,getting satisfaction knowing that I gave clear, and complete patient information and getting feedback directly from them over the phone. I did enjoy that part of the job very much. But I wish that the general work environment was more employee friendly. I also worked at the Philadelphia business campus as well as the Baltimore business campus and the overall employee morale was the same."
bad,"there was alot of brown nosing by employees and management showed alot of favoritism. I had a supervisor lie to me about getting a raise and making me believe it for 6 months then finding out hr never approved of her and my managers proposal. In fact people that made too much in my department kept their pay which two other supervisors stressed to me that was not right for them to be there. Also certain people could work poorly and get away with it because she was a good brown noser. Alot of flirting with married supervisors from other employees that was very noticeable especially when this young immature 19 yr old would brag about what they were doing behind this so called happily married supervisors wifes back. emailing, texting and him telling her about personal information about everyone in his department. If we are to respect supervisors they make it very difficult especially seeing this kind of behavior. DO NOT WORK THERE IT WAS FRUSTRATING THE LAST 5 YEARS OUT OF 13 THAT I WAS THERE. Clinical processing was like a circus very poor management and working alot of overtime because of stupid meeings that took away from our processing time. It was ridiculous to especially have fortune 500 say ""Quest is one of the best places to work"". This is making fortune 500 look pretty bad they obvious dont get the inside story on this place. My friend who was pregnant was going to get fired because it was so hot in the department she thought she was going to pass out because the air conditioning was broke. They said if you leave you will be fired. How considerate they are. She left because"
bad,"I truly enjoyed my coworkers and learned new things from them in a new field.  Management is very undecisive and will create a 'click' atmosphere, they have unrealistic expectations and refuses to push back on request to set accurate in order for teams to succeed."
bad,"Management plays favorites, you can not trust anyone their they are quick to talk about you I though this was a place to work and a good company which I could eventually grow with but again management plays favorites and it's like middle school with all the drama and gossip ridiculous"
bad,"not much to say not a good company to work for, this company is more aboput who you know not what you know management HR really sucks, co-workers friendly the hardest part of the job is that people are never treated equally.The only enjoyment of this job I think would only be pay day"
bad,"verbal and sometimes threatened physical abuse from clients to staff  with no accountability "
bad,"co-workers patients, superviors, its a great placee to work for."
bad,"Awful place to work. The work was moderate to easy after you learned the medical terminology and how to maneuver their system. Supervisors are uneducated people with mere high school educations that have worked up to management rolls and think they know it all. Unprofessional in dress and conversation. Cannot find a manager when needed, either outside smoking or who knows where they are while you have a client ""on the phone"" and need an immediate answer."
bad,Management with a Scrooge mentality where numbers and profit are more important than quality.
bad,"I worked at Quest in Pittsburgh, Pa., for 10 years in the Specimen Processing Department. The benefits are pretty good. You have mandatory overtime. So you might be there 12-13 hours a day. It is very clicky, people act like they are in elementary school, (grown adults mind you), if your management's pet you get promoted and cooed over. The supervisor's in Pittsburgh's Specimen Processing department are a joke. They do not have people skills; and do not know how to make educated decisions. They need trained on how to be good supervisors. People that are bullies, are allowed to carry on and intimidate other's, management think's that these people walk on water, again because they brown nose management. I am so happy that I do not work there anymore. I had to start taking anti-depressents, pills for anxiety and sleeping pills; because of the horrific hours and terrible co-workers. You will be doing yourself a favor, if you look to work elsewhere. It has an extremely high turn over rate. Training is very poor, you have to learn tons of vital test codes in four to six weeks. Processing has a points system, if your very fast at your job and inaccurate, your job is safe. But if you are slower and have a higher accuracy rate, you will be penalized and you will be terminated."
bad,Great lab services. Sales department is a mess. Silo of departments leads to overlaps of efforts and major gaps in operational efficiencies.
bad,"Great place to work for in the beginning. Last year, apparently in our region, cuts, cuts,cuts! Not enough staff to cover sites without massive wait times in excess of 45+ minutes. Like working in a sweat shop. Only care about the numbers/revenue. Cut supplies, and hard to get days approved off. Staff cuts in all areas. No longer patient focused-quality of care declining and staff unengaged.Extremely stressful environment makes for unhappy employees, which is sure to be noticed by Patients."
bad,Not a good place to work mangers was not good don’t know how to manment anybody and that’s soo sad I wouldn’t recommend any one to work there the team leaders never comb her hair
bad,I worked for the company for a year and was miserable. Understaffed and over worked. They give praise to staff that don’t do anything and the ones who work hard are treated poorly. They do not care about their employees.
bad,Focused on realistic goals. Factory setting. No progress is enough for corporate. Benefits and personnel have been reduced. At one time it was enjoyable. Now its unfair.
bad,There is too much favoritism and managers are all friends from before working together as managers so they won’t stick up for the employee but will favor all For other managers family members working at Dermpath diagnostics
bad,"To much micro/management all your driving is monitored every minute of the day as well 400+miles a day plus 10 HR PLUS+ days."
bad,This job is highly complex and can be tedious and stressful at times. A very competitive overnight production job fueled by workers competing to be the top processor just to receive at best a .35 annual raise. I have been with this company for a little over a year and quite honestly this has been one of the most miserable jobs of my life. The atmosphere is quite toxic and the people who work here are cold and eerie.
bad,"Benefits are not what market offers, pay is less than market too. Don't recommend working here. Insurance is expensive. Goals are unrealistic. Some managers are micro managers and some don't work much at all. Work loads are unrealistic, they did lay offs and added more accounts. Not enough people to manage all the accounts given, clients are constantly yelling at you because it's impossible to manage all the accounts, never enough time in a day to return the 30 calls and 30-50 emails."
bad,"A typical day at work is working from 6-3  and may do up to 45 patients a day and its really fast paced.Management could be very tricky, very hostile workplace depends who you work with."
bad,I applied for a full-time permanent position and at orientation told it was a temp position.  I've been working there 11 months and still not hired.  They change protocol and operations every day.  There is no stability and the work environment is a hazard not because of the chemicals or bodily fluids but the equipment placement and crowding.  They leave temps without leadership onsaholidays
bad,"I learned a lot from this job. I enjoy lab work and gained the experience necessary to move on, but the other staff and managers did not make for a good work environment."
bad,"Always under staffed, moody front desk, staff looks miserable,  inconsistent methods. Not a lot of growth potential. Quest always hiring because can't hold on to staff. Can sense tension in the workgroup."
bad,"All they care about is wait time. High employee turnover. They wont hire more staff they want you to rush but be error free.  All management does is send emails and complain.  Their expectations with the wait time are not realistic, appt less then 5min walk in's less then 10min.  Not every patient is a easy draw or Sometimes you have to call and clarify a order so it takes longer.... all the phlebotomists are stressed but they don't speak up....Quest should also be ashamed of themselves for giving staff a 35cent yearly increase with all the money we collect for them.....I cant wait to find another job.....i hate it here"
bad,nothing to say about this company good or bad I am indifferent on the subject.  If you like no overtime and working most weekend then this is the job for you!
bad,"Lab supervisor believes of doing things her way even if it is unethical. She has a ""click"" of people that can get away with doing illegal things and will back them up if caught."
bad,"If you get a nice supervisor and understandable  supervisor your life will be okay with drama. have a lot of loud unprofessional workers from management down to co-workers. only been here for a year and half,already I am ready to run very fast from client services"
bad,"I was excited to work for this massive company until the second month in. The management kept changing my hours, the training was not organized what so ever, and the lack of management professional skills. I have never seen a poorly built company in my life and they are nation wide. I fear for patients specimens and the way they are handled."
bad,"From the outside, Quest looks like a great place to work since they are always talking about being so innovated. They are far beyond innovated and still use software from the 70-80’s. Very competitive place to work and you will learn to stay away from the lab director because she has no manners and loves to keep secrets while all employees are left in the dark."
bad,"Operational staff and upper management create and endorse a manipulative work environment that allows targeting and harassment of their employees based on position or promotions taken. They expect employees to care about quality of work and dedication but do not invest anything back into their employees. "
bad,"Terrible management. One manager who is never in the office, covers two states."
bad,"I loved my job and my patients ,I learned a lot from other co workers , met a lot of wonderful people through out the years co-workers and patients.as for management they have a lot to work on themselves, very rude and careless , unprofessional.....upper management just covers ups lower management that's why no one is on the same page ever ….benefits are great though"
bad,I did not enjoy my work experience here at all. Its poor management and no one got a long. The hardest art of the job was that it wasnt a comfortable environment and there was a lot of tension
bad,"They don't advance you unless your a man.  Management is awful,  unless your one of their favorites.  3rd shift supervisors are the worst.  Never  positive, only focus on negative.   I would never recommend Quest to anyone."
bad,"I was employed for many years with this company. While it started out as a really good company that appreciated it's employees, I've watched it deteriate to a typical corporate company. Greed at the top of the chain has over ruled everything including PATIENT CARE. I took a voluntary severance and will never have anything to do with this company again."
bad,Stressful work environment. You are expected to work long hours and are not adequately rewarded for the amount of expected work. Management did not take care of employees and took credit for work.
bad,"Flexible with hours usually"
bad,The management will not listen to both sides and want to keep lowest paid ppl not enough hands on training all computer and no one to help with those not helpful at all
bad,"very  bad  place to work, a lot of favoritism, crazy place I  do not "
bad,"Always understaffed, would work 12 hour a day then on the last day of the week would send you home early so you didnt get OT pay, no sick pay, not a very healthy envirnment to work in"
bad,Alot of health codes broken here. Unsafe alot of times. Would not allow days off due to emergencies without days off. Was sick with time off for sick days but was still written up.
bad,I really liked working putting the tables and chairs up and braking it down. The manager worked really hard and kept us up dated on what  needed to be done. .
bad,"all i can say is that there's not management around , if they dont like you somehow, they make sure to make your life miserable so that way you can quit, most people there cover themselves and they lie so just be aware of that if you trying to apply.  thnks"
bad,"I have been with Quest Diagnostics for almost 4 years and it has been a downward spiral. Management and the company only care about numbers. Nothing is uniform. It is hard to get questions answered and the job is tedious, but somewhat easy. The pay is on the lower end of being decent and the insurance is HORRIBLE. Co workers are unprofessional but some are friendly. The only thing enjoyable about this job is hearing the satisfaction in a doctor or patient's voice."
bad,Quest has very unprofessional management in the billing department in Tampa. I have never seen a place with so many internal issues in my life. The job pays good but it is not something that I would be interested in doing for more than a year or two
bad,If your not left wing or speak your mind. They fabricate evidence to fire you. SOP.Anyone can coplain and the PC police hump all over it. No due process.
bad,"Constantly felt hassled, thrown into work without full training.  Pay was good but the stress is not worth it.  Enjoyed working with the patients the most."
bad,"this company sucks! manager HR. I have nothing positive to say about this company."
bad,"The work is tedious and repetitive. Training is non-existant so you don't get to learn anything new and try other positions. Lots of office politics. No career guidance.  The leadership has a fear of confontation when it comes to correcting employees. "
bad,"Typically, employees are underpaid for the work and conditions required of them, management only comes around every couple weeks, are slow to respond to issues, if they respond at all. The only good point is the patient interaction, and helping people. I love working with people and this definitely provided that for me. However, the conditions and supervisor were not worth staying for."
bad,"Sit at your desk, do your work, don't talk, stay for overtime if mandatory."
bad,"I love doing what I do everyday making a differance in someones life, but company does not care poor managment,no breaks under staffed,no coverage for time off,and if need time off supervisor makes it difficult,supervisor who cant preform the duties required,retaliation for going above supervisor who refused to help with situation,very sad because patients deserve much better care,always a cover up,no accountability,they would rather replace you than do the right thing,not a good place to work,no open door policy,dont stand up to what say they are,will take advantage of you ,very sad ,should be investigated by someone,"
bad,So much drama! Takes forever to get anything resolved I switched managers because my old manager basically was never there and I had to figure things on my own people try and get on the good side of the manager so if they get in trouble they don’t do much about it there’s people who I question why they are there in the first place certain coworkers are unprofessional out to get each other
bad,"They will start as them acting as they like you, then slowly make you feel like your less of a person, they will look at you in disgust and then not include you with group activities. They will talk to you like they would rather be doing something else, make you do their work and not care about how you feel."
bad,"Don't pay mileage, it's for someone who has money in the bank as you need to pay for your own gas. Office staff is not helpful, they have no idea how to schedule."
bad,"A typical day includes repetitive tasks and going out of your job duties to get your work done. I learned many things involving laboratory practices. However, they stop teaching you more so that they can keep some knowledge for themselves. The management is not good at all, from allowing derrogative comments in the workplace to being lazy and making others do their work. As a result the workplace culture is a toxic one. The hardest part of the job is the people. The most enjoyable part of the job is the job tasks itself if you didn't had to go out of yours to get stuff done. It doesn't help that the pay is too low for the amount of work that you have to do."
bad,"Management is terrible, very prejudice management team. Very inconsiderate with family and life. Stressful unprofessional environment. Worst job I've ever had"
bad,Quest Diagnostics promotes a hostile work environment through use a competition.  Very few employees are happy working at Quest but the pay and benefits are so good that people try to put up with it.  Over 80% of new employees quit or get fired in their first year and that is not an exaggeration.
bad,"I hear they are now unionized!!"
bad,"I think this place is a horrible place to work. The manager first off comes off racist and they go through employees like crazy. Quest Diagnostics is a great company as far as the benefits are concerned. They definitely take care of you but the people who work there are horrible. On some occasions I saw fights and I think one woman was even drinking on the job. They seem to promote based on favoritism and not who is most qualified for the job. People dont leave jobs, they leave managers and this place is a joke. Let the 51st Hunger games begin..."
bad,Not a good environment.  Team Leads run the show. Managers try to cover up what they dont know so leads have free reign. They do all they can not to let a new agent out perform them. Not one meeting w/mgr.
bad,"the pay was $17.50 but they do not accommodate for gas, you basiclly have no they off and they will call you, text you, email you constantly throughout the day, the management is very petty and does not let your mistake goes without announcing it to the whole team. I'm currently working there and looking to get out soon. The money you make from quest go back to fixing your car and paying for gas. It is not worth it,"
bad,"As a new employeeI had a lot of hope for this job.  However, I wasn't aware that they had huge layoffs before I started the job.  After 2 years, most of my department was laid off due to outsourcing.  Managers were difficult to deal with and they all got laid off as well."
bad,Although I will miss quest this co has bad management will stop at nothing to do Wright  ups no  encouragement for growth it’s all  favoritism and who u know . A lot of bullying and belittling goes on by the supervisor to make u feel horrible
bad,I was terminated after I couldn’t make it out of my apartment complex parking lot during a snowstorm. I had to miss a day due to the weather and I hadn’t missed a day before that for 5 1/2 months. They chose to write me up then terminate me 2 weeks later.
bad,The employees should be just as important as the clients as they are the ones whom carry the workload and work the long hours to make the company successful.
bad,A typical work day once your trained for two days is similar to being stuck and a room and being watched your entire shift. They don’t want you getting up to use the bathroom or going for walks if needed. They much rather not transfer you out of your department because they really need you. No one speaks English here and our hub is based in America. Management is horrible they only care about themselves.
bad,My manager sucks. The people that did the work never got notice. she only had her favorite and they did nothing. I always got great comments from customers but it didn't matter. The manger had other people due her work for her. She did do anything...
bad,As employee quest diagnostics I just fell as a company quest diagnostics can do better as a company and with there leadership staff . There a lot of things that go on that is not professional. management is never around and if around not friendly would know who you management team was unless you seen them in a town hall meeting
bad,discussed with company. Having one person handling 3 clinics. Informed manager about needing another person and would only have someone come for short time.
bad,My co-workers most was great. Management are horrible have their favorites. Not an even playing field. They run it like a sweat shop. No loyalty anywhere especially from management. They tear you done in front of your team and behind your backs. They give jobs based on family and friends who need one.
bad,"By far the worst job experience ever. Toxic unprofessional work environment. Management engaging in creating toxic culture. High turnover. Can not keep new techs. Anyone with talent or options leaves. ""Old"" techs complacent lazy and sloppy. Techs with seniority more concerned with drama and creating a junior high environment; no interest in creating an environment to retain quality people. Management at odds with each other. SOP's outdated by years. Lousy equipment.  Work flow issues that should have been identified and resolved long ago. Zero training. Complete lack of compassionate care in the work environment. This lab will most like be closed down soon. STAY AWAY!"
bad,too much micro-management and office politics. you are unable to speak to clients without using a script process .Too many problems out of your control
bad,Not worth it to work for them . . . They doubt the honesty of their own employees at any given point . . . WIll drop any employee at the drop of a hat
bad,"Very disappointed in quest...when my life got threatened and I had to move, they were very rude and not concerned at all...."
bad,"Management was okay, but training lacked and they don't provide any kind of equipment for you.  You have to be perfect in all ways, not just okay or good job but perfect.  You are watched 100% of the time to see if you are working or on a call or fixing a call, but you are monitored constantly and called on it when you or they think  you are not working.  The job itself is boring"
bad,MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE EMPLOYEES. no real benefit
bad,This organization has a bad culture and poor diversity within the organization . It is the good ole boy's club and does not appreciate or respect innovation and growth.
bad,"This division of Quest was eliminated and thus, I lost my job. Over the past year Quest has eliminated many divisions, entire internal organizations and management positions due to poor performance and financial duress."
bad,"They dont care about their employees. Over turn rate is very high, I would never recommend this place of employment (lee's summit, call center) TO ANYONE. i WOULD GIVE THEM A ZERO RATING IF THIS THING WOULD LET ME."
bad,"I would love to work for Quest Diagnostics again, however, it would have to be in a different state."
bad,"This place is truly a sweat shop, Some departments don't allow breaks Refuse to hire additional personnel even when the workload is obviously at an all time high. They have many programs in place claiming to be in support of work-life balance but all you can do each day is go home and fall into bed in preparation for the next day. So tired from running around at break neck speed all day the mind is boggled and the body is worn! If you dont believe me sit outside and watch as half the staff limps in on crutches, in orthopedic boots or shoes. The raises this year were less than 1.5%. Hard to complain in this economy but giving a person 20 or 30 cents? Morale is very low and either they don't care or refuse to address."
bad,"Highly automated, ""stat"" lab where you don't get compensated well, the management is mediocre, at best. If you enjoy boring, mundane work in an understaffed lab, this place is for you."
bad,"terrible pay, dragged out hours, the benefits are good management is all right The people you work with are friendly and nice but you cannot financially survive unless you're high up in management. They give you equipment that is about three or four decades behind if something happens most of the time they don't care. Causes a lot of body problems after long-term. lower back problems, knee and angle problems, regardless of your age how much your exercise or how good you take care of yourself. I have been there for a year and I'm about to leave. Completely unhappy and unless you are somebody who wants to spend the next 30 years driving a company vehicle all around, this field and job career path is not for you. Would not recommend it to anybody unless that's what you want to do for a living. Several drivers have had their backs thrown out there's knees blown out are in very poor health and have worked there between 20 to 30 years because they are comfortable making $15 an hour after being there for two or three decades and yet still complain about it and management does absolutely nothing to honor the people and the good hard workers who have put in many years of service."
bad,"This company has way to many layers., when someone has to schedule my breaks and lunch for me because they feel we as workers cannot do on our own is wY to much micro managing. Also, to be a healthcare company and not allow nor provide headsets?"
bad,I loved my job and patients. Never made anyone feel as if didn't know my job. My patients were my FIRST priority!! Would love to continue working as a phlebotomist.
bad,"the entire call center watched numerous people being fired on a daily basis right in the open, the secretary would pack someone's desk and talk to people about the person being fired. The job was a very easy job to do if your into telemarketing, but very scary considering you could lose your job at any moment if you didn't agree with the supervisors or the very egotistical boss"
bad,"Poor management.  "
bad,"Bureaucracy at its worst. Very few people are doing the work and those.people do most of the work. "
bad,I worked under contract. Never missed a day nor called off not late. Everything was going fine. Loved my job. Next day I called of not feeling well few hours later got a phone call from my agency my contract had been ended. I have no idea why. I guess I asked to many questions. But never worried about getting an answer cause management all took there breaks together.. so no one was ever there to answer not even the big boss lady in the office she was out smoking too
bad,Forget about your weekends or spending time with your family. The least organized company I have ever worked for. Your are treated like a child and never a professional. Your opinion counts for nothing. Your schedule will change from year to year or month to month.
bad,Management does not care about you at this location. High turn over rate. Mean co workers. Extremely negative work environment. Micromanagement especially on evening shift. Stressful work environment. Not understand on time off or hours. Shift lead on second is rude and a know it all. Do not work here.
bad,"It seems like the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. When I was emailed that I passed the background/ drug screen, three different people emailed me separately, and misspelled my name.   I was told several incorrect things when offered an interview/ the job.  For example, I was told that we got Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, NYE, and NY Day off when I got the call offering me the job, on my first day I found out that this was not correct and in fact I would be working all of those days. They never told me who my direct supervisor was. The training videos spent 3 hours on the goal of the company and  mere 30 minutes on HIPPA and Compliance. (for anyone that doesn't know, if you don't follow HIPPA/ aren't compliant you could end up in jail or fined and it doesn't matter if you weren't trained properly).  The coworkers I spoke to on my first day were really negative about the job and expressed their disdain for it. And probably the biggest con, I HAVE BEEN WAITING 2 MONTHS FOR MY FINAL CHECK. So if you quit quest they won't pay you."
bad,"fast paced and very stressful, under paid for hard work,unprofessional supervisors. there's no equality of work flow. supervisors have favorites and treat hard workers poorly"
bad,"I loved working for Quest Diagnostics because of the benefits the pay and the shift that I had, but management in the processing dept. was very unprofessional and didn't care for the employees.. as well as they had a lot of favoratism towards staff.. when i got injured at work and went on Workers Comp they send me a letter terminating me."
bad,"I formerly worked at the Quest Diagnostics business  unit in Twinsburg, Ohio and the difference between the Ohio business unit and the business unit in Florida is enormous.  The business unit here in Florida leave much to be desire when it comes to how management treats its employees.  Here in Florida, the management is after one thing....numbers.  There is preferential treatment, harassment of all type, and lack of communication from management to employees."
bad,"Huge politics in the offices, not a lot of teamwork. There was a huge gap between the Data entry and the Phlebotomists, even though we did just as much, if not more, work. Management was detached, but they did try."
bad,"I was there for more than a year. It should be ok until the company set up that they called QOM, they wanted to squeeze employee, cut off over time, cut off people  and maximize their profit. Also Hematology Dept in Houston is very bad with horrible supervisor, that supervisor wants employee to do everything but in fact she cant finish by herself. Company is a good step to learn, but there is not a place to stay."
bad,"I was hired in through a temp agency into specimen processing."
bad,"Billing call center focused solely on metrics, did not care about the customers or resolving issues at all. Super stressful for anyone with a good work ethic as nothing could ever get done. Bathroom breaks were timed and employees required to be on the phones for entire duration of being on the clock, with no chance to complete followup work."
bad,"The department motto is ""We're There.""  And we are there all the time.  Mornings, evenings, weekends, overnight, overtime, on our days off..."
bad,"Sitting down 8 hours daily, uncomfortable chairs, back pain and stress from work caused chest pains. Learned to never fully trust management or HR. They represent and protect the company not you. And could care less about anything going on in your personal life. Management very rude and allowed supervisors to be rude as well. Co-workers are lovely and giddy. Makes working there worth while. Hardest part of the job was putting up with ignorant, fake managers"
bad,"Most of my co-workers were pleasant enough to work with but the morale of the entire staff was at a very LOW due to very poor management from the supervisor and the lead techs. There was favoritism, and gossip and backstabbing."
bad,"Very Poor raises, poor bonuses if we are lucky while upper mgmt  make substantial amount no matter what ,for us pennies a year, Poor mgmt, Poor attitude The Drivers are treated like kids its ridiculous.The only good thing about this company are the uniforms and the fleet thats it! If you make over time you are forced to shave it off or be penalized."
bad,Was a temp there for allmost a year when interviewed for full time they wanted me to take a pay cut dose not matter how good of a worker you are there bottom dollar is more important I feel sorry for the pts who will suffer because of poor management
bad,"Work was easy, very repetitive and boring. The different supervisors were pretty nice but the manager of the whole department was very racist against the white people and was always obvious in her favoritism and everyone knew it.  I heard that she has since been fired so hopefully it's a better place now but it definitely was not at that time!"
bad,"Got turned down for management twice with 25yrs of service! Working in Chicago and Knoxville Tennessee, and I think I deserve a chance to put my experience with the company."
bad,"This company has not always been ran this poor but management changed and friendship with HR started this road to destruction. They should be called the mean girl club because they both are bullies. The specimen processing manager got her whole family a job, children, son in law, daughters friends. It would be okay but they were given jobs over people was with more years and experience . The HR we have over the phone is worthless and always side with evil. Not sure why New Jersey have not came down and question some things. How do a company not see a turnover rate of a department that includes supervisors leaving. It was do as I say not as I do. They break all kinda of laws        "
bad,Was lied to about duties and was told things were gonna change but never did... it has great benefits not enough pay for the multiple stops to you do..the supervisor is lazy
bad,"I worked at Quest for almost two years.  HORRIBLE JOB.  You literally draw and draw and draw and draw ALL DAY LONG with only an hour break!!!!    It’s not enough because you are under high stress because of the EXTREMELY HIGH VOLUME of patients.  The patients take their anger out on you because they have been fasting for 10-12 hrs and have to wait for blood draws sometimes over 3 HRS!!!  Not a safe working environment.  I was threatened daily from angry patients, and I couldn’t blame them.  Quest needs to fix the patient/phlebotomy ratio because 300pts a day between 5-6 phlebotomists  is UNETHICAL !!!  I quit very fast.  You WILL develop health issues because of the stress your body endures daily.  You have to process EVERYTHING which is fine; however, this can keep you past your time to go home...which results in working a 10-12 hr days MON-FRI :/ !!!  Do yourself a favor and run FAR FROM QUEST!!"
bad,"Actual job as Med Tech is OK, very heavy workload and no one will ever offer to help you! Not enough money for the stress level. Also, many folks working here on Eves and nights that don't know anything about anything. Lots of employees I wouldn't want doing my lab work. I have a general feeling Quest loves to hire undereducated employees with no experience and give them more responsibility than they are qualified for, but the plus for this company is that they can pay them $15/hr wheras they must pay MT college educated folks about $27-28/hr. Therefore, it is my job to babysit. Management sucks and plays favorites, it's quite awful, ignoring constant complaints about certain employees because they are butt kissers. This job has been all about who can suck up the hardest, don't worry if you kiss enough butt  you can be anything here, even if you don't have the knowledge or education to do so."
bad,"do not get paid enough to do what you do. drawing, process, billing , registering and dealing with cranky patients. mandatory overtime every other saturday. gave out rocks with ""inspiring words"" on them for christmas. management has no idea what they are doing. one of the worst jobs i've ever had the company does not care about there employees overworked and underpaid they will start you off as low as they can get away with huge turnover rate. co workers are sneaky and waiting to threw you under the bus. do not in any way work around your schedule and you're always short handed"
bad,"Poorest management I have ever seen. Takes DAYS For management to reply to your emails including the main director of the lab, half the staff is not fully trained leaving the rest of the team pulling double if not triple work. This specific location has lost at least 8 employees in a matter of months and its strictly due to them being tired of nothing getting resolved and HR has not stepped in to question why this specific lab stays so understaffed. Management would rather focus on mediocre issues that actually focus on patient care and why their employees keep leaving. I personally would not trust half of the individuals to run labs on my dog. Do yourself a favor and avoid applying."
bad,Coworkers constantly complained about their jobs. Discriminated against based on my age. Was youngest in my department by 6 years.
bad,Staff and supervisors are worked beyond reasonable.  No help from immediate manager when needed.  No contact with upper management.  Very unreasonable expectations by their corporate QA.  Rude and unrealistic.  Not focused on quality.
bad,This company lays off 500+ more employees at least every 2 years. Beware before applying!
bad,"I don't understand how there is even job posted for this job when almost the whole department of the specimen techs have been layed off, it makea no since to me at all."
bad,"Worst job ive ever had. So stressful i now have health issues. Way too much work for small pay. Breaks are super short,poor communication,Overload of  daily emails and information with no chance to even view them. Back to back call, no chance to breathe in between calls. Rude co-workers. Best thing about this place is paid holidays. Turn over rate is horrible."
bad,It's all about who you know and how far you go. The one thing I hate the most is favoritism. Doesnt matter how hard you work or what you have done. The one who is favorite always gets the credit. Benefits are awesome and get 3 weeks off starting out. But I dont see this as a job you can work the rest of your life when you have no chance over someone who the managers play favorites to.
bad,"My typical day at work was opening my own patient service center by myself and having patients check in on the Ipad. Then I word enter there orders and insurance information in the computer,then proceed to draw there blood. Also I would fill out temperature logs out on a daily basis. I Would also accept drop off specimens as well.I order my own supplies,kept up with emails with my boss. I draw blood on pediatric,Adults and geriatric patients."
bad,"Very fast pace"
bad,"If you love to be Micro-Managed, and constantly have someone of ""higher authority"" question your every move, follow you out into the hall to question you as to where you are going, and doesn't believe you when you say your are going to the restroom and will stand there and watch you walk in to and out of the restroom, then Quest Diagnostics is the place for you to work.  No one is friendly with the ""new employees"".  However, everyone is quick to point out your errors, normally they do not provide you with an example of your error so you can correct yourself.  Accuracy is #1 priority which is completely understandable.  But they keep pressuring your to work faster.  One requirement was ""3,000 keystrokes per minute"" once you are hired, that number jumps up to 3,500 keystrokes per minute and if you have not hit 3,500 keystrokes after 2 weeks, you are then ""spoken too"" right in front of other employees that sit next to you, and told that you need to increase your keystrokes by the end of the week WITHOUT increasing your errors, or you will be written up.  One positive thing about Quest Diagnostics is the dress code is extremely casual.  You can wear ball caps, sweat pants, flip flops they don't care"
bad,"In the billing department, the upper management has no concern for most employees, they have their favorites and friends, they were allowed to bully and harass other employees, nothing was done, the managers and team leaders openly talked about other employees and their personal business."
bad,Most days are spent working at computer doing data entry.  I actually learned a great deal because of my determination of asking over and over again to be taught new job positions.  My co-workers were usually late or called in sick most of the time.  Pretty much the hardest part of the day was working short handed all the time and trying to get goals reached.  The most enjoyable part of the job was going home.
bad,I loved working with the patients but managment is a different story
bad,"There is a lot of controversy in this work place. The managers are very unprofesional and immature. They dont follow any of thier own rules, of standards. There are very long work hours/ days, and your given very little break or time off (you have it scheduled but your not allowed to take it). Employees are treated unfairly, and horribly. Working here is like being back in highschool, where people lie, argue, talk about you to the high-managers. EX: A guy was supposed to start working with us, he was a very nice man but the manager of our department and her ""pet"" didnt like how he stood (he was military, so he stood tall with confidence), so they went to the high manager and told her lies about him so that her wouldnt get transfered into our department. And one of the new haven managers is also prejudice against white and spanish people. Shes been heard many times saying that she only wants her office to been filled with black employees!"
bad,Not job training. It's either sink or swim. You only get a 1/2 hr lunch Wich you end up sitting at you desk anyway because cafeteria is to packed or closed
bad,Quest used to be a great company to work for I’ve watched this company go from great to awful they don’t care about employees it’s all about numbers! You will work short daily and be threaten to make sure your numbers are met
bad,They Management will lie on you because they. Dont stick up or have their employees back. Not Trust worthy at all. Tell u one thing if they say it n dnt give it to you in black n white your screwed.
bad,"The benefits were good, the management needs little more help on treating workers like humans and not slaves..The pay could be better for the work we do dealing with blood and needles..."
bad,It's not a rewarding job but it's a job. The hours vary and the work is repetitious. They normally hire through a temporary agency and the positions are temp to perm.
bad,The patients and some of the employees were great. corporate was not understanding about life in the lab. No one cared if you were hurt or sick.as long as the numbers were meet.
bad,"Don't work at quest diagnostics unless you do not want your full hours, they hire a lot of temps so if they don't like you they can get rid of you fast"
bad,"Management was no good, co workers were jealous of others work and caused a lot friction. Pays really good but they will work TO THE BONE! I worked over 90 hours in 2 weeks and then I got into trouble for having too much overtime. I was a Floater and management solely cares about Patient flow - (In and Out) as fast as possible. No care or regard to the Patients care (Pre and Post analytical)"
bad,"A typical work day includes making phone calls to potential insurance consumers to collect their medical history for the underwriting department. Guidance on certain policies is subject to change mid-day without advance notice so you have to be very attentive. The culture is a bit immature, so it's best to focus on work and nothing more. I learned so much about medical terminology during my time there and how it's categorized by disorders/diseases. The management at the time was a little divided on a consistent way to manage employees and it was obvious that communication was affected because of it."
bad,"Worked with one other person, in a busy office. Learned to order and receive supplies. Did data entry and made sure patients were satisfied with the care and promtness they were receiving."
bad,"no growth"
bad,"Please don't waste your time working in the Wilmington, NC area for this management team.. they will treat you like dirt and leave you to fend for yourself."
bad,Worked at the call center that bought out MedXM. The job was actually not bad at all. It has great potential. The new management is what brought the place down. They looked for reasons to fire employees who excelled on purpose to get rid of those they didn't like (even supervisors).  I would've stayed much longer if there wasn't so much discrimination.
bad,"Very poor management, it was stressful and they always picked their favorites. I would not refer anyone to work there. I did not have a good experience working for this company."
bad,"I loved the job itself and learning new things. The culture and office environment made it very difficult to do my job. If you were not a friend, relative or favorite of management, you  were basically ignored. I discovered that a daughter of a mgr did work from home and came and went as she pleased. The constant talking and whispering about the job and other employees was out of control. Even the mgr had to shut her door because the talking/outbursts were non stop. Think twice before accepting a position here."
bad,"This company comes across as unethical, illegal, and abusive of employees.  Most people there seemed rather unhappy to be there.  I would stay far away from this place. "
bad,"I worked at MEDXM/Quest for a year and a half,I had the worst experience of my life. The leads are really rude and always have an attitude,supervisors love to play favorites and can never help you with anything. Management is a joke,drama EVERYWHERE. I would get live checks with my updated address on each every check,but once quest came into play,the company never told me that there was gonna be a delay in our checks,I went two weeks without pay because apparently quest sent my check TO THE WRONG ADDRESS,even though I updated my address with them and everything,It took forever to get ahold of Quest payroll and I fought so hard just to get my  check. Just an awful negative place,I would cry almost every day coming back from work. The one good things about this job was maybe 4 people out of hundreds who really cared for me but that’s it. Other than that,they make you work mandatory OT even on the weekends (including holidays) and the hire ups could care less about how you’re doing as person,I was told my feeling were wrong when I was leaving. I didn’t even bother to show up on my last week,I packed up my stuff and bounced as fast as I could. Just terrible. If you love yourself and care about your mental well being please don’t work here...."
bad,Horrible company to work for. Daily mental anguish and very stressful. Management is pathetic and horrible. Company does not care about you or your well being.
bad,"learned a lot medical terminology,typical day work answer inbound out bound calls some days are more stressful then most days,workplace a lot favoratism work place unprofessional the job isn't hard,enjoyable meet few nice people"
bad,"Quest was a short term job, overall is was a good company to work for.  They stress quality customer service, their training was extensive to insure you could do your job effectively."
bad,"Took over 100 phone calls a day reading medical results to doctors & nurses which I knew nothing about, with no training. Was very negative atmosphere."
bad,"this was a great company to work for I learned a lot of new information that I took to another job, great benefit package great temp agency to work for , I really hate my assignment ended with this company I saw myself advancing within company, but assignment wasn't long enough. I think if the assignments were long enough I could have went permanent, overall this is a good company to work for they just need longer assignment"
bad,"buena empresa, con oportunidades de crecimiento y apremdizaje"
bad,"Always a moment to enhance a patients or staffs life. Each day a new challenge, ability to learn something new, and teach a new student."
bad,Work had to be done within a time limit so that the patients/doctor's offices could get results within a 24 hour turn around. Need to be a little more relaxed atmosphere.
bad,I have done phlebotomy at other places before and have enjoyed it. Due to moving I found a job with Quest Diagnostics. I have never been so disappointed in a company as I am with them.
bad,A typical day is busy day
bad,Quest Denver lab worse place I ever worked depressed
bad,I hated the job. The company was very difficult to work for. higher managment was very poorly ran.
bad,"Miscomunication, lack of training, all day sitting, and computer typing"
bad,"Working at Quest Diagnostics was a great experience for me as far as learning about the healthcare system. Learned about skin biopsy, papsmears. Manager & co-workers was great learning experience to work with. There wasn't any hard part about the job. The most enjoyable was when it came time for my review & when you know you have done a good job performing your duties & managers to notice in your performance."
bad,I was told when I was hired I would be doing one thing but ended up doing something else.  They completely lied to me on my job function.  There was no opportunity for advancement.
bad,"performing daily health histories, setting and breaking down blood drives, setting up the canteen area, numerous of draws"
bad,"Quest is a place where you have to be perfect to work at one mistake is your getting writen up, i would never work for quest again to much favoritism"
bad,Great Job the people there made it so difficult for me. The job was a pleasure to do. Unfortunately I was working with people that was in a click. I wasn't able to learn like I wanted too. Supervisor lived out of state so he couldn't understand what was really going on. I felt like the supervisor was not looking at what I was trying to say.
bad,"Management makes the job bad. Favoritism is important there! Morale is really bad. The company makes a lot of money, but is cheap with the employees.  Money is the prime objective there. No opportunity to grow."
bad,"Poor management and no advancement.  Little or low pay, cannot attract CLSs from USA they rely on CLSs from Philippines.  Only one CLS left who is US citizen."
bad,"Quest diagnostics only care for the client and the patient they dont take the time to take care of the employees specially the front end which are the Phlebotomist at psc, all psc are over work the amount of patient's is unbalanced with the amount of employees per psc(patient service center)."
bad,The old Quest was a great company to work for. They did restructuring and it became more about the financial figures than the wellness of the employees and patients. Management became harsh and insensitive. There was no work/life balance and job security became unstable. There is no room for advancement here and no regard for employees safety.
bad,"Horrible,,,, if you cross a supervisor the wrong way they will make your life miserable until you quit or if you are a strong individual with a strong work ethic they will find a way to fire you. Favoritism is a day to day struggle."
bad,"Horrible place to work. No advancement whatsoever! If co-worker was the favorite, other workers were doomed! Management offered up lie after lie after lie!! Would not hire help if needed. Only 1 person off per vacation or any day off."
bad,The company is cheap. Wants you to work overtime but reduces it somehow will even still hours If necessary. They don't care about your personal life. You are required to be at work on your death bed. Worse experience of my life.
bad,"Quest is a terrible company to work for, they expect you to do all the work, registration, blood draw and processing. Then they tell you that you made a mistake. They don't give enough hours, sometimes I only worked three hours for the day. They make you travel to different locations. Management bases your performance on how much co pays you collect.one co worker told me the wrong code for a test on purpose. Would not recommend this company unless you are desperate for a job."
bad,Typical corporate culture- everyone is out for #1 at the expense of patients and clients.  The all mighty dollar and pointless metrics rule decision making.  They do not value employees; it's all about taking care of their own with platinum parachutes.
bad,"Quest Diagnostics, as a company focuses more so on the overtime rather than the patients themselves. Sadly, my employees are unable to get anytype of overtime, leaving it very difficult to get our patients in and out in a timely maner. As a Lead, I try to focus on the well being of not only my pateints but my employees as well. Quest Diagnostics is more so focused on money."
bad,"Take a look at the whole picture before accepting emplyment here. My typical day was repetitive calling out everyday to the same clients and hearing about other employees business because a supervisor sat across from me. Very messy, I over heard a inappropriate conversation between her and the director and was terminated two weeks later because I said something to them."
bad,"Disorganized, many mistakes and osha non compliant. Management will not listen to any complaints or any feedback to better the company."
bad,"working at Quest is a nightmare. The pompousity of the commercial translates in poor salary, ok but expansive benefits, culture value is low , treatment is indicent, management is terrible. Definitely not the best company to work for."
bad,"Pros- "
bad,This is not a typical sales job.  Lots of following up at the end of the workday.  Great place to learn about a lot of disease states.  Lots of resources to follow up for clients.  Clients have stated that Quest is hard to work with.  There are a lot of moving parts and hard to complete simple tasks.  Culture depends on region.  Each region acts as its own company.  Not standardize across the country.
bad,Management micromanage. They cut back on everything. Not compensated for hard work. Pay is ok but not for all the overtime you put in and it’s taken back by giving you days off . No room for advancement. Will not recommend
bad,"You get paid $14 an hour to do 3 people's jobs. You are over worked, over stressed and low pay. No growth nothing. They took away water/coffee cups from the break room, cut benefits and time off accrued. This is a very cheap company."
bad,"Dont have to much to say, i worked and got paid. Just a steping stone. The pay is kinda low, for the work. Lab corp pays around $8 more with better labs"
bad,I worked in great Dr Office with quest. It was a fast paced offices and great locations. The staff in the  offices was great all the nurses and the Dr helped as needed and was very nice.
bad,Employees are not allowed to speak to each other unless work related. Management demands all processors exceed the minimum amount of work required nightly.
bad,"Training was great at Quest.  The calls are not bad, but they hired a manager who thought every call should be done in 2 minutes or less.  They needed way more organization.  The trained managers were awesome, new manager was rude, and validates possible lawsuit.  He would not let me off to get medicine, critical for me to live.  They posted sings, not as informed as all my previous employers.  Dealing with panicked clients.  Client thanking you for receiving outcomes of test results."
bad,"people were rude, gossiped, and caused unnecessary issues for little to no reason, my boss didn’t feel the need to address issues as we were all adults and could “ ignore it” saying “ they only do it to get a rise out of you” bad management skills ."
bad,"Management was very poor, they'd blame mistakes and blame an individual for a ""Critical"" error when you followed their directions.  I was blamed for such an error and when another Supervisor stepped in and proved that I did as instructed putting the blame back on said Supervisor and Manager, no one came and apologized for their lack of character.  The Director of Operations would say that this is a culture of upward mobility when it is not.  I and many others where blocked from applying to other jobs throughout the company that we were more than qualified just so we could keep the integrity of our assigned regions and the quality at Gold Standards.  Very fast paced and high pressure, 8 hours tied to your chair."
bad,Manager can't communicate effectively. There is no help when you need it. No formal training and they look at you like you are stupid when you ask how to do something. Definitely not worth the time and stress.
bad,Very stressful working here. Fast paced and there aren’t many breaks given. Poor management. No opportunity for growth. They will fire you if you develop health issues.
bad,"poor management, extreme favoritism, high turnover rate. promotions are based on what click you are in not the quality of work you do..management retaliates against an employee for being vocal about work load or any other issue that may arise in the department."
bad,"per diem..."
bad,"Many year ago, when the company was Smithkline Beecham, this was the greatest company to work. Now, not family friendly or room for advancement."
bad,"Very lack luster performances from upper management. I've been there five years. Beyond rumors and conjecture all thats left is an integrity free environment were everyone does as little as they can."
bad,"The D.M.V region has their own set of rules (on the logistics side). Many employees are forced to record management, so they’re held accountable on promises made."
bad,"Training courses are ridiculously daunting, tiresome, slow, cumbersome.  Management communication is entirely via email.  Usual clique y climate at work."
bad,Quest Diagnostics does not care about the well being of their employees.  They have floats that they use as regular full time people to cover locations so it makes it difficult to have days off and request days off. The company doesn't even celebrate lab week we get nothing and we do all the work while they sit up in their offices patting on their backs we get an email saying happy lab whoopee..They are a money hungry company and only care about numbers. We are just another number to them
bad,Very stressful environment with extreme favoritism from management. Very short staffed and overworked. Rules didn't apply to everyone but were applied to only a select few.
bad,"Initiatives change daily, no autonomy.  A typical day at work is 7am - 8pm, no lunch, and that is not enough.  The more you give the more the company takes.  There are too many chiefs and not enough Indians working here.  Executives manage by fear, not motivating at all.  Overall, the company employees are overworked, underpaid and unhappy.  The company has a tendency to discriminate with age and gender."
bad,I tried to keep my nose to the ground. Do my job and go home. I was rewarded by the patients with their kindness and understanding. Patients where what kept me going.
bad,Previously survived on reputation and purchasing of competotors. Recently has changed business model to improve performance and client service and cost.
bad,"Awful work environment, management doesn’t care about you. To much work expected with little staff on assigned scheduled working shifts. Night shift employees are way nicer then first shift employees. Laboratory employees are really rude and disrespectful to phlebotomist. I did enjoy the experience I gained from working there. If the management changed I think it would be a way better work environment. Turn over rate is really high in Roanoke location. Their are always people quiting do to mangagment. They don’t care to listen to the needs of the employees or their scheduling. And they don’t care if there is a flood and the river is high they expect you to be there no matter what even if it’s not safe."
bad,Terrible mgt makes a dull job difficult. Getting help is left up to my fellow employees. Call in with a problem and no one answers the phone. You are pretty much on your own.
bad,"Quest promises benefits to off set pay, then takes your benefits away or lessens them. Every year your cost of insurance increases and choices decrease. The company promises further advancement then only offers to a select few."
bad,"The pay and benefits are abysmal.  The work environment is horrible due to problems with being understaffed.  Management is often clueless and inept.  Promotions seem to be based less on merit and hard work and more on favoritism and nepotism.  It is also very difficult to balance work and personal life; this is largely due to extreme amounts of ""required"" overtime caused by being understaffed."
bad,"Not a great place to work.  Good to earn money and pay bills, not much advancement opp.  Lack of professional treatment.  Lack of caring from employer, quick to throw employees under the bus or fire.  Not a career or long term place to work.  Will advance if you are friends or family not for the hard work."
bad,typical day is answering phones non stop and listening to doctors complain. Handling demographic changes to patient records due to processing errors. Adding and deleting texts that doctors either want or don't want.
bad,To much favoritism no raise all they care about us numbers not customer care nor service never acknowledge phlebs no kind if Christmas parties to show appreciation
bad,night shift hours only get paid 11 dollars 3 months then it goes to 13 dollars. boring sit on your ... job . they want you to move super fast and the Asian managers not good at explaining things and get mad when you don't understand them.
bad,"It has been my unfortunate experience to witness and been the victim of an organization where management is allowed to run amuck and unchecked even by human resources.Quest is an organization where policies, rules and regulations vary from department to department and human resources are completely and willfully incompetent and openly disregard state department of labor laws and regulations."
bad,We were always short staffed and didnt get all our breaks the average wait time for customers was 2 hours. they never split up the employees properly i was the only phlebotomist at the store i worked at while some other stores had 5... the managment was poor they diodnt know a thing about management or phlebotomy.
bad,"This company is very cut-throat and bais if you're not the color of the people working in the main office, they really don't care about phlebotomist! That is a fact. The only way to move up is to stick your nose between the supervisor butt cheeks."
bad,"Hardest part of the job is not having proper training on infant heel sticks. There was a lot of times we didn't have supplies to work with. Management was starting mess between the workers."
bad,HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK HIGH STRESS LOW PAY management doesnt care about employees favoritism is very high pay is very low no incentives no vacation time of sick time very hard to make production
bad,"Quest Diagnostic is not supportive of there employees, At this company you will most likely work by yourself due to under staffing. It is also very hard to get vacation time in because of the under staffing issue."
bad,Everyday we saw about 150 to 160 patients a day and had all sorts from newborn to elderly. I learned that coworkers aren't your friends and you can't depend on anyone at work. Management was very disoriented and never had a straight answer for me.The hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult patients and bad attitudes. The most enjoyable part was drawing blood and getting to know my patients.
bad,It's an okay place to work.  They just keep changing my schedule and I am tired of working nights.  There is a lot of nepotism and open hostility between coworkers that erupts on the floor occasionally.
bad,"A typical day at Quest is very busy and at times stressful because yoiu may be pulled in several directions at the sametime. I have learned quite a bit about how patients will do so many things to attempt to alter their drug screening test."
bad,They were rude and set most people up to fail. Couldn't stand the way management treated and micromanaged the employees. The pay was not near good enough for the job being done.
bad,"The company has/in the process of restructuring. Some of the management ""run"" with the idea of work more with a whole lot less. "
bad,"The work itself wasn't too bad, however the supervisors caused more problems than they solved. We were divided up into teams, each team had a Team Leader, who was your immediate supervisor, who you reported to daily. When your Team Leader is talking about their employee's and their confidential information such as salary with other employee's it's very hard to be able to trust your Team Leader. It was more than your typical office drama, and if you aren't part of Team Leaders favorites then they will do whatever they can to get rid of you. Some of the Team Leaders were actually bully's, instead of helping their employee's learn and grow with the company they would do whatever they could to make every day as miserable as possible."
bad,Fast-paced office required answering phone calls from local hospitals requesting materials for cancer patient's appointments. I would also expedite request for biopsy slides via faxes from various medical centers. I would retrieved these slides from our medical files and then package them for shipping via Fed-Ex overnight mail. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was making a difference in a cancer patient's life. I always made sure that the biopsy slides were correctly shipped to the patient's hospitals and on-time for their doctor's appointments.
bad,"Over works and in an environment where your immediate supervisor would walk past you and not acknowledge you. They are all about productivity and want you to push things through rather then doing it the right way. Mistakes are made that way and if you were not producing as much as they wanted you to, you could lose your job."
bad,"I really don't have a review, but this is not a good company to work for.  You are always left feeling that you are ""Dang if you do, and dang if you don't"""
bad,This particular job is a call center atmosphere the job entails calling or receiving calls from applicants regarding there medical history for life insurance these calls may take anywhere from 10 mins to an hour or two you have to document each piece of info they give. Which gets annoying aside from the calls the leadership is horrible and very contradictory they will not help you even though they say they are. Your promotion depends on perfect reviews from your calls for 3 months which is nearly impossible you will not receive any PTO time or sick time they lump it all together and any day you miss comes From this time you receive this time off based on how many hrs you wrk after you have been here a year if you do not have time to take off. They will make your time negative an you will owe this time back. This employer does not care about the employees there is no job security and insurance is barely worth it. They will also tell you you have mandatory overtime which sounds nice but what they dnt tell you is overtime can get up to 17 hrs and is required for you to complete it on certain days if you dnt it is an automatic disciplinary action. So this means coming to work as early as 7am and leaving possibly at 10pm at night if they say so
bad,I worked as a perdiem phlebotomist. The place was poorly managed. We drew blood for lab research. People would volunteer in a study for cash reinburstments.
bad,"I love what I do I just cant work for a company that allows their mamagement to treat people bad, and they never listen to what you have to say."
bad,"former ceo promised investors $500M in reductions over five years....hhmmm the only piece they are able to cut are PEOPLE and BENEFITS most recent changes limit on 401k match, health insurance which requires more out of pocket expense to employees, no longer paying federal mileage rate of .55 per mile but flat rate no matter how far you travel (could be one mile could be forty miles) and five (count em five) 20+ year employees offered ""retirement package"" -- retirement package is one year of salary only -- no continuation of health insurance, no reduced cost health insurance (hope you can use your 401k plan for income) oh and by the way hr director for unit left company just before reduction in staff announced here (smells like he knew when to get out), won't keep staff at consistent levels but will require you to work overtime wait can’t say overtime because there are no 40hr jobs everything is less than 40hr so they don’t have to pay overtime but will still make you work extra hours"
bad,It's always rewarding when you know that your hard work and efforts is helping a family get results that could impact their futures. Unselfish when doing the job because you know it's helping a family. Cons management sets you up for failure. When errors or situations occur instead of resolving a problem they create more issues without investigating so they blame you instead.
bad,"For real, if you are not in with the heads or Filipino don't bother. After 2 days I felt highly uncomfortable. 2 months I felt like I was losing my mind, 2 years later I quit."
bad,"Extremely toxic work environment. "
bad,The company doesnt pay fairly for my years of experience.  I don’t feel appreciated and respected by management. The only thing keeping me there is the fact that I have very good coworkers and a family to support
bad,Most people are here for the paycheck.  There are some very ineffectual managers who are either out of touch or there for the power trip. They  use their employees like they are disposable.
bad,"People work in silos and there is minimal interactions with others. As an analyst, I would spend entire days without talking to anyone, other than saying hi to my boss in the morning"
bad,"For the most part the other Employees are ok to work with, The leadership Lacks in problem solving and respect towards those that they are in charge of."
bad,"I worked for MedXM before it was bought by Quest Diagnostics. They were great before. Easy going, got the job done. No stress. Then quest came in and hired a new supervisor of the call center. Ruined everything. They demanded results for such little work. Most of our health plans didn't sign back up with us because of this. Then they expected us to still do the same work. Constant overtime and it is MANDATORY.  It sucks. I liked the job before but it was so stressful. Always something you are doing wrong. Never positive."
bad,Me tocaron lideres poco capacitadas para el manejo de personal y una supervisora en mi opinion poco profesional y discriminadora prefiriendo las personas de su pais
bad,"Poor management in one of Quest's sites. This particular business unit has almost a sort of caste system.  Management is told to keep space between themselves and their employees.  I felt that all employees should be treated the same whether they are lab assistants, warehouse workers; janitors; CLS's or management. This particular business unit is very political."
bad,"If you are not in the click with the managers , you will not last long at Quest. Management is terrible and most managers have no regards for your health or well-being. Certain employees get away with murder if they are in with the managers but if your not in their click you get written up for the smallest occurrence. EmEmployees are not treated equally"
bad,"Lowest wage received in this field and the benefits are mediocre. High turnover rate. They don't treat employees or patients very well. Their policies create a hostile work environment as patients often take their frustration with the system ot on the employees. "
bad,"We have to collect payments "
bad,Quest Diagnostics is your typical corporate run business.  They have this ridiculous and intimidating system of errors set up to force you to work under fear and stress.  Quest covers up their bullying tactics by offering great benefits for their employees if you can withstand the daily pressure and stress of working under such tyrants. They have no regard for their employees or their personal lives as its all about making Quest money!!!
bad,"Awful place to work, in an equally awful location."
bad,I enjoyed working at Quest when I first started there but through the many changes in management and policies it became very tocic. Every employee blamed someone else for their ineptitude and if anytjing v went wrong there was no accountability. There was backstabbing and favoritism among employees and management. I had calls from my supervisor when I was on short term disability and later found out that   my call was heard on speakerphone.
bad,"Quest is a great company to work for I loved my job.  The .com is my supervisor made untrue allegations against me while I was on fmla for heart attack.  Upon hearing this and told the office I worked in didn't want me there, I informed HR and the staff at the office where I worked were told to reach out and inform  none of allegations were true.  HE called me several times and the last time I was told I never had patient complaints nor numerous mistakes.  I knew I did nothing wrong well a week upon return I found out my father was terminally ill had 2 to 4 mths. to live keep in mind I already had fmla  for myself and my father prior to this.  A few weeks l later I was told I was displaced displaced so I no longer had a job.  Heart attack happened October 11, 2018 returned to work November 5, 2018 asked supervisor did she need Dr. note clearing me for work she stated no.  November 15, 2018 found out father had lung cancer had him set up with hospice.  December 15, 2018 I was terminated, was told I would receive severance pay, my insurance would be terminated at midnight  well I didn't receive severance pay and by 6pm. Insurance was terminated before I could pick up my meds. Needless to say devastated I am 48 single and only help my father has, but my faith in God is so strong and he is my provider."
bad,"Very little room for advancement.  Would only recommend for someone who would like to use this as a stepping stone to advance in another area of medicine,"
bad,Production environment fast paced not enough training involved before being put on the floor too many attitudes not friendly atmosphere not felt welcome SUPERVISORS are not people oriented
bad,"Great people to work with. Pay is below pharma and medical devices, particularly for directors. There are only 6 paid holidays each year which is below most companies."
bad,"Quest is a very process driven company that does not foster creativity thinking. On the contrary, everything is very structured. The culture can be a bit standoffish as compared to collegial."
bad,"No position is permanent and layoffs are frequent, there is not much training and workloads can be very heavy without adequate staffing, this is a job that requires quotas to be met"
bad,Very stressful environment. Its an excellent way to refine your phlebotomy skills. The pressure to meet timed requirements per patient can be a bit overwhelming.
bad,"Quest diagnostics is not a kind of organization where a good employee should think to work. "
bad,Alot of disgruntled employees. Alot of employees leave and go to other labs even supervisors or employees who have been with the company for more than 15 years.....Not good. Be aware.
bad,"With new management in 2015, everything changed - it became a workplace where it was no longer for employees job satisfaction but a place for employer gains and profits."
bad,"Company only cares about collecting money from patients. I worked with Quest for 7 months and could not believe wait time for patients. I guess it would be okay for newbies to get their feet wet but, for experience Phlebotomist this company would not be a good fit. Way to much politics and favoritism with management. Pay is just below country average."
bad,"It's very demanding and you often don't feel appreciated. They don't have any compassion for people with kids or other responsibilities,"
bad,Quest Diagnostics is a horrible company to work for especially as a phlebotomist. The pay is horrible and below other companies pay. The benefits are extremely expensive and you can still expect to pay 80 dollars out of pocket to see a physician. You are constantly under staffed and overworked and rarely get to take your breaks on time. There is a lot of pressure put on you for keeping wait times down but they do not provide the help needed. Supplies? don't count of having what you need on hand to do your job. Constantly running out of tubes and butterfly needles and having to send one of your staff members out of your already short ran location driving around to other locations to find the supplies needed. Management is horrible and do not help with these issues. I do not recommend working for this company! Go else where if you can!
bad,"Downsizing, layoffs, benefits cut, talk of outsourcing.  Moral is very poor waiting for the ax to drop.  Heavier workloads.  Not valued for how hard you work rather valued for how good you talk the talk. If you are a brown nose you get ahead. New leadership is very unprofessional  she back stabs and talks about everyone even her boss.  she is a detriment"
bad,"Difficult place to work.  Very stressful, high turn over. inadequate pay for the amount of tasks phlebotomists are responsible for."
bad,"Night shift supervisory leaves MUCH to be desired. Lead supervisor on third shift is nearly completely incompetent and spends the bulk of the evening ensuring that he never has to actually do any work.  Very indecisive management. Never enough employees (because they're constantly firing everyone) and next to zero growth opportunities. Repetitive and boring workload (but what isn't these days, anyway?)"
bad,"Where to begin... "
bad,Worker's and management was very hard to me and I once got hurt and they didn't care of me work in pain all day. Not very much to say BUT WARNING be careful to work there.
bad,Too many chiefs not enough indians. No one takes ownership for the wrong doings you receive. You are penalized for 1 minute latenesses. I thought that because this was a small office that the call center feel would be less. WRONG! You're led to believe in training that you have made it to the promise land. Their turnover rate is the highest it has ever been.
bad,"After management embarrassed me too many times, I had no choice but to quit. It's an in bound call center only, got reprimanded if you made calls out to insurance companies. They act like they care about the patients but they don't. Just wanted me to shut up and collect patients money even though we billed it wrong. Hardly praised for good work...supervisor would give dirty looks if you made a mistake. And don't make a mistake or they are all over you like the plague."
bad,"Work is not spread out evenly in a productive manner, no work/life balance at all. Management is not the best. However, I did learn alot working for this company."
bad,"Ok place to work, little room for advancement particularly if you are female. Management is out of touch with what the job entails and does not seem to care what the employees think or feel."
bad,We were incredibly understaffed for the workload at this high volume location.  We were encouraged to get patients in and out as fast as possible instead of providing quality care.
bad,"Non-accommodating, rude supervisors. Worked overtime everyday, never missed a patient and gave my all to my wonderful home office, Quest is unappreciative of their employees."
bad,Mandatory overtime form 4 to 17 hours per week. On The phone doing interviews for entire shift. Take 3 meals with you to work each day
bad,"I loved my job at quest.  Until they put me at the main location in town.  the environment is not team friendly, it is very cliqueish and the team members talk poorly of one another."
bad,Great Benefits but the wage I receiced was not adquate enough to survive on. The management team there was cold and rude and only cared about their company's bottom line. 
bad,"I'm not sure if it the company as a whole is like this, however the one office where I worked for a 2 weeks was horrible. Supervisor had no management skills and even went so far as to try to sign me up for training without even discussing with me if I could go. She actually wanted me to simply drop everything (son and all) and attend a training in another city 3 days after working there. At the end, I found out that I was no longer needed not from a professional phone call or email but on a conference call where she announced that the 2 new recent hires would not be working with them any longer. As I said, I can't speak for the organization as a whole but the Deerfield Beach, FL location was very unprofessional."
bad,A typical day a Quest Patient service lab is very stressful. We are always short staffed and over worked. There is little down time and sometimes you may go all day without a lunch break. My co-workers are lazy and dont hold there wait. The hardest part of the job is the fact we see over 150 patients with only up to 3-4 Phlebotomist aday. The thing I enjoy about the job is helping people and being able to give them great service.
bad,"Good PTO time, and decent benefits. However, the lack of respect for their employees is what hurts this company. People don't mind working overtime every once in a while, but everyday, and for long hours is absurd. You have to work to live, but you need to live to work! When people our overworked it can cause all types of health problems. I am all for putting the customer first, but your company should live up to that motto with your employees as well. If some of the managers would have taken time to listen to the little people on the totem pole, then maybe your turnover rate would not be so high. Employees that are treated right, will be dedicated to the company that they work for, and will stick around and grow with that company."
bad,"Hard to advance in this company. Long hours, no organization for work flow"
bad,Not appreciated for quality work. It's all about numbers. Management not suited or skilled for position. Poor human resources. Paper worked to death and morale is horrible.
bad,"I cannot speak for any other area of the company, but my side of the lab was divided because the management was not really there for the employees. The only time they are is if 1) you do something wrong 2) Inspection Week or 3) it benefits them/ makes them look better. They would take your ideas and try and make them seem like they came from management. "
bad,It was a good job for me as an LPN. Enjoyed going to various companies preforming health check ups. I had great reviews. Let me go over refusing to join company as employee
bad,After being there for so many years and you go online to look for another job you find out that others are being hired for  more than what you make and you bust your butt try to advance and you get no where.
bad,The company itself was pretty good. They are unorganized and if the management doesn't like you they will tell you that they are going to get you out of the company and they do.
bad,"The culture here is difficult to navigate through. They lead by a ""who can we blame"" attitude instead of leading by example. The upper management needs a serious overhaul in order to change this company. People are leaving everyday to escape the misery of the management and their impossible demands that they would not in turn do themselves. Its a revolving door. Its a good place to get your foot in the door to medical diagnostics and processing but not a good place to stay."
bad,"It was a good place to work until they changed management then it all went down hill. They didn't care about anyone that worked there. They lost at least 17 people within 6 months, people that was there more than 15-20 years."
bad,"Management has institutionalized it's employees to the point that no one will make a decision, especially management.  Conference calls with no action plans.  Employees show up for work and do as little as possible. Very low morale.  Departments do not work together. Minimal training. Employee reviews are a waste of time because everyone receives the same score and raise regardless of work quality or production.  You leave work everyday frustrated and knowing nothing was accomplished."
bad,"Managers harass and demoralize bench level lab workers."
bad,"My coworkers at Quest were wonderful people, but the management is awful. There was absolutely no work/life balance and I was one of the few people in the department that was able to finish my work on time. Most people get at least 30min of overtime per day and very frequently the company requires mandatory overtime on the weekends. I was harassed by the team leads and the supervisor was either unwilling or unable to do anything about it."
bad,"Quest Dallas has lots of openings, and they do pay.  It’s not worth it.   Management is a hot mess at this place.  You will spend all your time on meetings, kaizen etc, and then Management expects productivity miracles.   It’s like they haven’t figured out how much turnover costs."
bad,The senior management has its blinders on when it comes to consolidation of location. It has the old boys club feel from teh top down and then want to outsource as much as possible to the wrong companies just to save money.
bad,"They lack integrity. Its a very stressful place to work. The company itself is absolutely awesome, but the managers and leads that represent the company aren't professional."
bad,"You compete for points each day, slow days or slow shifts mean you are a poor worker compared to those workers that have work available to them. The management only approaches you, if you did something incorrect; there is not positive enforcement at all. Annual raises are 1-2% a year.There are no regular shifts, every worker has to work every weekend unless you use vacation time."
bad,I have to say that I love doing phlebotomy I have been Certified for 22 years a typical day at work was busy I learned how to balance my time well with the amount of patients that we saw within the day . I think management could be more supportive and the company overall should be more appreciative of the staff . The workplace environment is typical for a lab it's the people you meet along the way and work side by side makes it enjoyable and for those coworkers I've had the pleasure of working with i'm grateful .
bad,My experience at Quest diagnostics was not ideal. I had issues with the management on a weekly basis and they were not open to any change I had suggested.
bad,There were too much stream-lining of the work whereby employees were asked to do more work with less help from staff and management. Management spent too much time in meetings rather than being on the floor.
bad,"They provide 5 sets of scrubs if your full time. It is a revolving door because people don't feel valued, the pay is low $18.43/hr for Rep PS II Float in Sacramento, CA, & a lot of staff have no idea what they're doing. Due to lacking the ability to keep staff, you are always working short handed & some PSC's are too busy to work under staffed. It wouldn't be a bad place to gain knowledge for a newbie, but if you don't catch on quick, you will just cause more work for veteran staff & some get very cranky!"
bad,I am a very good phlebotomist  dependable reliable hard working and available any hours im asked to work  it was hard to take a lunch or break not enough help at the sites under paid favoritism
bad,The management team needed to communicate much better with the group leads. And not show favoritism. There was no growth to be able to move up in the department.
bad,"Quest Diagnostics has a lot of great employees and some upper management that are great.  They do not seem to have their employees best interest at heart though.  Always short staffed, overworked, expected to stay late frequently, and frequently working over 40 hours a week, to cover weekends and every three months meetings that don't happen during work hours, but on employees own time."
bad,"It is a very disorganized place. I have worked here for a year as a temp and there has been a decline in professionalism during my stay here. Your time at this job is based on your location on the assembly line. Others can leave when they decide to, others come early so that they can avoid helping if the day runs late. It creates stress and frustration for all those who come after them. Literally speaking, ""S--- rolls downhill."" It is a very inconvenient to work at a place that doesn't give you the ability to do your hours and depart when your time is up. It is even more inconvenient when your workload can be increased almost 3 fold by 1 person, simply, being absent. There is no teamwork and no willingness to be considerate in terms of expedition and time. If you really need the job, go for it. If you don't, then look elsewhere."
bad,"here is some text and some more text so I can get to 20 words.  Again, it is silly to require this. And I guess i need more so here is some more."
bad,Very high paced and high pressure environment.  My perception of management is that they are disconnected with volume of work load and the pressures of working with equipment and assays that often breakdown or fail.
bad,"A typical day at work is very routine. Ive learned how to become a better leader working for this company, how to handle people upon certain situations. The management team is pretty staright forward, but they usually dont have the best communication. My co workers are easy going and good to get along with. The hardest part of the job is having to tell grown people what to do, when that already know what they should be coming into work and doing. The most enjoyabe part of my job is that I can come to work and someone will make me smile or laugh every single day."
bad,"At first I loved this company, but I was promised a lot of opportunities that never came. On average I worked about 75 hours a week so keeping a balance at home with my husband and 20 month old became impossible. I believe in going above and beyond for your company but it was too much."
bad,Working midnights is the hardest part. I've learned everything about processing specimens and validating them. I like my co-workers.
bad,"Managers have favorites, never the same supervisor, don't pay you well, never enough help from co-workers, customer service refuses to help sites, not a good company to work for. There is no advancement or incentives for employees to work for Quest Diagnostics. No teamwork."
bad,"It's different. "
bad,Management made it hard to enjoy working there. Professionalism was lacking.
bad,Specimen transfer pilot. Overnight delivery of medical specimens throughout the Northeast and Southeastern United States.
bad,"each shift was demanding and therefore enjoyable for me. It was an extremely fast-paced and busy place to work with a tremendous workload. We analyzed and reported results for 15-20,000 specimens per 10 hour shift, spread between four technologists."
bad,"A typical day at work is being pressured into making production numbers every night. This by itself would not be a problem, but the poor judgement by supervisors regarding work distribution (the noticeably more difficult work always finds its way to select ""special"" processors, aka, those that were not one of the ""favorites"") makes it nearly impossible for some processors to reach those numbers. Even further, proper raises are not given once meeting a certain benchmark, or level, of what you know how to process. I know I was stuck at level 25, when I knew everything and performed just as well as someone at level 27. I'm thankful for the data entry and organizational skills this just gave me, but I could do without the unnecessary pressure, being overworked, and underpaid. The only bright side of going to work was being with coworkers, who knew exactly what each other felt, as pretty much all of us were in the same boat."
bad,"Great place to work! However, the culture of the company makes it a struggle to work there."
bad,"A typical day at work would be, several co-workers calling off work.  This jobs is not like most jobs were the work could be done by one person.  Its very stressful at work, management and the direct supervisor dosen't make the best decision when hiring new personal."
bad,the title speaks for itself lying manangemtn terrible moral not a good plcaeto work
bad,"had some great co-workers, but others would rather tell on you to management to make their selves look good"
bad,This company needs better management and better ways of recognizing hard workers like myself.
bad,"Quest has great services and is definitely a leader in the industry, however, it needs major improvements in processes and management."
bad,"There are some departments that are truly sweatshops...accessioning, couriers and phlebotomists. Low pay, only part-time hours, no advancement opportunities BUT upper management seems to think that all is well at Quest. It's all about how many specimens/patients you move in and out during your shift BUT MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MAKE AN ERROR. Employee attitude is we never get it right the first time but always have time to fix it later. Where is the patient focus? Isn't that why we wanted to work here?"
bad,Not going to say that it is the best place to work but it is a job
bad,A lot of work not enough to help Carry the weight. Good gifts if you win prizes. No part time. My supervisor was the best supervisor. Nice lunch:breakfast eating place.
bad,I didn't mind the work at all. The part I disliked the most was working every Saturday. That took way to much time away from my personal life. I worked there a whole year and no raise. Yet my manager and lead person  always told me how great of a job I was doing.
bad,"Supervisor is very arrogant and impolite to employees."
bad,"It is impossible to get a day off, regardless of how long in advance it is requested(8 months in my case and still was denied). I was asked to produce a death certificate, and was questioned about my father's obituary. Very upsetting. People have missed their own kids graduations, in fear they will be written up. Other than that, I loved the job,but management was bad."
bad,"I loved most of the  people I worked with but everyone was very unhappy with management.  The supervisor was very nice but not management material; therefore, the department was a mess and run by the bullies. Everything from the schedule and how the benches should be run was always a huge source of contention.  Techs got to pick whom learned what....this made for an interesting dynamic!  Another manager was brought in and knew nothing about the department.  This just made morale very low.  A lot of work, low pay, and no opportunity for advancement."
bad,"I got hired threw a temp agency and from the interview with quest I got promises that haven't been kept yet. I started at fulltime and now they push me to partime, I also have no benefits. It's been 4months I've been working wit the agency and still haven't got an offer for employment with quest diagnostics."
bad,"Quest, as a whole, is a great company to work for. Good benefits, good career development, and a great place to learn."
bad,"Here at Quest there is really only one thing you need to know and it is that upper management really doesn’t care about you outside of your ability to get your job done. Almost every department has mandatory overtime everyday. You are expected to work at a pace that, at times, seems above what is physically possible for the human body. And to top it all off they are expecting to double their work load volume in this upcoming year. "
bad,"My typical day of work"
bad,"I suppose there are less appealing ways to make an introduction into the Healthcare/Health Information field, but this one definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. "
bad,"its a job to collect a pay check! very bad management unprofessional (Wood dale,IL) minimum pay 12$ which is very low comparing what you do for 12 hours straight mandatory overtime."
bad,"Manager showed favoritism "
bad,"High employee turnover- some people never come back after a few weeks!  Low morale in my department. Your schedule constantly changes because this company always wants to run the departments a few FTE's short. So when someone is on vacation or calls out you need to adjust your hours. VERY POOR work/ life balance. Supervisors work between 10-14 hour days, 5 plus days a week."
bad,"The whole place is very chaotic. At least at the one I worked at. Management between all shifts, were all on separate pages. There was negative competition between some of management as well, making it hard on the employees to work properly. There were too many systems in place trying to fix problems. We moved on to new systems and problems before problems could get fixed or solutions tweaked as well. The company overall wasn't bad, but the one I worked at was a chaotic mess. Understaffed due to high turnover rate, and just systematically poor. Many employees quit in front of me, by which I mean walked out and never came back. Employees lost motivation to work hard quickly due to standards and expectations being too much. Example, doing more than one persons job, because of being understaffed, due to turnover."
bad,This company is fast pace and compensation is ok but could be better. I would recommend this company to people if want to stand on their feet for more than 8hours.
bad,Never a happy employer or manager.. it's always a push push environment.  You can never do enough.  LA management or the upper bosses are as non professional as it gets.  So many good people effected by there greed to advance.
bad,"- Busy and lonely"
bad,didn't get pay enough based on the experiences. Don't get to go break and lunch on time. The manager and supervisor don' listen  to employees. Whenever call in sick get threat from supervisor to get written up.
bad,"Senior management was driven purely by the bottom line living quarter to quarter.  There is no long-range planning and high performers are not valued. "
bad,"it was interesting working there learned a lot, but management was so bad, and they did not take time to appreciate employees. I would sometimes work third shift and 1st shift but even when 1st shift did not show up and I was tired and still stayed I never got a thank you"
bad,"The schedule was ever changing youncant get a set point of contat"
bad,"Working for this company you will be subjected to working overtime hours and not get paid for it. you will have to take extended lunches to cut overtime hours off you hours, and there is no grace period for being late, not even 1 minute late is acceptable. The pay raises are a bit of a joke if you ask me, it is basically change from their pockets, as in 15 cents. I believe that with the right kind of fairness and appreciation this would be a great company to work for, along with management being held accountable for their unprofessional behavior. If you are not a punctual person, this is not the job for you."
bad,Quest was a wonderfull place to work when I started in 2003. The management has changed for the worse. The employees and the patients are just numbers now. I am personally ashamed at the turn its taken. It used to be about the people. Now its about the stockholder.
bad,Management is really bad. All they care about is making money they overlook employee and needs. They hire supervisors who are not knowledgeable in any way. Retaliation for reporting supervisors. Over worked no overtime pay sucks.
bad,"inbound call center handling customer issues dealing with correct billing, coding, payment plans, and collects resolution. Records retrieval for collection"
bad,As a Quest Diagnostics Customer Service Rep I answered emails from customers from their web site. The majority of the emails were from unsatisfied patients due various reasons.
bad,No room for advancement unless you are friends with management. Pay was decent to start then stagnated quickly with no additional pay for additional work.
bad,Management is terrible. They show partiality. My supervisor is a mess. She talks about her employees to other staff. Creates a hostile work environment
bad,"most work happens on third shift.  sales runs service, promising clients unattainable results, impacting quality at the expense of patient health.  not recommended to staff or consumers"
bad,"The entire place was completely toxic; the co-workers that I had were absolutely horrible people, the amount of work was almost unbearable and there was absolutely inadequate staffing. It was not enjoyable."
bad,"A good place to start out, you will learn a lot, but you will work extremely hard for little compensation or appreciation. Learning about the entire phlebotomy process, from drawing to specimen processing, is excellent for your next steps."
bad,"Quest Diagnostics is a great company to work for but they need to do a better job with the Management in The New Orleans Region. The most enjoyable part of the job is your patients and co workers. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if you be able to enjoy special moments in your children's lives because, you cant get approved for the time off. What I have learned from working at Quest is that some people with authority shoudn't have it and everybody with a degree, aren't qualified for their position."
bad,this company was fair less to say. They acknowledge the good within their employees. the pay was satisfying. They could give more room for growth in managerial positions
bad,"This is a good place to work if you are looking for a place to gain experience working in the lab processing area's.  Co workers and management are not friendly or helpful.  No one seems happy there. "
bad,Everyday I would start by saying good morning to all of my coworkers who are there when I arrive.  I sign on to my computer and work trailer from clients office until 8 am.  I then would work from my worklist for the remainder of the day.
bad,Was not happy with the company I had a mini stroke on the job and they wouldn't contact 911 fro emergency medical assistance.
bad,The hardest part of the job working at Quest Diagnostics was that there was no team work. None of the employees worked as a unit or helped one another.
bad,I work with the Vitek machines daily getting sensitivity for the clients. After Quest bought us out we lost 70% of our work. I pray it comes back to us.
bad,"This use to be a decent company to work for years ago.  I left after almost 9 years at the company as a Medical Technologist.  Instead of treating us like employees they treated us as factory workers and tried to make us more and more productive.  It was more about quantity instead of quality. They have drastically reduced previous benefits which weren't bad in the past. You also need to punch in and out for lunch and they place the punch clocks right in your department clear across on the other side of the building so you can waste a few minutes getting there and back so you can't even enjoy your lunch because you are constantly looking at the clock.  The new CEO is focused on money and doesn't have a healthcare background.  I have never met a company so focused on not getting you the benefits you deserve.  For instance if your BMI is over so much they make you pay more for health insurance which is already very awful.  The raise have been awful and every year it's another excuse, every year were are ""in a transition year"" setting up for a better year.  When I left I thought I would get pro rated profit sharing but they instituted a new rule that you must work there at least 6 months that year to get it.  Just another example of them doing everything to try to compensate you less.  My former co-workers say it's getting worse and many have had to quit because they are adjusting their schedules they had for years to a more dynamic schedule basically getting the absolute most they can out of you. I have worked in this field for 17 years and never felt so undervalued as I was there"
bad,"The new management in 2015 made the environment very stressful and frustrated. You are not allow to talk to anyone while work, but only certain people of certain race are allow to do so. If you want to advance she will create obstacles for you not to advance if you are not her race. No appreciation for employees, manager just makes all employees get in a very bad attitude and stress everyone. Only employees she likes were able to enjoy the job. co-workers are great but management is so unprofessional and rude to employees. No confidentiality at all."
bad,Lack of job security. Spent years as a contractor before I was finally hired and let go after a year of being a full-time employee. I would not suggest working for this company if you have a choice.
bad,"Good Benefits and insurance. Job is Extremely Stress oriented"
bad,overall great place to work. you learn a lot about process and what required my federal law to complete task at hand. This NOC is in its beginning stages so there are still a few kinks to workout.
bad,"This company stresses the customer ""gold standards"" for support but they do not provide adequate training to sufficiently support client or patient needs.  This is a ""learn as you go"" job.  All the company cares about is how many calls you answer and it truly does not care about employees, clients or customers."
bad,"Average day is answering or calling out at least 100 phones calls, management does not have a clue and therefore unable to assist your. Must be apart of a click and hope your co-workers are willing to help if you need assistance with a complex matter. The hardest part of the job is sitting for six and a half hours and the most enjoyable part of the job is going on break."
bad,"typical Job to greet and serve patients in a professional manner. I learn how order labs, how to process blood. working with others was great. Management was ok."
bad,"this company never felt like part of ""corporate America"" until two years ago... then it all changed for the worse.  "
bad,"High volume, Learned how to deal with different veins. The hardest part is trying to maintain low wait times but still service the patient kindly"
bad,"flexible schedules and more learning at this time in the position, however, things have drastically changed since 2009"
bad,I was laid off my entire department was let go. I wasn't properly trained management wasn't the best.
bad,Employee's I worked with were great.  But the Management needed to all be fired and start over.  They were very bad to work for.  There were so many wrong doing's that I called the higher up and they did nothing about anything that anyone had complained about.  Not a good company to work for here in California.
bad,"Enter acting with patient knowing that I'm helping them to be healthy. And treat them like my friends or family. I always says "" come in as a stranger, leave me as a friend""."
bad,"I enjoyed working and building rapport with the clients and patients, the fast paced environment and the opportunity for OT, however communication could be much better and the the same opportunities should be available for all employees not some."
bad,"Company is currently going through a re-org with a new CEO and a lot of changes taking place. This could mean a lot of new opportunities for the right individuals. This is a 50,000+ employee firm with whom you could find yourself unemployed at the drop of a dime. Proceed with caution."
bad,They cared nothing about the workers and didnt pay well at all but poured on the work
bad,Quest is a good company to work for the communication is not very good and what they went over in orientation is not how it is in thework place totally different.
bad,When I started it was great. Then they made some management changes and everything went down hill. Would not encourage anyone to work for Quest. Still hearing horror stories from ex-coworkers.
bad,You get promoted by who you know not by skills and character. If your not buddy buddy with the supervisor they pick at you. Stressful and micro management. Quest in a whole is a great company but the people they chose as management are all friends and “put each other in door” per say. I have never worked for supervisors who try soooo hard to look for reasons to fire someone and always wrong. Maybe other territories are different but Houston south is horrible. Don’t attempt to report or you will get terminated cause they would rather believe the manager lies than employee truth.
bad,"Supervisor let there team lead do anything,poor training and if they dont like you they try and fire you please spare yourself the drama and apply else where"
bad,i have been with the company for many years and the place has lost its identity. The company is globalized with only money as its driving force. it is impossible to be promoted here unless you know someone higher up.
bad,"The pay was ok.... benefits were good."
bad,"Pretty easy job. They do like to hire within first which is a plus. Not very good communication between management and employees as far as changes that are knowingly coming, they like to tell you LAST minute."
bad,"Pesima gerencia, trato por parte de recursos pesimo donde ponen primero lo personal antes que lo laboral, el equipo de ventas cree que los demas deben hacer su trabajo."
bad,Long hours if you are an exempt employee.  They focus on money more than quality.  Care more about the bottom line than quality. One of the few labs that hire technologists without certification.
bad,Expected to interview all interviews under 13 minutes which is impossible.  Was able to work at home.  Hours required would change on a weekly basis depending on work load.
bad,"Typical day consists of extracting or processing over 6 runs (consists of 76-80 patient samples) along with other work"
bad,"Quest diagnostics is great if you are newly graduated and need experience.  It isn't a great place for long term.  As salary gets higher each year, staff who have been working there for years see minimal changes in wages.  Newly hired staff get paid better then those who have been working there for many years."
bad,"Not only is the work environment awful, the supervisors are not helpful or competent at all. The majority of the workload is pushed to those who always work hard but the slackers are never punished or reprimanded for not doing equal amounts. No one meets production and no one has respect for the supervisors. Didn't work there long, but saw enough in the first few weeks to know it wasn't going to be a long term thing."
bad,"I don't want t get into specifics but at least you get a paycheck. It was very strenuous work of what you are compensated and depending on what state you work in, there is no such thing as job security. I saw supervisors who were there for 10 years thrown out like they were still in their first 90s. You can't complain, you can't voice an opinion, you are a slave to your paycheck and that is it."
bad,"they pay and benefits are worth it but the overall environment sucks"
bad,"Not a good job  micromanaged way too much ,  There was no team work with management and they never listened to us. It was always their way or no way."
bad,Well its ok could be way better if people actually cared about their job and did it right. The only benefit is that its monday - friday with holidays off.
bad,Quest ruined a perfect company when they bought AmeriPath. AmeriPath knew what they were doing and all were respected. Quest is run like a conveyor belt . I would never trust my blood or specimen to Quest.
bad,"Doesn't like to give good raises, management is only concerned about their raises and no the needs of the workers. Benefits are too high"
bad,My first day was a huge red flag when introduced to my team lead who upon working with further had no place being in a leadership role. She spent a lot of time bad mouthing other employees and i'm not sure if she knew people could hear what she was saying. Whenever I had a question she would become irritable like someone just overcooked her dinner. Asking employees about the department and about the equipment resulted in being scolded by the team lead and her saying i should ask her the questions. The hours are horrible and you won't have much of a social life or regular sleep schedule for that matter. I heard over many conversations how worried coworkers were about being fired for unknown reasons so as to shore up OT for Quest employees. A manager or leadership role will not tell you this you will receive a phone call. Don't apply here if you want to do anything w your life outside testing urine samples for steroids and heroine its really a waste of your time but hey they moneys good and if you want to do boring work with terrible people this is the place to work.
bad,"Little room for advancement, hard-workers are overlooked.  Communication is terrible and we have few meetings and when we do they do not listen to employees when they try to address problems.  Health benefits have consistently gotten worse from year to year. Pay is not great and annual increases are pathetic even for those with seniority."
bad,"Totaly understand why this company is always hiring the training is not up to part at all. To much down time leave the class not knowing what you are doing, a waste of time."
bad,"Supervisors don't share workload equally, not enough advancement opportunity. At times there was no breaks or short breaks. Management cared about the work getting done and not always properly or under staffed."
bad,my review for this job is not good the management is very bad .
bad,"I worked there 5 years....yes they required working holidays too with very little compensation. I started as a courier with already 2 years experience @ $8.50 per hour with a promise of a $3.00 an hour raise after 3 years. On my 3 rd year anniversary date I asked my supervisor about the long awaited raise. His comment was....""oh..that was the old system...we no longer offer that"". I won numerous awards for going beyond the call of duty...probably 6 in all. They give you a $25.00 gift card which is very nice. But in my 5 years there...I left making slightly over $10.00 an hour....the annual raises sometimes were .17 cents an hour...even though the company was making outrageous revenue and opening new sites world wide yearly. Most co-workers were sour because they were lied to as well.Management changed 4 times in the 5 years I worked there...one other employee had to file a workmens comp. claim and although it was legitimate they fought her tooth & nail trying to disclaim it. She ended up quiting and having to go on Social security disability even though management said there was nothing wrong with her....It was a tough  thankless job...too many promises were never fulfilled."
bad,"They make you work mandatory over time, chronic under-staffing, and over working of employees, low moral among colleagues, travel all over Allegheny county, no opportunity for advancement, On call-on days off, and poor management."
bad,"I was Responsible for providing quality services to doctors and health administrative regarding"
bad,"Busy at times back to back seeing patients for venipunctures , drug screens ubit collections etc...."
bad,"Quest is a very large corporation. Recently they made drastic personnel cuts to increase profits for share holders."
bad,very nice company. i have nothing i want to share for these people only good luck to any new employees
bad,"I found it tough to remain engaged and motivated when resources are continually cut. Employees leave and instead of replacing them, everyone needs to pick up more work. This causes delays in patient results, leads to lost specimens and an overwhelmed feeling of no matter what you do or how hard you work you cannot keep your head above water."
bad,"Fast paced work- Too much work, management needs more training on leading their teams. Stressful at times but manageable. You need to know how to multitask to be successful at your job."
bad,"The company over hires at the beginning of the new year and then starts laying off by April."
bad,"It has an ok workplace culture but extremely fastpaced with little recognition."
bad,Too stressful;  high turnover rate;  felt like a factory with robots running around.  Management very rigid & controlling.  Too much work volume;  training time alloted is not enough to feel confident performing  testing. Not for me!
bad,Quest does not provide any opportunities to rotate among all the departments. There is really no opportunity for advancement and there is limited cross training.
bad,"there was just one person that caused problems, and she has for a long time and the supervisor doesn't see it, she thinks she is great"
bad,The worst thing about Quest is the management. They will destroy anyone with any potential. You can only advance if you are a good slave that sucks up to management.
bad,I loved drawing blood at Quest.  I loved receiving all the complements that my patients gave me in regard to my ability to draw their blood without hurting them without a second stick.  And mostly my excellent customer service and pleasant demeanor.
bad,You are hired for one job description and then that description grows and grows on a regular basis and you are not compensated for it.  You are treated more like a robot than a person.  They have metrics to meet which is fine but most are at a 97% mark; where is the room for human error or a learning curve?  They do nice things every month for charities which is very nice.  Their insurance is expensive for a healthcare company but they offer it.  The biggest problem I would say is that not very many people may it be CSR's or Supervisors are on the same page.  Getting answers to a question that should have a blanket answer is hard to accomplish and you may get 2 or 3 different answers according to who you ask.
bad,"Quest Diagnostics, use to be a great place to work at, until they changed the management. They will hire unqualified people, just so they can pay them a lower amount."
bad,"Worked w some great folks while at Quest. I loved my team mates. "
bad,"Could be a great place to work but management is horrible.  "
bad,Worked there for along time.  I got hurt on the job had to have surgery they denied I got hurt on the job had to get attorney then they terminated me.  Dont get hurt on the job there if you work your butt off for them go beyond expectations they dont care.  You are only a number to them and they will not have your back. They can replace you with a temp who cant do what you have done nor will do the job you did. Alot of people get away with things there as long as you are one of the supervisors favorite.
bad,Management was awful. The managers were not trained for support for the reps. There was always an issue with staff members not coming in for work and everyone worked under a lot of pressure.
bad,"Quest was a great place to work but due to lack of communication, some of their employees feel there is no answers when needed. There is no Human Resources on site so things are handled in an inconsistent manner."
bad,"Low pay for an RN, won't let me put RN on my badge.  ""Not everyone is an RN,it wouldn't be fair""  according to mgmt.  Poor compensation for training.  Lots of driving around, poor compensation for mileage."
bad,Management is not open to explorer processes that will increase efficiency and make the job less stressful and more satisfying.  Last minute mandatory overtime and working 55+ hours a week is not the most ideal.
bad,"Basically at Quest Diagnostic Laboratory, I learned what items and instruments are necessary for a phlebotomy lab to run efficiently( eg,.. laboratory vacutainer tubes, holders,bandaids,Centrifuges ect...) Also learned how to calibrate instruments that are vital for the separation of blood.For  example, for the separation of blood cells, centrifuges need to be calibrated regularly. It was also my responsibilty to keep these clients supplied with laboratory items and help order these supplies if needed.  Hence my title was RSR as well as courier.  RSR refers to Route Service Representative."
bad,I get that companies are all about making money but an employer should at least care somewhat about the employees. Quest Diagnostics does not in any way shape or form.
bad,Worked 2nd shift. Not a lot of upward movement. Management was good. Friendly staff. Benefits were okay. Good for first time job
bad,"Quest is like a factory, the culture is not centered around their patients and/or employees as their Total Quality Management suggests. There exists no career ladder and the pay for their professional, college educate staff is laughable. They are a billion dollar enterprise yet the re-invest in their employees and establishments very little. So glad to have moved on to bigger and better things."
bad,"I worked at Employer Solutions for a little over a year. Started as a temp, after 3 months, I was told I would be hired permanently all the time. I became permanent after a year."
bad,I learned how to work in a fast but I also found that managers played favorites. I deep cleaned the machines. It was something to learn from
bad,No room for growth. Management is unappreciative of work. Only focus on the numbers and daily output. Long hours. Coworkers have negative attitudes towards work and management.  Can easily get stuck in the job. No motivation from fellow employees. Some CLS's don't know basic laboratory techniques. Lab Assistants and Associates are underpaid and do most of work. Yearly performance reviews are biased and promotions only to friends instead of hard workers.
bad,"I had a decent internship here, but it was nothing special. The team that I worked with was pretty good, but the morale of people on other teams was very low."
bad,Most of the time you are driving as that is what the position required. Communicated with dispatch as to make sure pick ups were made on a timely basis.
bad,"management was terrible to work with,my husband got hurt really bad and she would let me leave and he was in the ER so I asked the office I was working with and they let me leave"
bad,"Worked hard and lots of overtime/worked with lots of wonderful people"
bad,"Days are extremely monotonous, there is hardly any variation in processing. There are also way too many things that processors are held responsible for, considering the pay rate. It's common to see people getting warnings or write-ups for errors. The ""RecognitionQuest"" program was an interesting way of rewarding those who actually work hard, but in practice ends up being a way for circles of friends to reward each other. It's hard to really find anything enjoyable about this position, especially since it's during the night shift. Only recommended as a filler for the gaps in between careers."
bad,I worked with Quest Diagnostics for 6 years management was not supportive and not truthful in promotion promises.
bad,". This was calling life insurance people from about 82 companies and documenting their elements. The worst part of the job was in about 100 emails that went to everyone only one or maybe two would be encouragement, the rest would be telling everyone how they need to improve their job skills. They have a 75% turn around in employees and that should have told me a lot. When my sister passed due to cancer they were very liberal with amount of day's off but when her body did not get transported to KC her funeral was delayed and asked if I could work these 2 days in exchange to have these two days off I was told no, this is a company that does not work with you. This is the first time I have ever seen or heard of a company that won't work with a person is such a personal and sad time in ones life"
bad,most busy delivery all day as hard work. Lots sort organized daily. it is stress lots walk. no learning none. the package delivery to sort. collect carry to test to dept.
bad,The experience through quest was an experience that began as a wonderful opportunity but transcended into a nightmare of incompetence and under staffing.
bad,"They say they understand, but if you have any health issues they qill not care and eat you up. There are alot of cliques too. Just dtay to you and you should be fine. If you do get sick like i did please try and stick it out till you get FMLA i wish i was given that chance bc the money is GREAT!! So if you have good health can handle katty woman you good then."
bad,"Quest Diagnostics is great for the experience, exposure and meeting new people. Quest Diagnostics is a stepping stone, A place to learn and perfect your skills."
bad,"Another day in paradise. Great company to work for ,however, look out to be in full force of the workload---and plenty of patients,patients and more patients!!!!"
bad,"Quest needs better management, leadership, positive vibes, also needs more teamwork. Needs sense of direction, professionalism. Needs to train more also give everyone a chance to learn and get familiar with blood draws and processing, because if you don't get a chance to then you will never have the experience to advance."
bad,The position offered a dynamic work environment. I was encouraged to expand my knowledge base and provide input on all levels. The management team was quite diverse and many of them were extremely skilled at creating a team environment that promoted a healthy work setting.
bad,this company is a great place to work if they had better people managing it. its a lot of favoritism and prejudice going. the open door policy is bogus if you air grievances with HR they will tell the supervisor exactly what you said with repercussions
bad,It's a job. Not one that I would suggest to a young person looking for a career in the medical field. Not much advancement opportunity as a courier. Also not too many entry level laboratory jobs like most other companies.
bad,"very fast paced and very detailed blood collection pouring off and patient interactions, worked as a team member, fun working with others. I learned a lot at Quest which has made me be a better phlebotomist all around,"
bad,"None to offer, I do not wish to discuss my usual workday or anything related to this company, it has good and bad points like every other company,thank you"
bad,Quest Diagnostics drivers were at the bottom of the totem pole.  We were only given a 25 cents salary increase every year until a cap was put on depending what area you worked in.  Drivers couldn't call in sick half the time due to lack of floaters.  Management was not very good.
bad,Quest Diagnostics was in the middle of a merger with the old lab that was in place. I do not remember the name of the old lab but it was causing problems with the current employees. Also while I was working there they were sued and lost because they were not giving proper breaks to their employees.
bad,"It was just a job that I worked at. While I worked there, it was not the right fit for me, but I did my job efficiently and in a timely manner.  I would not go back."
bad,Ok place to work. long mandatory hours and strict rules made rhe jib quite boring but manageable.Im not sure if it was just the lication im working at but. It wasn't flexible.
bad,"Benefits are acceptable, pay scale is less than satisfactory."
bad,"a typical day at work same old stuff everyday no encouragement from management, when asked to move up time takes longer than expected no excitement or fun ."
bad,Not the best place to work (in the call center) but it was a job. Very entry-level. Supervisors had favorites which did not allow opportunity for other employees to be able to move up or participate in any extra functions
bad,I enjoyed my time when I first started working at Quest Diagnostics. After a while though management changed and staffing became a bit hostile. During this time management did little to correct the issues at hand.
bad,"Had the opportunity to experience many practices in the medical field.  I traveled to different doctors offices, and really enjoyed the family atmosphere provided"
bad,"Greet patients, answer phones, register and check in visits, and activate orders in the appropriate system based on requested testing and insurance coverage. Obtain blood specimens by performing venipunctures and fingersticks. Process samples using aseptic technique and prepare required paperwork for KCIM testing and reference lab testing. Floating, team /site leader, Able to perform the job at a proficient level even for moderately complex duties, Pediatric, geriatric draws, long-term care or mobile phlebotomy, Leads team members’ coaches and train others. Collect blood, process, scan specimens, and prepare them for testing, Enter patient’s information in Microsoft word Perform urine, hair and/or oral drug screen"
bad,"Used to be a good company, but due to new leadership, it is more"
bad,The manager is an obnoxious young girl who is very rude and condescending half the time she does not know what she is talking about they are constantly scheduling out of your designated area and pretending like it was a mistake but then kind of forcing you to do it anyways where you can be traveling far from your house. There is no continued education about your role with the company you just get random emails with rules or with a packet.  The only pro is that the schedule is flexible but con if you get on the bad side of the supervisor or your coordinator they can mess with your schedule and pretend like it was an accident causing you to miss out on jobs because your schedule is accessible by the them via computer.
bad,This is a great company to work for but the management is the worst I've ever seen. I've never seen so many good coworkers fired because the supervisor doesn't like them. It's like walking on eggshells because if you say of do the wrong thing it will be held against you. Some that had been with the company 5+ years let go for nonsense.
bad,Quest is your typical large corporation. Management isnt terrible but I have found that this is not a place where I see myself being long term. 
bad,A supv. in the phlebotomist dept (Pittsburgh) doesn’t have a clue no  communication supplies not always available Supv dresses in sweatshirt and jeans  employees would get sent home
bad,"I love drawing blood samples I am very good at it not once did I ever hear a customer say I hurt them or that the draw hurt , I think for me the hardest for me was that the expectations from my manager was unrealistic she demanded for me to know all with only less than a months worth of hands on I mostly was only let shadow and then was sent to a different clinic to work finally not ever shown around or introduced  or anything there was only one clinic I felt comfortable in and they treated me well ."
bad,"I enjoyed working with Quest many years,  the past few years it went from being people/patient based to business based.  I feel in healthcare it's not black and white and I don't feel pts received the best services."
bad,"The company pairs fair, but you work for what you’re getting paid. They don’t allow sick days or doctors notes. Days off are rarely approved for lack of coverage. There is t much room for growth, at least where I worked. They care more about who you know in the company, rather than what you know. Very poorly ran area."
bad,"* Call Center was very busy on the phones all day, no call was the same, lots of paperwork, requests for  medical notes,letters of medical  necessity and diagnosis code request from the doctors to get medical claims resubmitted to insurance.Correcting  patients name address and  insurance information."
bad,"After 14+ years and never really getting a chance to move up, I would like to find a company that give's hard workers a chance. Our supervisor is NEVER there at night with us.  We have favoritism that let's certain people disappear for long periods of time.  I enjoy the pay, that's bout it."
bad,"They put a lot of responsibility on the phlebotomist and expect to much out of them. The phlebotomist literally do everything! Management is harsh they just care about the bottom line wait times, patient volume, etc. They never approve days off for vacation or even to go to the doctor. A lot of stupid polices there."
bad,"Rude manager and EXTREMELY favoritism! A very inhuman, defile and utterly mean manager! "
bad,"As a former CSR in Valencia for many years I’d honestly tell you that people aren’t happy because of how they are treated by management. You will abide by the script, and over time you will become a zombie. You’ll take calls (and be listened to by a coworker/friend - and be rated) on how well you can agree to every demanding whim from the client. You’ll take calls from other zombies who relay the same script to you and become part of the system. You are not unique, you are a cog in this crazy system they keep glued together by telling you ‘need improvement ‘. Every day you’ll find yourself in a ‘Ground Hog Day’ movie scenario. When you look around, eventually you’ll see that your other co-workers have given up on finding anything else of meaning and are there only for the check. Day after day, week after week you’ll see and hear the same things including Quest propaganda telling you to give more, do more and continue doing what you are told. You’ll grow tired of the fakeness and either sell out or leave this depressing place. Your Directors have their favorites and will only promote them and this includes Managers as well. You’ll see this time and time again. Other than that, the pay is decent and medical insurance is provided but expensive. The regular people are good and will help you and become your friend fast. I sincerely love the people I worked with and consider myself fortunate to have met them."
bad,Sometimes they only care about the patients and forget about the employee. They don't listen to the employee when they ask for suggestion they do what they want .
bad,I haven't been employed their for years! When I was employed there is was great for me...Lots of patient's each day lots of busy work and the patients were great
bad,"Company is too large to pay attention to very important details. As a lab professional, I wonder about some of the policies and procedures. There is no real leadership.....just a lot of cooks in the kitchen. It can be tough to work in this environment. Very stressful"
bad,"If it were not for the long commute I would still be working at Quest Diagnostics.  I enjoyed working with the tax and Finance team.  Additionally, we had a great relationship with the PWC."
bad,This was a temporary position. The starting pay was good but the training was not. I ended up out on the route by myself before I was supposed to. I had several different trainers. I was getting the best training the evening the contract ended.
bad,Solid company and profitable business and continues to grow year after year making it one of  Forbes top 100 admirable company to work with which gains  lots of respect.
bad,When I first started we were very busy then we got and insurance taken away from us and we couldnt use it so then we got really slow. There wasnt anything hard about the job if everyone did their part but when you have people coming in and clocking in and then leaving for hours and management not doing anything about it then that was a problem
bad,"My client's reach out to me daily for assistance on drug test results, setting up accounts and/or research and investigating an issue.  They love the fact that I respond within seconds/minutes with resolution so that donor's can get back to work in a timely manner.  I love my job and love helping my clients with day to day matters and love to help keeps their business running smoothly."
bad,"Very slow paced. Management doesn't see your full potential, so there's a lack of advancement/promotion. Co-workers were nice, but very ""clique-y"" among the new people and the ""lifers""."
bad,"very under paid. it can better, ..................."
bad,Very high expectations of new trainees as well as productivity requirements for seasoned veterans causing extreme stress and possible issues with accurate patient results.  Ethical issues in my personal opinion.
bad,"Since ExamOne acquired Superior Mobile Medics in Nov 2015, the customer service level has gone significantly down. SMM was a great small company on its own, we didn't need ExamOne. The pay is almost offensive and the annual incentive is a joke, a few cents more a year when the job description intails so much more than answering phones. They want you to be the face of the company but pay you like you're fresh out of high school. My Supervisor is great, she does make you feel heard and important and looks out for the team. If they paid a bit more, no one would complain."
bad,"The place is ran like a sweat shop, all about production and numbers. The manger of processing watches people on camera and pretends to be all the good of company but is only to make himself look good. The supervisors are all lying puppets. I wouldn't recommend this as a long term place to work."
bad,"Nice company to work for, fast pace environment for advance career opportunity. Convient work schedule for college students"
bad,"Very repetitive and a very detailed company. I enjoyed the cafeteria that was on site and the culture. There was quite a bit if data entry involved and attention to details but personally, I feel it was a bad fit for me."
bad,"Cleanliness was lacking, the building was filthy.  Much petty gossiping among the employees.  Management was essentially ineffective."
bad,I have been working this company for long time and the most enjoyable part of the job was be able to work early hours and  had free parking space.
bad,The billing department works on a buddy system. The only way to move forward in this company is to befriend management outside of the office.
bad,"A typical day at work consist of blood draws. I learned to put patients at ease and deal with patients from all walks of life. I was an IOP (in-office phlebotomist), so I didn't have very much interaction with managment except by telephone and email. Management always make themselves accessible and send emails as to update employees on necessary information. Co-workers are very encouraging and great team players. We called on each other for help and just words of encouragment to start our day. The hardest part of this job, was having to answer to two people. Ex. I had a Quest supervisor as well as having to answer to the onsite supervisor to the clinic for which I was stationed. The most enjoyable part of the job was patient contact."
bad,Management for this company was bad on literally every level.
bad,"Management, Management, Management!!  Benefits are good, great overtime.  Work and life, no balance there.  No sense of values.  "
bad,"I was a floater phlebotomist. I traveled almost everyday to a different clinic to train new phlebotomist, open new clinic, or releave another phlebotomist. The highlight was co-writing a procedure and training manual for the clinics. I worked long hours but the job was very educational and my immediate supervisor was a great teacher."
bad,"Everyday was a different encounter you never new what to expect. I learned how to work in a enviroment where there were no limits in what you could do. Some management was excellent, coworkers were very friendly and cooperative. The hardest part was adopting to different changes in this SOP's on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the Company with excellent benefits."
bad,"data entry, verification of patient & test info, preparing specimens for testing"
bad,Quest is a good company with good benefits.I appreciated that. But when it comes to management it is very poor. this company is very diverse i couldn't complain about that. I wouldn't recommend this company due to poor leadership.I worked all over the San Francisco bay are all the way to the central valley.I also worked in Miami and my experience with management was the same. I spent 17yrs with QDX and i have no desire to return.
bad,"It is critical that management promote an environment where there is good communication between the team members and between teams. Upon hiring, I was told that everyone in the IT unit is a team player and that all the teams work well together. Wrong! I got caught between two managers having a turf battle. Lots of politics, lots of stress. Despite my concerns about not being provided training and documentation on the applications I was to support, my manager pretty much ignored me. Very shocking. I felt like I was tricked into getting hired. But it has been an important life lesson to me for future job interviews, to ask for concrete examples of how teamwork is nurtured and truly valued."
bad,It was very stressful due to not having management for over 4 months due to two supervisors left. What I did learned were medical terms and it was enjoyable cause we work as a team as a family even thought we didn't have no management.
bad,"My supervisor's words pretty much sum up our employment ""I don't know how much more of this I can take here. I feel sorry for you guys. I cant give you any more hours. They are making us do more cut backs and lay offs"""
bad,"My last position as a phlebotomist with the company was very disappointing after having experienced such positivity throughout other departments. I would not recommend being a phleb with Quest, however I would recommend other departments within the company."
bad,"I was working for Quest 19 years and I will never go back."
bad,Night shift needs a whole new professional team to manage employees. Sensitivity training is a must. They are not compliant to employees with few disabilities.
bad,"I opened the lab every day. A typical day would have 75-110 patients a day, me being the only full time phlebotomist. I enjoyed what my job was but the company was severely understaffed."
bad,"Quest does not care for their employees safety, they expect for you to work in clients offices & accept being treated bad. When you ask to be moved out of a unsafe environment they will tell you they have no place for you. It takes them forever to give you a raise & its only 5 cent plus they want you to collect their money when clearly there is nothing in a Phlebotomist job description that says bill collector. I would never work for them again."
bad,"Most typical day at lab is wit drawing blood to the patience. Also, sent their blood work to lab so it can be tested for any diagnostic given from doctor."
bad,"Always feel like family when I'm there, I've a lot of fun with my patients, missing that place."
bad,"Used to be an enjoyable place to work, now they are replacing senior employees with younger, cheaper employment."
bad,definitely not a place to work for everyone. Working with specimen and things that are just not for everyone. but pretty cool to see how it works. nice environment
bad,"Needs better management, expects way too much from employees."
good,It’s not that good of a company to work with.  They shuffle you all over town to cover someone else while they go eat. So basically you take turns driving around town to cover someone else’s lunch hour!    And they don’t cover gas within 13 miles town!
good,a typical day at work. very stressful. patients get shoved in your room depending on the supervisor you have. you have to stick 40 or more a day. the pay is no good for all the responsibility that is given.
good,"When hired as an independent contract numerous hours of mandatory training and testing is required, but there is no compensation for independent contractors, only per diem and benefited employee."
good,"I have nothing to say about Quest If you wanna work with them Great after so many year you will need to look for a new job, it was a great company until this year"
good,"I worked as a specimen processor overnight shift. I enjoyed the work although training was brief and poor. Management is rude, incompetent, and made up rules as they went along. If managers didn't like you (personality)..Fired!! Performance and attendence not considered. Overtime is plentiful. Mandatory overtime hours was constantly being changed. Not a place recommended for those with small children."
good,"Company host Appreciation parties, heavy workloads always occupied, learned to work with a large number of physicians"
good,"Everyone was unhappy to be there and hated you if you were happy. Don’t smile, don’t be a positive person and don’t look to advance and you’ll fit right in. They’ll halfway train you then say you’re making mistakes.  You’ll be on the 3rd shift, they’ll lie and say it’s just for “training.”  The people that enjoy no job advancement will micromanage you because they have been there over 20 years and want you to know it. Lol"
good,"The company works within favoritism, does not provide opportunity for growth or advancement. Training does not allow for phlebotomist the time to complete work on time."
good,"Provide exceptional patient care resulting in increased satisfaction and attendance to LabCorp laboratories."
good,You have to work hard to learn the different test and codes the Dr. order and be able to read their handwriting . Management dos not take kindly to your mistakes
good,"I had a great experience and loved my job. Until new management. Worked extremely hard and put my heart and soul into my work. Senior management was great, although a new director had a big ego and made a terrible decision. We called him out on his decision because it was negatively affecting our territories. He couldn't handle anyone telling him he made a mistake.  Instead, he reprimanded those who thought he made a poor choice."
good,"management was ok to work for, my co workers were wonderful to work with, the hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day"
good,i feel the phlebotomist is not treated that good we are told we are at the end of the pole in the company are raises are poor and we get no respect
good,"the site that i was located,people were promoted based on the fact if you were a favorite employee. . they would promote people based on whether or not they liked you, you would think that seniority would be a deciding factor if one was hired but in reality its not even considered. . one person got promoted twice in a year, while everyone else was given alibis as to why they did not receive a promotion."
good,Company is ok to work for. Don't expect to make much they would rather hire someone else to take over your position then to promote or compensate from within. Very sad.
good,Not sure why this is requested as I haven't worked there for over almost 15 years.Enjoyed my job but my position was eliminated and I was given only 2 weeks notice
good,My review of this company if there was always enough help there will be no room for any mistakes I've learned to learn from my mistakes work hard and the positive of working for this company always be happy and friendly with my employees and the patient
good,Working in Logistics dept will only ever be a job not a career. the equipment given to do the job is old and out of date. they talk about making changes but it always take a year or more for those changes to happen if ever. Pay is below avg 13-15 for most the drivers and they will try to low ball you. Company doesn't see logistic department as value adding only as expense to be gotten rid of. Only plus side if your full time is ok health care and time off if you can take it.
good,"I learn that you experience don't matter, what matter Is that you make the job easy for the supervisor going above in beyond just to keep your job, they is a lot of favoritism in this company here in Houston Tx.  No chance of advancement."
good,"N/A "
good,Trained there as a student. Low pay in VA compared to other states and hospital systems within the state. If you can find a different job and are willing to relocate I would recommend going somewhere else. They want you to work hard for minimal pay. USPS drivers make the same wage starting out as a tech with a bachelor's degree.
good,"Minimal training provided, long hours typical, hard to find daily support. The hardest part of the job is not receiving adequate training needed to perform all of your job functions"
good,"It was a good way to start off my career as a phlebotomist. Although the job was not a good fit for me, it really helped me learn about my job title and the function I would perform,"
good,I love my job and the different people I come into contact with but management has cut staff which in turn piles more work on the people who are still there and so its become very stressful.
good,"While overall this is a good company, it has some local management issues and has lost a lot due to centralization of some functions. Like a lot of corporations, it tries too hard to please shareholders at the expense of clients and employees."
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a fast pace company that allows you to learn however stunts your growth. This is based upon who you know not what you know. A high rate of favoritism in management. Those who have been long term and loyal are not valued."
good,Overall my experience with Quest a Diagnostics have been bitter sweet. I Love what I do and I love the relationships that have grown with my patients. My issue is Managment. They do not practice the core Values quest Diagnostics require! You tuck your tail and do what your told with no back talk. They alter hours in turn affects your pay! This is Not true for all management! Most definitely true for those I've deal with over the past year and a half.
good,The Comapany culture has changed tremendously in the last couple of years. Top performers have left for better opportunities. Not a bad place to start if you are desperate for a job but definitely not a place to plan a future.
good,"This position allows independent route service within a given territory."
good,enjoying working with people. I had alot of hands on experience with the patients
good,I learned what to fabricate dental appliances and work with drs' offices on a regular basis
good,Ability to work was jeopardized by the narrow or antagonistic mind of the higher management(female manager). Particularly Direct reporting supervisor was biased and more towards the development of the young female Techs. Above her the Operation Manager (OM) was a lady too. She was mentoring females for carrier development. I Wanted to share my knowledge of long carrier. OM removed all Ph.D's. supervisor/Director by creating false allegation because she has a simple B.S. degree. She felt inferiority complex. Every way she tried to crippled my ability to function quality work. Only thing I missed is my Techs who are very much eager to learn and wanted to progress.
good,"Management only worried about their numbers being on top of the area. Want you to lie on paper to make area supervisor look good. Area manger doesn’t care about anyone except herself and talks to you like a child and mean and nasty comments and when you explain to upper management, they blow it off .. place sucks and so does management.."
good,"Strong company, if NOT for the favoritism overall it was an ok company. Salary plays a HUGE part. When you work for a company for 25 year's you would THINK you would receive the proper salary, 10 cents a year is a slap in the face.  I have only stayed because of the benefits of the your lab work paid by the company."
good,It's an ok place to work pay is ok and the work/life balance is ok my co workers  there are great the opportunities for advancement are limited and management aren't much help in that department
good,Supervisors really do not know what they are doing . Training is a joke . You get no sick leave and they are unwilling to work with you . I should have left a long time ago !
good,Force employees to train new employees with out compensation. Management use position to intimidate their employees. Good company horrible management.
good,I come to work & help sort specimens to be processed. I managed the employees processing the specimens to insure that this is done in timely manner. The culture is so so. Everyone is pretty much on individual production so there's really not a team environment.
good,"preferential treatment is given to certain cultures. It is not an equal oppertunity employer. it is more who you know, college degree don't mean anything."
good,"this company. they use you and abuse, put stress on employees to the point that they quit or go on stress leave. cause the phlebs behave like robots and the quality of  patient care to meet the companies time frames (phleb should only have to spend 7 to 15minutes wit a patient according to Quest)"
good,I come to work to be able to take care of my family. I don't have anything to really say about the company or my work experience. I'm currently looking for a new job that's stress free.
good,It's a decent company but not for everyone.  The environment if fairly rigid and is built around one core line of business.  It is very difficult to function in other lines of business.
good,TYpical work day includes servicing a minimum of 30pts in a work day. very fast paced. can become stressful on busy days. management varies for different areas. you have to love what you do in order to enjoy your day. coworkers can become like family which helps make things easier.
good,When I first got there it seemed like a real nice company in the work for until you started realizing that they are racism going on on the low there they have two different sets of people that worked it's like a black person to Filipinos the Filipinos say great in their own groups talk about you to the management which is also Filipino behind your back in their language so he make you feel out of place and a comfortable working there
good,"You are just a robot. They do not care about their employees at all. You will learn medical terms and will gain some medical knowledge from talking to clients. Everything is monitored how long you go to the bathroom, breaks, talk time, ideal time, everyting. Big brother/1984 is watching you. You are paid 11/hr. For the type of work you are doing it is highly underpaid. "
good,"Really good place to work and get experience but defiantly not a place you wanna stay longer than 1 year. Staff is amazing but manager has a lot of family members who work for this company and there is a lot of favoritism, making it hard for you to advance your carrier."
good,"Could be a great place to work, but supervisors are petty and tyrannical, and management and HR have no interest disciplining them as long as they keep cutting costs; many cost cutting ideas are detrimental to employees, and some are harming customer relations"
good,"Over worked, under paid for the skills that I have. Management and higher ups only concern with the bottom line(numbers) not how short staffed the psc is. Phlebotomy, patient ratio ridiculous. Pay not that great."
good,"Work is there to do some of the people are really cool "
good,"Company with good benefits. Very little job security, constantly restructuring and cutting personnel.  Hard to balance personal life with the work"
good,A typical day at work consists of assisting my team in processing all requisitions so that the results can be released to both the provider and the patient in a timely and successful manner.
good,"poor management good company in general. Would defiantly work for quest again under different management. Manager was extremely rude and turn over rate at VFU was enormously high. Manager didn't seem to appreciate employees hard work, Rules changed at manger convince."
good,"Verbally report laboratory results to clients."
good,Overall great company with too many problems internally.  Learning constantly and upgrading clients was always a challenge.
good,"As a floater, there is no consistency with the scheduling. You are subject to work at 2-3 places a day. You hardly ever work near your home or home base patient service center, always 20-40 miles from home, when they have coverage in your area (unnecessary commuting)they dictate what you can, and can't do in your vehicle."
good,There is a definite culture of bias and harrassment. Work advancement is very difficult to achieve.
good,"You can do nothing but work, they aren’t understanding of life, your just a slave. Don’t need time off... it’s not an option, pay is decent, but please look around"
good,Training is a week or less on companies you have to learn. You are not educated what words meanings are you are supposed to read the script so it make you look stupid. Breaks are 15 minutes twice a day but if you go to the bathroom it counts against it. Robot yes.. you must like what you do to succeed. 70 percent of people are rude. Overtime when they decide each week .
good,"I currently work here, it pays well than most labs. Management however could care less about one's well being. Its truly just a business and if they have to work you to the bone, they will. Its become quite stressful and disappointing to work for this company. Hence, looking for a new opportunity elsewhere."
good,"Not all Supervisors at Quest are supportive to Staff. They have high expectations, but when staffing is low or short, most of the Supervisors are not willing to work with the Employees."
good,I think quest has great benefits- but I watched over the years that the older phlebotomists were laid off  and younger (less expensive) employees were hired. I wanted to stay at Quest and it did not happen.
good,The pay was not the best at Quest. Quest pays less than the other large labs in town.  In the Phlebotomy department you can hardly ever get to use your accrued time off because there were never enough floaters to provide coverage.
good,"I worked in the metropolitan area of Atlanta and my experience was  phenomenal, my supervisor was awesome!  I transferred  to a small town in Florida and the entire experience was horrible.  Management was messy, showed favoritism.  Very discriminator."
good,Apply if your are interested. You can have the opportunity to grow in your profession.  Learning and the availability to travel and grow.  A nice place to work.
good,This is a lab that forces patients to pay before billing their insurance. Always getting yelled at by patients that understandably want insurance billed. Staff get in trouble if don't  get payment.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the patients and my co workers helping each other out team work and learning new and different things.
good,"Quest is  a good place to work. . "
good,"Typical day includes processing samples, and making sure the orders and names (and other important information) match the requisition.  Must always be working.  A typical day is usually busy so there is always something to do during a work day.  There is mandatory overtime, depending on how busy the day is.  Must meet productive quota; not meeting it means possible consequences, such as write-up or no pay raise.  Management leaves much to be desired. Coworkers are pretty friendly."
good,"Quest can be a great company to work for with good benefits. The only short coming I have with quest is your supervisor if you get a supervisor that doesn't care for you, although you are a great asset to the company and your department then you are in trouble because he/she can become bias by not allowing you to move forward by not giving you raising and transfers to other departments. How they do that is finding and digging petty errors on you."
good,"a typical day, very stressful, fast pace, must be on your toes at all times. everyday you learn something new, management always on top of you, hardest part of my job, no time to exhale very demanding. the most enjoyable part of my job. when I log out to get ready to go home."
good,"Very busy workplace with little help, work in a location by myself where I see 40-70 patients daily, only see manager once a month, management doesn't seem to support the employees."
good,"It’s a good place to get experience. The only good benefits is set hours and 401k plan. A couple discounts but, I’d rather not and ha Better pay. There are better places to work"
good,"The work is not hard it's just a lot of favoritism, long hours, under staffed, no understanding of family responsibilities. Pay was decent, but expected to work 12 or 13 hours every night."
good,"The company is solid and offer many benefits, but the culture is bad."
good,Stressful place to work for. You are expected to do a lot with out the proper tools. Regional management is old school in their approach to work life balance. They expect you to work a lot and don't compensate accordingly.
good,"working at quest was a experience working in the lab."
good,"This job has a varying schedule and you might not even stay at one location. the better you get the more they take you for granted. you will eventually end up becoming a ""floater"" and travel up and down Miami from location to location so be prepared."
good,"lacks proper management skills, hire rate is extremely high but so is the turn over, stressful and no accountability, managers need organization and people skills, unable to be objective, many have multiple jobs at different places and are not committed to this business"
good,"fun day at work, learn how done several different things at once. Management in my department a little different from other departments,never new what to expect from one day to the next. A great group of people very helpful. Short amount of training time. I looked forward to going to work."
good,Very repetitive and have to type word for word verbatim what applicants say could be difficult at times and only $11.09 an hour
good,"Working with specimens is fine, the people are great. However right when you think you'll be offered a higher position someone above strips that from you. There's too much drama here."
good,I've work for quest for about 2 years now and the only complaint I've had was pay. Very light work. The heaviest you would carry is about 50 lbs if your lucky. Routine pick ups. Same thing everyday unless you get on calls/will calls. Sacramento crew has great people to work with. Management is good. They don't really tell you much unless it's urgent or someone got in trouble.
good,"The company overall is okay. The pay is mediocre, people are okay some are helpful and others are not. You do have quite a bit of autonomy overall. Employees are not micro managed not because they don't want to but more because you are on the road and rarely around but when you around they look at you like you need to be doing something. So technically they don't want you to have too much free time. Some higher position employees are liars and will do that to get out of doing their work. Management plays favoritism in obvious ways and don't care to be fair. So my conclusion of this company is unless you like to be a scapegoat for your coworkers find something else and don't bother complaining because only a selected few gets to choose and be treated with fairness. Others are their to be taken advantage of. Good company but horrible management."
good,"The atmosphere at Quest Diagnostics is not one of advancement and growth.  The company on a whole is all about advancement.  However, for an individual to advance in their career, it is truly about who you know and not what you know.  The decision has to go all the way to the top to get recognize."
good,"Working for the company is very difficult to enjoy. workplace morale is low, overtime is mandatory, promises are constantly broken, and the promotions are nearly non existent.  Healthcare is fare however."
good,"The company itself is great to work for. However, management in every department lacks significantly. It's quite sad. It doesn't matter if you're the best employee they have, you will still be micromanaged, treated like dirt, and have your soul sucked out with each passing day."
good,"from the low pay and the lack of caring towards new employees, this place is only good if you have been there for ten years.if you dont like vacation time this is the place for you because they do it by seniority and when the average years of employment are 10 years don't expect to get any time off."
good,"Walk in and sit at a computer for 11 hrs. Regular routine everyday. "
good,My co-workers were the best to work with. They were hard workers enjoyed being with other coworker. Very knowledgeable about there job and willing to help others when needed.
good,Good company to work for been there for ten years would recommend anyone
good,"I have spend my day leading others and helping them meet their daily metric GOALS. There is no accountability for the front line workers. The hardest part of my job is the disorganization and lack of accountability. We moved into a brand new building and have stuffed boxes into a huge room and just left them there. We have built in cabinets to store thousands and thousands of files and loose leave forms and instead of taking 8 hours to file them away, we spend hours daily trying to locate documents, "
good,Very fast pace. I learned to test samples. management was not fair at all. Co- workers did not come to work. Hardest part of the job as working extensive overtime due to employee call-ins. The most enjoyable part was the fast pace.
good,Management acts like kids. They have their certain picks of employees that they want to treat with respect. Certain people can do what they want if you are in their circle.
good,Learned a lot of Account Receivable and Medical billing. Co-workers were a pleasure but management is not to be trusted and could not always answer questions.
good,"A typical day at work would be opening and closing a PSC office daily. I would work a seven hour shift servicing outpatients by schedule or walk-ins. The services would include answering phones, faxes, venipuncture, drug-screens, and health screenings along with the responsibility of accurately registering and processing patient information and bloodwork. In my position I meet a variety of personalities so I always learn how to use proper customer service even in the most hardest situations. I also learn and are introduced to new testing and techniques. At my location, I am the only worker so most of my communication and interaction with co-workers are over the phone. The hardest part of my job is management. There is no leadership or flexibility. The most enjoyable part of my job is the patients. My patients remind me why I enjoy what I do. I enjoy seeing their smiles and hearing their life stories. I enjoy making them feel at ease in one of the most uncomfortable situations they may experience."
good,Good place to learn. Very busy environment. Most co-workers speak to each other with their native language. Management area need to be improved.
good,"Drivers on a typical day check in at dispatch , prepare vehicle with needed supplies and go on regular routes."
good,overall decent plave to work a good learning experience . in regards to advancement and managment very limited and narrow minded . the work load is tolerable and very routine but expectations way too high . hardest part of the job was finding the middle ground to please managment they made u feel ur job was up for grabs at any moment. best part of the job was getting a chance to work with some great new co workers and make a few vauluable friendships.
good,Conference calls throughout the day.
good,"Good management, friendly staff, but its a temporary staffing agency. Work was not as consistent as I needed."
good,"I believe having more Constructive Meetings with Employees would not only benefit us as an Employee, but it would help this"
good,No comment. I have worked here for the last 7years. The first few was great but the longer I'm here that culture has changed and the business isnt about the patient any longer
good,Job is okay. Training is rushed. Too much for too little and rarely have pay increases. Always told one thing and another thing happened. Asked off for time off 7 months in advance only to have it denied the week of. This reflects poor management.
good,"overall great company with job security"
good,"Since the change in management, everything is about the bottom dollar for the CEO and shareholders."
good,"Get blamed for things you have no control over, unrealistic expectations. Short staffed not having enough supplies: needles. Giving a hard time when trying to take off or need flexibility due to being a single parent or child emergencies. Horrible management. When asking for help they take it as you can’t handle your job. Complaining about overtime and asked why you did this extra hours when they fail to realize it’s due to short staff and trying to be a robot and trying to reach these unrealistic goals without error. Not just being a phlebotomists but doing billing etc.."
good,"When I worked ans interviewed for the Quest in Jerset it was amazing, and working there was amazing. Employees and bosses all around a wonderful experience and I got paid a decent amount. After my father passed and I had to move to Florida, the interview was over the phone. I was told i was getting a site lead position. So i made arrangements to move down. I was driving, and my kids were flying. The day before my kids were leaving I was told i had to take a pay decrease and 2 levels decrease and no longer have the site lead position. Or wait for another position. That wasn't an option for me because my kids were leaving. When I got there to start working the site lead was awful, she didn't know how to run a site and the supervisor wasn't better. I was the only white person and was bullied and contacted HR when I was attacked and almost hit by an employee and nothing happened. So i switched companies. I wouldn't recommend the plantation fl site but over all quest isn't that bad."
good,"it was a great company but once management got switched out it was a down hill from there. Making employees work 6 days, making the productivity higher when your already burnt out from the 6 days you are already working, They just want you to get the work done. It wasn't like that when I first started but all good things come to a end."
good,"Unless your a lab tech they don’t care about you or how long you’ve been there. Lots of kissing up, favoritism, just wrong, i am so glad to not be apart of this company anymore"
good,"No challenges with work and no competitive salary. No advancements or raises worth working for this company! If you are an MT it's not worth it, working for Quest is for mlts, preferably fresh out of school with no motivation to continue their education!!!"
good,In the beginning when I 1st started it’s was a good but over the years it seems to become less care and  less human relations to basically a numbers game .... Lack of communication on management.... lack of growth within the company...
good,"I worked for this company through a staffing agency, so I only knew a little bit of their procedures and practices.  I would not mind working for Quest, directly; however not in the North Pinellas region.  The upper management there is horrible, and not helpful or friendly AT ALL!"
good,Quest has poor management of their employees and their recent bid to save money keeps employees from advancing including those who have been certified.
good,"When I started at this company I was told there was opportunity for advancement I was there almost four years received all types of recognition never did advance, when I asked they would give me 25 cent here 15 cent there. I worked my vacations days off worked other sites hardly ever got a full lunch didn't get off on time worked short never appreciated. There was a lady that made it there for a year without transportation late maybe 6 times in the whole year never over 15mins. When she asked for a Phlebotomy II position they went back and pulled up tardy that was over 6months old."
good,"If you have a medical or technical background (direct), you have a chance in this environment.  If you are Logistics, Materials or Client Services (indirect), you might want to rethink working here. It was an okay work site until I connected with some of the other departments--big mistake.  "
good,"Pros:  Good pay, nice work environment, hardworking people, and decent benefits. "
good,"Poor Management, Not employee or patient oriented, too worried about the competition rather than customers that employees in my position are the face of the company"
good,"A typical work day involves simply answer calls and emails from patients as they come in. I did not necessarily learn my communication skills from Quest, but my time here has certainly increased them. The workplace was fairly relaxed, not particularly stressful. Unless you received a call from a very irate patient, which is the hardest part of the job."
good,"its average - alot of work and deadlines but not enough resources to complete the projects and meet deadline goals.   "
good,"No exp necessary if you want to advance, just learn how to keep your mouth shut about bad things like they do not exist.  Mgmt are not team players!  You better be a team player, but support from them is non existent."
good,"I have been disappointed about not feeling involved enough in what is happening at Quest. I have been asked to use my experience to see and help troubleshoot problems, but then when I point out what I see it is ignored, There is very much a culture of me, me, me there."
good,"I don't get to work very often being a greeter, but working events are fun. Events are normally at 6am, living so far from the events (at least two hours) is a little challenge."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the company. The only downside to the company is that the is very little opportunity for advancement if you are not in a major hub area such as St. Louis, Atlanta,Chicago, etc."
good,Management is lame and controlling. They have become so over structured it takes the fun out of sales since so much of your time needs to be logging information.
good,This job is not cut out for everyone. The work environment was not always compatible with the personal life. The hours varied greatly and were based on each contract for the people looking for life insurance.
good,"At one Quest site in particular, located in LA. Management is less than acceptable. deceit, dishonesty and back stabbing behaviors are frequently displayed and aimed towards the employee's who are professional and loyal to the company. Management holds loyal employee's responsible for any mishaps that occur. Some employees' are held accountable for job duties that were never taught or shown by supervisors or micro management such as: Leads."
good,"Anywhere from 60-400 patients a day depending on location, work phlebotomist hard without proper breaks, could not keep a supervisor no more than a year, too many changes ending bad, some so-workers would not do their fair share of work, stressful. I've worked with a few great people who taught me more than school, have learned how to manage my 8 hour day by working hard and fast without mistakes."
good,"The company overall is not to bad. The management is what makes the job good or bad. As an ""In-Office Phlebotomist"" we spend more time with the clients than with our supervisors or coworkers. Yet you are constantly reminded that you don't work for the client. A bad boss makes this difficult, as the client usually shows you more appreciation than the company you work for. There is no recognition for the job and your raises are based on a review performed by a supervisor that you may see once a quarter. The pay is pretty good, the employee stock purchase is a plus, but is still lacking. There is a company match for your 401K which is really good, but the health benefits aren't that impressive. Unless you opt to take the company insurance you don't get any types of discounts on lab work or any other services the company provides, so in theory you are just another number. Don't expect any type of personal touches to anything, and don't expect much advancement, because they are not there either."
good,"This was a Stressful place to work unless You were a Relative of Management. Workload heavy while others did not want to do their job. Felt like You could not talk to Supervisor about it, that nothing would be done."
good,"needs to improve hiring the right kind of employees. Employees are constantly fighting and do not come in on time and do not meet the standards that set for them."
good,"My experience hasn't been the best. I've experience poor management, retaliation, HR isn't there for their employees, tuition for school comes with conditional hidden expectations, over worked and under paid, expected to go the extra mile and stay later than schedule shift but wants you to burn over time and the list could go on."
good,"A typical work day would be grind until the shift is done. I learned that there is no loyalty in being a company man at Quest Diagnostics. Upper management not so great. My direct management overall was a great manager. I worked independently so I didn't really get much of a opportunity to reap the benefits of the culture.  However, in passing people very nice and cordial.  My hardest part of my job was being a contractor for 3 years."
good,This company look marvelous to work for on the outside but completely different than whatbit appeara to be... No room for advancement.. underpaid ... its a great job kus to gain experience from.
good,Good Company. Needs more pay and benefits for hard working employees. Company does not provide a lot of benefits. They make you work more and not give you a pat on your back. Does not have a lot of possible training to move up.
good,Working at Quest Diagnostics is okay....just avoid the call centers. Call center stress can wear on you. Many of the supervisors go on sick leave...a lot of people abuse FMLA benefits and the attendance policy is ridiculous.
good,"I've worked with this company for many years and under 5 different supervisors. Each supervisor was had their quirks, however only one of five had a handle on the basic functions of the position."
good,i was laid off due to economy. I was looking forward to being promoted because I received several awards for outstanding performances. It was very fast paced and I always was focused/determined to my job.
good,Greatful for the  experience and knowledge.. I had the opportunity to work in different departments and gain knowledge of the work and importance of making a difference in the company.
good,"wonderful pay and benefits unfortunately cannot say the same for most employees or management. However, if you are employed with the company staying to yourself is a must to survive here."
good,Great job needed more hours. The supervisor for my division was good hard to get a hold of at times but over all came to the site often an employees were older but still need more professional skills I fell but great company. Love drawing blood so to be able to do it every day was a pleasure.
good,"I learned how to order labs, process them, and had plenty of practice drawing and getting my anchor down. I also helped get my clinic in the blue with wait times and patient satisfaction. When I  miss a stick that's what I find the hardest, I'm very hard on myself. When I make my patients day."
good,Learned and performed a large variety of tasks in a high stress environment. Performed venipunctures on patients of all ages. entered all patient demographics and Dr. ordered information into Care 360. All done in a timely fashion.
good,This part of the Quest family of companies is poorly managed and overly cost conscious.  Their operating procedures makes an otherwise fun job overly administrative.  The website is poorly designed.  The work scheduling process is convoluted and poorly applied.  The best part of the job is the actual work and patients...both great.
good,"If your a Senior and wanting to supplement your income, this is not the place for you.  When you ask a question and get the ""eye roll"" like your supposed to know the answer, that's not for me.  All the employees are not treated equally, and I noticed that they are not told all the same information."
good,"They pay pretty good for the work you do. Never know what time you're getting off of work for the day, cannot go to Monday through Friday until 5 years"
good,I love Quest Diagnostics but the sabotage that goes on to get in a higher position is ridiculous. I wish I would have known before.
good,"Answering inbound calls and inbound emails from exam offices nationwide, lab customers, underwriters and insurance agents. Checking the status of lab results for clients and underwriters for life insurance policies. Answering and sending responses via right fax and manual fax. Scheduling appointments for labs, Requesting sensitive labs to be released. Follow ups on lab requests. Coding labs to life insurance companies."
good,"Good pay that's about it. They tell you there's overtime, but not required overtime. Excessive overtime. Leaves no time for a life or family"
good,"Great company if you can get a good manager. Some employees went above and beyond with little to no recognition, while others who were lazy employees advanced."
good,"Used to be a great place to work, however in the past few years it has become a very stressful environment with very little job security. Quest has gone through 3 major Reorgs in the past 5 years. They have also outsourced the majority of their IT infrastructure and technical support to both domestic and international companies."
good,At one time Quest had been a great place to work. I was part of a great team. We respected and supported each other. When the decision was made to outsource the IT team things became stressful and morale continued to deteriorate over a period of approximately one year until the entire team was let go.
good,"Productive and fun workplace.  Co-Workers were great to work with and team environment.  Great location in Addison, TX."
good,"typical day was about 20 calls"
good,"Managerial skills are lacking from all leadership personnel, no room for career advancement and poor staff appreciation. Staff is overworked with small raise incentives."
good,"great place to work"
good,"A typical day at work includes arriving at work on time, Greeting my coworkers and updating myself on the current work that needs to be completed. The hardest part of my Job would be the 3rd shift hours. Management tends to be very helpful with any questions our team may have."
good,Good people to work with but management is harder to work with.
good,Very Long hours...You can not leave until the work is done.  This is a very informative job.  You learn about any medical test ever created which in turns help you take care of your own health and those of your family.
good,"I started with Quest Diagnostics as a Phlebotomist through a Temp Agency called All Medical. I enjoyed my work but found  that the management wasn't very good. When we all had concerns or questions, our manager was Missing in Action. We got new management and we were not treated fairly. I learned a lot about how to process specimens, lot's of hands on experience I would have never received if I had worked elsewhere. The hardest part of my job was when I was placed at a one person laboratory. There was no back up in the event of an emergency and I had  2 emergency situations. The most enjoyable part of my job was the patients. I also enjoyed the team I was privelaged to work with."
good,"Not very professional, I am very disappointed in the professionalism in the company. I wish there was more team moral"
good,Now with a completely outsourced IT staff there's not more to be said. It was a great company to work for with the exception of a few managers.
good,"This job I currently have is a great place to start work. There is no room for advancement however. I am Part time and do not foresee any options for full time coming soon. Management is very understanding and flexible, seeing as how I have two young children. However, there is little to no discipline for certain employees and more for others. this bothers me ,coming from a military career where everyone is treated equally. Overall Quest Diagnostics is a wonderful place to start but not a wonderful place to stay."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is coaching and mentoring a diversified team of sales representatives. Day to day activities include strategizing for growth and retention of new and already existing business, working a diversified portfolio of tests, visiting clients and handling client issues, etc."
good,Learned great people skills
good,"started at 7am phone on then tell 9am answered phones, then took care cars then ordered supplies for psc and uniforms for drivers. co workers were great management always made feel important filling inf for driver that caklled in sick after been there eight hrs makinjg friends we wre togather eighteen yrs"
good,very busy but fun! very high paced and a lot of clean up work. They could benefit from hiring telecom personnel as permanent.
good,The pay raises are very small. The cytology department supervisor would talk in clicks with other management personnel.
good,The management is a joke. Employees are treated like children. Completely understaffed. The company hires phlebotomists with “years” of experience that have no clue what they are doing. No complaints about coworkers. Everybody helps the other one out. Only problem is with management. Job is very fast paced. Pay rate is NOT high enough.
good,"You are just a number do to corporate setting ...mo matter how hard you work, they keep adding more responsibilities on the phlebotomist , such as collecting balances, collecting at time of service, manifesting specimens"
good,On most days the job is very repetition. I've learned to be very patient over the years. Managenent needs improving. Employees are ok. Duties are easy to adapt.
good,"I learned a lot of sales experience at Quest- sales forecasting, growing accounts, etc.  I was fast paced but I enjoyed my clients and team. Management changed and I decided to leave."
good,I found that they don’t value creative and strategic thinking. The management tend to be lifers who started at Quest right out of high school or college and do not have broad work experience or market knowledge. It’s very conservative and conformist. If you’re seen as an innovator they see that as disruption and quickly shut you down. I outperformed for my role and my division but the manager above me toook it as a threat.
good,Zero life balance. Looking to axe anyone over 50. Reducing benefits to the point where I will be paying them. Expectation is to always be available. Just did away with vacations.
good,"the culture at Quest Diagnostics call center is still growing. if you're going in to be a frontline agent, it's a standard job. however, as you start to advance, it becomes more and more concerning. Managers and directors are only concerned with saving their jobs and not actually improving anything. everything is very knee-jerk instead of being proactive."
good,"very political and fragmented"
good,Over worked not enough pay for what you so. Not equally treated.  The phlebotomiat is not treated the same as the techs.¿¿????? ¿?????????????????????
good,"Work-life balance is rough. Production based contracts and understaffing force the company to require heavy overtime. Benefits at job are nice. Advancement within company is possible, but most positions are held by long term employees with over 20 years experience."
good,Manager was trying to push me to retire after 22 years. Kept moving me around from psc's very unhappy with the manager. Send a letter to HR don't know if anything was ever done about it. But I send it after I quit just trying to help some of the other employees lot of favoritism still having problems hiring someone that can be Dependable which she never appreciate my job that I never quit or had complaints from the doctors I just got tired of her Corpus Christi area.
good,"They have no backbone when it comes to attendance.  They work the people who do come to work to death.  I do not feel I am an asset to the company."
good,"The quality of the lab results are the best available in the commercial laboratory business. However, internally the company severely lacks in leadership. Not to say its completely absent, but many of the low "
good,"What I learned is that if you are interested in learning and growing within the department, it's available as long as you work hard. But if you want to venture out into a different department, it's the most difficult experience I've had in years."
good,"I would normally start at 10 am, would either start on the technical area or go to processing area and run the CV 2000 automated alliquot machine. I learned how to do extractions on the technical area as well as how to operate the CV 2000 machine as well as learn how  to reagents. Management worked poorly in terms of being fair to their employees as well as implemented their politics into their decision making. The workplace culture was very divided among  employees due to forming their own cliques and if not part of that clique would be considered an outcasts and fall out of favor with them including management if they are favored by them. The hardest part of the job is to be able to multitask and do several loads at the same time or put them in order of priority. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we get to go home knowing that we did our best at what we do."
good,"long training process "
good,"The job can be stressful and sometimes overwhelming, I learned most people can be very mean when it comes to giving out there medical history even it's for their own benefit"
good,the people that i worked with when i worked there were absolutely great and alot of fun but that was when it was located at Demonbreun and then bought out by another company
good,I really didn't feel right th ere. I was used to hardware maintenance and I wasn't allowed to actually repair any equipment. I had to merely report and a contractor would do the work.
good,"es una buena empresa, se aprende mucho y se desarrolla el sentido de la urgencia y una alta responsabilidad, ademas de practicar mucho el ingles, pero las direcciones en mexico no estan alineadas a una cultura laboral en donde se conserven a los buenos elementos."
good,I enjoy working at Quest Diagnostics. What I enjoy the most is the patient contact. Everyday is never the same and that is another reason why I enjoy working for Quest Diagnostics.
good,it was ok until your boss tells you  can do this then his boss comes to visit and see me doing something and didn't like it and my boss acted like he didn't tell me I could do that not cool.
good,"Quest was a wonderful place to work. The staff was always helpful and worked together as a team. Very fast pace. We would all take turns doing different jobs. Front desk data entry, processing, blood draws. I worked at a few of the locations. Watertown, Waterbury, Prospect, Cheshire, Hamden. But my favorite location was in a doctors office. OB/GYN. I loved working with the doctors and staff. I was the only phlebotomist that worked for this office. I did all aspects of phlebotomy. Entered patient information and tests to be performed, drew blood, prepared specimens, ordered supplies, etc. The only reason I left Quest was because the doctors office switched laboratories."
good,Quest is a good place to work. It is a casual office and could listen to music or books. They do have mandatory overtime days for 3 days a week up to 3 hours per day.
good,"Quest Diagnostics has been a great place to work over the past years for various reasons.Compensation,health,dental &vision insurance and 401k optionsare just a few reasons I've enjoyed working for this company.However, My work hours do not allow me the time I need for a balanced life style so I am choosing to part ways for that reason."
good,"Quest Diagnostics could be a Great place to work based upon the Principals outlined on their Hand Book. Unfortunately their are too may people in middle management that don't adhere to said principals. Some (not all) treat their work environment like a ""Reality Series or Soap Opera"" Fortunately, their are enough associates in support roles (though often overlooked), that hold themselves to a higher standard and ride out their work day just trying to keep their"
good,Management sucks. Doesn’t care about life outside of work. Rather you work more hours than take care of personal everyday life tasks. They rather you choose work over your kids.
good,"Understaffed. Usually, you have to do the work of multiple people. They underpay you for the amount of work that you do. Company only matter is to get money."
good,Hard place to work as they are very fast pace and do not give much customer service to their patients. Employees seem to be very rude and blunt and do not give great pt. care. no growth.
good,I wish they made more advancements for the employees that have been working for the company for a long period of time rather than hire form the out side.
good,"Great place to get started.  Chemist are not valued, nor is your opinion or scientific judgement often respected.  High-output lab that runs 24/7.  Great shifts available for early birds."
good,Busy work schedules !
good,never enough people to fill the void management only cared about deadline and not the employees. work was uneven and taxing. they cared very little about their employees.
good,"Things were great there before the new CEO arrived, then there has been a great focus on efficiency and productivity. Now everything you do is counted and measured against other workers. Fear is instilled in the workers to perform better and faster. The wheel turns and there is no end.  Sometimes 6 days a week with no overtime, they call it flexing your time. 401k and Stock Purchase Plan are still good, but the health insurance is a little expensive."
good,"It's job security, multi racial diverse which is good, management, depends on who you know, as long as you stay out of management radar your okay, there's no quality of life, balance between family does not exist, but healthcare insurance is super, so all in all it's a trap."
good,i had been there for years and when a permanent position came up a full employee had their daughter hired whom had no experience what so ever.I felt that was unfair
good,This is a self-trained job with very little management. It is very fast paced.  They open at 5 am every Saturday which leaves employees very little rest.
good,"Very unprofessional, a lot of favoritism, condescending. Huge turnover rate on this shift.  Coworker are somewhat friendly but the enthusiasm has been lost.  It is very difficult to get excited about anything as a team because of our leader."
good,"Heavy patient load, not enough staff. diverse patient load. A lot of mental health patients. As with any other company, there are wonderful patients and those that can be difficult. Co-worker all get along just fine."
good,"Never had the opportunity to work on different kind of equipment. So many promises made about training but non fulfilled. I felt disappointed with management because they never seem to be encouraging. It is the dream of every technician to face new challenges everyday for it helps them to grow, but I was not given that opportunity, company had very few equipment and contracted them with a vendor and so I was not allowed to spend more than 20 minutes working on something. Co-workers were great and very supportive. Hardest part of the job was just sitting around doing nothing for several hours. Most enjoyable part of the job was when doing some repairs and had to do research."
good,management is a lil to overwhelming and would rather blame drivers instead of leads who should manage their drivers.Great place 4 older employees who just need a jump in income
good,The company is stable and strives to create an environment where employees can be successful.  They invest in employee development and seek to promote from within.
good,"A good company to work for overall.  Good, mostly helpful employees.  Very demanding supervisors and managers, who did not quite understand the difficulty of our jobs, but would always expect miracles.  Constant mandatory overtime, including intimidating employees to work overtime or face disciplinary action.  Not understanding that us, employees, have a life other than Quest Diagnostics.  Very little salary increase over the life of my employment, actually laughable."
good,love the people i work with but it's quite a tedious job. plenty of work to go around for everyone. but management needs a lot of improvement. too much favoritism going around.
good,"Very High collection volume you meet great people all day friendly and helpful co-workers. I learned a lot working for Quest Diagnostics the computer systems that they have are wonderful and informative to help accurately collect and process specimens. Although Management may have friendly and even helpful personality traits, It can make or break your experience as an employee. To be honest there really wasn't anything hard about  the it. The Most Enjoyable part of the Job for me would have to be the veni-puncture collection. I love putting patients at ease and hearing them say I didn't even feel that, this really makes my day because I want to assure them that I am concern with there well being and overall health."
good,"The management is questionable, and compensation is not based on work performance, but rather relationships. The hardest part of the job is being overworked and not compensated very well for it."
good,"Everyday is filled with a new rule or changing a way we perform a certain job function. I have learned a lot about the way a company transitions to a corporation. I did improve my typing skills, knowledge of Microsoft Office and communication skills."
good,"I would take calls from Doctors, Nurse or Patients. I have learned to take lead when a company makes rules alone the way. I have learned that I could not trust management there. A lot of co-workers quit. The hardest part was dealing with the director, manager, and supervisor. I enjoyed working with the clients."
good,Good place to work. Just need a career change. Good management. Good job for someone who likes to keep busy. Very fast paced work environment. Tight knit working environment.
good,"A typical day at work consist of maybe 25- 30 patients sometimes more, I work at a 1 person PSC, so Im performing all the duties. I've learned time managment, patience, and to not rush. I make sure that my patients leave on a very positive note."
good,"Good company.  Great benefits and learned so much.  Able to gain a great deal of experience working with many types of patients.  Geriatrics, neonates, infants, adults.  Quest gives proper training on dealing with patients, needles, proper disposal, and processing"
good,Quest is a good company for laboratory professionals with many locations across the United States.  It is a production driven environment to service the 24 hour demands of the healthcare industry.
good,Overnight and Ok job. Lots of overtime. Mostly sitting.  The pay is  pretty I guess.
good,"The night shift is horrible especially the night manager donna, shes unprofessional and like to create problems among employees. She doesnt know how to do her job, she needs to be replace. And I find higher up managers getting involve in stupid childish tthings. If they replace second and third shift managers the place will be a great place to work."
good,Reviewed department errors in daily company meeting. Pulled daily/monthly/yearly reports to see standing to date. Set up tapes for monitoring reps. Assigned reps to work special functions. Reviewed errors daily and emailed to reps. Called undelivered critical results to clients from previous day. Listed and graded monitored calls for staff of 25. Responded to email communications from other departments. Entered special instructions for priority accounts.
good,The job itself was a multi-tasking job where the day went by fast. There is always something different to do or learn each day. The only complaint was that we did way more than what we were paid for.
good,"Stressful work environments on a day to day basis.  Not many breaks expect for a 30 mins lunch if you got all of the thirty minutes that were supposed to be given.   Lack in management and supervision leads to sloppy work stations and lack of good patient flow.  Coworkers are sometimes good to work with, but technically work by yourself in all areas of the lab and processing."
good,"I answer incoming calls from doctor's offices, clinics and hospitals requesting lab results for patients. Management and co-workers are ok to work with. The hardest part of the job is making a calls per hour quota. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping patients with questions."
good,quest was once a place to work for but it is now more about the money than the actual patient care. it has become very very corprate and cold.
good,"Worked here more than 6 yrs, Really good company, good benefits, paid time off."
good,"I liked working for freedom, but the companys vice president does not know how to talk respectfully to the employees."
good,"Not enough money for the amount of work you have to do..."
good,"working experience is mixed. A typical day is a very busy night shift."
good,Experience here can totally depend on lab you are working in. Right now labs are short handed and OT is not mandatory but pushed VERY hard onto employees.
good,"While working for the company, my typical day was data entry of patient payments made from the outpatient centers. My co-workers were all wonderful people to work with."
good,Okay place to start out in the lab field. Awesome insurance and retirement. Working environment is high pressure and is very overloaded at times
good,This organization is well organized.
good,"Fast paced, I enjoyed doing what I was doing. No doubt in my mind that if I could land another position just like this one, I would take it in a matter of seconds. However, the hardest part of the job was getting everyone to see each other eye to eye because of poor management. Other than that, it was a laid back job."
good,"Very interesting work. On-the-job training is second to none.  Fast paced and stressful work load.  Employees and Management are very ""cliquish"" and can be very unfriendly when they chose to be. Management style is to pit employees against each other. Most positions work on graveyard shift."
good,I loved working for Quest Diagnostics. I've learned a lot through the years and have met some really great people along the way. My regular patients that I see weekly or once a month have become a huge part of my life. I look forward to seeing them and celebrate when health is good or support them when health declines.
good,Mandatory overtime. Work life balance was non existent. They treated u like an animal. There were lots of people who had issues who were walking there.
good,Do not want to answer this question. I do not want to leave a review for this company for I feel it irrelevant to any thing I am trying to do with looking for other employment from here on out.
good,Working there is fun you make lots of friends. The work just wasnt for me. They dont train very well so they kind of just throw you into it. The greatest  part of the job was the elderly people who were so nice and caring. The worst was being yelled at most of the day by the people decling the services
good,I learned a lot from Quest Diagnostics as a processor there and made me mature through the years. Workplace is nice and accommodating but if you are coming for the first the time it can be intimidating. Hardest part of the is you are in a graveyard it is to get use to working late nights specially when you have no sleep but Quest Diagnostics shaped me in good ways possible in three years
good,Left company due to new CEO cutting IT budget. Outsource IT support overseas and switched out old management. Coordination within IT was hard to proceed. Made deep cuts and time to leave. IT wasn't appreciated and many people lost their jobs.
good,Was not a person with the mind set of talking to the people who worked there. She was short tempered and was always short and down right nasty to the office staff. 5
good,"my big issues with the job was the management.  and I think also the had a culture of paying people regarding ethnicity. I faced a lot discrimination in my department, but I didn't report them.  I just want to get out."
good,"Good pay.  hard to get time off for med appts. Harrassment goes rewarded for some. Favorites. Gossip among leadership. No back bone when needed by manager in ma."
good,This job is very fast past. Which I love. There is not alot of down time. The most productive time is graveyard shift which is the shift that I'm on. It does not allow adjustments in work life balance or life changing events. I'm currently looking for a day shift position.
good,"I have not worked for quest long, but there are a quite a few things I do not like. Management needs addressed, the lack of communication we have with management is poor."
good,For a publicly traded company there is a lot of waste at Quest Diagnostics in particular in logistics! Routes are not optimized for efficiency and they have too many routes. Management does not listen to senior drivers and new drivers are poorly trained. No overtime is available for regular employees. Instead they contract out work to courier services instead of allowing employees to work available weekends routes to get overtime. Also there is a lot of favoritism and lack of consistency when disciplining  employees!
good,"A typical day consists of a morning meeting with the team and/or management to discuss issues that occurred on the previous night. Then we move into the daily production which includes Quality assurance review, metric reviews, project meetings and management tool meetings."
good,"Depending on your metro, lead, and manager it can be an ok place. I’ve seen ppl come in bright eyed and bushy tailed but after 6 months of trying to be a good employee that will change cuz you’ll just be taken advantage of. Pay isn’t good for cost of living. They do offer a good health plan but if you’re paying for the family it’s about 600 a month. I worked alone in a 2 person office for close to 2 yrs and whenever I got help they were pulled to a bigger site down the road cuz they were “short.” Some sites are nicer than others. Fortunately I was in a nice site with large windows, can’t complain much about that. But I’ve seen other site in my metro that were like dungeons and miserable. Good place to learn everything so you can move on."
good,"they allow mediocre employees to run things because they've been there a long time. too much backstabbing and favoritism. the company has taken away all employee incentives for working there including employee rewards programs, holiday dinners, and stock purchasing discounts. raises are minimal."
good,"Worked from home interviewing clients purchasing life insurance.  Completed  medical history of clients documents over the phone, which were technically legal documents.  Company was contracted by over 40 life insurance companies for completion of medical history of clients."
good,Company is fine to work for but the leadership is s ares to make changes with the industry. The leadership is scared to take on risks and stays complacent.
good,All about production harsh penalties for mistakes which is impossible if you have to go really quickly. The hours are always changing and they have a lot of favoritism going on.
good,I had some issues with 2 of my fellow drivers and my boss did nothing to correct these problems There is nothing else I want to share on this matter Im done
good,"There is no room for advancement.  Management and team leads have ""favorites"".  Management hire family versus hiring the qualified candidate.  Having a degree means nothing at Quest."
good,"Good pay, raises frequently but very stressful if you are still in school or have other things going on in life (Overnight). Secure but high rate of workers quitting."
good,"Quest does offer many good things, but the management is poor and no matter how many times you bring something to their attention, nothing will be done."
good,"Good job it pays the bills. Med insurance is good 401k is offered. Company is diverse ,opportunities are very limited. Department growth is also limited.Pay is not as good as it should be."
good,Very strict about collecting payments from ALL patients. More worried about getting money than making sure patients are happy. Management does not genuinely care about employees. Overworked and under appreciated.
good,"very busy not enough staff, communication is not great, needs more structure, most employees do what they want and get away with slacking off. people that work hard don't usually get reconized"
good,"The work place had a lot of unnecessary drama going on, and the group lead and supervisor either added to the fire making things worse or they didn't bother to attempt to fix the problem at all. Some of the co-workers were amazing both as workers and people. Others would sabotage you and the work, leave, yell at others, or not even do work at all. With no discipline happening anytime soon, I don't imagine the place to get any better."
good,"poor management and stressful."
good,"If you've ever heard ""If you can work for Quest, you can work anywhere,"" it is the absolute truth. It is difficult to balance home life and work life as an employee here because PTO days are difficult to sign up for, and hours are not as flexible as I had hoped. PTO is handled on a quarterly basis rather than a day-to-day or even week-to-week basis. If there is OT, they will expect you to be at work and that will affect your ability to take PTO. If you are a high producing tech, be prepared to be questioned on days you didn't hit your mark. There are corrective methods in place if you fall short on their sensitivity range or are too sensitive, and techs are monitored on a monthly basis. It can be very frustrating to try to fall within the range, given the subjectivity of the field and with the new contracts coming aboard."
good,"Quest is very well run operration. We had about 50 routes a day with many exceptions along the way .Not a bad place to work ,on your own most of time . Must be focused ,no mistackes. Pay is low for the quality of work expected"
good,"Liked working with patients, job require using company car to various locations. I would recommend the job to applicants with experience.  You have to work some weekends.  Maybe on call."
good,There are many good people that work at the Baltimore lab (I understand it will be closing sometime after 2018). The management style was punitive and old-school. I worked part-time on the night shift and received an additional tuition remission--they do not do this anymore--plus stock options.  Ultimately it was essential for my career and it was good experience.
good,Too much stress involved in a company struggling with the new healthcare law.  Longterm employees were expendable due to high salaries. Most of the most knowledgable were let go
good,"I liked my job and my patient was very helpful. We had training every month on blood draws, health safety, HIPPA , Bio hazards, Patient care. The work was some times fast pace, but sometimes in summer and on holidays things were slow."
good,"Work was fast paced, very challenging, I love the patients they was very nice and considerate of our profession, patients was very considerate and the hardest part of the job was meeting our deadline at the end of the day, but it was worth it, the patients was the key and they helped us do our work with quality and their concerns was  a priority."
good,The culture and management could be better. They have been making changes since i started working there. Hopefully they will get it right sooner rather than later.
good,"It is a fast paced call center. Very Stressful. Management shows favoritism and is very inconsistent concerning what and how much productivity is needed. Also the culture of call center environment was not one as team, but more as very competitive. I thoroughly enjoyed working with our customers, and trying very hard to fulfill their needs."
good,"OK company to work for, but not to make a career out of.  You can work for Quest for over 20 years and not make more than $8 more than when you started. The raises that are given are not even equal to cost of living."
good,"It is a very busy atmosphere, micromanagement their employees. Unable to keep their employees. Like most company stocks holder are first then employees. Managers and Team leaders are not knowledgeable."
good,come in wait for patient so come in enter their orders and draw their blood. you then have to call and clarify any unclear orders with the dr office and follow the sop in documenting everything
good,"Good people within the finance group, vague on what's needed to get promoted. Work life balance can be very taxing on you and family, very dependent on specific individuals within the financial group.."
good,There is a lot of work that comes through this laboratory. Sometimes this makes the shift seem never ending. Its good if you like to stay busy but down time is almost impossible.
good,"I enjoyed working at QD since you work on your own in your own drawing station, but if you work at a busy location, you have to be able to keep up with the pace. Patients are always nervous to get their labs done, but if you enjoy your job, then you make it a pleasure experience for them. I did not enjoy my over all management."
good,"poor pay, high turnover, terrible staff , can't keep a trainer, poor training it is a total waist of time, only had 2nd shift available no 1st shift, you keep moving teams unannounced"
good,Great starter job where you can move onto another place. Benefits are nice and there is several locations throughout the united states to work at. Have training for all levels of employees.
good,"not very many options for advancement, only cares about money and not the employees, company is too big for their own good. otherwise, good job to start out and gain experience"
good,"Quest is a great company, however you are constantly under a microscope, management does not have your back..and employees are disposable...I will say much better than some places I've worked."
good,"High volume, high quality work."
good,Calll Center. Answering phones and processing claims while on  the phone. Calls are inbound but many require outbound calls to be made in order to complete the billing process.
good,"I learned a lot at here always continuing education classes and the client were good to serve, hardworking coworkers, several different testing done so efficiency was importan.t"
good,"The job allowed me to utilize my skills, and to learn new ones while employed there. But management was not the best, and wasn't helpful for opportunities to advance."
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a good place to begin a laboratory career.  It provides you with great laboratory skills that will stay with you throughout your career. The hardest part is balancing work and home life as you may be required and asked to work overtime quite often, which is good for the paycheck, but can be tiring with a family that needs your attention at home as well. I have nice coworkers that are easy to get along with and that is probably the best part of the job.  So all in all it a good place to work if you're looking for a career in laboratory science."
good,"The company overall isn't a bad company at all, the location I was zoned to was micromanaged. Seemed as if The supervisor was unsure of any phlebotomy knowledge so she emphasized on write ups and  discipline. There seem to be no balance. The most enjoyable part about work was coworkers, using our skills to work together and complete the main reason we were there anyway, to care for patients."
good,"Quest is a decent company to work for. However, profits seem to be the only objective. Management can be stand-offish. Advancement opportunities can be very elusive."
good,"I found it hard to remain professional, positive, and upbeat when speaking to Medical Assistants who were not exactly knowledgable about what they actually wanted or were calling about. However, it helped me improve my customer satisfaction skills as this was a major goal of mine."
good,I had to receive call from insurance agents and customers in regards to insurance claim bills. I leaned how to effectively process insurance claims. The coworkers there were good. I enjoyed the pot luck luncheons. I hated the low pay.
good,"It can be stressful place to work, but the people I work with make the shifts more enjoyable. Shifts are always different so days don't become monotonous."
good,A good place to learn the inside of a laboratory and the connection it has with different doctors offices. A good starting place for a person wanting to do more in a laboratory setting.
good,Company focuses on its growth without much care for its employees. Supervision lacks knowledge and caring for people bellow
good,"Monday office day, rest of week out in field visiting clients to ensure business flowing smoothly."
good,"everyday you were micromanaged. some supervisors were better than others. upper management sucked. most of the time I hated going into work, but I worked with some of the best co-workers I could have asked for. I can say that quest taught me a lot about myself and the medical field."
good,"The new CEO is purchasing many companies and growing the company nationally and internationally. The problem is that the companies being purchased want to continue to function as independent vs. coming onboard with Quest.  I believe the right programs are in place to move things forward, but I also believe it will take a very long time."
good,"Busy, global culture, meetings were the hardest part due time difference.US management is okay but can do better, six sigma process driven. EU management sucks typical know it all but really doesn't."
good,"Good company to work for, provides good customer service and offers potential growth for employees. Company offers competitive health benefits as well as 401K options."
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a worldwide company that offers lab testing through diagnostic insight. It is a good place to work, team oriented."
good,"Quest has gone through many changes recently.  Many mirror what I observed with other companies, too focused on headcount and not on the true bottom line.  The pressure to provide Wall Street with quarterly returns has led to the multiple reduction in workforce/ layoffs.  These will in the end affect quality.  It a shame that such a great company is going down this road."
good,dispatch for medical facility for texas regions and gulf coast schedules communications with doctors and other medical staff on patients specimen reports and other time sensitive manners maintained communications with drivers via sprint two radio with rsr
good,Nice place to work.  Good benefits.  Computers LIS needs update.  Management needs improvement in specific lab areas.
good,"Voice mail, check e mail, order entry.  Take phone calls from clients and continue order entry along with responding to emals.  The hardest part is dealing with work load with little help.."
good,"A typical day is very busy and you are usually running from the minute you start your day to the time you clock out. If you work here you will work hard but you are surrounded by great people who care about you and will be there to help and support every step of the way. "
good,"Shared lab with opposing laboratory employee, very small work area. 3 doctors in 1 office.  Had to be very organized and meticulous. Most patients were pregnant, so it was great sharing their experiences and joys of pregnancy. Supervisor would stop by unannounced, which made it difficult, patient flow was very steady and it made it hard to step away to talk"
good,"Poorly managed laboratory environment; unorganized"
good,"A typical day at work for me would include sorting specimens according to where they needed to be stored, and re-pulling the specimens for other departments throughout the building. "
good,It's a nice company to work for it's new and things are frequently changing. Management needs more experience. You are pretty much on your own when you get on the floor.
good,"A typical day at work will entail completing, at minimum, 15 interviews with applicants for life insurance. You learn how to manage time here, as there is strict adherence to time - especially during peak season. If you're not in the break room, coming to work, or going home, fraternization with coworkers is not encouraged."
good,"People are great to work with but lab management is awful. Unqualified people are given special preference based on ""friendships"".  Very emotional and no composure when it comes to problems. A lot of micromanagement on certain people. Doctors are very nice though."
good,I typed all day long.  I learned different computer programs.  Management was very stable.  Co-workers was very nice and good attitudes.  The hardest part of the Job was to not make sure that you don't get a mis id.
good,"I have been with the company for 20 years."
good,"I had never done data entry (for billing) before and really struggled with that.  You have to meet their daily quota.  If you can't you're outta there no matter how loyal or dependable you are.  I was there 6 months and just couldn't meet the quota. Coworkers were nice and helpful. Management was mostly doing their own thing-not very helpful, didn't pay much attention to staff.  There were times when they system was down then we had to find other things to do.  I pulled off pathology reports and printed them out for billing during those times.  Hours were good 8:00-4:30.  Dress was casual with jeans."
good,"hard and heavy labor, managment was cool bit they will work you to the bone. co worker were great. the hardest part of the job was working in the hot/cold weathers"
good,"Great place to work,long hours sometime.Good pay scale,meeting nice people everyday"
good,"Stress levels are moderate in the day-to-day work environment, but high motivation leads to great learning opportunities.  Working independently and with a team provides valuable support for ease of job duties.  There is a lot to learn within Clinical Trials and this knowledge and skill can be applied in all areas of the healthcare industry."
good,"Handled incoming sometimes made out going calls, spoke with patients, doctors offices and other medical laboratories, provide test requirement and results, scheduled appointments and processed supply orderd for both private doctor's offices and or patient service centers. My co-workers were wonderful people. "
good,The day is very busy drawing blood and processing a 100-200 specimens a day. My co-workers are a joy to be around
good,Multiple positions held. Cannot make determination on review.
good,"I enjoyed working with a team that was supportive. I moved around and got experience as working as an unofficial floater.They have excellent phlebotomists. My skills improved working in the fast paced environment, I was given a chance there in a clinical environment. The most difficult part about this job is working with the old system they have to check in patients. Most of the phlebotomists have issues working with the system because there is so much you have to remember. Then having to read a doctor's hand writing and having to call to confirm the requisition wastes valuable time. If the process was computerized it would be beneficial to the company in making less mistakes and the patient to get in and get out."
good,"Typical day , opening PSC , with many people waiting at door. entering pt information, drawing blood and processing, answering phones and faxing reports. i have learnes mucch about pt communication with many repeat customers speaking well of me which has in turn made the PSC a success. Management is good, but benifits going down the tubes. don't have any co workers am alone at office. hardest part of my job has become the amount of people showing up at one time but manage to get them out fast. most enjoyable part of my job is the customers."
good,"A day at Quest starts out at a running pace. I have improved my multitasking skills by leaps and bounds. In the 5 yrs I was with Quest I've been through numerous supervisors, out of the 6 that has came through Quest. Only 2 knew how to run our department. I enjoyed all of my coworkers, our department was the true meaning of diversity."
good,After finding it very difficult to get a job as a new medical assistant I was fortunate enough to be hired by Quest Diagnostics.
good,The management at the branch I worked at needs some work. You learn alot about the medical field.
good,"It was a good job for me when I needed it. But it's definitely not a final destination unless you somehow get promoted into senior management, which was tough."
good,You make the best with what you receive. Its alot of work but it keeps you on your toes for elevation when moving on or up in this field. You will definitely know everything.
good,"Not able to fulfill my title as the lead phlebotomist because one employee was allowed to over talk, scream, yell and insult me whenever she felt the need to, Site supervisor would tell me one thing and always told her something else making it impossible for me to do my job."
good,"Fast paced, mentally challenging but Educational. Great place to get work experience. Poor management and short staffing makes for a stressful work environment."
good,"I think Quest is an amazing place to work for as far as skill set, but just as many labs, turnover is extremely high and management sucks! The higher you are in your position the better your chances."
good,big company lots of amenities indoors safe vehicles good pay bad hours too long of a route management ok but stretched a little too thin very long hiring process
good,"Great place to work but my department,management was atrocious very rude and lacked people skills.The face of the company CEO great guy made the company joy to come work to,but others in upper management not that great.The wages could be a little better seeing the money the company makes.The atmosphere was very relaxed though"
good,"So far, I am satisfied with the flexibility that I am given working for this company. We'll see how it goes in the future since I've only been here less than two years."
good,Stressful... And management always has their pets... Some management loves to talk about other nationalities.. Only believe what they want to... Good pay and benefits
good,Working at Quest can be enjoyable but the production atmosphere can be hard to balance work/home life.  Each day no idea when you will leave for home.
good,"Very pleasant,  comfortable. Low stress envirnment. The company i work for arw great people. And comfortable to be around.Considerable and absolutely amazing."
good,"It was a good place to work and met a lot of people that helped me a long the way to grow in this company. "
good,"Good company, great benefits, not much room for advancement unless you obtain a certificate or degree. Laid back work environment. Great opportunity for individuals seeking an entry level position"
good,"I really enjoyed going to work everyday because of the employees affiliated with my territory. The day was full of meetings and conference calls  and opportunities to interact with the employees at all levels of the company to include cross functional areas."
good,"You can ask five different people the same question and you will get five different answers. Not helpful. The training is extensive & ongoing but unfortunately there is an environment of favoritism as well as many people who cheat the system. I took the job to get out of an office environment and for the paid time off. Unfortunately getting a route covered when you're sick is nearly impossible. Therefore, people show up to work sick and spread viruses. I respected my direct supervisor as well as a couple of team leaders but other individuals not so much. My worst day consisted of 82 stops & 145 miles which took me 9.5 hrs and I was cussed out in Spanish by a lab Clerk for being late. My second worst day was during route change when I was told I was awarded one route but execution proved it to be a different route and two individuals with less time than me were awarded earlier routes that I had requested."
good,"After working there for eleven years and seeing new management come in, I knew it was the beginning of a shakeup. Management will change course at a drop of a hat leaving employees in the lurch."
good,"Quest benefits are awesome compare to other reference laboratories in the Midwest. You get coaching for wellness, free lab work, gym at your facility. Sounds great, then you get to salary. For newbies a Med tech salary maybe perfect, but for someone with over 15 years experience is nothing. Then you get to favoritism. Only the brownnosing get to train in different areas. If you don't kiss up to management you are doomed, regardless of your past work experience. Also, it is all about quantity not quality. The more and faster you perform, regardless of poor outcome, the more you get rewarded. That's another thing, the same brownnosing staff gets praised and reward over and over. It gets to a point it becomes a circus. So, please, do yourself a favor Quest. hire supervisors that aren't only smart and know your system inside out, but also has managerial skills and choses training and rewards and recognition NOT based on brownnosing skills."
good,Was a good compay to work for until about 7 years ago. They got a new CEO who was more concerned about money than employees and patients. They did massive layoffs of long time employees.
good,"As a phlebotomist, I would give Quest a lot of credit for giving me the experience that I need to become awesome at my job. We see about 150 patients a day, and with that volume, I was able to enhance my technical skills, communication skills and interpersonal skills."
good,Management lack an understanding of the job of Management when it comes to supporting their employees. They are more concerned for there own needs then taking care of the workers that they are responsibly for. Lack of upper management decision making on issue's that employees bring up
good,"Working at Quest wasn't bad,  just needed work in the daytime. I worked the night shift the ten years I've been working there, and I've never seen a day position available."
good,I am very disappointed to see at how poorly such a large and wealthy company is willing to manage their sites and allow such harassment and terrible treatment of personnel to go on. Again I am very saddened to see this continue to occur which is why i am looking for another position with a company that has honor and integrity.
good,"There is a good sense of communication over all, however, Upper management does a poor job of coaching and motivating team. Unengaging environment. large staff sizes and a lot of favoritism. Good benefits and 401k matching"
good,Overall they are a okay company to work for. I like the ipad for sign in and for the most part we provide quick and courteous service. We are provided scrubs at no charge that is a major pro.
good,"Quest diagnostics is a great company for new phlebotomists. You can gain experience in phlebotomy. It can be hard to move up in the company, not a lot of room for advancement. Pay is ok, vacation is generous. Typically full timers start at 2weeks a yr."
good,"I do customer service, billing, receive payments, and phlebotomy."
good,"The job will keep you busy, but they will sometimes over work their employees with minimal recognition. They make some employess perform way too many tasks that are not their own."
good,"Work is relatively easy and I loved the people I worked with. Great stepping stone but not much room for advancement within the company. Environment can be real political. If you are not liked your job could become very difficult, make sure to have a good first impression."
good,"At Quest-you work as a traveling Tech you get paid Per Case .  The "
good,I love what I do but looking for more at this time. I love the patients and the kids that I draw: I love the fact when a draw the patient they say I didn’t hurt and they are gonna send everyone to me
good,It is a very busy place to work and with the right staff patients can be taken care of in a timely manner. never will get bored always learning new material
good,No one to go to when you need help. No one has answers to questions when they arise. Not the best management I have ever worked with. The people I work directly with are great.
good,"overall there are some good and bad as with any place. The culture is a bit too focused on bottom line and not on people. While there are some positive things, management needs to do a better job valuing its people."
good,My Supervisor was primarily concerned about turnaround time and your personal work volume. There was flexibility in start time which was good.  The bad part was having accrued vacation time but not being able to use it because they didn't want too many people gone. Cytology should be a professional job but Quest has reduced it to assembly-line work.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with. I work weekends only and the week staff leave me messages about office closings or new office locations that I may have to start visiting."
good,"overall good company to work for."
good,"I performed the functions of a laboratory assistant, collaborated with the preparation of the specimens that came to the department. He was also in charge of carrying out the weekly inventory to prepare the purchase orders and had to receive the requests and organize them in their respective places. I have to make the monthly inventory and send it to the administration for accounting purposes."
good,"A person is considered a resource, a number and not a person to most of  the leadership.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the technology, applications that we built in house and most of the people who did the work was great to work with."
good,"In the beginning, I loved working at quest. People worked as a team and supported on another. Quality and customer service were foremost in every way. Over the years it became more cut throat, the client needs b/c less important and the testing was becoming a commodity. I don't know a single person who is happy who works there now."
good,I loved my job there. Management from bottom to top is a joke. If you go to HRSC to file a complaint it is ignored and swept under the rug. your supervisor will retaliate against and nothing will change.
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a nice place to work, but I needed to advance quickly and there was not a role at the time so I moved on to the next company, If someone ask me about the company it would be a positive response."
good,"The senior management has made it clear that its primary objective is operational excellence. This strategy stifles innovation and makes its management teams repeat the same problems over and over again. Management allows for personal advancement through school, but limits professional advancement due to the lack of positions available. This shortcoming lowers employee engagement and doesn't empower an employee to go above and beyond on anything."
good,"It was important to grasp the techniques quickly because you were expected to perform independently since the leads are busy when the clinic is going. There is someone who can help if needed but, it was important to know what you needed to say in a short amount of time.Meeting a set number of clients was important."
good,"The culture at Quest is very collaborative and focused on providing excellent service to our patients.  Our people are extremely knowledgeable and service oriented. Overall, I enjoy working at Quest and helping to improve the lives of our patients while growing the business.  The most difficult part of my job right now is a constant focus on cost reduction, which often focuses on sacrifices by our employees.  I know this is the same in all industries, however, it still makes it difficult for me as a resource manager and a Lean Six Sigma practitioner."
good,"I worked fro this company for quite some time. In the beginning it was awesome. But as the years progressed it wasn't hard to notice that there was no room for advancement. Management was afraid to stand up for employees to clients. Clients lie on you when they can't have there way. Lead is only concerned about having their own family members advance. Management is too blind to see. You can't any OT, If you are 1 minute over 40 hrs, supervisor will call and tell you that you're 1 freaking minute over. Bonuses were good at first but became smaller and smaller. The job literally gave me an anxiety attack. I WOULD NOT GO BACK TO WORK THERE EVER!!!!!"
good,"there was always a disconnect between sales and operations"
good,"Pros"
good,"I was a temp and had great coworkers."
good,it's a good job for entry level positions but there is no room for growth in this company and the benefits are poor. I think the job is best for people just starting in their careers or retirees coming back to work. it's a very stable job and good for job security.
good,"el día de trabajo es bien agitado, es un trabajo continuo pero fluye, si se logra crear un team es super. "
good,"Always fast paced some down time between stops. Use company car, company pays for gas and all maintenance. Very confidential. Like your back in Highschool with the drama at the hub"
good,Im not going to bash or run the company into the ground. Every work place has pros and cons. What one doesn't like may not bother the other. I do feel the phlebotomist are under paid.
good,"You're trained to be well rounded as a phlebotomist.  For the most part you take care of your patients from the registration process all the way until their specimens leave the lab.  You will most definitely get the experience you need to excel in your career, however the pay for the amount of work expected of you is probably the lowest salary you could expect from this field."
good,"I was at quest for close to 4 years I dealt with supervisor changes, company changes and was about to go through system changes. Most new hire can't get use to 3rd shift and high production standard so if your not a fast worker, who can stay up at night this place is not for you."
good,"I am very work oriented, so typical work day is more work and less play at the same time remainig cordial with my colleagues. Overall I very satisfied"
good,"Unfortunately because this is a large company, they fall in the same structure of not really treating their employees well and appreciating them  for the value they add therefore they lose very qualified people and have a continual turnover of employees unlike smaller well run companies who value their employees and treat them well."
good,One of the worst environments for IT. IT was treated like a step child especially at a company that bought a technical company so that they could have cutting edge software which was a big disappointment.
good,"Learning about different cultures, happy and friendly patients, learning more about Florida since I originally come from Illinois after 30 something years."
good,Productive and a fun place to work over night. You receive your work load and your all to yourself for the night. I didn't have any issues while I work there.
good,"Low salary, easy job, no standards. Does not engage.    Surrounded by people who don't care and the company makes poor decisions. Poor customer experience"
good,"Worked in a facility that were mainly African Americans and Latinos.  I got along great with the staff but once a new manager took over that was Latino, I was pretty much harassed until I left."
good,Quest Diagnostics overall was not a bad company. The main issue is that they were unwilling to promote people of color in significant  roles simialr to most large companies dominated my management that all look alike.
good,My typical day started at night did not mind it at all. Although  at times it can be very stressful. Learning and teachings  others was very satisfying  to me.  We taught  each other if something was new you have to be able to adapt  to change. Loved my job and the role in played at Quest.  Management  on the other hand is a different  story There  was a lot of favoritism  there with their friends and family.   Supervisor  had her favorites and believe  me you had to pay the pricefamily members did not like you . Not good.
good,"Working at Quest was very fast paced and a very great experience. I learned a lot while working there, which helped me with my future plans in the medical field."
good,Enjoyed the constant workload where the quality of the quantity mattered. Only down side was the amount of hours needed to put in to make decent money. But did like the ability to move about in the company despite limited additional compensation.
good,"Sales success is gated by the region's access to health plan contracts.  Often you can be limited by Quest's status of in or out of network."
good,"i have been at quest diagnostics for 20 years, i have enjoyed my time here but i have reached a time in my life to start somewhere new in order to grow."
good,"Quest is a okay company to work for, they value their customer, but not their employees so much. They give you 1 personal day per year and they count missing days against you when you have to call out. They 401k is awesome and also the insurance that they provide. I've work for them off and on for a total of 4 years."
good,"A typical work day consists of back to back calls from hospitals and Doctors offices checking patient lab results. "
good,"Typical corporation - work with as few resources as possible and keep adding responsibilities without an increase in pay.  You can ask the same question to 5 different people and you will receive 5 different answers; everyone seems to just ""wing"" it. The account managers are merely glorified customer service reps.  They are entirely responsible for anything and everything to do with the account from the time the account is setup to billing & payment issues.  The company does not entrust other departments (other than client services) to communicate with the clients.  This leaves the account manager to deal with account setup, supply, collection site, and all billing issues including contacting your book of business  every 2 - 3 months for anything that happens at the company.  No time to be an account manager because you're being reactive and putting out fires daily instead of getting the opportunity to be proactive. The company tries to offer fun, bonding, and learning activities, but everyone is so overworked and busy that they are unable to enjoy or join in."
good,"Quest Diagnostics is one leaders in the clinical laboratory field.  However, the benefits are not great, there are not enough employees to cover the workload, and because of this management tolerates poor work performance."
good,"On the clock by 4:00 am."
good,this company has horrible pay raises and salary. micro management and very nosey co-workers always worried about what your doing not focused on their own work and self. management plays favorites and will act like it's no big deal. The company does not pride it's employees enough to pay for supplies and give any types of lunches or holiday party's they expect supervisors to pay out of their pocket to help have decent parties and feel appreciated.
good,quest is a good place  to work for the company can do better with management overall. but I would recommend quest for employment
good,Good place to work my coworkers are very good people. The environment is a nice.Very busy and always peaceful. The hardest part of the day is verifying doctors orders.
good,"A typical day usually involves repairing and re-imaging pc's. Printer and label writer repair, shipping hardware, disposal, and inventory maintenance."
good,"Prep specimens to be tested, run urinalysis, data entry. Working with a team, logging in specimens and making sure they are stable for testing."
good,"Work is always good. Working with great people makes your day goes by so fast. Management are great to get along with and talk to whenever there is anything."
good,Quest never gives priority to it's IT department. So you won't get much scope in this sector of Quest. They always concern on budget while executing any project so market standard products are very rarely used.
good,I have 25 years of phlebotomy experience. The hardest part of my job was not having good management. I was happy to leave this company but I do miss my patients.
good,Good company but not best environment for challenging employees by utilizing skills and room for advancement.
good,"Fast pace high call volume work environment. A typical day involves resolving testing issues with and the doctors office, calling priority reports. ect."
good,"Typical day - People work hard on their job."
good,"A typical day at work consists of arriving at 8:00 a.m. and leaving anywhere from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., once everything is finished Which I am perfectly ok with, as I really do not like to leave any work unfinished . I have learned to appreciate all types of personalities and diverse cultures. I have also learned a great deal of problem solving skills.   I was assigned to an office to work unsupervised for 7 1/2 years of my 8 1/2  years with the company. So, I had to learn to address and resolve any issues that may arise, as I wouldn't see a supervisor for months at a time.  Things at the company have changed drastically.  The supervisor I had worked with for the majority of my career with Quest Diagnostics was moved to another area within the company.  I was assigned a supervisor who has made my past 2 years with the company less than tolerable.  This is a company which I had wished to retire.  Unfortunately, that will not happen.  During my time with Quest Diagnostics, I have had the wonderful opportunity to work with some amazingly, hard working and dedicated people. Some of whom I will still remain great friends with for a very long time.  The hardest part of the job has to be trying to get an issue addressed and taken care of in a timely manner when it is out of my  The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely hands down, my patients.  Meeting new patients and seeing my regular patients.  I truly enjoy giving the best service possible to all my patients. . I have many repeat patients that are very loyal to me and value me as their phlebotomist and some, as their friend."
good,Working for Quest diagnostics has its challenges on the up side you meet many different people and your are providing a service for those clients that need there samples picked up and send to the Quest Lab for testing. The opposite of this is that you deal with a lot of repeated duties day after to day things don't change very often and if u are a person who likes to have some change this well be hard job to do.
good,"It's a great place to work if you keep to yourself. The people are great but tend to fall victim to or promote gossip, but I'm sure it's not unlike any other work environment. Productivity and quality work are very important in my department and errors are taken seriously. There is a quota that has to be met and its been increased at least 4 times since I started working there. I don't want to say the management has an unrealistic expectation of the employees they oversee but there is always room for improvement on both ends without burning the candle on both ends per say. I can only hope that the do keep that in mind when they choose to implement new ways of dong things. We all work really hard or at least try."
good,"Quest has given me the opportunity to work closely with clients in the healthcare field. The job gives me great satisfaction, however management does not listen to what would be best for the clients involved in daily pickups.  Salary and hours are an issue I am not pleased with."
good,"Well structured large organization, people tend to get lost in the organization"
good,"Good learning experience in the laboratory specimen testing. Unfortunately, job security is not great as many departments have already been laid off or is going to be laid off shortly."
good,Good place to work.  Bad management for the most part and the hours are long
good,A great learning experience.  Management was high-level.  Co-workers were very qualified and helpful.
good,I've been with the company for five years and i'm ready for a change.
good,"I have very good experience with this laboratory."
good,"I was in a group lead position. When I had trouble with a coworker harassing me, I went to HR to receive help in figuring out how to handle the situation since my supervisor and manager did nothing. The next thing I knew I was being written up for not carrying my jobs duties out with their expectations. The really confusing part is there were no complaints about me before hand and no specific instance they could share with me as an example. I had been out sick with a condition that slowed up my typing skills for a couple of weeks. I had brought it up to my supervisors attention so she would know what was happening, and then that was used against me stating I wasn't meeting production. Which my job title had nothing to do with production which I was told on numerous occasions. It's amazing what can happen when you bring up something the company is doing wrong and they are able to turn it around and make you the problem. Before this situation I had no issues with the company and I still didn't until they refused to back me up in a harassment complaint. I know I did nothing wrong in the situation, so I ended up leaving quest diagnostics because I lost faith in the company. Very sad I enjoyed working for them. I worked 12 hours or more a day at least 6 days a week. I really enjoyed going above and beyond my job duties. I wish I was still there but I couldn't stay where I felt mistreated."
good,"While the job was fun and exciting the opportunity to move on was not what I was led to believe. Rules and regulations were made by people that had either never done the job that I was doing, or they were so far removed from actual field work that they lost sight of what was really relivant."
good,"I didnt care to be lied to on how things work as far as Dr's note go. I didnt think I was treated very fair. Favoritism was played, even though I felt I worked hard for that company. I don't think its Quest as a company, I think it depends on the people in charge. I have learned that working while sick, gets you no where. It doesn't mean I will turn into a person that calls in all the time, but i feel it wasn't appreciated. I did not to much care for management. Most of my coworkers were awesome. Just about everyone did as they were told, and did it with a positive attiude. There were a few that lacked compassion for the patients. I didnt care for the fact that I would get an error for things that are out of my control, Such as specimens becoming lost, even though everything was documented proplerly. I also didnt care that I was one of the emplyoees that had to work every other saturday since I was part time, while the position say rotating satrudays. The hardest part of the draw was keeping the drawing portion three minutes and under. I dont feel that is a safe time frame to properly draw a patient. Having patients that were former addicts were hard to draw as well. But they were usually my most understanding patients. I did enjoy making my patients (especially the children) comfortable whle being drawn. Getting complements from them always made my day."
good,"Managers are fair, but they focus too much on the details. I would recommend they compliment employees more on a job-well-done when warranted. The most enjoyable parts of the day were actually at the beginning and end when interacting with co-workers. Many times things were also enjoyable working with the clients we visited daily. The most difficult part of the job was remaining flexible and changing duties or routes without notice. I had twice had to change my personal schedule with my family because of changes at the last minute; these changes were rare, but they did occur."
good,"I learned that there a lot of people that are afraid of needles. I was able to use my empethic comforting, and comedy to draw their attention away from what i was doing. It was a great feeling when they left the draw room and said that they couldn't believe how easy that was!"
good,it was a busy place to work and co-workers were nice and fun to be around. i loved what i do.
good,"If you want to work in a fast-paced environment doing a job that needs to be done, then Quest is your place. There is opportunity to learn and advance, within certain parameters, i.e. a degree will mean more than experience in some areas. Quest offers some of the best benefit packages available. Co-workers tend to be friendly and helpful for the most part. As in any company with thousands of employees, the workers run the gamut from friendly and helpful to (thankfully few) dishonest and backstabbing. Great ethnic and cultural diversity is on display. Management is micromanagement geared, with the feeling that every key stroke is being watched and recorded (they are) and even tiny deviations from norm will be dealt with in some form. Managment seems to want to listen to ""experts"" and not the people actually on the front lines for their decisions."
good,"Receive medical specimens, process them and distribute between departments."
good,very busy place drawing patient back to back some patient are very
good,Performed phlebotmy at a PSC and different doctor's offices.
good,"My work consist of data entry , process and received specimen fro all clients in VA MD and DC. I didn't gained any experienced in this work."
good,the company is a good company to work for. During the down times when work get slow when its bad.
good,"Good company- I loved my job and was very shocked when I got laid off at the beginning on the year. As any sales job, there is always a risk of getting let go."
good,"You would gain the necessary experience required to secure a more promising career in this field. The goal sharing  and 5% employer matched 401K are the best aspects of the benefits offered, hence maximize these benefits."
good,The work was fun and educational and rewarding. Helped me to become more attention to detail oriented. I worked there for 18 years. I also had a brief time at management. It made me a great team player.
good,"This company does not place a great deal of value on their employees.  While my teammates were great, the management, especially upper management lacked sensitivity and loyalty.  I felt like a number and not a valued ""family member""."
good,"I loved my time at Quest, most issues I found would be found in almost any workplace. A job is what you make it here. Success was rewarded and I wish Id never left this employer."
good,"Always have a job, Its a  Highly repetitive job Overtime is always there .Health insurance is great, pay isn't This job requires holidays and weekends."
good,"enjoyed the face and helping people"
good,Low salary is the major draw back and lack of advancement.  It really depends on which group you belong too.  Some managers are more fair than others.
good,"Quest does the best they can to supply an amiable work atmosphere, but there are always going to be bad apples that cause stress. They have handle these situations very well."
good,enjoy working here quest took over in February of this year. so far the changes have not taken any real effect. waiting to see what comes next. hopefully big changes soon.
good,At Quest Diagnostics I was working at a doctors office which was a great place too start off as a phlebotomists. Everyone there was so nice and helpful.
good,I liked working at Quest Diagnsotics for the most part. I did not like that the workers work all alone by themselves many times without a supervisor or any help.
good,"Productive work environment. Overtime was mandatory, but staff was friendly and approachable. Facility was nice; working with hazardous materials. Definitely be careful."
good,It’s a nice place to start out with phlebotomy trading could be longer but overall it’s okay some people may love it some may dislike it but so far it’s ok
good,"Widespread company so there are plenty of transfer opportunities and opportunities for advancement. Be prepared to work hard every day, and some days can be an exercise in patience and determination."
good,Good job. But definitely need better compensation for the area in which I work and cost of living. Benefits have gotten worse not better since I’ve areived
good,"very diverse, constantly recognized for how they respect their employees."
good,"It was a Productive place to work, the employees were helpful. The location was convenient, I was able to take public transportation. The morale was somewhat easy going the staff was pleasant."
good,"training, not employed.  this was an externship for my certification.  i was responsible for a certain number of blood samples in order to get my certification, so basically I worked for free."
good,"The company provides healthcare benefits, 401k, and discounts. A typical day at work is very simple, quiet, and kind of lonely. It is hard to create good work relationships. I have learned that if you want to work as a team, make sure you are doing your part. Management in Quest is not as good as expected. The hardest part of the job is not to receive what you deserve even when asked for it, drama between coworkers, and to learn the real value of the employee. the most enjoyable part of the job is the learning experience."
good,The environment is kind of school like - women who were older with children were very catty. But the pay and hours are ok for college students with no kids.
good,I enjoyed my years with Quest my most enjoyable times were getting up every morning and knowing that I would be drawing blood and seeing my patients that showed me so much love and believe me for patients to love a phlebotomist you must be some kind of good smiling I have received letters of recommendation written by the patients over the 7 years I worked with Quuest and my very first year I worked with Mental patients at Friends Hospital and had a very good repport with them as well
good,Micromanagement runs rampant. Constantly pushed to exceed production goals. Very little human interaction. Difficult to move up unless you are one of management's favorites.
good,The work keeps you busy and not hard but the people will drive you crazy with their drama. More work then people and has a sweat shop feel to the environment.
good,"It is really hard to grow within  the company, but overall it is a good place to work with good benefits, the only problem is that they do not give chance to people there to grow."
good,"Ability to work alone "
good,possibly sometime in the future I will provide my feedback to help give an accurate idea of the job environment....for now not applicable...future date
good,not much room for growth and management style needs to change. they don't like to listen to feedbacks. instead of encouraging people to do more. you will be in trouble for being proactive because you weren't ask to or selected to. too much micromanaging in this department. other department seems happier but nobody leaves so there is no opportunities to transfer.
good,I started at Quest very excited to work their. I got trained in different departments and that was great. The problem was our supervisor that was never their and he was in a relationship with a coworker and she got special favors. I wasn't affected by it but other employees were.
good,"Overnights are majority Asian ppl, which stick together so if you’re not then you won’t get treated as fairly..expect you to stay late for them everyday but will fire you in a heartbeat!"
good,"The metrics utilized for performance and review are, for the most part, unattainable.  The company boasts about integrity and compassion but their priority is the money collection.  As long as you can collect on patient balances you will be fine with this organization."
good,"very flexible with the ability to work from home. For 2018 activity, the company made a decision to freeze any merit increases in 2019 for certain pay grades and opportunities for advancement were limited."
good,I was with this company on two occasions. The first time they were about the employee. A lot of benefits. The job was rewarding and fun. The second time I came back the company changed. It was about the bottom line.
good,it was a good place to work for until the day I was told that I could not come in late to go to my daughters very first day of school. they treat their employees like slaves no overtime. but they have money for a stadium and private jets!
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a great place to work for someone who just graduated or is seeking an entry level position. There is little room for advancement because employees, especially lab techs, do not leave their positions. The downside is most employees are resistant to change which makes the environment an unpleasant place to work."
good,"The Pay is good, PTO is great. There are advancement opportunities for the right individuals. Everyone is always concerned about job security. Loved the people I worked with."
good,"I believe in the power of recognition and empowerment leading to great employee engagement. And employee engagement is critical to guest engagement."" Great place to work"
good,Nothing much to write than it’s a company to work for with minimal promotion . But with lots of flexibility . Overall a good stepping stone for a young entry career pursuant
good,"Place of business is a nightmare .. Its very sad how unhappy I was there. I gave them 4 years of my life that I'll never get back, thinking it all just get better because I loved helping people but they long time employees where bullies."
good,"Overall a decent company but lately there has been limited opportunity for career growth. "
good,"This is high volume lab. skills were high volume work. you must greet patients with a smile. made a lot of friends"
good,"I was with this company for 11 years as a lab assistant. It's one of those companies where you become comfortable very quickly and become a lifer, like many people there. But things changed over time and the requirement for a degree to do even basic things became ridiculous. There isn't much room for growth, even for a med tech unless you've been there for 20 years and then you might become a manager. Only Phd's get the corner offices. I would have to say that after 11 years there, I only gained experience relative to working in a lab. Lots of friendly people there, but being a lab rat wasn't for me and I moved on."
good,"Work was available, night shift no day. Hard to advance because my degree was not related. Management worked with you and very knowledgeable, had consistent reviews."
good,"The job is easy enough, they do well in training new employees. I don’t feel the pay is good enough for the stress they put on you. They make a big deal about how it’s such an important job and that one mistake on your part can alter the patients life in a negative way, and yet it’s minimum wage.  You do accumulate TOP time ( paid time off) but you can never use it! If you want to request time off you have to do it a minimum of three months in advance and if another person on your shift has requested before you your request will be denied. So if you wanna have a personal life outside work good luck, quest makes it very difficult."
good,A fairly steady daily schedule and the ability to work on your own without supervision.  Nice work in summer with the nicer weather is a plus.  Rain and snow is not always fun but still not bad.
good,"Not sure what to put down"
good,Quest was a good place to work however they didnt keep good employees around very long.  they trained me had me train others and then once they changed the management i was the first to go.
good,"Friendly and warm environment, but long waits, friendly interactions with certain staff members. Doctor orders were not always ready in office for service."
good,"•	Worked as an Independent Sale Representative acquiring clients and provided Title insurance to brokers and real estate agents."
good,"ustomer service checking in-out patients scheduling appointment answering phone calls faxing, filing, photocopy, scanning information into the computer. Verifying insurances authorizing documents buy frames for the office meeting with sale reps reviewing statements billing patients dispensing contact lense and  glasses offering advice to customers on lens and frames, taking measurements, recommending repairs reading prescriptions bookkeeping and taking  payments cash, visa, mastercard"
good,You spoke with customer's all over the country going through the steps for life insurance policies.  Was able to learn a lot about the back side of this process and was intrigued with how it was all accomplished.
good,It was a pleasant place to work. The workload was fair. I got a long with the people. It was enjoyable. It's a very productive place to work. You had to do your job.
good,Good place to work in the sense that you can grow and learn a lot about closing deals and really truly selling. Bad in the sense that the budgets are set so that very few people hit them and such the compensation plan does not equate to actual business that is closed and revenue that is generated.
good,"Overall good company.  Commute is ultimately caused me to leave at over an hour each way.  Company likes to invest into its people. "
good,"Good company to work with .However they never give you enough incentives such as increase your salary a year. Only increase work but pay less. I've  been there for 5 years . Only the upper management got more increase than us."
good,"For new graduates without prior experience, it is a good opportunity to learn new knowledge and experience. The workload is very high and the salary is very low."
good,the job is ok. benefits leaves something to be desired. one minute their demanding that you work 100 overtime hours the next there is none. thats my onlu complaint
good,"Needs management with life experiences, great co worker, stressful at times causes of lack of leadership and teamwork. enjoyed my time with Quest until the end."
good,"Very busy, High work load.  Understaffed.  Process improvement meetings every week and supervisors are expected to have several areas to improve.  Stressful"
good,I have nothing negative to say about Quest.  the people are funny to work with.  I love the fact you can transfer to any state in the USA. Quest saved my life and hired me when I need a career.
good,I worked for Quest diagnostics for three years I enjoyed my job as a phlebotomist in a doctors office but Quest pays very low. Being a phlebotomist since 2000 I should have been getting paid more especially for all the work I had to do everyday.
good,"Decent place for any entry level healthcare worker. Room for growth but you have to wait until relocate, retire or die. Low pay rate, 5- 50 cent increases depending on annual review.  little vacation time."
good,"I liked working there and learn a lot from different people. Flexible hours for part time employees. Learning and training programs, part of the company characteristics."
good,This company was okay until I started working for Labcorp. There wasn't room for advancement for me there and I just decided to move on. This is a good company
good,It is a pap lab. Get experience and get out. The supervisors are nice and friendly. The director is disorganized. The Cyotechs are friendly. The pay is pretty low.
good,"If you're the type that doesn't like to work...steer clear of Quest. I worked at a solo site for about 3.5 years seeing about 60-80 alone before my supervisor decided to give me a part-time employee. As soon as I leave, there are 3 full-time employees"
good,"It was a nice place to work. But, after working there for nearly 20 years my pay did not reflect it. You had unattainable goals every year so, that your merit pay a.k.a. increase/decrease in salary could never be possible. This was economically driven and psychologically manipulative. Unfair and unethical and skewed to only allow a few with nominal raise."
good,Quest is a good place to work. Everyone works together as a team. There is a great amount of team building. There is always room for improvement but everyone works hard to meet their goals.
good,"I learned many things from working at Quest Diagnostics, including running immunoassays, making reagents, and working in tissue culture. It was a great experience to work there. However, the management is very poor. There is no transparency from them, and they treat employees very poorly."
good,"the work isn't hard but there are no career advancement, also some of the supervisors are not professional and have favoritism for other employees.the pay is decent but over all too much stress"
good,"faced paced, stressful multi requisition from patient you had to do data entry, draw blood, edit any mistakes, process all specimens and get them ready for transport."
good,"nice people good management wish I could have stayed longer would recommend working for them again in the Seattle location."
good,"Long days, received over 200 calls a day. computer program was very out of date compared  to the size an progressive  company. I would not recommend my position as customer service rep."
good,"Very busy patient service centers, high employee turnover rate."
good,"The company offers 401 K plans, health insurance and free annual blood tests for the employee and spouse. Pot lucks are common. van pools operate with cash incentives for the riders."
good,"Worked as mobile phlebotomist, with company car.  Worked 10-12 hours per day. Called patients night before to schedule the time to come out to the house.  Enjoyed meeting people from all walks of life."
good,Very competitive company to work for. Enjoyed my role as a safety officer in addition to my Float Phlebotomy role. My supervisor was kind and respectful.
good,Great place to work as far as duties and benefits but pay isn't enough to live on. Easy work...some routes are faster paced than others. You spend most of your day alone driving around and jamming out to music.
good,I really have mixed feelings regarding QD.  I liked the job but they did not have any sympathy for me leading up to my dads illness.  The pay could have been more also.
good,Talkative people make the job a bad place to be. You could be so focused on your own tasks and people would want to know how are you. What's on your plate meaning life so it's a very difficult task to complete your  own work with people that should be doing their own work bothering you.
good,"Quest is a solid company with a good reputation.Being continuously short staffed makes work demands difficult and contributes to a climate of dissatisfaction. I can say however, that I have been treated very well and believe manegment is working hard to build a team where all can feel respected and appreciated."
good,this was a good job but it was 3rd shift that made it very hard on family life with 2 small children in school.  if you are a driven person than there is room for advanacement
good,Most days start at 06:30 to prepare resources for required upkeep. Reporting of previous days productivity takes several hours. Manage all daily situations with nearly 500 resources. 
good,While I am grateful they adjusted my schedule to allow me to go to school full time as well as work full time.  The call center life is not for me. It would get stressful at times to maintain a certain quota.
good,Working as a specimen processor gave me great pleasure. I was able to meet great people from different medical fields and learn from their experiences. I was able to take that knowledge and pursue a new career in the medical field.
good,Quest is a great company with great diagnostic tools for it's clients and patients.  The diagnostic services that Quest provides to their clients are top of the line.
good,"The shift differential is nonexistent in the laboratory. Your shift starts at a set time but the end time varies because it all depends on the shipment so you can't work multiple jobs because they can keep you until 10AM even though you're scheduled until 730AM. The work itself is monotonous but you'll be trained on different things so you'll see a variety eventually. The hours are so inconsistent that your check will also be inconsistent, which is no good when you have a family to take care of."
good,"Quest is a company that has ample opportunities for advancement for those with entry-level experience. There are multiple job functions from lab tech, drivers and office workers."
good,Not given proper training. When I went to orientation the computers we were supposed to learn on were sitting on the floor in the corner of the room where they remained all week of the orientation.When I arrived at the lab I was to work in My co workers expected me to have some understanding of what was going on. They were NOT nice about having to virtually train me on the spot. Maybe someone else would have an easier time......
good,"Busy placed to work. A lot of nice patients. Management ok but co-workers were all very nice, professional and helpful. Fun meeting different patients."
good,"I greatly appreciated the experience. I was a floater, going from city to city and clinic to clinic.Co-workers were welcoming and supportive. The managers in each site was supportive as well."
good,"A very large volume corporation with many opportunities in several different disciplines."
good,"Incompetent supervisors but not a bad job. A very independent job with little interference on a daily basis. Godd benefits, time off. Only con is supervisors are incompetent."
good,"hardware coordinator, my job was fullfilling and enjoyed it, supported all tech;s across the country, also sales support and support of all clients, had a very good boss in robert silva"
good,only think i recommend is that they dont demand as much overtime it should be voluntary. Also provide more extensive training over the different insurance companies so that we will know how to educate the customers when discussing their medical history.
good,"I haven't been at Quest for years but when I was there, there was no room for advancement in the billing department. When there was an opening for management, you could apply if you were a regular employee, but you knew that the job was going to another manager and then that managers job was filled by an outside applicant."
good,"If the company did not lay off 2/3rds of their staff, due to the competition and economy, I would still be there. Very good company to work for but has gone down hill in recent years"
good,Working at Quest was nice it was very laid back and very slow paced I feel that it was a very nice work area very nice and clean the patients were wonderful
good,"This is not a bad company there is a lot of things that could have been changed and better managed, there were a lot of changes made for the good of the company."
good,"gm needs help talking to emp. but other then that its a nice company to work for good people great vibe, a job you can come in get your work done and leave"
good,"Lab was under management changes.It was slow going.and changes took along time. Revision of changes were not up to expectation, Lack of hiring more lab workers."
good,"Worked to the bone, pressured to move faster draw more patients then is required of you, short staffed and supervisors always us the threat of you will lose your job."
good,Maybe it was just my department but... talk about the lack of management and accountability. People could just say and do what they wanted without any consequences. My boss never addressed any concerns that her employees had. Never was thanked for all of the hard work put in and there were times the department was short staffed and you're expected to cover for everything.
good,"My site was very busy. I worked by myself most of the time due to under staffing."
good,"over worked, under paid, under staffed  "
good,Fast paced company . friendly co workers everyone is nice . Always learning something new. New analyzer training. Loud and nosiy so who have to stay focus.
good,Low wages -- you are not paid what you are worth.  They do not make you feel appreciated.  They could pay a higher wage but they do not.  They need a serious change in management
good,A great place to work.  Company has become very automated and if you like working with machines it is a interesting place to work.  Staff is friendly.
good,Very low salary for the exposure and work done.The raise per year is very low as well. Too many patients seen a day and not enough personnel to cover all patients.
good,"Register patients and verify their insurance. Print their paperwork, draw their blood, process their specimens . Drug screen people who come for their new or curent employer."
good,"Quest was great, they really take care of their employees"
good,you never get to sit down always pts waiting and complaining about wait times it was work work work from the minute you start until you leave for the day
good,"The job changed after 3 years.  The position became unmanageable; however, that is not the reason I resigned.  I resigned for family reasons.  The company as whole was great to work for."
good,"I work on posting cash and insurance claims. Denials and doing patient searches.  The hours are nice, and its nice you work at your own pace.  Management  is not good."
good,When I first started with the company is was an exceptional place to work and you felt the support of your supervisors.  Many things have changes and the structure of the company has also.  The drive of increase productivity has changed my out look with the company.
good,some sites are very busy and some are not but pay is very competitive. Have incentives for employees like purchasing power and recommendation to earn points.
good,"A normal day at work is reviewing emails and responding to incoming emails and other assigned duties. Like engaging with clients, sales reps and providing outstanding customer service to all clients. Management provides support with assignments and providing future goals. The work environment or culture is all about working as a team and collaborate with other departments. The job is challenging due to the amount of items you need to know or learn, but fun at the same time due to the confidence that you have great knowledge about your employers product to present to clients."
good,"Quest has gotten me a lot of great experience, but little room to better myself in the company. I don't feel I am paid fairly for all of my efforts.  Management, like many other companies, is really about the money they are making and less about the front line employees making them the money.  Raise once a year is nice, but Quest can do better..."
good,Quest Diagnostics was a good company. I was able to learn many the billing aspects of healthcare in my position and enjoyed being part of the organization.
good,it was a cool place to work would have love to continue  at  temporary position that i though i had made to permanent didn't think it was fair for me to be laid off
good,"Although the job has growth potential and is an environment to learn a variety of tasks not directly related to laboratory management, this is an unstable and unstructured environment with subjective guidelines."
good,"As an employee at Quest, I obtained patient information, verified insurance information, and made sure diagnoses and test were accurate. On top of collecting specimens we also process specimens using a centrifuge."
good,The moment I was hired at quest I knew it was going to be a good and new expirence for me  I loved my team tht I worked with as well as my supervisor everyday was prductive and challenging.But over all I loved it all my patient's my schedule etc etc ..
good,"A typical day at work would require problem solving, auditing documents, Interacting with vendors regarding software and hardware issues. Attending department meetings. Developing process. Creating training documents and administering test. Speaking with clients on the phone to resolve problems. What I have learned as a trainer and leader is everyone wants to learn, however the pace they obtain the information is different. The most enjoyable of the job is accomplishing goals with the team, The hardest part of the job is not having enough staff to get the job done."
good,"As with most jobs its never the work, always the people... The benefits and stock purchase options are very good..Forward mobility is nonexistent due to politics.."
good,"good start-up working place ,  Continue to bring cutting edge testing to the market. Lack of communication, lack of coverage for a day off; Multiple work shifts"
good,"Learned a lot when I started, very fast paced. Same as most companies is, unfortunately, the favoritism. I've been in a couple different departments and work load is always heavy!"
good,Quest is a good company to work for. They have alot of potential for growth within the company. Coworkers can be quite difficult to deal with which is the reason i left the company
good,It is an entry level job and an entry level company in healthcare/medical sales.  They tend to have expectations that are unrealistic and therefore the quality balance is not recognized.
good,"A lot of overtime was required, and offered if you wanted it. Benefits were pretty good. Employees were helpful and you could get time off when you wanted."
good,Very good place to work I started off working there as a volunteer right after I finish school and then I was allowed to work there as PRN and travel to different sites to work for Quest Diagnostics.
good,"A fast paced environment and you have to be multitask in order to succeed with this company."
good,Its a ok company put unnecessary stress on employees to get job done .  You work until your done I would not recommend this job unless they are really down on their luck high turnover rate.Termination often happens
good,"Mostly laboratory developed assays in Immunology department,  a pioneer in EIA testing for West Nile virus, very high volume lab handling patient testing and clinical trials."
good,"Responsible for handling incoming and outgoing calls to deliver lab results verbally, via fax, email or U.S. mail to doctor offices, patients, imaging centers, pharmacies and hospitals throughout the United States with accuracy and professionalism in accordance with company policies and standards"
good,A typical work day included many responsibilities. The primary focus of the company is the patient which I loved because I love working with and meeting any different people. I found it fulfilling to ease the mind of people who faced what they felt was a difficult situation. A blood draw. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate patients. However it was no hard for me to make a difficult situation more peaceful and conducive to the job. I found the greatest joy in dealing with children and making a scary blood drawing situation a little easier to deal with for the patient and the parent.
good,"A work day at Quest is the collection of blood and specimen samples to be processed and diagnosed for ailments."
good,this company is very fast paced and competitive. they strive to meet or exceed the expectations of both their patients as well as their employees in any way possible
good,Nice place to work relaxed environment everyone works as a team great bonuses great benefits pay could have been better position was great and hours were also
good,"Over bearing supervisor that won't get you any help "
good,"The company seems great and I liked the management but honestly the environment and atmosphere is so childish. The job itself is not difficult, but to perform the job and get the shift done is. It's very dreadful having to go in. I once enjoyed working until being sucked into the childish drama when I just wanted to get the job done and leave."
good,"Worked in a great location as a lab technician.  Work flow was study and busy.  The most difficult part was being the only lab tech in the building to draw blood, so with that being said , i could not have hard stick.  I was greatful with other clinics asking for my help.. made my day."
good,"There is a lot you could learn here however, getting someone to train you without holding back seems to be an issue. It appears there is a lot of job security here and the training is done within a box."
good,If you are a college student and need flexibility then this job is for you! The people are nice and you will work hard but it's all in a day's work! Consider it!
good,"Always worked in a very busey office with several of co-workers , some were very negative, but at the same timesome were team players, I enoyed working because I love working and helping poeple"
good,"a typical day at work is very productive, i learned how to defer aliquots, bank and store specimens, data entry patient requisitions with a 10 key speed of 9000 keystrokes and wpm 60."
good,Working for Quest Diagnostics was a great  experience  Nice place to work its company with room for growth very laid back environment
good,Well my workday is a little different as I don't sit with my team or management.  I sit and work alone in a quiet atmosphere.  I a hard individual worker with no supervision and continues to get excellent yearly reviews
good,I must admit this is one of the most stressful jobs I had. Some of the management was not professional at all. I believe they thought your life was based around the company and that's it.
good,I do not wish to provide a review of this company.  There were many changes and untruths told throughout my employment with this company.  They are not straight forward in upcoming changes within the company.
good,"good place to work, friendly co-workers. There was a lot of computer based training which is mostly on driving abilities. Minimum supervision which was nice."
good,this place a business was great until it was taken over by quest diagnostics. my schedule changed and the workload became unbearable at times. left within 6 months of take over.
good,Large laboratory with many departments. Great benefits and cafeteria onsite. Good place to learn and advance throughout departments. Growing rapidly.
good,"A high volume laboratory that constantly keeps you on your toes."
good,"Fast paced, collect insurance info and demographics on 40-50 patients a day."
good,"I've enjoy working for Quest Diagnostics, my boss as well as all my co-workers have always been amazing. I gained a lot of knowledge and improvement in my Phelbotomy skills at Quest.  They offer great benefits as well."
good,"For 15 years working in Quest is quite good. The benefits are excellent. I talk with my co-workers while working, that's how I enjoy my work. I can say I'm one of the best employee in our department. Even though I talked a lot I make sure I meet my quota. And make sure no mistakes especially we are dealing with patients test ordered."
good,"Worked well with co-worker, did what was expected each and every day.  Worked well with manangent as well as staff.  A typical work day like any other place"
good,"Quest Diagnostics for a few friends and myself has an age-thing!"
good,"Quest Diagnostics, Inc. was a very driven place to work.  It is a productivity based employer from most of the positions available.  Over the last three years it has become more focused on giving excellent patient care while trying to steer it profitability upward."
good,The company was building a new facility and changing process and procedures. The result was a confused and often conflicting environment.
good,over all a great place to work. I get along with everyone.The hardest part is to many call outs and working half staffed making it harder for the people that come to work . team  leaders need to have more management skills.Most enjoyable part is week ends off.
good,I missed getting out and meeting people.  I enjoyed working from home but when my computer or internet crashed I had to drive 45 min. to work on site. The work was very repetitive and was not fulfilling.
good,"Specimen pick ups and drop off to the lab, Maintain specimen at their required temperature, ensure proper handling and no lost of specimen."
good,"Not employee minded, volume of patients not considerate with possible patients needs. increased data entry of information not clinical related."
good,I was able to work in the graveyard shift in a hospital settings where I meet a lot of people.  We have great teamwork in the graveyard shift.
good,Good place to work. they do offer different options of growing in your job skills. Management does work with you depends on the work place.
good,Was a good company to work for but the culture changed and the employee is no longer recognized or appreciated.  Everything is about the bottom dollar and things are being let go where they can.
good,I was working 2nd shift doing Specimen Processing over at Quest Diagnostics Wallingford Lab. I was also going to school during the day to finish up my degree.
good,Every department worked together. Everyone was willing to help where needed. Great manager communication between employees. Profit sharing and 401K matching.
good,Very fast paced work flow and turn around times with multiple high volume tests.  Immediate managers are very friendly and easy to work with. Fun and enjoyable coworkers/work environment with many team building gatherings and events.  Tight/small working stations.
good,This use to be a great company until this year when a new manager that runs this company plus 3 other states. she has taken Quest in the wrong direction and is running it into the ground.
good,being a mobile phlebotomist you are alone and have to react to any situation that may pop up in the best way possible. This was my first phlebotomy job and I learned most of what I know from this job
good,"As per resume, logistics courier/dispatcher. Have taken on new tasks. I believe I have a great rapport with not only management, supervisors, coworkers, but also other employees in other departments throughout the lab.  I would say that the hardest part of the job is not having coverage at dispatch desk to just get a few minutes away for a breather, as the phones are extremely busy."
good,"Learned a great deal at the time about billing & handling money and sorting mail and deliveries of packages throughout the building, loved working with and  meeting people . the hardest part of the job was proof reading it was hard on my eyes."
good,Worked as a Phlebotomist in a Patient Service Center. Enjoyed Drawing blood and helping the patients. Benefits were good but pay could have been better.
good,"A typical day for Quest Diagnostics consist of meeting a list of short and long term goals. "
good,Enjoyed working with the sales team and interacting with employees in the different departments. Very supportive management.
good,"I learn new things each day while at work."
good,This workplace kept me on my toes at all times. It taught me self management skills and to be accountable. I had to show my supervisor that I was able to manage my office duties and do what I was asked to do without someone hovering over me to make sure the job was done.
good,"daily : operated a patient service center  180-200 clients a day ."
good,"Fast pace, no frills work place. Clean and secure work place. Limited    opportunities for career advancement. Productive work place."
good,"Process and receive in clinical lab work from hospitals, clinics, and private practices.  Worked with machines to run and release clinical tests for our clients.  Learned how to control the machines that are used to run lab work, along with the maintenance that goes along with the machines.  Patient care is our main focus, making sure that our clients get their lab results in a timely and efficient manner."
good,"Responsible for all responsibilities of the Specimen Preparation Assistant.  Demonstrates an ability to learn the job duties assigned to the SPT I, and develops an understanding of how all the functions in Specimen Processing fit together."
good,A typical day at quest is first clock in take all the temps to make sure the machines are in range. Log into the care 360. Make sure you have all of the materials that you need for your draw station. Unlock the door and greet every patient as they enter the PSC. Enter in the demographics into the computer for test verification. Escort patients back to draw station for there blood draw. Following requirements for specimen processing. Management is not to concerned about there employees needs to improve patients complaint's. The co workers was great to work with until the stress of the comes then some get overwhelmed. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep you cool when you have 15 eyes in you hungry and waiting to eat. The most enjoyable part of the job is making people happen when you draw their blood with one puncture.
good,Quest is very great place of employment. As a customer service representative you get to have a relationship with the caller as if it was a family member. As a quest employee you get to make difference with what you do to help people around the world.
good,Long days in heavy traffic and some of the employees are disrespectful with general low morale and very very poor raises.
good,"•	Communicated lab results to physician and nurses.  "
good,"There are many different type of people you meet and I must say I love working with them. The feeling of helping people and being there for them is a WONDERFUL feeling, knowing that you may have touched someone's life."
good,"•	Inbound rep, receiving calls from doctors, patients, hospitals and potential new clients in Florida and around the U.S.A"
good,I learned more about the lab in depth. I met great people. I enjoy my time working here. The training process was long but very helpful throughout my different positions within the lab.
good,"Servicing Patience to have the blood draw, urine collections, working here I meet new friends. Learning to be a team player"
good,Providing phlebotomy service to patient collecting blood and urine specimens. Getting patients in and out with a great group of co-workers that completed there task of assignment.
good,"I would never work for Quest Diagnostics again. No team work or organization, long hours and very low pay. Poor management."
good,learn a lot although it takes a long time to be trained. management is not very involved in everyday labwork. Some employees believe they are better then others
good,I was working for Quest Diagnostics and I was in a doctors office In Methodist Hospital where i covered four doctors accounts. I drew blood for their offices.
good,This is a good starting job for anyone that wants to work in a lab. You learn the basic training for lab work and your co-workers are very personable. It is a great job.
good,"Used to have fun doing my job, had the right authority to the job properly without going back to the manager for more help."
good,A lot of repetitive movements but they pay okay and it is constant hours.  good way to get your foot in the door and they help pay for schooling.
good,The company was a great place to learn. All of the employees were very helpful and informative. The environment is more relaxed but the hours seem long.
good,It's an good place to work. Department currently working does not require you to be on the phone unless you have to call to get missing information. Flex schedule and sometimes have the ability to leave early on Fridays.
good,"due to the facility running short staff it was very demanding and stressful at times,however i was able to run the facility and maintain high volume of patients.worked independently no immediate co-workers."
good,"I've worked there for a little over 1 month, and I don't know if it's because I like to be up on my feet, or if I just plain don't like it, but it isn't the job for me. Don't get me wrong, they're great people to work for, but I just don't like the way that some of the things are ran. If you're out sick and have a doctors note, you still get wrote up. Too demanding, and you don't get paid enough. A typical day at work, you get cussed out over the phone, and I learned that I never want to get in another call center job again."
good,"The market is changing.  Hospitals are purchasing the physician groups and bringing the lab testing in house.  Directly taking business away from Quest.  Losing market share simply because of market dynamics.  Great company, challenging marketplace."
good,"Colleagues are great people. Helpful. Caring. Smart about their job position, duties and how to work through the maze of corporate chaos.  Management has some issues, not always true to their word. Not all but a few are this way which can effect your position. Loved my position and people I worked with."
good,A high-pressure work environment where getting the job finished is paramount. There is no time for fun. There is very little if any positive recognition.
good,"•	Lead over 60 Medical Technologists in administering vitamin D, testosterone, aldosterone, reverse T3, and vitamin B1 tests. Also, making the schedule for all 60 employees on 3 different shifts. "
good,"I do everything in the office by myself."
good,Good benefits however major staffing cuts. Management changes and contract loses impacting business.
good,"Dealing with specimens. Learned to take the job seriously because you're dealing with patients results. Management team was great. Co workers were nice. The hardest part was to deal with stool samples."
good,"The call out system implemented by Quest Diagnostics is horrendous. If one calls out or clocks in late, one receives an occurrence point. If one calls out less than six months from the date of the incident, another occurrence point is accrued. I had an outstanding balance from this system for over TWO YEARS. I was denied Short Term Disability, which put me at seven occurrences, thus terminating my job."
good,It is great to see a company that is goal oriented and are very serious to stay the best in the business.
good,this was a great company to work for I really miss working there
good,I enjoyed my time spent with this company. Wasn't happy that my manager was never there at our location. He was always traveling and was never able to address our needs as employees.
good,"I work with team players, the hardest part of the job is standing for eight hours. The enjoyable part is meeting the patients everyday."
good,Typical warehouse job. Underpaid for the work you are responsible for doing. Extremely hot in the warehouse.
good,They try to meet all lab testing in a timely and efficient manner.
good,"In working on third shift it was all about production."
good,I was a volunteer for this company whenn I was just graduating high school
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a diverse place to work. There is not much room for advancement, without post secondary degrees in certain fields."
good,"the learning and of work a typical day at work"
good,"short term job, fast paced environment. I enjoyed learning a lot in such a short time. The employees were very nice."
good,Management was too uncomfortable with their employees and created a uncomfortable work environment for all who worked their.
good,"After being laid off from a company that had to downsize, I was hired as a temporary employee and then hired permanent.  Great and fun place to work, but I wanted to get back into an office setting."
good,Good company with excellent client services as top priority.
good,"I enjoy working with the interface vendors and training new employees.  Using Webex or Dameware to resolve all problems, taking between 30 to 40 calls in a day."
good,A stable company to work for. Management skills leave something to be desired.
good,"Leadership and management lack direction and clarity. Pay is not great, relatively stable job, lack of oversight, plenty of flexibility and freedom."
good,They are only worried about clients and patients and they don't back up their employees.
good,"typical day at quest was getting to work at 7:20 ready to open the door at 7:30 and the work day beginning with at least 15 patients waiting for you at the door.....they would sign in on a log at would get helped one at a time we would register them in the computer take a copy of their insurance card...enter the test that we were prforming on them and print out their lables....take them back to the patient room and preform the specimen collection ......after the collection we would give them instruction on house to take care of site and say good bye......in the mean time we would also collect urine samples,..and re stock the rooms with supplies that were needed to continue our day...."
good,"Busy "
good,A typical day at work would be inputing patient information into companies system. Verifying lab order has all the correct items to be able to process appropriate lab work. Collecting blood specimens using the proper venpuncture procedure according to the age of the patient. Kept myself up to date on all new and inproved phlebotomy policy and procedures. By far worked with some of the best people ever. Was even able to make a couple of long lasting friendships.The most enjoyable part of the job were the patients. I enjoy being able to help people get and stay healthy.
good,It is a prestigious company and deals with highly esoteric assays.
good,"Keep on learning new things everyday, the hours are great for the moment"
good,"Quest is great place to work, great caring people and the benefit are just right"
good,"My typical day starts with me gathering all blood and plasma samples for testing.    I would arrange the samples in order for testing, I stored the samples, and created blood stain slides when needed.  I searched for missing specimens so that they could be tested."
good,good work place with a gymnasium. Always on your feet. Dynamic work environment representative of the U.S.A.
good,It's a good company to work for but not happy with previous upper management staff.
good,Friendly coworkers and management but the work was too repetitive.
good,Quest was a very busy place to work for. It does slow down on the weekends.
good,Quest is definitely a good employer if you do not want to advance. There is not enough room for growth opportunity.
good,"I work from 7am to 330pm in an out patient service center Monday through Friday. I preform venipuncture needle sticks on geriatric, pediatric, and bariatric patients, as well as doing drug screens. I enjoy doing my job and coming to work on a daily basis. I would say the hardest part of my job is dealing with the un-organization and being short staffed."
good,My favorite part was cutting.  I learned a lot about special stains.  Coming to work was something I looked forward to.  A new supervisor came in and everything changed for the worse.
good,"A typical day with Quest Diagnostic consisted of receiving a high volume of incoming calls, correcting and billing patient's claims, assisting patients with issues. Every day I assisted 80-130 patients. I learned how to correct claims and resolve patient issues in a timely manner. Quest helped me to effectively work in a stressful environment. Many of my coworkers were unhappy with management at the time, because there was a lot of favoritism and inter office issues, which was unprofessional.  Management would constantly inform employees that Quest was an at will employer, therefore employee’s were free to quit. Needless to say the way that management handled unhappy employees brought down the moral of the team. I had a good relationship with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job would have to be assisting irate customers that were calling about their claim balance. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers. I really enjoyed the people that I worked with. We respected each other and worked well together."
good,"The company started as Berkeley Heartlab and it was a great company to work for.  Then we got bought out by Quest Diagnostics where I thought the company did an OK job.  Some of the work procedures changed and change can be hard sometimes, especially when used to doing things one way for a long time.  I loved my co-workers.  We always helped each other out and had each others backs.  My supervisor was very understanding and worked well with us.  I just thought his communication skills maybe a little lacking and never thoroughly explained some new procedures.  My main job was data entering patient's info and I don't mind typing all day.  I actually love it.  I learned about HIPPA and also what certain blood tests represent.  Working in the lab was very educational and occasionally fun."
good,"Not a god management. No place for opportunity."
good,"Stressful day"
good,Productivity is key as well as turn around time for patient samples.
good,Collected blood and other specimens from patients and prepared them for testing
good,Gives opportunity for employee's growth by providing training on different areas in the department.
good,Alpha numerical data entry of patient demographic information into company computer system.
good,Very busy. Stay on your toes and never relax for a second there. The managers where nice. I had some very nice co workers.The hardest part was paying very close attention to detail. The hours at the job was the best part.
good,"Longevity place to work for a career. great benefits, great place work when you work as a team."
good,"Overall is good. Experiences are good to have here, management is also good but workload is heavy. "
good," not a fun place to work it is a business and is run as such. Business as usual, point blank."
good,"A great company with very fast paced enviroment. I learned about the healthcare system, testing as well as insurance companies."
good,Very productive work place. I learned the ins and outs working in a warehouse. Management were very chill but productive people. The people at the job were pretty cool. I just the job and the people that i worked with during my time there.
good,Great organization to learn about the medical laboratory industry.
good,"I wish the best to anyone who has an interest in working there. It is a great company with lots of opportunity for advancement and growth. There are many business units under Quest. My concern was with the unit where I worked. Little to no communication equals bad business. A lot of emphasis placed on integrity, ethics and ""open-door"" policy, but the ""door"" was not always ""open""."
good,Work emails about compliance/quality complaints. Investigate and resolve.
good,Quest was a temp postion so I wasent able to recieve the full benefits of the company.
good,Discussing appointments with patients for their bloodwork.
good,"High production, three shifts, team oriented environment, accuracy with (10-key) by touch Data Entry."
good,"My typical day was processing medical claims, verifying information, and being very productive. I learned about some of the different type to ICD9 codes being use, and determing which insurance was the primary for the customer. My co-workers were good to work with. The hardest part of this job was not being able to consult an co-worker if you were having a problem with a claim. All problems and questions had to be brought to the supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people I was able to work with."
good,communication from upper eschelon is sketchy currently undergoing reorganization with a lot of unknowns
good,"intense,stressful,lack of cooperation with managers, coworkers walk on egg shells, the hardest part of the job is pretending to smile due to lack of appreciation with the supervisors and managers. they are based on serving the client only and treating the employees with no respect. either we do it right or else type of attitude."
good,I am getting worried about security of my Job. Lots of changes going on in the company.
good,Its a great company to build your customer service skills in this entry level position.
good,"Very productive workplace. Just about every day you learn something different. Management is fair. Loved working with my co-workers because we worked as a team. Doing that makes the job easier. Of course you have your good days and bad days. There are times you have problems getting sticks. Or, unable to read scripts. But I do enjoy meeting the patients. There are times patients ask for me personally to service them because they liked how I took care of them in the past. Especially the parents. I want there kids to feel comfortable while getting their blood work done. It pays to joke around with your patients. It makes each others day. I enjoy being a phlebotomist."
good,"Great place to extend my knowledge. Excellent team, great facility."
good,"A really good company to work for, co-workers were pleasant (most of them), While working there I learned how to perform urine drug screens for pre employment and COC. A typical day at work consisted of drawing 60+ patients a day, answering phones, and processing the blood work that was drawn for transport to the laboratory. The most enjoyable part of the job was the patients that came in."
good,very educational and a great company. knowledge of patient care and client friendly.
good,If you have a family member that is in senior management you have a chance to advance in the company.
good,"I never got a chance to work my way up the corporate ladder at Quest Diagnostics, after 5 years of being an elemplary employee, due to a severe allergic reaction in my work environment. I learned a great deal about team work at Quest and the value of cooperation. Volunteerism was widely supported. The hardest parts of my jobs were keeping up with high production quotas. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with different departments to achieve goals. While I was promoted to do many things in each of my jobs, and have a work history and references to prove my many talents, I had to put in my time in order to move ahead at Quest. Unfortunately, my own biology ended this journey, sadly."
good,Great place for entry level and to learn and develop laboratory and research skill.
good,Fast pace made the day go by quicker. Fun environment to work in
good,Great benefits but low wages. Large turnover in management- went thru 5 supervisors in 5 years
good,"I was a IOP, Staff in the office was great. Helpful with diagnosis codes, I would call the patients back, take their insurance cards and demographics and draw their blood according to the order sheet. Spin blood and process according to set procedures."
good,"Always enjoyed working with the clients, the job had a way of making people feel better knowing that you were helping to make someone elses life easier."
good,Fast pace
good,Not many advancement opportunites.
good,Co-workers are excellent ready to help
good,"Co-workers were the hardest and most dedicated, especially at the dismantling of NID"
good,It is very difficult to move up in the company because of the reduction in force.
good,Quest Diagnostics is a good company. A typical day is busy and often times challenging. I find myself constantly learning new things and surrounded by intelligent people.
good,to be a breath of fresh air when interacting with my patients giving them the time and compassion they need. and although the patient is about to be stuck with and needle showing compassion and gentleness goes a long way.
good,A day at quest is very stressful management is not supportive my co workers are great the hardest part is management and mot enjoyable part is dealing with my patients
good,"good company to work for excellent benefits and retirement package, you are learning something new everyday, you can definitly move onto other positions if you desire."
good,I enjoyed working for Quest and there were I left because of school hours.
good,"Es un buen laboratorio clínico para adquirir experiencia, tienen un buen sistema de calidad establecido."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with clients, doctors, and coworkers. A typical day is spent on the phone, emailing, faxing reports"
good,I love when I know I have helped a patient by either going beyond what is expected or just with kind words.  Also training a coordinator to have customer service skills to make every client feel respected.
good,"This is a stable, long term job. I've only known the company to lay off from other departments. I think the pay could be better to fit today's economy."
good,Quest Diagnostics only cares about the wait time NOT their employees and  always short staff. they need to hire more people and to much work for little pay.
good,"When I was first hired things were great! As time went on we became understaffed and I myself, while in my second trimester of pregnancy, was working anywhere from 50-70+ hours weekly. Shifts would be anywhere from 12-14 hours, I worked that way for as long as I could. My residents needed me and I truly enjoyed being there for them."
good,"Lately a typical day at work was very routinary. Only the patient's challenges were making the difference. I feel that there is no significant support from the management staff. As a Lead I was assigned to perform too many supervisory tasks, some of those resulting in discrepancies with my co-workers and supervisor. As a result, my co-workers are skeptical to express their needs, feelings, and ideas. My most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with so many different patients."
good,"start at 7 am and take phone calls and make phone calls to interview applicants that applied for life or disability insurance, go over medical history and activities. Learned patience, communication skills, empathy. A Lot of people come and go, there's a high turn over rate. The work load is heavy with lots of seasonal overtime. The hardest part of the job is keeping your production numbers where they want them and the easiest part of the job is conducting the interviews. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping them attain their insurance."
good,I can not think of a lot to say abot quest. When i was there suzanne was the manager and now shes not so im pretty sure its a much better place to working
good,"The work life balance is good and for the work the pay is competitive.   Courier work can be stressful because you are working in all kind of weather and traffic in the Atlanta area. "
good,Fast pace working environment. Employees are not encouraged to work as a team. Management do not care about  employees health or well being. It about their work.
good,"Managed and performed clinical trial testing for the immunology depart. A typical day would be prepping for the test, performing the test, analyzing, and completing a report of the test results."
good,"I was a medical courier. "
good,"Would recommend it for someone who's just entering the workforce, but not as a career. If one is looking for a supervisorial/management role, but what needs to be considered is that there are many skilled, talented employees who are not cut out for management. The bean counters at the top need to realize that everyone from the CEO to the employees at the bottom, has a unique talent and would excel in something even if there may not be a future for them here."
good,"It was good for a while but recently it's gone downhill. The people are good, until it comes to the leadership teams. they set unreachable standards and blame the team when there is no work."
good,Ok for those who want a steady pay to provide for there families and can balance their nights and days oppose to the normal time sleep schedule. Off weekends.
good,Some of the people are great others not so much. I wanted to switch positions but was not allowed because they couldn’t find anyone to replace me! Also yearly bonuses aren’t great.
good,The culture of the company was very interesting and the possibility of lifetime connections (friends) was endless. Goal driven associates and understanding management.
good,"A typical day at Quest Diagnostics is usually busy in the mornings due to, fasting patients and slows down in then after noon. In then 6 years of employment, a large window of opportunities were opened from such as becoming a floater to psr3 performed drug screening, insurance exam1s ect."
good,Mostly a good place to work unless you have certain supervisors some are very vendictive and there’s no one to report to. There are no exit interviews
good,Cubicle style work environment. Employee communication was fair. Customer service and telemarketing style job. Laboratory attached to main personal offices.
good,"Like my title states, the company has some really outrageous, unrealistic productivity expectations of their RSR's/Couriers. My experience with Quest was unpleasant and brief. I was extremely turned off during my training once I firsthand witnessed the unrealistic amount of stops to collect patient samples each RSR/Courier was expected to complete within a route and timeline while utilizing the ""Smith"" system of safe driving protocols; laughable, unrealistic, and ridiculous -- comparable to the saying ""You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig"". The company can push the Smith safe driving system all they want, but the fact remains they're still requiring that you perform an extremely high number of pickups relative to a short amount of time, which in my mind equates to an extremely rushed employee out there on the road employing whatever means necessary to get all their pickups completed. Ultimately, I lasted one week on the job before coming to the irrefutable determination that I was not suited to the high pressure, demanding environment. In addition; I personally found the in office personalities of other drivers to be tough talking and confrontational. I seriously was shocked and hated the toxic environment. For these reasons I did not last but a week, unfortunately, because compensation and superb benefits like what Quest offers from day one are almost unheard of these days. Even still, for me the high stress and demands of the route coupled with the mean, tough talking drivers were enough to make me walk."
good,Overall Quest Diagnostics is a good place to work... The departments collaborate with each to ensure both the clients and patients receive accurate and timely results...
good,"Quest Diagnostics overall is a great place to work. Very little micromanaging. My biggest issue with Quest is the pay. From doing research, I have found that the pay is much below the national average."
good,"Very fast pace, friendly, mostly driving all 8 "
good,"This job could be really good if there was accountability in the office.  This area is lacking sorely and until that improves, the needle will never get to where it should be on a daily basis."
good,"I truly enjoy my job on a daily basis, but the lack of communication from Management is astounding. Sometimes I feel like I am set up by management to fail. If I have a deadline.. you make sure you to pile multiple things on top of my responsibilities..therefore I am unable to make my deadlines."
good,"Quest diagnostics is a good place to work if you are looking to work somewhere for a long time, and you are complacent and enjoy office politics. During that time I worked for quest there was a change in upper management Which had any affect on many different departments. Management is ran from outside the country."
good,Quest Diagnostics is a great company with rich history that has a mix of your fresh management cultures and old antiquated management cultures.  The work life balance and compensation makes it worth the struggle to reconcile how anyone in 2018 is still not using all the available technologies to ease work flow.
good,"The management at Quest is not very good. Their focus is strictly on the business. What they employees feel, means absolutely nothing. Management really needs to listen to their employees without an employee feeling like there is a target on their back for speaking up."
good,"Good place to get exposure of all Healthcare standards/formats."
good,"very fast pace"
good,Good company but got harassed by patients all the time and my supervisor and manager never did anything about it. Very  busy! Benefits are very good and they provide uniforms.
good,The pay isn't what it should be so you better love what you do and you may be moved around a lot even though you didn't apply for that particular site its all about the company remember its a corporation your expendable.
good,"Everyone got along here. A very big family here. Worked more than 8 hrs a day usually, but didn't mind it because of how close everyone is and how much fun we have."
good,"Great place to work that is very diverse. "
good,Quest Diagnostics is a great company to work for. Its a great place to get training and be challenged day to day. Provides great benefits for you and your family.
good,"This is a good job the allows you to move up in the company if you work hard, I enjoy that they are willing to work with you and around your schedule."
good,"Quest is a large corporate reference laboratory and behaves as such. It's hard to make any changes to adjust to your environment. Benefits are great. Recognition points are given for reward gift cards, items or other things. Lots of paperwork and confusing procedures. Some people loved it, some people didn't like it, depends on the person. This taught me problem solving skills and problem prevention. Working here made me a well rounded lab tech."
good,This company offers excellent compensation.  The pay is the highest in the local area. There is room for growth within the company and they offer tuition reimbursement for degrees  associated with the company.
good,"I've been in the health care field for over 24 years, I've started out working as an Certified Nursing Assistant. From there I went back know to school to become a Phlebotomist/EKG technician, than I went back to become a Medical Assistant in 2002. I would like to go and finish getting my RN Degree. I would really like to put all my knowledge and experience I've accumulated working in the health care field to work for a thriving company."
good,the company is great for people who want to advance in the medical industry. It has great benefits and provides a work life balance and development for employees.
good,"worked at quest on behalf of wipo ltd. "
good,I do not feel a review of this company is sufficient at this time. Putting in a review in order to move to the next page to see indeed job postings is quite ridiculous.
good,"Fairly stable company with good revenue growth.  Excellent teamwork among lab testing professionals. Senior management not very ""visible"" to line employees."
good,This job is about learning and being able to apply the knowledge to answering questions from customers about their bills and insurance and E O B questions
good,This job provides stability for its employees. The department I work for really employ work and life balance. Overall most people are pleasant to work with.
good,"A lot of samples processed daily with associated paperwork completed and results reviewed and released."
good,Very productive company. Hard to balance work and life. Requires mandatory overtime. Good pay and benefits. You get to meet alot of good people from different backgrounds. Management can be better.
good,Quest bought our company.  Extremely bumpy transition.  Supervisor has extremely poor communication skills which leads to poor moral......................
good,"Picked up diagnostics samples to and from doctors offices around the city."
good,"greeting all employee's in the department"
good,"Company was excellent place to work and treated employees with respect. New CEO downsized IT, probably on bad advice/metrics from others. Not enough Support Personnel to do the job correctly since downsizing."
good,My reason for leaving this job was not a good experience for me. I was terminated because of pulled out of work medically that would not let me do my job at my best and did not have enough time to qualify for medical family leave
good,My co-workers were the best part of the job.  The job was challenging and very busy. Some of the management staff promoted advancement.
good,"This is a good company to work for, however, there is lack of job security and opportunities for advancement.  They have excellent benefits, management and training."
good,"I came in there with no experience on data entry and I never work in a laboratory . It was a really cool environment, good people. They taught me alot . Management was going thru some dramatic changes."
good,Quest diagnostics is a good place to work especially co-workers I am working with are very professional .I learned a lot   and get familiar with new tests and machines for the tests.
good,"Under paid for all the responsibilities of the job, sometimes very understaffed, supervisors did not always address problems."
good,"Working at Quest is definitely a plus if you are looking for stability. you will learn a lot but there is not much growth here. Even yearly salary increases are on the low end.  It is very competitive if you want a management position and upper management is harsh on budgets. Everyone is micromanaged. Most coworkers are awesome, depends on your department."
good,A typical day at work is exciting and joyful. The things that I've learned alway's provide well service and do your job to the highest potential you can. Management needs to be fair when it comes to an employee concern or need. My co-workers work as a team and alway's giving there best each and everyday when coming to work. Hardest part of a job would be knowing how to handle certain situations when coming among them. Most enjoyable part of a job is knowing that you can make a person feel good after you have provided good service to them.
good,management needed to be upgraded at quest to many changes to the company. to bad our old president left.
good,enjoyable environment with help available 24 hours a day. Learning experience.
good,"A typical day at work starts around 8-8:30 with preparations for the 9:30 recap/operations meeting. After the meeting, my reports are prepared for distribution to all executives, managers and supervisors. My day than continues with normal and/or extensive administrative duties. My position supports the Client Service Manager and supervisors, which allows me to interact with phone representatives on a daily basis. I provide support to an office of about 20 or more, but mainly for the Managers. The hardest part of my job would honestly be making sure I meet client satisfaction in a timely manner. Working in healthcare, you deal with very sensitive and confidentional issues daily, so you always want to make sure you deliver with minimal to zero error! The most enjoyable part of the job are the relationships you build with client, Doctors and co-workers! Working here under management as taught me to become a more effective leader and a bigger voice not only for myself but the company. I am a much stronger Administrative Assistant!"
good,Great company with good benefits. Not much room in this territory for advancement. Must be self-sufficient and a very patient person.
good,I liked my job.  They said they needed to save money because sales were down so they needed to let me go.
good,"I am proud to work for a reputable company. However, I do not believe their is room for growth or advancement in my department. I am ready to use my education and skills with a company who needs me and where I can earn a salary commensurate with my education level."
good,"this is a good place to work if your are permanent, hard to get converted from contact to permanent, allow to work remotely everybody except Valenica office (but depends on manager), director of IT is out of loop on what is going on in the teams....."
good,"Quest is a great company. In the past year allot of corporate changes were made, leaving employees with no room for advancement. Unfortunately the events within the past year have caused allot of turnover, leaving current employees shorthanded."
good,"The most rewarding part of working for Quest Diagnostics was having satisfied clients/patients. As far as the company goes, the pay was ok and the hours were good. However, management rarely acknowledged a job well done, they did not value their employees, the rules were very strict, and getting a day off was like taking an act of congress. It wasn't the worst job ever but I wouldn't recommend it."
good,"Performed various venipunctures on patients for blood work "
good,"Management was very professional and showed good leadership skills. The employees were very professional and I learned a lot. "
good,"When I first started to work for Quest Diagnostics it was ultimately a dream job, where there was plenty advancement awaiting. Management and co-workers got along and cohabitated in an awesome work environment. In my 11 years experience at Quest Diagnostics, they have always seem to genuinely care for their employees well being and growth. I have personaly and intellectually advanced and grew while working here at Quest. The hardest part of my job is the most favorable, my sales team intrusted me with a lot of responsibility day to day to see that task are done completely and accurately. Unfortunately within the past two years Quest Diagnostics has lost it moral and is undergoing a total reconstruction of the company including many of layoffs. Group functions and training advancements have ceased. Moral has become negitive. I'd like to move forward in my career with more opportunity and leave the Quest Diagnostics on a positive note!"
good,"Quest Lab is a good company. People here are fun and friendly in-spite of the overwhelming workload. The benefits are decent and the salary is fair. I can say that there is job security in this company. The work environment is alright, not that big nor small. Everything you need like paper, pens, and other supplies are sufficient. Lab gowns and other protective gears are also readily available. It is very organized, clean, and it's a non-smoking institution."
good,A hectic work load coupled with some unfriendly coworkers made for a stressful environment. Management was more cooperative.
good,I enjoyed promoting new products to physicians. Could have used more support in the field.
good,"get patients orders from front office look over, call patient back to lab. check thier ID and Insurance Information, Enter infromation into computer. ask if fasting?"
good,A typical work day is very busy with feeling overworked at times sometimes the Patient Service Center is not staffed properly for the patient load (great deal of stress).
good,There isn’t so many events all year long so there’s isn’t a lot of work for long periods of time. You rarely will get 40 hours in a week. Plus side is you make your own schedule and if you want it or not you get a lot of time off
good,Good Job for a stepping stone. The job is stressful because management is unprofessional and favoritism is shown throughout all departments. Company feels that quantity is more important then quality.The only good thing from Quest would be the benefits from Insurance and The Company as a whole.
good,"If someone got hurt don't compare them"
good,I enjoyed working for the company because I enjoyed the family atmosphere. After working for the company for almost 20 years I was disappointed about my layoff as well my co workers being laid off.
good,"typical day at work was fine, walk in, get the day started, draw blood spin blood and pour it off, send it off to the correct derartment in a timely manner."
good,Hands down one of the best places to work as far as benefits go.  Hard to get time off especially if department is understaffed or if volume is up.  Great 401K and FSA.
good,Overall..enjoyed working there. I was rewarded for my achievements. Minimal supervision. Aloud to listen to music with head phones as we keyed..with very little interruption.
good,"Technical research in the laboratory computer system, identifying problems and correcting them. Searching for missing specimens in the laboratory facility. Receiving calls from client services and helping them with their questions. Making calls to other laboratories to request specimens and to clarify whether they sent the right specimen type."
good,"It's not a job that takes a lot of thought, but this also means that it's not mentally stimulating.  There is room for advancement if you seek it, but the training will not come from within the company."
good,Not enough time to do it. Expected to be fully up and running solo in 12 months. Move from one technology to another and back again without full understanding either. New languages and technology introduced frequently. Evolved into a development position.
good,stressful environment and lack of knowledge within the supervisors  and manger doesn't know how to run the call center and delegate job duties and the was a negative work environment
good,"The company could try to follow the Six SIgma principles they claim to follow more closely, but seem to focus more on numbers produced at individual sites instead of being its self-proposed customer focused and employee involved motto. "
good,I worked at Quest Diagnostics for almost 30 years. I started at SmithKline Lab which was brought out by Quest Diagnostics Laboratory. I remained with Quest Diagnostics Laboratory after the buyout.
good,It has been a great place to work just need somewhere closer to home. This is a very fast paced job. I enjoy interacting with applicants and performing there exams.
good,"A typical day can be stressful but rewarding after work is done. "
good,This is your ideal started job when your are coming out into the working world. Even if your seeking retirement and looking for a less demanding job. It’s best to be financially stable before considering a position in this company.
good,Quest Diagnostic is a high intense place to work. The hours needs to be well informed when you first apply. The work load is massive and not a lot of help.
good,This was a ok place at first but no sick time and you have to take about 100 calls a day one after another I need something else to do other then a call center
good,"a typical day at work, cant say enough its a huge company that's growing each and everyday and a company you can better yourself at. learn the basics."
good,With this job it was a lot of learning. I learned things that made me say hummm it was not a bad hummm but aw ok I'm glad I was here. I love learning and at Quest Diagnostics you will. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"La empresa nos adiestraba continuamente, buscaba la mejoría para el empleado, buenos beneficios y aumentos de sueldo anualmente."
good,"Very busy work days with many challenges and often short staffed. Quest has made many changes recently and is more geared towards patient counts and making money than patient care, work environment, quality supplies, the needs of client accounts, or the work place environment or employee/management relations than they used to be. Management has been put under pressure to meet counts and decrease wait times while decreasing staff  this has made their job very stressful and it reflects in the way they communicate with their staff.  Most Quest employees are extremely competent and work very well as a team."
good,"excellent experience, great environment, fast pace, great coworkers, good healthcare, room for advancement and growth, long hours, lots of work, rewarding field,"
good,"nice place to work, most of the staff are really nice people. company has some nice perks...cafeteria in one of the buildings and flex time is always great."
good,Okay company to work for.  I dont feel there is much room for advancement. Scheduling is nice . Some rules are a little over board but for the most part its a fair company.
good,Great benefits. Pay is ok. Typical day is 8 hours with occasional overtime. Great time off with pay. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the changes in healthcare insurance.
good,"benefits and yearly goal sharing is what kept me there...but the drama is HORRIBLE. Even when getting HR involved nothing gets done. People are 50+ years old and are causing drama like little school girls and it doesn't matter if you are the most talented in the room...they will always give the jobs to the people they are closer too! All political!! So yes, great job for techs but not for processors"
good,I was workimg for them under contract  met some amazing people but did not have the proper training for the job at all its like each day I was there I had to learn something knew that they didnt teach in training at all
good,I really liked working at this company. My manager was one of those managers that you would go the extra mile for if she/he needed you too.
good,"A typical day for me consist of collected the specimen, print out the pending list, collect all specimens . I  prepare the specimen, creating a worksheet to run the test.   Help the technologist with different tasks: answering customers calls from internal and external, picking up specimens  from different departments or storage room. "
good,"a typically day at quest diagnostic. I see bout 70 to 100 patients, childern, babies, elderly, also putting in orders, processing specimens, send out, gestational testing, etc. You will learn how to enter labs, process, learn the professional way to handle patients. The coworker are friendly and fun to work with, and they help make the day go by a a lot faster. the enjoyable part is clocking out when u completed your work"
good,A very busy company with exceptionally high standards and high demands. Patient satisfaction and comfort is always main focus so I have learned exceptional multitasking skills and how to take care of patients to the best of my ability.
good,"The  management made the environment very stressful and frustrated. You are not allow to talk to anyone while work, but only certain people of certain race are allow to do so. If you want to advance he will create obstacles for you not to advance. No appreciation for employees, manager just makes all employees get in a very bad attitude and stress everyone.  co-workers are great but management is so unprofessional and rude to employees. No confidentiality at all.We lost alot of great coworkers recently due to the EGO of the manager. I for warn u before you apply(The manager is VERY SELFISH, Has a BAD TEMPER, The Supervisor is no help if we shorthanded and we are occasionally you would think one of them will come out and help being this supposed to be a team thing, No they leave early and complain they dont pay me enough"
good,Entering patients demographics  of Lab testing and blood work into labs computer system. To meet companies timely dead line before the end of the shift.
good,"I loved working with this company, in order to work this particular position you have be very career oriented and be willing to travel at least 75 to 100 percent of the time."
good,"A typical day is getting assigned my days tickets and prioritizing them.  Once I was assigned my tickets, I would start resolving them.  I learn how to do validation testing and quality assurance in connectivity.  Management was great and very easy to work with.  My co-workers were wonderful and helped when and where they could and were very supportive and great to work with.  The hardest part of my job was problem solving and knowing who I could turn to for assistance.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping and assisting the clients to resolve their connectivity issues.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers."
good,"Making outbound calls to labs to provide lab results. Call doctor's offices and other labs to verify insurance, provided lab instructions to patients."
good,"a typical work day is answering about 75 to 100 calls a day. Helping caller set up accounts, finding location to have a drug test completed."
good,Very busy and fast paste working environment. I've learned to how to be compassionate and patients working with this company. Management depending on what cluster your working with is very stressful and inconsistent. My co-workers where outstanding and my working at Quest worth the while. working with them was the best part of my job we all worked together as a team and put patients in front of everything we do.
good,"My job is far too easy. I find myself working on auto-pilot and still performing better than most of my coworkers. We are in the business of saving lives, and too many people in this company do not care about getting the work done accurately and on time. This has a profoundly negative impact on the patients and the physicians that care for them. The consistently poor performance is tolerated, and even rewarded. No one is held accountable to the mistakes that they make. If you are lazy and think you deserve credit just for showing up (I have actually heard someone say this to a supervisor, and their employment continued.), this is the job for you."
good,"Comparable wages.  Enjoy my work and my patients. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with my patients. A typical day consists of entering patients into the data system, drawing the specimens required, spinning down the blood, and packaging samples."
good,I am satisfied with the work environment but not the ability to grow. I rotate in many departments and do a little of this and that on a daily basis
good,"You never know what you are walking into every morning in Client Services due to the many contributing factors that sets the tone for our day.  I would not change this for the world....multi-tasking and prioritizing is what I do best."
good,"I would arrive at work 10 minutes early for a little time to myself, that would never happen there were always one to six people waiting t"
good,"large clinical testing reference laboratory"
good,"My typical day starts as soon as I get to work, Clock in at 6:30am we have patients meeting us at the door non stop until 3:30pm. I've learned to stay positive in every situation. The management is in and out, all my co-workers work hard and the most enjoyable part of my day is that I work hard to do my best to help someone."
good,A good company to work for offer great benefit packages. A great place to work and learn all about working for a Reference lab.
good,"Good places to obtain knowledge on new technologies"
good,"Hard work, weak pay, little recognition.  "
good,"Monitoring client issues"
good,"alot of driving ,they do not pay mileage, weather conditions vary can make driving to clients home difficult at times. Good flexibility in schedule"
good,"Quest has by far the best people to work with.  Though the job is very demanding, the people make it worth it."
good,"I have some mixed feelings about this company. On one hand, the experience I gained while working here was tremendous. I learned a lot that helped me progress in my area of expertise, however, work distribution within my department could have been handled better. The work environment was comfortable and employees were easy to get along with. Benefits here at the time were excellent. Medical benefits, 401k, stock options, among other great employee benefits like discounts for many goods and services were second to none."
good,"My primary job duties was to setup new customers information and edit existing customer information into the database provided by our Sales team. Ordered and trouble-shoot data line for customer use. Worked closely with the Information Systems department on special projects tailored to meet customer needs (i.e. customize requisition)."
good,"Worked there for five years.  It isn't bad at all.  Management trusts you to do your job.  If you don't, you will get told about it but they are professional about everything."
good,"Provided accurate, timely planning, coordinating, and budgeting on approved projects. Worked with other project managers, lab directors, and contracted labor on the implementation of new software/ hardware needed to improve patient care. Learned the in and outs of how labs/ doctor offices work. My management ones one of the best I have ever worked under. I had a great team that I worked with throughout the department nation wide."
good,"the company as a whole has some great people; not specifically in my department, but i have many friends from throughout the building! The benefits in this company are fantastic, numerous holidays and almost 3 weeks vacation after your 90 day period, great health, dental, and vision plans, and many other perks."
good,"typical day consisted of visiting medical offices, marketing lab testing, computer connectivity, and dealing with any billing issues due to medicare, or insurance issues. Also, communicate with sales support to verify request are completed."
good,Desk bound
good,Quest Diagnostics is an overall good place to work for. There will definitely always be job security here.
good,"I love my job. My job is why I stay at Quest.  I am helping people and that's what matters to me. I feel like there is quite a bit of favoritism.  Some people do what they want and nothing is said..some can't.  Some people are very shady. One minute they're speaking to you and the next, they act like you just killed their dog! As long as you don't care what ppl think, this is a great job."
good,Great job management is great the office I work in was pleasant my manager was great would get things done for us make sure the office run smoothly and we have everything to get the job done
good,"Fun workplace, though it is very fast-paced. Errors are documented and accounted for and an employee should not make more than 1-2 errors per month. Employees are able to have fun and talk while working, which was the best part of the job."
good,I was inside sales because of a non compete agreement.   The environment wasn't conducive to learning or forging employee bonds.    The pricing was unfairly high for patients and it was difficult to hear patients talk to me about how they couldn't afford testing for a chronic illness.
good,I love what I do in drawing blood and interaction with my patients but my management  think they know my patients more than I do when i have been with them for 3 years and they have 0 experience with them and try to tell me how to do my job but yet don't know a thing about what I do on a daily basis in my office
good,Quest provides improvements related to clients and customers although employees are expected to do too much and as a result mistakes happen that affect clients and patients.
good,"It was a pretty decent place to work. Stayed busy during work day"
good,"The really need to consider years of experience and knowledge of the skill and only keep it to that factor. We are not bill collectors as the front line but apparently we are the only ones that are bringing in the revenue. They need to consider experience and skill into the phlebotomist work habits or they will loose a lot of skilled people. They need to see how competitive it is between the hospitals and other labs to negotiate accurate start pay and not start them from the base pay. I have over 14 years experience and I am floored that they have started me at their base pay with no experience. I deserve more and also travel pay since I current do not work in my living city. I am placing too many miles on my car and have already changed out my tires for maintenance. They do have good benefits but I have to wait a year until I can use the education, but the health, dental, and vision are good."
good,"Very supportive coworkers."
good,"They hire highly polished, professional sales reps who have high standard of work ethic.  The company provides great benefits.  There is always changes in sales direction but seem to fall back to what works rather quickly"
good,"Nice job to have, "
good,"it was a great place to work, I miss it. Life took a turn and I had to take some time from work. My coworker were the best. The only thing I would change would be I wish it was not so far away but you do what you have to do. I really liked working with patient and being able to help others was a great joy. I look forward to the next adventure."
good,"Maybe it's different now so I won't say anything bad, nice management. Awesome days off and wonderful team players just really slow with business at the time"
good,"quest diagnostics is an overall great place to work at. Its very face pace so you would need to be able to multitask and keep up with the work flow. The hours however are long, especially overnight hours."
good,"Learning the medical terms and conversing with Doctor  and nurses on there level helped me understand my task and with that in mind i was more efficient."
good,I am a quest float my schedule is not a set schedule so I can drive from east freeway all the way to Baytown .  sometimes I get off at 4pm or sometimes not until 5:15 the hardest part of my job is the driving floating is not what I expected to be looking for a more stable job closer to home
good,It's a good company to work for but there needs to be a change in management.It's a fast pace job which makes the day go by quick.
good,I think Quest Diagnostics should care about there staff. They keep on changing procedures when incident happens. Need to know that some staff working graveyard should get more and the management should listen to us more.There is more to this company then what it could be. We should be able to contact the proper people there. when there is a problem. There are different shifts and the Grave yard shift is the hardest..
good,Overall a good place to work.  Flexibility with hours.  Pleasant working environment. Decent staff.  Pro Health.  Encourage you to keep up with your health since it is a medical company.
good,"Good place to work for continue for more education."
good,"Low Pay, and almost no room for advancement.  Too political.  You must wait in-line for about 5 to 10 people to get a promotion.  Even if you are more qualified than the rest."
good,"I was here as a temp. Pretty much a good office setting. My only complaint is communication, if you feel someone isn't doing their job well enough then to let them know and offer some tips."
good,"Inland Vault and Security was the leading Vault company in the southern california area. However, advancement was not an option. The pay was ok, but the management needed improvement."
good,I worked for this company for many years. When I told them about a office that was in violation I receved no support from this company. I do not feel I would recomend this company. There are unsafe situations that need to be addressed.
good,"Pretty good company.  Flexible schedule, if you're not a customer service rep."
good,Hardest part of the job is the work is very tedious. Hours are very flexible.
good,I really enjoyed meeting all the creative people working to drive solutions as Quest Diagnostics.
good,"Quest Diagnostics Clinical Trials is my first job here in the US. I learned a lot with regards to testing serum, plasma, urine, and blood to different assays. A typical day at work, I maintain instruments, do PM, calibrations, testing of specimen, among many other things. Hardest part of the job is the volume of work being done, although I do not mind it since I am very much used to it already and i enjoy what I do. The most enjoyable part of the job, besides the work itself, is working with good natured coworkers."
good,aprendí muchisimas cosas y creo que este ha sido el trabajo en el que mas he aprendido en cuestion de oficina y medicina
good,"good coworkers / bad management, Enjoyed what I did and was looked up to by coworkers and CLS students for my experience and expertise in training and troubleshooting. I was the main go to person for anything involved in Cardiac testing and eletrophoresis assays."
good,"dealing with clients is great but no room for advancement, im looking for a job i can advance in."
good,"Working with fellow employees and teammates made for a tolerable worksite. Jobs were programmed per depts and one was required to follow all procedures as assigned with a daily quality control review,"
good,"Boring And Hard, a bunch of 3 year old can manage this place better but overall good company"
good,if you apply here you must be prepared to work long hours and be able to keep up with the pace and handle high call volume during peak time also you will be required to maintain specific metrics in order to continue to work for the company
good,Supervisor was good and worked with you well. Paid well and closed for inclement weather. Co workers were team players and willing to help whenever needed
good,"If management were better, it would have absolutely been the perfect job for me. My coworkers are amazing and hardworking, and the collaboration with other departments is wonderful."
good,Definitely a good start for someone fresh off CPT certification. Coworkers are awesome and hours are in abundance. Lots of work to learn right away so definitely keep a sharp eye and ears. Compensation is good but not great. Benefits are pretty good as well.
good,"When I first started at Quest it was 'the' place all phlebotomists wanted to work. But when the new CEO came on board a lot changed. I felt that my job was no longer about the patients but the bottom dollar. I learned a lot at Quest and spent my last 2 years as a float, mostly working solo. The pay and benefits were great but in the end the comradeship between fellow workers faded and it almost seemed as though some were encouraged by talking out of school. I miss the work but not the politics."
good,"A typical day busy, which I like it make the day go by fast. The hardest part of my job, no support from my supervisor are there was no accountability toward employees."
good,Coworkers were great to be around. At times it can be distracting with open atmosphere.The work is challenging and fast paced. Able to move between departments to learn new tests is a plus. Solid company with good benefits.
good,The work place and employess were kind and hard working. The management could have been better. When it pertained to situations  that may have been a misunderstanding managemenet allowed their personal differences to get in the way and made it a hard time for me to work there.
good,great benefits I had but underpaid for all the job that had to be done plus on the downside had to work from home. One thing I miss the most is having such great and helpful co-workers and manager was always very understanding.
good,"Its extremely a lot of driving and long distant driving on the weekends...other lane that, management is very cool and you can advance in the company overtime."
good,"Make sure rotating schedules were made, work flow was running smooth, employees were accounted for. Search to ensure test kits arrived for internal clients or look up Identification slips for information regarding client. Daily or weekly maintenance on Label printers and Image trac machines. Would correspond daily with other supervisors on any special tasks and relay it to employees. Fill in on Production line or Imaging if needed. Run reports to keep track of work flow. Filled in for Training supervisor as needed, checking employees attendance/tardies, running reports and working on the Kronus attendance system"
good,"Very busy all the time. I love interacting with people. I was always a team player. If a person is experienced, and know what they are doing, they should not have any hard part of a job. The most enjoyable part is when you get things done right, and make people feel happy."
good,"Compare data with source documents, or re-enter data in verification format to detect errors (light Data Typing)"
good,"Quest Diagnostics was a contract position. I loved working there. Management was wonderful and provided all the tools necessary to be able to complete my job to my fullest on a day to day basis. I wanted to continue working there however, they did not have it in their budget to hire me on full time."
good,i enjoyed the work place i enjoy working with people i learned how to take care of people i never had a problem with my coworkers and my manager was very nice and understanding to help me understand the job better
good,Quest Diagnostics was a great place to work with wonderful people to work with.
good,The job was ok for me I just didn't like how the operate in there if an employer don't like you they will tell the supervisor to get you written up I was mad
good,Just like any other job you have good things and bad things. Working at Quest is what you make it but also what your teammates help you maintain and there is a lack of that.
good,Working with this company can be very difficult at times and very stressful. They have a good incentive program and you get 5 paid holidays off a year.
good,Quest was good to me. I had lots of opportunities to travel and transfer which I did several times. Quest Diagnostics is a good company to work for with great benefits.
good,I love my job and I also like helping people. It’s a wonderful company.I have been employed at Quest Diagnostics for many years. I file insurance work with different groups of people and also train other phlebotomist.
good,"Accession specimens, correct problems, cover slip slides and prepare stains for the cytologist. Work closely with the cytology lab with sharing specimens."
good,First thought great company  i was very excited at first to work for a well known company. Hours were great   Training was a little long. Major problem was management acted as if they really didn't care. after working for a few months you start to feel like a number not an employee. A slap in the face is you do not receive anything for Christmas not even a card.  one big positive is the pay is good for part time!
good,"I am leaning a lot at this company and feel its a good starting place, but really not a long term place to work. Five years would be to long of a time frame to work here."
good,"great place to learn, and see what phlebotomy is all about. tons of people you can lean from. work is very fast paced, lots of overtime, pay is okay, but for a new phleb starting is great."
good,"I enjoyed working there, good team work, always room to move up, co-workers were great, manager was great , benefits were great, keeping you updated on all the latest procedures"
good,it was a good space to work in with benefits and great work hours.
good,enjoy working at hga quest because i get to travel alot and meet new people and also learn about alot of stuff there about tools and build light fixtures and etc the hardest part of the job was the lifting but after awhile start getting into it all my co works was also cool expescially ny bosses . the most enjoyable part was when we done the job and seeing the store maniger face after job was done how please they was and said we have done a job
good,Very much like one big family Good place to work.Management is good Generally everyone is very supportive and remain professional. I learned a lot in term of how lab's function
good,"We are always busy, overtime is required when work dose not complete with in a day. I learned a lot of things with in the last 2 years. Work is very easy nothing to complained. It's an excellent place to work."
good,"Information, I'm frequency not without with time also pretend about there translate but not owe think same urgent whether company quality, Other an interview with that how doing with but can't talk about perhaps easy first them bring and immediate while an interpreter and American Sign Language same I am deaf normal whole they're disabilities might the public make citizens a coordinate."
good,I learned a lot from Quest including how to analyze accounts to find corrections for lost money. The associated who worked at Quest were hardworking underpaid people.
good,"The clients are a joy to be around. They are very sweet and for the most part easy to take care of. A typical days work isn't very hard, is rather smooth."
good,"learned a lot, lots of benifits. Temp assignment ended, wish I was there longer"
good,This company was very challenging and fast paced. When you got off work you definitely knew you worked hard. But it definitely prepares you for any other phlebotomy position thats to come for sure. They say once you work at quest you can work anywhere.
good,I absolutely loved working here. I was able to move up quickly by working hard and staying focused. If your looking to goof off and move up this isnt the job for you
good,I did enjoy working with the staff.  They were helpful to find me work I just disliked the mopping work and odd hours. I worked at night at the basketball stadium and that was fine I was just tired.  I also worked production and the boss was somewhat upset at the workers and I really wasn't enjoying that but for the most part everything went smoothly.
good,"Very good work and family culture"
good,"Quest Diagnostics has a great training program,  I felt comfortable on the call center floor immediately.  I provided lab results to medical offices and physicians.  "
good,Loved making a difference in sick peoples lives. Working closely with physicians to treat patients with proper medications etc.
good,Very stressful fast paced. The supervisors are good but the upper management does not do a very good job in my opinion.Not a very stable job because of the management.
good,every employee has a quota.  You are given only 7 minutes to enter patient info and complete blood draw.  No new skills learned.  Management is terrible and not family orientated.none
good,Quest was great to work for until we got new higher up management and a lot of our old supervisors left. Leaving quest i learned a lot and got a lot of training on different areas of testing. I also trained a few new hires at different locations which is why i traveled. A typical day at work was seeing anywhere from 60-120 patients a day with 3 on staff. It was very fast paced but it made the day go by quicker.
good,"A typical day complete/approve over 200 interviews(insurance apps.)"
good,"I worked for a very small group with a very, very high call volume ."
good,Quest was a great place to work -- at first. The issue with quest is the management - and them not wanting to train you or give you the resources necessary to advance further in the company. Managers/supervisors get intimidated when you are a good worker and sabotage you.
good,"I worked at Quest for many years with little opportunity for growth. Managers are not leaders and the company lacks transparency. Corporate is pro employee, but local management needs work."
good,Overall it would have been a great place to work if management was experienced and professional.  I did not enjoy my time there because I felt there was to many issues going on in the company that need to be resolved.
good,"Drive and pick up medical samples across the area."
good,"a typical day at work involved being most productive and finishing your entire workload in order to get home before the sun came up! i learnt that ergonomics is helpful. doctors' offices are extremely productive! and that it takes a well run team for a lab to function.  i also learnt that the work attitude at overnight is not much different from the daytime attitude.  there are all types of businesses functioning at night.  management was medieval. most of the co workers were effective and productive team players and there was a 'family' environment since most shared the same experience of being parents.  the hardest part of the job was carrying another persons' workload after you'd finished your own.  the most enjoyable part of the job was the office social functions, like halloween dress up, and when management catered dinner, for thanksgiving and christmas!"
good,Quest is a busy company to work for. In the years of employment I have mastered the art of venipuncture. The job itself is enjoyable! One of the draw backs working every Saturday and no room for advancement. 
good,Management is not very good. They speak to you with such disrespect. Pay is not good unless you’re part time...then you get a differential. Very fast paced with not enough staff. But we made it fun. I enjoyed meeting everyone and doing my job. I love phlebotomy! Office was very clean and neat! Good training if you work with the right people.
good,Working at Quest was great. The pay was great and you had a lot of overtime. opportunity for advancement. It was a big company but you still were treated as an individual. I highly recommend working at quest.
good,"I was an intern at Quest for a short time, but learned many new skills: hard sticks, pediatric sticks, dialysis patients and learned I will create my own tricks to the trade. blood collection in patients vary from vein to vein. Some patients have fear and others don't"
good,What I enjoy most about my job is building relationships with my clients.  A lot of paperwork in a typical day.  The hardest part of my job is trying to create balance in my life.
good,"This job was fun, physically demanding, and challenging. You receive a route to run daily to pick up medical specimens, then have a a nextel phone to receive additional call-ins from doctors. You have to keep your specimens at the correct temperatures and well as keeping count of them. The work environment was good, most people were nice, though ultimately I had conflicts with other employees and had to leave. A lot of boomers on my shift fighting for their job and being jerks. Overall the the job was great, the company not very loyal to employees."
good,"I've only been there a short time,overall for part time work it's been good for me"
good,you are going to service over 25-30 patients a day. very very under staffed and management doesn't care they only care about their wait times and easy pay. you are only a number here. The hardest part of the job is to have to rush through servicing each patient.
good,"Working at Quest through the Agency allowed me to draw blood from a variety of patients paving the way for my experience, with pediatrics and geriatrics."
good,Quest is a good place to work. As I have accomplished and attained further education I feel the need to move up in my career and increase my responsibilities and utilize my newly acquired skills and knowledge.
good,"very fast paced. Per diem work . Must commit months prior to actual event. Play out favorites. Protocol enforcement does not exist. "
good,A typical work day can be very stressful due to management from the business unit whose looking from behind the computer desk all day regarding numbers and metrics.
good,It's a solid job for a young adult with not many responsibilities. Once I had children I had to go. Overnight schedule is the big drawback for me. Other than that if you hit your hourly goals you'll be fine.
good,Expectations are extremely high. Worked hours are expected to be over 50+ hours to meet the demands of clients. Being in healthcare employees often are over worked. This company is no different.
good,Work long hours due staffing challenges within the department...the company can be very rewarding if it didn't have a high turnover with employees....
good,Workflow very business. Need more help from team leads and managers. I liked the new process you'll never miss a sample. Good patients. great co workers they are always will to help. I like to train students. The health fairs were nice to help many people  in need.
good,"This is a very face pace job however if you know how to handle your job and you are confident about yourself its nothing for you to handle.You must be able to work with some argumentative people but again if you know your job you will know how to handle this,"
good,"at quest diagnostics i start off my day by arriving at 8:am, i let the patients inside the office, have them sign in. i then call patients up one by one to collect insurance information and lab orders. patients are then told to return to their seats and wait to be called back to have blood drawn. once the patient has had the blood drawn, i then have them verify and sign paperwork. as patients leave i let blood clot and shortly after transfer them to the centrifuge. from the centrifuge i then process blood and scan specimens in."
good,"Loved it, learned a lot, hardest part was not getting equal treatment, I enjoyed meeting the deadlines. Co-workers got along for the most part"
good,"Busy, busy, busy. Very production oriented. Management plays extreme favoritism. Have decent benefits and a lot of overtime if you want it."
good,"Quest is a company that purchased several companies, therefore there were several cultures.  The CEO is phenomenal.  He is a visionary that is working hard to create congruencies amongst the cultures and to move the company forward as one culture."
good,"Overall Quest Diagnostics is a great company to work for, the management could use some work, and hiring the right amount of staff for busy sites would be a plus."
good,"Employees are great, the work load at the PSC is over whelming. Management is fair. Love working with patients and meeting new people on a daily basis."
good,Overall the company is Awesome!
good,"I enjoy what I do and Quest was a place for me to do that. Unfortunately I had a family emergency where i was obligated to resign. I loved my co workers and managers, everyone was really understanding. But I'm looking for a job where i can obtain health benefit."
good,"Quest is a good company to work for however, management seems to choose certain people as their favorites and those are the people who move up in the company. I can't speak for all locations, but I can speak for mine and until I move to a different location or get a different supervisor I will remain a PSR II. I am one of the strongest phlebs in my site, yet it goes unnoticed. There is also a lot of racial bias."
good,I like working for the company. It provides a much needed service. However the working hours are not consistent. The environment is relaxed and the equipment is provided.
good,"Quest is a fast paced environment, gotta stay with the flow of people and get them out! And also give the best customer service. I loved all the expertise I got there."
good,"Constant change and high energy environment.  Health and Wellness division acquired two companies within a 5 year period creating a stressful environment.  Most enjoyable part is working with people that have good intentions on delivering a quality program to the client/participant.  Hardest part of the job is keeping up with all of the process changes, employee turnover and direction from upper management."
good,a typical day at work would be very upbeat and focused. it had many ups but many downs because of disgruntel employees.I on the other hand came to work on time with a smjle.
good,"Quest is  a very busy place, i love working with patients and my team, but i don't think there is room for advancement to the next level of my career."
good,"I currently work at Quest I will remain at Quest I love my job I love my patients I enjoy my team co-workers. They could pay slightly a little more because  we do have to multitask including insurance pre authorization payments, patient care, processing, reception... we wear a lot of hats there and it's very busy super stressful at times. You can not take days off without given 3 to 4 weeks notice other than that it is a pretty good place to work. All places have pros and cons. Overall I am very happy."
good,It was a great life and work experience sometimes it was TOO PROFESSIONAL mangers did not encourage a work friendly environment. The job it=self was stressful enough jsut dealing with the fact  that you have patients results in your hand and having to deal with hippa rules and regulation and then not being able to think like a patient sometimes.
good,"I view Quest as a awesome company to work for. However, there are individuals in positions of leadership that are not worthy of that title. They use intimidation and mild threats as a way of leading. The unprofessionalism is beyond what I have ever experienced, and the total lack of respect is amazing."
good,"Call Center production requirements are very high.  Only a few people meet them.  While my manager is great, most managers are terrible.  Several high level managers have been fired recently."
good,"very stressful, fast pace, great place to learn , no opportunity for advancement. good benefits, friendly culture,.great people, great company. Poor MGMT"
good,The most recent manager was reassigned from another department and had no clue how to run the specimen processing department.
good,Quest is a great job for college students.  It offers very flex hours.   The paid is low and the expectations are very high.  There are so many things this company should do using computers and other systems that they don't and for this reason they fall short.
good,"Very good company mission and culture, some departments with bitter and cut-throat employees. HR was very political, and not very personable to employees."
good,Very structured and fast paced environment. I enjoy my employment at Quest Diagnostics. They have made it very successful for myself. They care about the patients and their overall health needs.
good,Quest Diagnostics is a good company. It provides many benefits for their employees. But advancement seems recently to be on those who know others not so much on work stability or experience.
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a fast-paced environment. Direct managers are supportive of their direct reports. The company provides a lot of opportunities to learn; however, opportunities for career development are not always available."
good,El salario es bajo para la cantidad de trabajo el ambiente laboral es bueno
good,Good  Fast pace company horrible management poor communication between workers and management. Patient flow was fast friendly co-workers good working environment .
good,B.U. manager can help you or make you miserable. The corporation ALWAYS backs it's managers! Recrimination/favoritism inside a B.U. runs ramped. That goes for pay raises and side bonus programs as well.
good,Quest is a growing call center with some growing pains. but overall the company is not to bad. they work with people having family issues. for the most part they have a open door policy they have even put a process in place where employees can submit their suggestions for process improvements
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to mentally get my mind right before starting my day because some customers may just come out of no where & just bite your head off. What i learned from them is that if you just sometimes let them vent and listen, that's all they want. Then you can really help them with what it was they were calling for. In taking escalated calls, you have to be firm and stick to the answer you gave the customer from the beginning. Co-workers are usually easy to get along with. Their like your neighbors, you have to see them everyday therefore make the best of it. "
good,A typical is unpredictable due to inexperience administration and lack of leadership skills and communication among the staff and employees.  The hardest of the job is not communicating and not taking responsibility of those individual actions.
good,Great place to work little opportunities. Favorites chosen among management. Was not happy.  I learned great billing skills.
good,"The Lenexa, KS Examone division of Quest Diagnostics has a huge I.T. department which is filled with dedicated, passionate people who are a pleasure to work with."
good,"25+ yrs with company. Position Eliminated & subsequently outsourced overseas."
good,"During my time at Quest Diagnostics, I made some great friends and met some awesome people. The Benefits at Quest were great and a real strong reason why I stayed there for so long and wanted to grow in the company."
good,"Overall, this could be a better place to work. Working with other Quest Diagnostics in different cities, management was better. Everyone should be able to rotate weekends full time and part time employees. Seems to be that their is favoritism and tattle tailing. All the managers should know about the operation throughout the day and how a psc or doctor office runs. The company shouldn't be running the employees down as well. Needs more support from the management and positive feedback."
good,processed all blood samples and split all samples according to ordered testing.Company was ok to work for but management was not very good.
good,Stanilaus County good area to work in. Pay was really good. Good hours
good,Work here was repetitive. I just strived to do my best everyday.
good,very bussy office  fact past multi tasking is a must.It is a world wide company with a chance for advancement.
good,It was a good place to work. I enjoyed working with the public. I learn alot of thimgs to take with me. Helped me great at what i do.
good,"Over the past 3-4 years, our Customer Service department has become such a fast paced environment and there is little time to actually do the work efficiently. There are high expectations for the representatives but lack of support when needed. "
good,The employees here are a pleasure to work with. Management seems to be under a lot of pressure and changes are being made in a negative way towards the employees.
good,"The low ceiling was not communicated to me in advance so I left. However, the people and culture here are enjoyable. There is a small gym in the building, which is nice."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"Meeting new people is always a pleasure to me. Some of the clients are welcoming and friendly, others so so much. The hours were scare however they offered health care screenings and fairs and that is where i made most of my money"
good,"Mason business unit."
good,"Overall a nice place to work. Great work-life balance. Coworkers are good. Downside is the company is very stockholder driven, pay inches up very slowly, promotions are almost nonexistent, and poor managers are tolerated."
good,"I like working for the company but my department is a different story. Every department (exluding lab and call center) have the option to work from home when needed, well not the case under my management. There is so much micromanagement and lack of trust we are not treated the same as everyone else. The company as a whole is great but I wish HR would not give management so much freedom. They need to standardize some rules. All or none! "
good,Lots of hours and energy to work here required.  rewarding most days.  Solid smart people attracted to the environment.  Very much an engineering workplace
good,employee focused in the beginning then became money driven company eliminated many perks such as holiday party employee outings company lunches and dinners lowered uniform allotment
good,"Must be able to multitask, enter patient information, order testing, identify correct specimen for each test ordered, process specimen according to test."
good,"Performed daily activities of the Patient Services Center phlebotomy accurately and on time; Maintained a safe and professional environment; Performed with confidence, both the forensic and clinical specimen collection and processing duties following established practices and procedures; Maintained required records and documentation; Demonstrated organizational commitment and promoted a positive image to patients, clients, employees and the public in general."
good,"I love working at Quest because we have a great team,and clean and safe environment, exciting and you get to meet different people throughout the day."
good,The organization knows it has current problems with the local management team and they are working very hard to get these issues corrected. They have had a lot of turn over as well.
good,"I currently work in a very fast paced environment registering patients, drawing their blood and processing their specimens. There are not enough employees at the site so there is a long waiting time for some patients that do not have appointments.  This can be stressful but I try and take it in stride since I love my job."
good,Benefits are great so is the corporation ethics and work force but positions changes  each clients differs continue. Plus pay should increase each tech. is upfront collecting specimens not handing out milk shake burger fries. Those who are certified with college degree in healthcare should be paid as professional in healthcare/patientcare services to represent product & excellent quality public services.
good,My last position at Quest was very stressful. It was a very busy site but was always short-handed. Management was not supportive and upper management was cut throat.
good,Busy work place with great benefits.  Great diversity in the workplace.  The hardest part of the job is continuous sitting at a computer with very few walk breaks.  The most enjoyable part of the job is great clients.
good,"Towards the end of my employment, I had a new manager every 6 weeks for almost 2 years. The inconsistency in which my work was monitored and performance rated changed every time. Each wanted me to do more with even less than before. No managerial support for work completed either."
good,"I have enjoyed working for Quest.  My main reason for leaving is the hours.  Also, I want to go back to doing phlebotomy, which I am very good at and I loved doing.  They haven't had any positions available anywhere close to my home."
good,"A typical work day includes, running many reports, maintaining a professional attitude, replying to emails and instant messages in a timely manner, reaching out to agents to assist with calls holding, redirecting calls to be answered, updating agents schedules, and conducting meetings about new products the agents will be using. Being able to maintain high volume work."
good,It's a nice place to work. However at smaller places (hospitals) they seem to downsize and create more work. I still enjoy working here. I do recommend it.
good,A typical day at work would consist of answering a high call volume of calls from patients in reference to billing concerns.  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the public.
good,60 - 100 phone calls were received and processed by each employee every day. there was only 30 minutes off the phone to work on issues that needed further investigation that could not be done while on a call. Could be very stressful.
good,"Management in hospital needed to communicate with staff more"
good,"loved working for this company, but it was all a misunderstanding.but I love quest, the other employee are friend and very helpful"
good,"This was the best job I've ever had. That doesn't negate the negative traits of the organization. The company is large and offers areas of advancement, but there are many hidden limitations, due to the ever-changing management structure. This lends to an atmosphere of fear. Management changes are frequent and multiple reorgs throughout the year have cost many their jobs, (including mine). Many cost cutting efforts have led to a higher employee turnover rate. I don't know the official number, but many are national reorgs over many job areas."
good,"Working for this organization has pulled out my strengths in leadership, training and research methods.  The employees work hard to achieve the overall goal of the organization.  We work as a team, and continue to provide good customer service."
good,Comfortable work environment with ergonomic chairs and keyboards to influence healthy workflow. Not much micromanagement but the expectation of getting the job done is obvious.
good,I love working for quest. It was my dream job. Over the past few years the company has changed. With all the new policies in place I feel like a bill collector rathar than a phlebotomist. They give us very little over time and its really no room to grow with the company. A great learning enviroment none the less.
good,I have greatly imroved my skills by working at diffrent kinds of pratices within quest.  Allowing me to learn more about the way the body works and the best way to find a solution by testing blood and  other body fluids. As a iop employee (in office phlobotmist) I have grown to know and love my patients and look forward to showing up to work everyday.
good,"Very fast pace work enviroment but everyone works at there own pace, great coworkers,even though it was night shift it wasn't that bad"
good,It is a job that conform to statistics which is the hardest part of the job. The co-workers are tolerant and adept.
good,"Its actually never a dull day. I deal with a lot of patients and I feel like I'm totally within my comfort zone when dealing with customers (patients). I've learned to be patient and more compassionate. Although it does get busy at times, the pressure does not affect me. The most enjoyable part of the job is the smiles I get to see on a daily basis."
good,I enjoyed working in a clinical laboratory setting with many other lab assistants. We performed various tasks in a fast paced environment as a team. Thousands upon thousands of patient specimens poured into the laboratory to enter data into computer system and process by preparing slides for Cytotechs to read.
good,i worked for Quest for two years. in that time i got to work with tons of great people.
good,"they were remodeling the building when I was there, a lot of issues with coworkers not working the required overtime"
good,In the beginning it was a nice place to work but when peak season stars it is an entirely different place. Workload increases about 30% along with rude customers but you really can't do anything about it because management really doesn't know how to handle them either. In the end it's best to tread carefully.
good,I learned how to deal with irate doctors when it comes to very ill patients. My co-workers are very educated and don't mind assisting one another. 
good,"Unity and equality is a necessity in any work field. Working at this company was a great experience for me, because i achieved knowledge at great scale. Which only motivates me to pursue my goals."
good,"Uncovering leads, building relationships, minimum of 10 sales calls a day, exceeding goals,"
good,The hardest part of my job was seeing the pain that my patients went through some knowing that they had been giving the death sentence. I work in the STD clinic inside the St. Louis Co Department of Health. Quest was contracted with them I ran the RPR's as well as drew all the blood samples.
good,i was working for all medical in guess but i thing is exelent for work
good,"Very independent position. I've learned different sales approaches and techniques with this company. Management could be a little better. My position is an independent sales position, so I am on the road by myself during the week. The hardest part of the job would be not having a closer relationship with management (due to location). The most enjoyable part of the job is working for a well respected and well known company!"
good,The company is a great stepping stone for those interested in working in the field of phlebotomy. Quest Diagnostics offers great benefits and longevity.
good,Stressful jpb with a very stress out manager.  The amount of daily yelling did not equal the pay. it was a shame to leave becas enjoyed the work and challenge and co-worker.
good,Everything is now numbers driven.  A lot of pressure is put on the employees to do better and be faster. Other than that I really loved the people I worked with.
good,"I started with Quest Diagnostics for five years, it is a good company to work with in general, the staff age good, but the only concern the payment is not good."
good,"Usually with coming into this company you will start off on the patient phones, but within a year you are able to apply out anywhere within the company."
good,I've been a contractor with them a long time and recently switched to Per Diem.  They definitely make sure that everyone is trained up and in line with their company's high standards. Good company.
good,"Overall the job is fine. Quest Diagnostics initial pay and benefits are OK. Medical insurance is pretty costly, even worse if you have dependents. Not much room for advancement if you work away from the companies main laboratories. The longer you are there the less you are appreciated. Coworkers were really nice but management is indifferent."
good,"Benefits are pretty good. Health, life, dental, vision, PTO, education assistance, yearly raises, retirement, sick time, etc. Competitive pay for the area."
good,"Working for this company is great, you can advance so much.  I love tuition reimbursement also, they'll help pay for college so you can become a better team member and work with your colleagues."
good,"Days at Quest were great, no matter if you were a one man team at one of the sites or you were at a site with six others every one worked together as a team, took care of the patients and promoted the company name.  I believe everyone was treated fairly and the benefits were great."
good,"Lab week was fun and they gave lunches free during lab week, dress-up fun games to play. In the winter they put you up in the hotel next to the work so you weren't driving home .. They always were giving ice cream on Friday .. a great group of people to work with,...The pay was good all the overtime you wanted since they are short handed .."
good,"I really enjoy my job and who I work with. My trainer was and still is, super helpful!! Quest has not technically held up"
good,The problem with quest is they are downsizing. I got laid off because they closed my whole department and moved work near Philadelphia PA. They are moving to smaller building near by middle of next year
good,"No overtime. Location changes. No recognition when going above and beyond. Excellent benefits: 401k, employee stock program, 21 days of PTO, health, vision, dental, life insuramce, etc."
good,"Everyday was different and I feel i learned a lot in my short time there. Being attentive, punctual, and thorough are strengths very much needed to work at Quest Diagnostics. Most of the staff was easy to work and get along with. I would say the hardest part of this job is explaining to a patient that their sample has to be re-done."
good,Would love to work there again but not as a temporary employee but a full employee and will be dedicated to each and every day of their services that they need of me to succeed with the company.
good,"Absolutely loved this job, very independent in IOP settings, working with the patients can difficult but overall very good job. Management is excellent"
good,the only reasib its getting 4 stars is because they actual offer a cafe with a chef to cook whatever you want.. only perk.. other then that the calls were unbearable over 100 call per day
good,Great staff. Quality training. Terrific customer service and satisfaction. Great company benefits. Job is fulfilling and very enjoyable. Comparable job duties as postal worker. Vehicles well maintained for safety and comfort.
good,"It's a great place to work but needs more advancement."
good,Great company to work for . Knowledgeable people and staff.  Clean and organized environment to work in. Excellent benefits and paid holidays are nice.
good,"Overall, this is a great company to work with.  Very professional environment with an ability to really elevate your corporate understanding.  If you live in a big city, fantastic opportunities to promote from within."
good,"Great work practices and friendly coworkers."
good,"Worked here for about a year, and enjoyed the environment, and the people I worked with.  The work was interesting but repetitive, and there wasn't much room for advancement because it was a  temp opportunity. If they decide to hire a permanent employee for this position I would recommend the job."
good,After almost 20 years with the company I was offered no advancement opportunities but a minority would advance quickly after only a few years with the company. I have seen it happen many times. The company as a whole is a great place to work and the pay is higher than the average laboratory will offer. The benefits package is also above average considering what most companies offer to employees. It is a high risk position often working with hostile patients who are afraid of needles and will threaten your safety almost daily. The company will always back the patient and your job will constantly be at risk if a patient complains. Must have thick skin to deal with management and patients.
good,"Overall Quest is a good company, with excellent an excellent benefits package, 401k, opportunities to continue your education with reimbursement. I worked there for 17 years and truly enjoyed working for them. They have currently been bought out in my area of the Tri-Cities and i have been forced to find other employment ."
good,"There were a lot of politics and it was hard to keep up with what was happening in the main office because IOP's are off site.  Unfortunately the IOP gets caught between the facility and Quest in too many things that do not pertain to them.  Do not put us as the go-between, go directly to the company."
good,Not as easy to move up as they say.. they pick favorites and advance them while still coming to you to do more than your job. It was an ok job! I feel like if I didn’t have a family it would’ve been ideal
good,"I have only been working for Quest Diagnostics for a short period of time as the company I worked for was acquired recently.  Due to this fact, I am not able to review Quest Diagnostics."
good,"I enjoy working at Quest, it has great people and the work is easy to learn as long as you're willing to learn. Management is also great and will work with your scheduling needs as well."
good,"The typical work day began at 5:00 AM with employees calling out sick. My supervisor calls started at 9:00. The most essential part of the job is time management. I managed on an average 30 to 40 employees, all of different nationalities. The hardest part of the joy was they had different cultural outlooks and different levels of understandings. The most enjoyable part was when you were finally able to reach them and you knew they finally understood"
good,"It was an ok job. Give them a shot if you really need someone to work for. Even though I wasn't treated with respect on most days, it is better than not having a job at all."
good,"i like it "
good,"I have only been with the company for 9 months, so far I have no complaints. Management does there job and are available when needed. Looking forward to the future!"
good,"Independent individual, hard-working and strong lab skills with smooth social communication skills. have  strong team-work spirit and self-motivating."
good,Quest is a good place to get your feet wet when it comes to being in the lab because they show you the ropes on all the minimums and they don't expect you to want to advance.
good,"Whenever I called in to work, they were very active in finding what I was looking for - jobs that met my schedule and current needs.  They didn't hold it against me when they offered a position I was not interested in."
good,Quest is a big lab so there are a lot of coworkers and a lot of managements. The laboratory is great and have a lot of assays for drugs. A good place to get experience.
good,I completed my internship at Quest Diagnostics and was hired shortly after.  I really enjoyed working for the company and would recommend working there to others.
good,"Over all it was a great place to work, I worked night shift as a asscesior so our employees were treated differently for example events that took place in the morning, night shift employees didn’t always get the same treatment . They pay was ok, raises were not that great for the level of stress and they better you are the more they utilize you !"
good,"Friendly staff, loved the job and drawing blood. Nice patients. A typical day would include drawing blood, sending the blood off to the right location."
good,There's a lot of favoritism.   A lot of gossiping.   A lot of finger pointing and not enough of owning up to your mistakes. Horrible management.  Management treats great employees horribly and lousy lazy employees like gods.  People are always in your business instead of focusing on their job.  Manager basically won't let the supervisors do their job.  Manager will speak to you about a complaint made about you but won't give you an example so you don't know exactly what the complaint was and can't defend yourself.  Some coworkers will stab you in the back the ask why are you bleeding.  There's just a lot of BS that goes on.
good,"Generally a good place to work.  Wonderful team atmosphere and very professional.  Benefits are good, salary is on the higher end of the spectrum for the area."
good,Excellent place to work if looking for medical experience. Good place for job advancements depending on experience and how far you're looking to advance within the company.
good,The company is a great place to work. My only complaint was the workload and stress which caused me to work excessive hours to meet goals. We have great teamwork .
good,When I first joined Quest Diagnostics they were highly focused on the patient at all cost. They lost their way and seemed to forget that the key component of their product is the patient.
good,A typical day at work was opening the doors with at least 10 patients waiting outside to come in before the doors opened. I learned that some patients were much friendlier than others. The management was always there to interact with any patient issues. The hardest part of my job was when you would have an infant that needed lab work and keeping both the parents and the patient comfortable. Knowing you were the front line in the diagnosis of the patient was an enjoyable part of my job.
good,Typical day was busy. Learned a lot about lab compliance. Easy going work place. Time allowed for lunch or gym. Flexibility to work at home if necessary. Hardest part of the job  was dissatisfied customers. Quest not very flexible for the smaller customer.
good,Innovative and challenging and people were helpful. I would not have left if the department  I was in did not close. I worked there for ten years. Every year there was bonus and incentives.
good,Quest Diagnostics is a great place to work but there are too many manager and co-managers. 50 hours guaranteed on a weekly basis. Job is very time consuming but has great benefits and paid time off.
good,"Enjoyed working here, it was more like a data entry job with going through aging reports and then making collection calls and reporting to AR Supervisor."
good,"Working at Quest was rewarding.  My job duties required that there be supplies available to Laboratory staff in a collaborative effort  to ensure patient results were available to meet turn around time.  I was also responsible for meeting preparations, department notifications, communications with vendors, equipment maintenance and/or repair and many other daily administrative tasks for the day to day operations of the lab."
good,I good Place to work overall. The hardest part of the Job is floating. Don't Know what time you have to be at work. You will know 2 hours of the time you suppose to be there
good,It's the medical field so it's fast paced and stressful at times. The shift does go by quickly though. Not much room for advancement unless you get a 4 year degree and move somewhere else in the company.
good,while i just worked as an intern the atmosphere at quest diagnostics was very inspiring. It was like everyone was mostly family like and the attitude towards customers was great.
good,"Quest Diagnostics as a company was excellent to work for. But in order to satisfy the new/current manager, you would have to beat a certain time in order to service your patients. It did not matter rather or not the site was busy. I really enjoyed my job as a lead phlebotomist, but only if our territory had a manger who was a little bit more understanding and with some sort of compassion, not just for the staff but for the patients, we as a team would not feel like we we're working in a hostile environment. But Quest Diagnostics as a company is a great job opportunity and I would recommend people to work for Quest but certainly in a different territory."
good,Fast paced environment helps you gain important multitasking skills and quickly exposes you to many skills you can use in any lab. The only downside is there is little room for growth and the yearly raises do not keep up with standard increases in cost of living.
good,"Quest as a company is ok.  However, I would not recommend NM as a place to work at.  Pay is fair but overall is bad in the MLT/MLS industry.  There is a clear lack of advancement opportunities."
good,"Fast pace environment. Good place to work, from  the first call you get to the end of the shift always busy. Always learning and management improving the way we work to make it easier to get the information needed"
good,Management made the place uncomfortable to work. No advancement opportunities. Co-workers and my immediate supervisors were great and made coming to work enjoyable
good,"I worked for ExamOne which is their call center. Their phone metrics are set so high that it is nearly impossible for you to advance. I was highly praised in my job, but never got to the next step."
good,The job was great.  Great working hours.  Benefits would be good for full time.  PTO days accrued fast even for part time employees.  Doing the labs for a doctor's office is a great position.
good,Quest is a stepping stone. Do not plan your career around being an employee here long and if you do plan to be here long do not look forward to upward mobility
good,Only been employed 3 months but I love the doctors office I work in when I first applied I didn't know this was an option but my hours are great and so are my coworkers
good,Loved the job that I had. Maintained friendships with outside clients. Made physicians comfortable with the process with the changes that were made. Detail oriented.
good,This job is great experience for individuals who just graduated college. This isn't a forever job. The experience is great but the compensation for all the work is bare minimum. There is a lot expected out of you.
good,the hardest part of the job is to work alone seen 50-60 patients a day but the bust enjoyable part is to see all the patients leave happy out of quest
good,Working at Quest for the past 15 years has been a great experience. I was learning something new almost each day. Management was always on board with my questions and suggestions and okay with me taking the lead on something that they felt sure of. The hardest part is leaving Quest in general because I am not willing to relocate. The most enjoyable moments of working at quest are the friendships made.
good,Good starting pay. Yearly bonus and raises about a whole paycheck of a bonus and 50 cent raises. Easy to advance if you give it everything when you are a temp and then everything else requires lots of remembering and always asking for overtime so the work becomes your life. Did not want this job to be my life. Very good pay though. Could not find better. I started at 11.80 an hour as processor and ended with 20.50 as a GC/MS operated (forensic scientist). If you work nights and odd shifts you miss out.
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a laboratory with a high volume of work that has to meet daily deadlines.  It is often understaffed so it is often necessary to work overtime.  Job security is strong, however, sometimes can be overwhelming, and demanding."
good,"Team work , fast paced, phlebotomy a must , must be willing to work hard and put in long hours . Staff meetings are ;mandatory , must be willing to work with others"
good,"friendly and helpful co-workers"
good,"Very hard working team to work with; Business is getting better since I left. Need more people to help this team, covering, and more knowledgeable employees. Wishing this team for the best and still looking forward to work with them in the near future."
good,"checking pm schdules "
good,Great company!  Educates and interaction between employee and management.  They continue to update ways to accommodate patients as well as clients.  Opportunities to further your education also.
good,"As a Route Service Representative you get to drive a car or suv to various medical facilities on a set route and pick up sealed medical specimens to be returned to a central lab for testing. It is an easy and pleasant job, but it does require maturity, a good attitude, organizational skills, and some smarts.  Expect to work 2nd shift to accommodate medical facilities' needs."
good,Prepared laboratory specimens for designated departments/locations prior to laboratory analysis and testing. Unpacked specimens from branches and ports and routed specimens by type to various staging areas.
good,Process patient samples into the computer system which assigns them an accession number that makes it easier to pull up their information. Pour off specimens to be tested for drugs. Weigh out specimens to be tested for confirmations. Help other departments when needed. Train when short staffed or work load becomes heavy.
good,"I llike my company. Great  please to work and co-workers. And benefits, madical  insurance also great.  Also company sponsored employees   go back to school."
good,"They over work you , but don't pay you enough money and hire new empolyees with very little experience , it's a very fast paced and a very busy location"
good,A typical day at work you will begin your work loads and start your instruments and computers. You keep this up through out your day.  You will continue to learn new things on the job because there are always something new coming out.  Management is fair and you can usually can get along with your coworkers. The hardest part of the job is making sure your job is done correctly.  The most enjoyable part of the day is break.
good,I enjoyed working with the patients. I liked working in the lab setting and processing the blood for results. working with the doctors in the office I was in was a great experience. hardest part was delivering patient results that i knew was going to change their lives.
good,It was an ok company to work for.  They made an excellent effort to make sure the equipment we needed for our jobs was in good shape. I was always paid on time and they were responsive when I had any kind of problem
good,A typical work day consist of maybe a 10 to 14 hour work day depends on the overtime that is required for the week. I learned a lot of medical term and what is required to have life insurance. Management was nice I LOVED my co workers the hardest part of the job was having to learn up to 20 different companies but once you do your first call you pretty much get the hang of it the most enjoyable part of the the job was the laid back atmosphere everyone got along.
good,The lab is a very busy place and you learn a lot.  There are different systems you learn how to set them up and run specimens.  You also learn how to keep very detailed records.
good,Hard work with a lot of stuff but a good opportunity to work and develop abilities to multitasks and focus with 1 hour free every night to luch
good,"always learn something new everyday! Billing is a fast paced world and i love the challenge! I have recently taken on some of our submission processes, while it is an extremely important role It is repetitious."
good,great company and learning experience with medical billing. Benefits good look out for there employees.  I learn good customer service and third party billing
good,"Typical day at work includes travel to see various existing clients, while seeking out new clients.  Learned quite a bit about the lab industry and multiple selling techniques.  Local sales management often difficult to work with."
good,"Get in office start computer system take calls from dr and staff, different types of testing, management there to coach and co works always ready to help with any questions. Giving out bad news to doctor about patients always helping patients"
good,"I worked for Quest in a Dr office and in a Patient Service Center. Did any thing from draw bood,urine drug screens, front office duties."
good,"I have been working for Quest for 7 years and I loved being a Quest employee, the benefits are wonderful. They took away the reimbursement fee of becoming certified, which I wasn't to happy about. Management has been changing often lately. I think all of the changes will make Quest even better as a company."
good,"Quest Diagnostics was a fast paced draw station type processing center.  I enjoyed my time there and adored my patients, but for me a clinic or doctors office setting is more appealing to me. Management and my co-workers was a joy t work for and with.  It's important to have that team work feeling and we did.  The hardest part of the job was knowing the crowds we had everyday was hard on the fasting patients.  And my patient care was my favorite of all.  I am a people person, so I never meet a stranger.  It's important to me to put someone at ease when nervous about being stuck by a needle or if they were sick at the time of the blood draw.  I am very accurate with my venipuncture on all ages.  I was always told how I didn't hurt them (the patient).  I always liked hearing that.  The last thing a phlebotomist wants to do it hurt someone.  I take great care of my patients in any way I can."
good,great working with people. i enjoyed coming in everyday to eager smiling patients.  challenging at times if scheduled to work alone.  overall great company
good,working at quest was a great opportunity and an even better experience. I learned a lot about the corporate side of business. lots of over time and a positive attitude from coworkers made it a fun place to be
good,I primarily admired this companies persistent goal of excellence and professionalism. Quality phlebotomy equipment was always provided and I especially appreciated that.
good,"I perform health screening. A typical day includes set up of event, screening, coach of results and ensuring all paper work is properly documented . I enjoy the flexibility but there is no job security and some co  workers are rude and spiteful."
good,Spent a short period of time working for this establishment but overall folks seemed to be happy there. The staff are pleasant and inviting and willing to help out when available.
good,All you do is answer phone calls. no real interactions with other workers. One day I blew them out the water with how many calls I answered. I learned about the different blood tests they have and which tubes they go in which helped with me becoming a phlebotomist.
good,"the supervisors and co workers were really helpful, the location was very convenient, I wish there was more opportunities for advancement, overall it is a great company to work for. I learned a lot"
good,"During my time at Quest Diagnostics, after my training was complete, It was myself and one other employee and occasionally our float. Every day we learned new ways to work together and efficiently in order to provide better service. I learned a lot from her and left with so much useful knowledge. I learned more about specimen requirements and developed my own techniques in order to draw my patients more painlessly and time efficient. I also learned how to perform drug screens. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the volume of patients we had with just the two of us working. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work and interact with people."
good,"Long work nights 3rd shift was only available. Quite challenging."
good,"General office duties, filing, scanning, email, sorting documents, retrieving doctors' and nurses' licenses. Helpful coworkers in case I ever need help."
good,I worked in the house call department that allow to travel the 5 bouroghs including nj to visit homebound patients and collect lab specimens
good,Able to work at a high production rate. Very good machine operator. Great management a very clean and nice place to work.
good,"Entry level position, with co-works willing to provide help and teach you how to work smarter for better use of time. Once you master how to use the machines the job was easy."
good,"I worked the graveyard shift. I learned so much about what labs are all about and what diseases. My Supervisor was great to get along with. I enjoyed my Management Team. Fun and knowledgeable. Co-workers were great to work with. Worked as a Team. I was always there for my Supervisor if someone called in. I loved being there for the patient, Doctors, Nurses from all over the Las Vegas Valley"
good,This company was a wonderful company to work for. I was responsible for daily production and leading a team of 6 to meet goals and be available for any questions they might have. I learned the expectations of leading people and understanding the different ways to handle individual team members so that they were motivated to do their best and that the approach for some is not the same that can be used on others. The most enjoyable part of this position was starting a department of 1 and working the team up to a sis person team.
good,"trained well, worked nights so after training had a lot of working independence - which could be good and bad based upon each of the employees motivation and if they pulled their weight"
good,"Reference lab with high volume. Great learning opportunity in Microbiology- transfer between various lab areas included mycology, parasitology, and mycobacteriology."
good,"All the above companies have been great to work for. All provided team work environment, management support, provided tools to do my job."
good,"La oportunidad de aprender sobre nuevos estudios, conocer gente unica,"
good,Quest could work on their management and compensation. Other than that it could be worse. They are very flexible with taking time off and at least the supervisors in my area actually seem to care about their employees
good,Great bosses. I've been with the company for a long time. It was time to move on. Company has great benefits and is has a good work environment.
good,"Wonderful place to work, Very clean and neat facilities, Excellent benefits. Very family friendly and accommodating. Fun company picnics and awesome rewards and bonuses."
good,"Every week the employees are assigned different jobs for each day.  One job duty is the Code Auditor Assistant (CAA) where I answer employees questions, verify and/or edit already entered information, including already coded forms, and give out errors to employees.  Another is Performance Verifier, either for insurance or toxicology information for each client.  Errors are given in this position as well, but the CAA hands out all errors to the employees.  When not assigned specific duties, enter general information in different screens for the client applying for life insurance."
good,"Its a good starting place for any career but very limiting for career ladder . Ex. in the lab, one can either be a Med tech or aide. If you are too ambitious you might have to transfer to other departments."
good,"Great company to work for constantly looking to make changes and provide quality care. This is a high volume fast pace environment and "
good,Working as a medical technologist in toxicology means you are busy. ALWAYS! The demand is very high and as a result we have over 35 employees in our department alone. This makes for a great environment to learn in as there is so much data you get exposure to. Because of the high volume it gave me a great opportunity to become an expert at reviewing and truly understanding the various methods of chromatography used in our confirmatory testing.
good,"Helping take care of patients is the priority."
good,"Loved working there, very friendly and professional, took care of clients and patients appropriately. Some supervisors were a little tougher than other but that comes with territory..management is very understanding to situations and problems and are always available to help when they can..."

good,Fast pace data entry of patient information. Having to handle different types of specimens is pretty wild sometimes.
good,General surgical pathology duties from biopsies to complex extenerations. Demanding volume with excellent support staff. Co-workers are dependable and helpful. Some long days are required. The variation of specimens and exposure to complex specimens was invaluable. Co-workers/exposure to complex cases were the most enjoyable part of job.
good,Being a phlebotomist always gives you the opportunity to meet new people everyday.  This was a good company to work for also.
good,"Mobile Examiner, Great job to have as a Traveler. Meet new people everyday, great connections."
good,"The work is hard, but rewarding. Coworkers are for the most part great. Management seems inexperienced or simply poor at making decisions and communication. The work environment is a bit like the UN for all the diversity, but it seems as though this does not extend to promotion practices when promoting into leadership/management roles where the lack of diversity is stark."
good,Real good training and resources are available. Dynamic working environment with lots of collaboration.
good,"A typical day is driving from city to city picking up lab work, sorting it out, packing it in and putting it in the cooler. Greet the customers and head to the next destination."
good,"Great benefits, in a fast pace environment. Co-workers were very good at pulling together for the best of the patients and each other."
good,It was an overall great experience. I was able to get the necessary experience to be a successful Phlebotomist technician.
good,"Manage Call Out"
good,"Very fast paced, made the day go by quick, learned the Quest way of doing things. My co-workers were very helpful and kind. The hardest part of my job was trying to practice the new computer system while working every day in a fast pace environment, not much time to do anything else. I feel the most enjoyable part of the day was going to work. I love doing my job!!!"
good,"It was fun working in this laboratory since this is where I started in the lab."
good,"Typical work day includes, picking up assignment, mapping out route for timely blood draws. The most difficult portion of this job is different everyday. Some days its avoiding dogs or pets in the home.  Some days its traffic or bad weather on a busy road. Most days I had only a short period of time with co-workers. We are usually on the road most of the shift."
good,"Very flexible atmosphere, although large workload an overall great place to work."
good,"*Promotion to become ASR / CRM manager.  Promote business growth within the medical community relating to clinical laboratory."
good,"The technical departments are very busy.  There is always a lot of work to do.  Most of the work is done late evenings and overnight. Hardest part of the job is getting the work done before the 8 a.m. deadline, while maintaining the quality and without errors.  I have learned that time must be taken in order to obtain accurate results regardless of the time restraints."
good,"i really like the enviroment and enjoy the daily task, make sure all labs are accurate and done in a timely manner a typical day starts at 6:30 a.m and ends at 3:00 p.m. assure all Dr. orders are done to provide the patient with a good experience"

good,"Great environment, I met a lot of great people and learned a lot at Quest. Open and friendly environment. Great benefits."
good,"A typical day for me is one in which I complete administrative functions in the Patient Services Dept."
good,"My days varied working for 4-6 providers at a time with draws or labs ranging from 20 -50 per day.  I worked for a general practice office, so was afforded the opportunity to see many aspects of the medical field.  An integral part of my work was to be a team player with the entire office staff.  The most difficult part was to be able to maintain proficiency when we had a very heavy workload.  The most enjoyable was when we all worked together so cohesively, a job well done at the end of the day. I was actually under double management by Quest and the IOP, sometimes difficult maintaining loyalty to both."
good,I am a person who enjoy helping others. Quest Diagnostics is a wonderful place to work in order to help others. Preparing of tests with the best results for the patient is a must.
good,"Starts off with anywhere from 10 to 20 + people waiting. Focus is a big part of this job. I learned that being positive and keeping your co-workers positive helps the office atmosphere. Management was what I did the last 4 years at Quest, we had a good team. My co-workers were the best. Hardest part was trying to convince parents that their child was in good hands....most enjoyable was performing a venipuncture on nervous people and then having them tell me they felt nothing. I strongly believe that a phlebotomist is a gifted person, you either have a good touch or you don't."
good,"Plenty of work to do that made the shift seem fast. Running jobs for"
good,Being the only employee at the PSC was both rewarding and challenging.  I enjoyed meeting the patients each day and taking care of their phlebotomy needs.  I was very sad when the PSC was closed.
good,"great company, and great people. Loved the chance or advancement."
good,It was a fast pace work environment with minimal supervision.
good,"Shipping medical testing supplies to clients nationwide . Casual warehouse environment , great to work with a diverse staff . Can also be a challenge due to the different personalities . The job requires attention to detail in a structured time frame ."
good,"Like fast pace enviroment, very multi-task, people oriented, collection of blood samples, entry into data base."
good,8 hour overnight shift consisting of non-stop processing except for lunch break. After training all of the work is completed on an independent basis with each worker accountable for their own production statistics which must meet a company set requirement.

good,Worked as a generalist including blood bank and limited microbilogy
good,"Good people to work for, supervisors very helpfull.Able to move up in the company."
good,"I enjoyed my time working with Quest Diagnostics.  However, I feel the company could offer their field management team more freedom to make market based decisions."
good,"Busy place to work, busy schedules. Great place to meet new people,  and being able to work as a team."
good,"close 3rd shift with team of  CLS and Lab techs"

good,"Goals and objectives with data driven, customer focus! An excellent place to work."
good,"My daily work load consist of lots of data entry and research. I learned how to work closely with my team members and manager to ensure accuracy and quality to the customers requisition. The hardest part of my job is the end of the month crunch time inputting three the work load in a timely manner before the deadline with required coming at 4am sometimes, but the success of meeting our goal was worth it"
good,"Great benefits (including free labs with Quest). High sample volume, lots of opportunity for learning."
good,A typical day at Quest would be high patient volume. I would Draw patients while thier paper work and other things were being retrived and printing. Also working on a Team of 3 to make sure all patients got the attention they needed and thier specimens where obtained with little or no pain.
good,meeting new patients and assuring them that their tests would come back as quickly as possible to their doctors office.

good,Project Manager for multiple interface projects with EMR vendors and lab information systems
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a gret company to work for. My job as office assistant while it is rewarding in many ways, it doesnt utilize the many talents I have."
good,its a great learning experience for me everyday..
good,"I rate quest diagnostic a 7. They can improve on ways to help ther workers feel appreciated and better team work. For the volume of patients, more pay."
good,i learned how to bluid coumpters and that was fun i worked with poeple ho was so cool
good,Good place to work very fast paced. Friendly environment and learn alot. Always learn something new
good,"great place to work, but lately they have been using the down turn in the economy to get greedy and squeeze every once of work out of people. They are also getting rid of long serving workers who have acqiured significant benefits."
good,"preparing spreadsheets for clinical trials, customer service, checking microfilms, filing, assisting in print room making manuals, for other offices. All my co-workers were very friendly and very helpful. Mangement was always there when you needed help. all the paperwork that needed to be filed that was the hardest.most enjoyable part, I really liked my job."
good,"Straight to business, no time for play. When I first started there we had a excellent team with a super supervisor. Once she was demoted for whatever reasons and we had a new supervisor who knew nothing about Quest. Things change and the moral in the group diminish. One by one we quit or was let go for no good reason. The hardest part was dealing with a supervisor who knew everything but did not know anything about Quest. The good thing was once HR seen what was going on she was eventually let go. It took for them to loose a lot of good employees to realize the real problem. So sad."
good,"I very much liked working at Quest Diagnostics, I was there a long time."
good,Good place to work but no room for advancement. Need different hours due to school and child care. Great people to work with. Many staff is willing to help out if needed.
good,great place to work for those under 30. benefits are ok and locations are feasible. people are nice and friendly depending on where you are located in the company.
good,Loved working for Quest. Worked both IOP and PSC. Great teamwork. Only reason I left was a cut in hours and nothing else available at the time. Only complaint was the immediate management.
good,"traveled everyday as I was a floater. I drew for the nursing home clients and worked at the patient service centers. You have to be able to work in a fast paced environment, work in a patient center alone, maintain the office and patients while properly maintaining specimens on time."
good,"I was a paramedical examiner for them, and loved my job. I was able to create my own hours and schedule. This allowed me to be at home with my kids. The con is there was no benefits offered."
good,Interesting place to work but they hardly promote their workers. Productive and fun workplace. I want to see a situation whereby management considers promoting their employees.
good,Fast pace work setting. no room for growth unless you want to learn other skills. (i definitely did). High productivity. You have to set your own work life balance in this environment due to its an overnight job.
good,"I enjoyed the pay and benefits, was by far the best job I had in terms of good payments but management discouraged me from continuing within the company. Other than that, I got laid off as well."
good,typical day would be receiving patients specimens and entering the specimen types in a timely fashion so the lab can run the test so the patients can get results. Very fast past!
good,"Again management is always an issue at any job. The people will go above and beyond for the company they work for if they feel they have the support from the top and Quest diagnostic leadership doesn't lend, offer, or give that support."
good,"Great place to work, as long as every body is respectful to each other. Great team work. I didn't stay there long but I had a wonderful learning experience."
good,Aggressive goals clearly set that provide daily challenges. Managed care contracts dictate the direction of company in a very competitive market. A good place to work.
good,"Always something new to accomplish"
good,"I like my department and what my job entails, the skills I've learned are valuable. But that's where it ends. Huge lack of communication from immediate supervisor and beyond. Everything is a secret and it's like a game of telephone around the building. Very low morale among employees. Lots of budget cuts."
good,"productive and fun to work at quest diagnostics always has someone  there to help they have huddles everyday to show how everyone is doing, let`s every team know whats goals have to be met each month"
good,"Quest has been a wonderful learning experience and has been a great way to get into the healthcare industry. "
good,"Up to the employee to find and take advantage of advancement opportunities."
good,Employees and management truly care about each of the lives they touch each day. Senior management takes the necessary time to ensure employees know the current direction of the company and how they impact it.
good,The workplace was part of a medical center  and many people I knew would go for medical appointments and I would get the opportunity to see how they were doing.  Nice atmosphere.
good,Working at Quest Diagnostic help improve my professional skills to perform laboratory duties independently. I learned to make decision for the better of the company and myself. I learned test skills as well as how to handle the test shipment methods. I enjoyed the flexibility of working on my own. A typical day could be managed with preparation and good pace of work ethics. I've always handle my skills to work in a timely manor and organization.
good,"Overall, the company is a great place to work for.  The job can be demanding and stressful to work due to fast-paced environment.  Benefits package and extra perks extended to employees convey the company's real concern for employee health and wellness."
good,"Good company but, Not focused on promoting within. Employees don't work together towards the same goals. Poor Management...If you are a suck up then you may go far...If not be prepared to stay in a dead end position."
good,"Labcorp pays more. Quest cuts tons of people’s hours. Even after moving for my position, they cut my hours twice. I’m left with no insurance and no benefits except a 401 K. I was planning on using the educational tuition reimbursement to go back to school, but lost that too."
good,"What made work fun was the people I worked with.  I considered them as my family and because of this, it made the job easy.  We would help one another and when a situation arises, we would all try to work them out together as a team.  The hardest part of the job was when we are short-staffed.  Regardless of how many people are out that day, we still had to get the work done in order to meet turn around time."
good,Accuracy is utmost importance on this job. Starting time was 12am to 8am Monday night till Friday night. Working nights is less stress but more detailed.
good,"Great organization to work for, but in smaller areas such as Wichita, there are no opportunities for advancements within the company. So if your are attending school to receive an higher education above phlebotomy, I suggest you either relocate or venture out into the workforce."
good,"I loved how easy this job was. I was very young when working there but it was very easy and I was happy being a processor. The area was convenient to where I lived at the time, and they provided on the job training."
good,I enjoy working with quest diagnostics. The only downside is that you must be  mobile. Working with Quest you gain independence experience. Great for people who are flexible.
good,"Fast pace, not family oriented, no work advancements or promotions unless someone quit or retired. The most enjoyable thing about the job was being able to comfort a patient while getting their blood drawn. Reassuring them that the experience wouldn't be bad and they leave happy."
good,"Fast paced, high volume job site. Good job stability, but no recognition for dependability or accuracy. Very nice supervisor. Quest tries to encourage commradery with co-workers and proffessionalism with patients. Both are evident in the workplace culture. Hardest part of the job would be trying to service clients in a timely manner. I enjoy the online trainings that are provided and neccessary throughout the year."
good,"Quests' management team are the best I have encountered. I am concerned about the competitiveness of their benefits and salary. Currently, I am comfortable at Quest....."
good,"It's your average corporation. "
good,"I worked in a small physicians office, the position is as you make it. I was only responsible for phlebotomy procedures and sending specimen to laboratory. I worked well with the physicians and their staff. The position could easily become boring if you are looking to a busy work load, however as I previously stated the job is what you make it to be."
good,"Very productive little room for errors, processed change orders mini/maxi log and test inquiry fields, poured specimen for correct lab division test results, investigated process flaws with the objective of providing effective resolutions, entered patient demographics, CPT, and ICD9 CODES accurately in a productive environment, and remained in compliance with HIPAA and OSHA regulations and confidentially. Management need more training in how to treat and talk to people.  Less write ups about things not pertaining to work ethics.  Overall its a good company to work for."
good,"Every fifteen minutes bed checks were done for each clients."
good,training is a bit fast for all that they want you to know but its a great place for someone who's wanting into the field with limited experience. there are some strong personalities but also some very awesome co-workers.
good,"I met incredible people over 8 years of hard work in several areas of lab. "
good,"The diagnostics services industry is complex and evolving. The commercial laboratory space is directly competitive with larger health system laboratories that  continue to consolidate and acquire physician practices. To be successful you must be willing to adapt and adjust based on rapidly changing markets and circumstances. Not for the faint of heart, but rewarding."
good,"I enjoyed working for Quest Diagnostics because I enjoyed the work I was doing. Overall the job duties were easy to meet, however management needed improvement."
good,"The company pays very well, has great benefits, and it takes a lot to get fired. But the management is awful, complete lack of communication, minimal room for advancement, and a horrendous level of micromanagement. I would recommend this place though if youre looking for a good job with good pay."
good,Productive and fun workplace but few chances for advancement. Very flexible work hours that is the most enjoyable part of the job. Management works with you but there is really few opportunities for advancement.
good,"I worked for this company twice. I was a specimen processor, meaning I entered the patient's information and test being performed. In addition I did pour offs if the sample needed to be used for more than 1 test."
good,"A typical day at work was working from home. Sitting at a computer logging on and then receiving incoming calls from customers who needed to complete questionnaires for their life insurance applications. They previously had done these interviews in person with an agent but this was a follow up to basically confirm their answers and also to obtain additional information on their medical history, finances, and lifestyle."
good,typical day at work here is basically just processing drug test all day. hardest part is hours and all the changes to make it a better work place.....
good,It was okay. The pay was terrible and I didn't have any health benefits but it was a good job. I enjoyed working as a phlebotomist but I had to end up going back to school because I couldn't survive on that income.
good,Good place to work. Provide many good benefits for employees. I enjoyed working for them. I would refer this company to other people.
good,Great place to work can use some improvements here and there but otherwise a fine place to learn.  Teamwork is highly encouraged but not a lot of opportunities to move up.
good,fun and excitied to be there  the management was awesome  and my co-workers we was a team the hardest part of the job was leaving when i was offered a position the salary was lower if got hired on i couldnt  except but this was a great job orange park florida
good,"Good company to work for"
good,"I worked in the Anatomic Pathology in the Cytology dept. for ten years processing gynecological specimens(pap smears) to detect cervical cancer. I learned how to use reagents, chemicals and to dilute alcohols according to my job functions. I had a different variety of job functions including aliquot specimens for CT/NG testing, pulling specimens for HPV dept, and changing our stainers. Management was on-site but in our other building, so we worked without supervision for most of the time. They only came over for meetings,  and making sure everything was on the up and up. My dept. was only made up of about 7-9 people and everyone seemed to get along and work together efficiently with good communication. I liked my co-workers, they were caring and nice people. The hardest part of my job was that I had to stand all day long, especially when processing because you are running five instruments at one time. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was helping people when performing my job functions. All in all, I'd say that I liked working for Quest Diagnostics."
good,fast pace with a high volume of different patients coming in to get blood and other lab test done in a timely fashion. to be fimilar with billing different insurance companies.
good,"My experience with Quest on a daily basis as a phlebotomist was enjoyable, very challenging, with over a hundred patients per day on some occasions that were scheduled for various tests. I was able to manage my time to provide the best service for each individual patient arriving at out facilities. Management provided the workers with all the proper supplies necessary for daily functions. Quest management provided all staff with updated training and classes for its large diverse staff. I had the pleasure of excellent trained co-workers who were just as focused as I on providing the best service possible for our patients. The challenge for me was to keep my training updated for all the new various tests in a ever changing work environment. Lastly, the most rewarding aspect of my position was assisting the so many different patients who crossed my path and that I was able to provide them the best service and representation for Quest Diagnostic."
good,"My Co-Workers help me through it however the process is difficult to grasp right off had. Once you have that done, everything else follows pretty nicely. The environment is very professional and everyone seems dedicated to their jobs."
good,"A typical day at Quest was a full and fast paced work shift.  I worked in four different departments because of my ability to catch on quick and my attention to detail.  My manager was awesome.  She was fair in relaying information and job duties as well as the notice of my abilities for placement in other departments for me to further my experience.  She made sure that her department ran as efficient and adequately as she could within her power.  I met some wonderful people that I worked along side of in my eight months there as well as some that would try and be a challenge, but when you know your sole purpose for getting up and going to work daily, those people don't change who you are.  The hardest part of my job was leaving when my assignment ended.  I love working and knowing that I have a job to go to daily, weekly, and monthly.  This makes the arrival that much better.  I enjoyed learning a different part of the medical field that really go hand and hand with my LPN experience.  Learning about the different lab work and being apart of 4 areas of the testing process was very important to me."
good,My typical day at work is very rewarding.  My day begins with greeting my patients. Check patients in my asking them several questions to verify name address and insurances.  After that I escort patients to a room for venipucture.  I have to make sure my patients are relaxed and comfortable before venipunture.   After that processed I asked my patient to sign that I am labeling their specimen in front of them. Then packed specimen in bag and thanking them for choosing quest diagnostics. At the end of the day all specimen have to be processed correctly by making sure all specimen are packed and all paperwork is correct for pick-up.  I love my job very much but after so many years experience I am ready to do other things and widen my horizon.
good,"	Ordered, tracked and maintained stock of all materials needed throughout the lab"
good,ok place to work. Awesome Supervisor and leads. Work with you on scheduling. Easy place to work. Fast Paced at times. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement though.
good,"Great place to work. Friendly environment .  Go above and beyond to make sure all job get done on timely manner, all employee get paid on time  even on critical times such as 9/11 or bed snow storm."
good,Start the work as soon as you get to your desk. The team leader brings the work every hour or before if you needed. The work place is  a safe and the people are kind.
good,"I currently work the night shift which is not conducive to my lifestyle but I manage to make it work on very little sleep; which will most likely have long term effects on my body. "
good,I was working as an extern.  I was shown respect and was able to learn with out slowing down productivity.  The manager was very friendly and went above her job description to help me complete my externship.
good,Quest is a high volume lab that emphasizes quality and turn around time. It is fast paced and you will thrive here if you are organized and enjoy multitasking. Quest is at the forefront of the clinical diagnostic industry.
good,"The people that work at Quest are all great and hardworking."
good,Decent company to work for but would like something different.
good,Quest is a very good company.  Great benefits and a great opportunity to grow.
good,"Great company to start off for an entry level position. The company has made changes in upper management and corporate structure in order to serve and provide great quality service to it's customers. As an employee, they provide great benefits such as health insurance, 401k, employee recognition awards. I've learned a lot about the laboratory industry and it's contributions to the health industry. The employees are great and sincere about helping patients."
good,"I really liked my time there with quest. They just don't pay enough to make it a career. people are great, management listened, just a really great place."
good,Provided plenty of job growth and employment advancement opportunities.
good,"I've worked in a hospital setting with this company, and it was a great learning experience to be able to work with so many different types of patients and people from other departments. Working in this kind of environment, lets you really see how what you do can impact someones life. The hardest part of the job, was being able to multitask constantly, there are so many nuances with the type of work we do, and who you interact with, that you must be able to adapt efficiently, and effectively at a drop of a dime. Although this might seem as a bad thing or a con of the job, this to, for me, was the most exciting for me to do daily. I crave that I can see a challenge, and using all my skills, make it work out."
good,"this job is full filling i loved it. But the fact that i had to finish all my work before i went home sucked. it wasnt fair. "
good,"A typical day at work includes taking/ receiving patient and client calls, working out insurance and diagnosis issues and team building within the department. I have learned a great deal while employed at Quest Diagnostics. My level of knowledge has expanded a great deal in insurance/ medical billing, HIPPA regulations, database and Microsoft office skills, six sigma operations, and leadership skills. My co-workers have helped me a great deal in learning the processes and I feel very comfortable going to my teammates with questions. The hardest part of my job is addressing escalated patient calls. Patients sometimes call in angry and/or frustrated with a bill that they may not understand. It is my job to then explain the situation and find a solution while continuing to keep the patient at first priority. The most enjoyable part of my job is finding solutions to issues.  This is enjoyable for me because I know at the end of the day, I made one of our patients' day a little bit easier and brighter."
good,Well my typical day is going and releasing money through different insurances electronically. There are times I will have to look up information regarding a specific patient when asked by my supervisor. Most enjoyable part of the job is the work. I like working with numbers.
good,"While Quest Diagnostics provided a great deal of day to day labors, the management style was not as perfect as one would be led to believe.  Advancement is highly limited and security of one's job is limited day to day.  I loved working for them but did not love them so much when it came time for me to leave.  This is another company that speaks so much of 'integrity,' but really needs to look in the dictionary again for the meaning of the word."
good,"A typical day at work is meeting production, asking a lot of questions about various insurances that has either changed or no longer exist.  I have learned to come to work, do the job assigned and go home.  I have learned to be a team player, offer positive suggestions that will help the team as a whole.  "
good,"Quest has great benefits, compensation is decent, and if different people were in place it would be a pleasure to work at that company. The management is under educated and usually are in there positions because they have worked there for a long period of time, but unfortunately seniority doesn't make you a great supervisor. Most of the supervisors I came in contact with lack people skills, appropriate vocabulary, and leadership ability. At Quest it is more about who you know and less about your work ethic and performance. The raises are given once a year and they are horrible even with great reviews. Quest works off seniority and are huge on politics. If properly managed Quest would be a awesome company with great benefits."
good,"heavy value of calls. dealing sick patients with their medical bills, dealing with medical insurance, processing medical claims. follow up with patients. I learn that helping others with their medical bills can give a sick patient a relief knowing that one less stress has been left off their shoulder. and it is a great feeling to know that you have help someone. my co worker are great and very helpful. the hardest part of my job is to learn how to listen really good to hostile customer/patient over the phone. the enjoyable part of my job is whenever i get a mail or letter of appreciations from patient that i have help out."
good,I have worked at quest for a year and it has been a good experience for me. I have learned a lot that will benefit me in the future when looking for better opportunities and growth in my career. I have learned a lot about the industry and plan on using this experience to expand in my career path.
good,"It,s a good company to work for real about goal,s in putting people first in service and health care"
good,"Everyday is different. Some days will be a smooth mellow workday. Other could be hectic and problematic. It's never a dull moment. Working in a call center, you have a different variety of personalities. You have to remain professional and courteous at all times."
good,"Due to a heavy workload and block count, I would either gross specimens for several weeks at a time or embed or cut specimens depending on staffing needs. Performed Lead/ Administrative duties when time allowed during the shift. I was able to advance over the years as I had started as a Histotechnologist then was trained as a Lead during my employment there. For 13 months our department functioned without formal Supervisor and for the last four months without a Director which made performing my own duties more difficult. I worked well with my co-workers as I had to direct them with daily duties to achieve turn around times effectively. I truly enjoy working in the field of Histology and the technicality of my role."
good,"Microbiology and Analytical Chemistry."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when employees are recognized for their hard work.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy. There was always work to be done. Great job security. While being employed there I learned how to deal with patients specimens and how important it was to be accurate and concise on inputting specimen types in the system. If there was a specimen lost then it meant that the patient would have to retake the blood work again.The management team there was very understanding and listen to their employees regarding schedule changes or anything within the business unit. My coworkers were great. I got along with everyone great. The hardest part about the job was the hours. The hours no longer accomodated me and my family. Working the night shift started to get complicated due to the fact that I had small children and had to make sure they got to school everyday and the demands of the job were very strict. That was the reason for my departure. The most enjoyable part about that job was feeling like I was needed everyday at work, without everyone doing what they were suppose to do made it harder on everyone else, so I made sure that I always put my best foot forward while working for Quest Diagnostics."
good,Gained a lot of experience with my time at Quest Diagnostics. Flow was continuous with patients ranging from pediatric to geriatric. Co-workers were great and extremely helpful. Hardest part of the job would be finding a vein on a drug abuser. We would usually have to ask them to drinks plenty of water and keep warm packs on them before finally successfully finding their vein. Most enjoyable part of the job was the look on their face when we finally got some bloodwork. Their expression was pure relief.
good,Management always seems reluctant to make final decisions
good,I really liked the company. It is difficult to advance. I do alot of work that is not necessarily my responsibility but I enjoy what I do on a day to day basis. The hardest part of my day is doing my managers job without the credit.
good,"Travel to schools, set up equipment, take pictures and complete extensive paperwork to ensure proper payment and delivery."
good,"This is a good company to start with fresh out of school. You get to experience all kinds of different cultures and ages. Working here I have learned to perfom heel sticks on 2 and 3 day old newborns to venipuncture on 96 year old patients. We see about 180 patients a day so its a great place to learn to be quick, efficient and polite all at the same time."
good,Good place to work but the Management needs a lot of improvement or a flat out change in some departments
good,"Very exciting place to work, great company equipment and company values."
good,A typical day at work is fast paced of all type of patients coming for lab work. Most labs consist of blood work and urine samples. Thirty percent consist of drug screens for employment and bio metric screens for employer insurance
good,"Hospital setting, familiar patient types and ages.  The Pathologist or overall supervisor was a pleasant individual to work with.  The pay excellent and commensurate with education PLUS experience."
good,Good place to get your foot in the door if  you are looking to get into the medical field at a bare bones level.  I was trained as a customer service representative and had great training.
good,"Benefits aren't the best. Not room for advancement. Feels dead end. However, the environment is laid back and very family friendly, flexible schedule if needed in emergency situations, and management cares about your concerns."
good,"getting a check, hard work long hours and little pay. management in other depts are great but not in mine. Technical employees are prioritized over support employees."
good,"Management is the essential key to any successful business. If Leadership is incompetent and lacking,the staff has no overall direction. Quality will continue to diminish and besides the old employees accustomed to the everday uncommon, mean workplace tactics business will continue to lack substantially!"
good,If you work well by yourself than this is a job for you. Many offices scattered throughout territory staffed by 1-2 people. Which is good if you work well by yourself.
good,Quest is overall a nice company. They offer a good vacation program and at the end of the day it is a low stress job. I would recommend this position to a friend.
good,"Quest is struggling with maintaining clear priorities across its massive enterprise. More often, there are competing initiatives at the corporate and senior mangement levels. This creates stalled initiatives, and in worst cases, failed programs and projects. For someone in mid to upper management, this can be frustrating. Frontline employees aren't as affected, and Quest does a great job of maintaining benefits and compensation for these employees. However, as profit margins shrink, the manager level and above are the first to feel the impact. This makes sense from a business  and employee satisfaction perspective,  but again can be off putting for a manager level employee."
good,"good day with patients, we provide good customer service .make sure everything is correct at the end of the day double check the samples before we sent it to the lab."
good,"a typical day at work was checking e-mail to ensure no clients were requesting help with an issue, then picking up boxes of shipment containing specimens for processing. I learned quite a lot of different studies and different systems. Management was not that great as it was difficult at times. There was no hard part of anything that i was doing as i learned it all so i could advance to a better position. The best part of the job was meeting the people and getting to learn new things."
good,"Decent place to work. My direct supervisor was competent and so was her manager. I had an ok experience. I did have issues when it came to communicating with coworkers about events and things would get pushed back onto me because people couldn’t take personal responsibility for their actions. While I didn’t completely hate my experience, I didn’t love it either. It was a place to work and helped pay the bills. I did make some life long friends while I was there and that accounts for something! Overall, I would recommend working here if you like doing the same thing all day everyday. The break room is full of great options for food! CEO is nice and personable."
good,Good place to work   Options in every state. Most corporate jobs are out of NJ - so have to be willing to move. Opportunities for sales advocment into specialized industries
good,"Nice place to work for transitioning into something bigger. rat race otherwise. just make sure to gain more certification as you progress, or else you'll be stuck where you are forever.Pay is kind of shabby too."
good,One of my favorite workplaces ever everybody is doing their own stuff not as much gossip as manufacturing but unrealistic goals and bosses who don't listen to workers advice.
good,"great company to work for, good pay, good benefits."
good,I love Quest been here 30 years marvelous benifits strong foundation and most definitely a family feeling surrounding. As well as professional and clean place to be.
good,"Quest is a nice place to work however, The company policy seems to change pretty often  .One must be very flexible and being able to adjust to new rules and regulations"
good,"I was passed over several times for advancement, in spite of numerous performance awards, excellent evaluations and numerous letters of appreciations from patients and doctors alike."
good,"as a veteran of Quest Diagnostics i enjoy working with a diverse culture. i admire how the company adhere to their values and mission. whenever the company decided to make changes, it was not a surprise or a blinside to the employees. the company is very informative"
good,My duties as a Test Send Out Referral Testing is to ensure our client and patient that their samples are being set up and tested in a timely manner with no interference in sample handling and it's our goals to treat every sample as a precious item to PATIENTS INTEGRITY.
good,Typical laboratory environment. Hourly employees drive lab success. Coworkers talk bad about you when you're not around. Do your work and keep your head down and you'll be fine.
good,"I truly can not complain. I worked there for 2 years.  They taught me a lot of skills."
good,"Quest provides good benefits, decent pay and excellent training. Perfect job for someone that scheduling does not matter as much as other things. Some aspects of management was questionable but over all it was a well run organization. I always got in at least 40 hours a week...sometimes more overtime then I wanted. Work atmosphere was excellent, coworkers always willing to help / teach you do things properly in good attitude manner. Once you are trained,  you are given a ""route"" to run for pick-ups without too much (if any) micro-management."
good,"Stressful work"
good,"I have not worked at Quest for a very long time, however I would not hesitate to work there if offered. Quest was a good place to work. It was busy and rewarding and had solid management. The volume of work was high but the staffing resources met the needs for TAT."
good,"enjoyed working with friendly people, customer service job so over the phone skills which was nice, great team work ethics, had a enjoyable time while working"
good,"Quest is  good company overall. I was able to grow within the company. The Managers were not flexible with me and honest, when it came to accommodating me and the company did not seem to mind losing good people."
good,It wasn't bad. Of course when you work together everyday some people clash but nothing ever big. It was mostly a positive environment. Very busy lab. Cooperation from all team Leaders was helpful.
good,Productive Environment with Growth Opportunity. Workplace Culture is Positive. Longevity with Employees. Schedule is good! I have learned a lot about the Medical Field.
good,this is a call center that stays busy 24/7. at least 150-200 callers a day easy. The pay is mediocre and the benefits are excellent. Wouldn't consider long term if you looking for advancement .
good,"I enjoyed the business partnership at the leadership level with Quest Diagnostics.  Work/Life Balance was challenging, but appreciated the opportunity to work with so many other leaders.  Employees really are passionate about what they do and take personal responsibility."
good,Responding to customer inquiries regarding outstanding bills and associated charges.  Posting payments and scheduled payment plans as appropriate. Applying credits accordingly.
good,"A productive and very interesting place to work. I enjoyed the Customer Service that I provided to hospitals,physicians offices,retirement centers"
good,"I have held various positions within the company for a number of years and it has mostly been a positive experience. The problem at my location is that the quality of the employees they are bringing in lately is lacking. No ethics, no values, no concept that they are actually being paid to do a job and complete a task."
good,The HR division was set up to support all business units.  I learned a lot about the business working in the HR team.  The people were friendly and welcoming and there was always a lot of work to do.
good,"would see over 120 + patient a day, got my experience of performing venipuncture small children and heel sticks on infants. management was great. didn't have much team work during the week, coworkers worked when they wanted. when working weekends there was team work. hardest part of the job was there was no team work during the week. most enjoyable part of Quest Diagnostics was the patients"
good,"A good place to work with a good culture (mostly Because of the division president). Decent pay to start,  raises are not good and bonuses are small. Not a lot of room for advancement."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company.  It was one of the first companies where I felt like I wasnt seen as just another disposable number to them, I was seen as an actual person with a real life.  My boss knew my sons name, and my medical struggles, and really worked with me and cared about what was going on in my life outside of work.  It was super refreshing."
good,I love my job. Lead techs in my area seem to be on edge all the time trying to impress their boss irregardless of how it makes them look to those they lead. Seems to be a lot of stress on them to prove themselves by barking out orders but never actually doing anything to help.
good,Company used to be very focused on their employees and gave pretty good raises.  Over time the company became less and less employee focused and more money driven.  Management was adequate but played favorites and looked out for certain employees.  Company finally sold billing functions and laid off half of the staff.
good,Good place to work.  The company offers some opportunities for advancement if you are willing to relocate.  Management is open to suggestions and feedback.
good,"If you show up every day, do your job to the best of your ability, have a good attitude and be nice to people, you'll be fine. It's like everyplace else; there are good days and bad days. Some days are a lot more stressful than others, but it's a call center and call centers can be stressful because you're at the mercy of the phone and the computer. For the most part, I like my job. I like my supervisor and my manager, and I've always been treated fairly. I've learned a lot of medical terminology and the many diseases that are out there."
good,"Overall this company is good to work for. Pretty good benefits and most of the staff is great to work with. Every site is different with work load, but most are fairly busy."
good,Good place to work. Excellent coworkers and a clean work environment. Opportunities to advance if the effort is put in. 40 plus hour workweeks with some Saturdays
good,I would work for them again. great company and liked the benefits. Managers helpful and I loved helping people as well as the clients.I loved that they offered education classes and pay for you to go to school.
good,"A courier at quest is not a hard job the benefits are good the pay is good you good vacation time accruement,the people that you work with are nice and friendly"
good,"It is very disappointing to admit that I have been a very loyal and above average employee for Quest diagnostics. What is disappointing is that I have worked here for 21 years and make less than that per hour.  there is no loyalty to the senior phlebs in the company. No appreciation for the hard work and stability that we do. Im very disappointed at the fact that I have to work a second job just to pay my bills. After being with a company this long, I shouldn't have to. Im looking elsewhere because of this. I do not want to have to receive food stamps or government welfare because my job wont pay me what I am worth. Where I am now, the supervisor prefers to promote people who have no experience, so she can mold them into doing things her way without question. Since I have integrity and I say something if I see its out of compliance, I am looked over again and again."
good,"Management/Managers lack of knowledge in Seattle, WA.  There is always new employee.  Lack of training and trainer.  Lack of meeting/ huddles every night.  They do not value the QUALITY and QUANTITY of each employee.  They choose the people for advancement without or POOR KNOWLEDGE for a certain position.  Attendance are not being ENFORCED."
good,"very busy in the morning but somehow slow down in the afternoon"
good,"i really enjoyed working there we had a great team to work with and a great supervisor and a great assistant supervisor,and also we got to test vet samples and i learned lots  about animal diseases and the different affects on how organisms affected animals and not humans in such a different way"
good,Working at Quest Diagnostics has been a good place to work. I did leave for a short time and they rehired me back. I am looking for a new job just because of the hours I am working.
good,A typical day at Quest was setting in a class of 20 people training on software that we were going to use when we work from home. I learned in the process that the job was only temporary until I got hired on with Bayer.
good,Working for Quest Diagnostics was a great experience I would typically work 8 hour days. Each day is usually filled with patients with appointments and without appointments. I would draw blood from babies and older people.
good,"I enjoyed working for Quest. The people were great and I loved my job. My schedule was very flexible. Unfortunately, the job I had was being changed in a direction that didn't match my career goals."
good,my typical day starts with a halfway house for those with addictions and then I go to the outpatient program.  My day begins at 7 am and I am done by noon. You meet people from many different backgrounds.
good,"quest is a good company,just low pay for the amount of pay for all the work you do. very diverse, good benefits, but no advancement opportunities. good for people looking for long term stability without looking to advance"
good,Quest Diagnostic is a great company to work for. They have great benefits.great pay and great atmosphere. Everyone is vry nie and management is very hands on and helpful
good,At Quest Diagnostic our mission and policies are the best. But their individual labs are not as people driven. Need love for people in medicine field.
good,Some long days but loved every minute of it the Patient Services Supervisor has a lot of responsibility but it has it share of rewards.....also you get a company car ....nice.
good,"New department management has brought relief in the amount of required overtime year round. It has also implemented the Kaizen program in order to give voice to the employees to improve the jobs we do and our workspace/environment. "
good,"Not much room for growth if your not of the popular vote. Lots of beneficial learnings and they pay for continuing education, benefits aren't the best ."
good,"I spent 10 years at Quest. I enjoyed working there and traveling to various locations to collect samples. I also processed specimen samples, collected pre-employment urinalysis and did data entry."
good,There are many changes taking place and keeping up with those can be challenging if not communicated. from management effectively and in a timely manner.
good,"Have worked at better lab environments. Quest employees are overloaded with work, not enough co-workers for the amount of work issued. There does not seem to be opportunity for advancement."
good,"A typical day is typing insurance information correctly and as fast as possible. We stretch every two hours and lunch and breaks are mandatory. We have three days of the week where we have to work up to two hours of mandatory overtime, if we have the work available."
good,My work day started at 8:00am until 5:00pm Monday through Friday. I learned at my job that patience is a virtue. The management was very professional and organized. The enviroment was very casual with a lot of teamwork. The hardest part of the job was a hard stick. The most enjoyable part of the job was processing and learning new things behind the scene!
good,"Good company to work for.  Management varies.    Pleasant co-workers, cafeteria, not a lot of direction regarding details of the job.  great benefits. Bad IT department."
good,"The days always began at different times, such as I would get a call that I had a STAT, at 06:30. I would muster quickly, to get to the lab, and do the STAT, as soon as possible. I would also stay late to accommodate physicians who hadn't recalled that they had ordered a STAT, and needed to call for a ""pick up"" from our couriers. It was very time consuming. So, I would stay until it came, and do that test."
good,Overall Quest Diagnostics is a good place to work at.  Everyone works hard but are recognized.  If a was to say mention something that needs improvement is communication on changes and mentoring.
good,"Easy going culture.  I started working in specimen processing and then moved to client services.  The work is demanding, but satisfying.  The company has college reimbursement program if the classes you take will allow you to improve in your current position or move into another department if desired.  I enjoyed working at Quest and would still be there if I hadn't had health issues that required me to stop working at that time."
good,"I love working for Quest. Such a great company to work for. Great benefit, colleagues and great supports from the management team. Quest is such a valuable company to work for."
good,"The work are not physical demanding. However, accurate and attention to detail is emphasized as mistakes can means more than getting fired, it might make a big different in a patient's health."
good,Staff wellness events with retail or employers to screen and counsel. Adequate training provided. Low on pay scale. The management is responsive and very organized. You are considered contract labor and must utilized their applications to request clinics. You then wait to see which ones you get assigned to.
good,"se empieza a las 8 de la mañana en visitas con clientes, cualquier duda que tengan, ayudarles a que reciban sus resultados, aprendí un nuevo tema sobre ventas de análisis clínicos que no se realizan en México, solamente en estados unidos. muy buenos compañeros, los químicos de ventas, que son los foráneos."
good,Competitive pay rate. Nice benefits package. Comprehensive training. Always something to do–time passes quickly. Nice to be helping patients and clinicians by providing results to ordered tests. I liked being able to listen to my music while I worked.
good,I love my co-workers.The patient load in high volume. the benefits are great. Management tends to hire outside for supervisors regardless of current employee's experience or education. That the reason I am currently looking outside of the company
good,I always worked in a new environment. I loved the hours. The experience of traveling and working with new people and new faces was the best.
good,"I like working here the only thing its that I work overnights and that affects me I never have time for myself. the people that I work with are great, but you have to work long hours too which okay sometimes."
good,Easy to sign up for biometric screening jobs. Yearly skills update provided with partial pay. Team leads are very good.
good,"Were I was employed to many relatives and close friends working in the same department, very clickish work environment."
good,"I loved going into work in the mornings, I was always greeted by my coworker with a ""Good Morning!"" followed by a huge grin. This job taught me more than I ever thought possible; Being in the field gave me so many ""Ah-Ha"" moments. I felt wanted and needed most days, and patients loved me. I did find pediatric sticks daunting at first but in the long run I found that it was a challenge I wanted to take and knew I could perform. Phlebotomy is the one thing I love doing and know I'm great at."
good,Work/Life balance acceptable. Compensation on the low end of competitive. Benefits were great. Advancement is limited. Management and Job Culture go hand in hand.
good,"Rapid pace but insured patient satisfaction and job safety. Insured proper training for staff in all areas of care including:"
good,"is a very interesting place to work, you get to learn new things."
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a fast-paced, service driven company.Our team members try to build this great brand by delivering amazing customer service. Working with doctors and patients, we strive to maintain and uphold the highest level of client confidentiality."
good,"A typical day at Quest Diagnostics, working close with others, the hardest part of my job is the air quality at times of the year, and the most enjoyable part of it is that I am changing lives and possibly saving them as well."
good,Quest is not the best nor is it the worst.  Your experience at Quest is what you make of it.  Wearing Jean everyday is a bonus.  There is always opportunities in Customer Service
good,I did contract work for Quest for two years and I really loved the environment. From the security to managers everyone is friendly. The workload isn't too hard.
good,"Working at Quest Diagnostics has and is a great honor. This company is amazing and you can grow within the company. We put"
good,"Very good lab that people can trust, multinational company, "
good,"I was with their billing department doing a new process- imaging.  After scanning the requisitions, billing was able to pull them up and bill directly from them."
good,Greenbelt company.  Managers are engaged with team and manage team through metrics.  Company has been through many reorganizations and layoffs within the past few years.
good,Great people to work with and the supervisors are very understanding. They were willing to work with schedule conflicts.
good,"Everyone was super helpfull, and willing to teach all who were"
good,Every one there is a pleasure to work with including the staff and residents.  The work environment is clean and comfortable.
good,"It's a fast paced, production-based career with good compensation and benefits. Though, it does take a little time to get yourself used to the hours. I work the overnight shift."
good,"Working for Quest Diagnostics has been an empowering journey improving better health with diagnostic insights. A typical day at work would start off taking temperatures,  making sure the cultures where at the right temperatures for incubation growth. Then the techs "
good,Use scanner to scan location bar codes and pick up medical samples
good,"great company but when i was there a lot of management problems, but hear that management has since changed and that it is a great place to work for now"
good,Not a bad place to work but compensation is very low for the work expected.  Advancement is pretty poor.  Benefits are good.
good,"Being exposed to another tasks after another is challenging. Have to learn medical language/terminologies. It is fun because, you will acquire knowledge about health especially for women's health."
good,"I gather specimens create worksheets  label and plant specimens to look for bacteria growth."
good,If they paid just a little bit more this would be a great place to work
good,Fast growing department that keeps you on your toes.  The hardest part is that you have to leave the lab in order to eat or drink anything so you can never have that morning cup of coffee while you work.  The enjoyable part is knowing there is no work to take home with you because the next shift will pick up where you left off.
good,I was there for 1 month doing an internship. They were very helpful and taught me a lot about phlebotomy.
good,"Quest is busy. Best thing was the fast paced environment. Hardest was working alone, it seemed like there wasn't enough coverage which was stressful but I was always able to learn new things and expand my knowledge."
good,"busy all time working hard to satisfied customer service and patients "
good,i work for the patient service centers where the patient would come in and get their blood drawn.
good,"Demanding, high pressure sales environment. Very heavy on servicing. Very stable company. Great benefits."
good,Its nice to go to work daily and love what you do along with a great team to work with.
good,I had a great experience working with a great team and learned many of my skills from there.
good,"I enjoyed working for Quest in Colorado, but when I received a job transfer to come back home to Mass, I had been placed 1 1/2hrs from my residency and tried for 8mths to obtain a location closer to my residency which was not granted to me.  Very discouraged since I had worked for the company for over 3yrs."
good,"I typically work alone my entire day normally is enjoyable,management is very meticulous the hardest part of the job is figuring how to get the call ins i get into my route."
good,"I need day off on sunday and monday"
good,Quest has great people to work with and really does care about patients and people.
good,Overall rating quest diagnostics is a good place to work with. Their compensation and benefits are awesome. I learned a lot during my tenure and of course...... I guess I wont stay that long if  I am not happy with what im doing and the people I worked with.
good,"JJS -Wauchula"
good,"We were shocked to find out that our Department was going to be severed and relocated to Valencia, CA."
good,"Enjoyable place to work.  You learn how to run front office with easy, co-workers most be a team player.  The hardest part of the job would be a difficult vein.  The patient care and a patient wanting to return for excellent care."
good,I processed all the out going specimens. I made sure all the collection requirements and process requirments were met. I entered it all in the system then shipped it out to Quest. I was also the customer service representative for that account. If a client had any questions about tests or billing they were directed to me. The management was very good with quest. The supervisors kept in close contact with the employees. The co-workers were alo great to work with.The hardest part of the job was having to leave when they sold to another lab. The people I worked with were the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"Quest as a company provides a playground with which to learn scientific techniques.  I was provided with all the tools I needed to conduct the research that I chose to conduct, from protein purification to liquid handling systems.  The management was always supportive, and the co-workers help to create an environment where not only do you enjoy being around them at work, you also enjoy being around them out of work.  The company is expectedly fast-paced, and can be hard to deal with at times, but is especially rewarding because you will always be at the fore-front of the clinical diagnostic research being conducted."
good,"At Quest I would come in, greet my coworkers, set up my station then begin seeing patients, filling out paperwork and maintaining my station as well as specimen processing room. Here I got more practice with routine lab work. The management was highly professional, patient care driven and knowledgeable. I worked with very few people as it was a small lab but those whom I did work with were friendly, positive people that were concerned about their performance and having happy clients. The hardest part of the job was trying to interact with difficult patients. The most enjoyable part of the job was that everyone maintained a professional countenance and environment."
good,"It is a very hectic day . I learned a lot especially the different test ordering and the requirements of the  test. The management are really great. They are not there all the time which is great no pressure at all from my supervisor . I work on my own as the representative to the other lab. MY CO-WORKERS are always great to me. The hardest part of the job is the hours that  I work which was not favorable to my family."
good,Ive learned alot with this company as far as phlebotomy skills management was a little rough but it comes with the severity of the job my co workers were very pleasant andf nice and respectful and the miost enjoyable part of the job is a happy patient leaving without complaints or hematomas
good,"Quest is a great company to work for. They have great benefits, the hours are good but management is unfair and down right mean. They do not believe in having fun at work or enjoying your job...don't even smile. Management has no compassion and they laugh and talk about you behind your back. The manager was nick named ""the terminator"" if that gives you any indication. If you can put up with management the job is great."
good,"- Fast paced, high productivity, constant -"
good,"i enjoyed going to work everyday because i love what i do typical day was steady call patients, check the forms and insurances, drew the proper blood tests and got them properly ready and packaged to be picked up to go to the lab"
good,long work hours the benefits sucks. bonus every year between 500 to 1000 dollars a year depending on how long you work there.
good,"On a typical day of work usually there is enough work to keep you busy all day, but if you schedule your time wisely you can complete the work in a timely manner. I have learned many things and have worked in 3 areas of the lab Microbiology, Serology, and Molecular, because of needed help, and I was a good candidate because I am a fast learner with lots of experience. My co-workers are friendly and like to cook and bring the many dishes of their culture. I think some of the managers need more training on communication skills, and also should realize that they should learn each bench provided questions come up. For me I feel if you are very organized, have good communciation skills and reliable there is nothing too hard. The most enjoyable part of the job are the holidays, and Take Your Kid to Work Day."
good,"a typical day is keying imaged information on the computer with the option of listening to music. with an occasional department, team or individual meeting once a month. management keeps to themselves and so does the coworkers mainly because we have a daily quota to meet. the hardest part of the job is doing the same thing over and over while the most enjoyable part of the job is that it is laid back"
good,"Good but very busy work environment, operating various instrument, required to do overtime until daily work load was finished; poor cooperation between shifts"
good,OK place to work. The best part of the job was the constant challenge. The hardest part of the job was seeing so many of my co-workers leave.
good,busy enviornment repetative work thats micro managed. great benefits with hr on site all times to help out with any concerns
good,like every forture 500 company it has it down side. i like staff n benefits n the execise i got everyday doing my route
good,"Good company to work for, has lots of overtime. Good health benefits. High paced work enviroment,"
good,"Quest could use some help in project management, and the decisions of how the budget is distributed. sometimes the company pushes an agenda that doesn't make sense to the employees."
good,I enjoy the work but the pay is ridiculously low for all of the work we do. I wish they would offer a better pay rate because I truly enjoy working for the company as a whole.
good,"The hardest part about my job is that there's no room for advancement and no type of recognition.  "
good,Company is awesome. I would welcome the opportunity to work for them again if management in the nashville HR dept has changed since my time there.  I believe one should know how to do the work they are delegating in case of emergencies.
good,Working there amongst coworkers for many years felt like a second family. I always look forward working with some of my former coworkers The job was a bit stressful but with good benefits.
good,"Good company work for. Fast pace"
good,I truly enjoyed my 15+ years with the company. Like all places they have both good and bad aspects of things but when I weigh it all I had more good than bad. I love the various things they did within the community and the encouragement for a better and healthier living.
good,"I love working for this company. The culture and overall job is great. I get along with the clients that i meet and see everyday and the job at the end of the day is rewarding. However, with every great company comes some sort of flaw and for my case it’s not the company’s fault. You can choose the company you work for, but not who the company chooses to hire... unfortunately"
good,"Training is extensive, probably because they hire people with no experience which is great for people that want to get experience in the field.  They stop work during the shift to do a ""huddle"" so they can let you know how the shift is going and how much more work is still coming in and to give credit to those who have exceeded performance goals the previous night.  There is no dress code outside of no belly shirts, vulgar t-shirts, short shorts and things like that. It's a good place to work especially if your introverted because you can wear your earbuds and will usually have minimal contact with other staff outside of training unless you want to talk to them."
good,I enjoy working with quest as it gives a very good work life balance and gave me a paid vacation of 4 weeks to my home country. They have very good benefits package + stock buying options.
good,I worked less than 40 hours per week so I didn't receive benefits but it was a good job. I also didn't know that I would have to write a 150 word review.
good,"Quest folks treated me nice.  Great retiree job!  The pay could be better.  Luckily, I don't need top pay since I enjoy a good retirement, but in all fairness, they should pay more"
good,"More of a worker bee. Cannot learn new skills if you hold a professional degree.  They want you to stay in that field.  Employees without a degree can move up faster than a person with a degree and can eventually become their supervisor or manager. However, they will work with you if you have things going on in your personal life and need a flexible schedule."
good,It's a good place to work with great benefits. The structure is easy enough to follow and they care about client outcomes. I would continue working here if not for lack of career advancement as a laboratory scientist.
good,this place was ok to work for. very stressful and they make you call people over and over who don't want out services and we would get yelled at or cursed at everyday
good,Good company to work for but sometimes the fast pace can be overwhelming if you don't have any help. You learn a lot working for Quest and the more you learn the comfortable you become in the job.
good,Was able to kick start my career with this company. It paved a way to my current success. I appreciate the opportunity that was given because it was a great foundation that I feel I needed as a nurse that many nurses don't have. Making me a valuable asset in my career. Everyone I work with knows my back ground and look to me for my expertise on blood draws. Something that may seem so simple has been the greatest experience and skill I've learned.
good,Very organized place to work. training and feedback is topnotch. work volume is a lot but if organized easy to manage. this is a great place for to gain experience as a medical technologist because the training is great
good,"This job was easy, however to advance you need to stay quiet. They mainly choose their favorites or quiet ones. Once you give too much push back even if they're wrong, their goes your opportunity for advancement. Unless you go over the supervisors head, but then that gets awkward and they'll be out to get you. The CEO is super nice, she's the most humble person I've met st the company. She'll speak to you before any tech rep, supervisor or manager would."
good,"Raises were minuscule and didn't fully keep up with cost of living, but health benefits and vacation time were very nice.  You are often at the mercy of bad traffic, but you generally have enough to time get where you need to go.  Long periods of private solitude while driving, which is nice for listening to the radio or podcasts.  Most co-workers are ok, but management will often play favorites and isn't much interested in settling issues.  Annual bonus is based on company profit sharing and isn't very impressive, but better than nothing.  Some branches take better care of their employees than others, so it's hard to make a broad generalization over the whole company.  Overall, I'd work there again."
good,"Learn a lot in the laboratory as a specimen processing, enjoy working with others, people are very helpful to each other working as a team. Good environment."
good,I loved being a Phlebotomist.  I just did not like having to put all the medical information into the computer before I drew the blood. And I didn't like having to process all the blood.  I just love people and wanted to draw blood.
good,"Run Daily report. Find what is needed to get lab work paid from insurances. Call or write physicians to obtain missing information, then reprocess order to insurance company."
good,While aorking here its was Cool but nust becareful of management not.following SOP constantly Bias choosing side ignored Nepotism  constantly lies to customers about Insurance produce and cost encouraged charging for patients didn't not have to cause of Insurance
good,"Quest is about the money , what I love about quest is all though they are tight with money we get two bonuses a year . Free money for doing your job . They change policies and procedures alllllooootttt. They make phlebotomists do a lot of the work before it gets to the testing point . I think pay is a little more then fair , not excellent but more then fair . Management for some can be great and for others it’s not . This company is everywhere . So advancement is very likely ."
good,"happy working at quest diagnostics"
good,I liked my job but it becomes redundant. Repeating the same thing over and over again. But I enjoyed my co workers they were fun. Management enjoys tattletails- and wants to know every and anything someone is doing to get the in trouble
good,"Typically, daily operations are stressful as there is an abundant quantity of work and insufficient staff. This being said, the staff is extremely devoted to their professions and are willing to execute the daily workload."
good,"Quest offers excellent service to clients in the Laboratory industry."
good,Quest Diagnostics was a great company and thrived in making sure every employee is successful and happy in their roles. Quest was amazing in training and made sure you understood everything.
good,"nice place to work, good work environment. compensation average for field. No stress workplace culture is neutral, co-workers very helpful resourceful."
good,Patients make showing up to work enjoyable. You never know who your going to meet . Or what challenges your going to face. Coworkers are also a great part of the Quest family. If you get the right mix everyday is enjoyable.
good,I learned that even if you have been with this company for years you can still be fearful for your job everyday.  Supervisor not willing to transfer you even though there are other jobs.
good,"I really enjoyed the team dynamic and culture that the company tries to adhere to. Some of the management teams of group leads, supervisors, and area managers concerned with personal advancement, and miss entry level FTE's that could have been a great asset."
good,"I enjoy working at Quest.  The benefits are really good and there are several areas/departments you can grow with.   It's a major corporation that dominates the market.  If you are wanting to grow with a company, Quest is a good selection."
good,"fast paced environment- pressure"
good,Working at Quest was a good fit for me at the time. I always knew what was expected from me in regards to workflow. Learning new technology was appreciated. Continuing education courses were provided. Even when the workload was heavy it was manageable. Management was approachable and usually accessible. Flexible work hours were a most welcome benefit.
good,Quest Diagnostics was a fast paced position that focused a lot of energy on patient/customer satisfaction.  Uniform was required and supplied by company.  Compensation was above average with yearly incentive bonus.  Management needed much improvement.
good,"my most enjoyable part of my job is making patient feel that they are important.my typical day is drawing blood in nursing home ,homes and group home.Hardest part of the job was driving.fun workplace culture."
good,"Many opportunities for growth at quest diagnostics. good benefits, advancement options and tuition reimbursement available. I would recommend this company to all."
good,pros are you get to make your own schedule-compensation is average-no full time employment opportunities for mobile paramedical examiners or health insurance benefits
good,"Great group of people to work with...very helpful in learning the many systems, policies and procedures necessary to succeed at this job.  Always learning something new."
good,giant company with thousands of employees.  Works slow at corporate level to meet competition.  Good training and work life balance.  need to integrate companies they purchase quicker
good,"A good place to work. Benefits are excellent. Management is the only thing that is terrible I hope the company change that. Management think you cannot have a day off without the supervisor in Sugarland getting a attitude with her employees, yelling on the phone, does not approve days off, texting or emailing rude comments to the employee about productions and call-in. Overall Quest is a good company to work for. I enjoy being employ with the company for 8 yrs. The only complaint I have is management."
good,"It was an enjoyable experience, schedule worked for what I needed at the time and I enjoyed working with my coworkers. I wish there was greater emphasis on advancement within the company."
good,comfortable place to work very clean and  organized.no tolerance to racism very diverse people respect each other and work together very i have not seen any outburst or violence in my sixteen years of employment.
good,Their attendance policy is cut and dry not very family friendly. They pay the highest for a phlebotomy job. You get to use their vehicles. It’s a laid back job.
good,Rather not disclose any particulars about a day in the life of at Quest / Optum360. Much of the information we deal with cannot be disclosed due to Patient Health Records
good,"Just a nice environment with good people and a fun job. The driving part is the fun with the customer service and meeting people. Hardest part was going home being part-time. As far as adding more words to reach the minimum, I can only say that the company does a great job of making the workplace a benefit."
good,"Quest pays well and has some good benefits. Quest gives you paid time off and paid holidays. But they do not allow you to carry over but a small amount of time into the next year and if you are not allowed to use your time, you lose it.The work load is getting too much for the staff available but no interest in hiring help. Most days are very stressful trying to meet TAT and not make mistakes."
good,"Enjoyed my position, worked directly with physicians and medical staff to promote diagnostic testing.  Great support staff from QD and from medical providers."
good,"I enjoyed working for quest. I believe if it had not been for my health and starting School, I would still be employed. I found the management staff to be helpful and caring when it came to the needs of the employees. The only thing that I found that could be changed was the rate of pay."
good,"Good customer service, collected payment for services and collected specimen to send to the lab. Presently, opportunity to get higher education and hour lunches. I like the amount of vacation time. The culture is very professional. With the benefit of getting new uniform every year."
good,"Fast paced workplace, production is key.  Accuracy is a must. Learned a lot about how testing is done on specimens and how it is a must to be accurate and proficient in what we do."
good,I original began with Quest Diagnostics billing department which taught me about Microsoft products and how they work. Most impressible are the people willing to train you on those different function.
good,"too much work and too fast paced for my personality. well paid and good benefits though. .pto and sick leave, profit sharing. commute to chantilly is a beast"
good,The workplace culture is extremely fast-paced and team-oriented. Be prepared to come to work ready to try your hardest to get accurate and quick patient results.
good,"Quest is too large a company for any one employee's experiences to be likely to apply to the job a potential candidate is looking at. I enjoyed my time at Quest due to a series of good supervisors and coworker, but I knew people in other departments within the same building who received horrible treatment - and ones who had an ever better experience than I did. Quest usually gives decent benefits and pay. Beyond that, every position and department is going to be a different experience with a different culture."
good,"Great collaboration with workers, fast pace easy to learn and meet new people. Allows you to travel, has set hours, and gives you the opportunity to utilize your skills as a phlebotomist."
good,"typically fast paced, "
good,"I enjoyed working for Quest Diagnostic. I was temp and was hired on presently and work for them for 4 years. The environment was repetitious with minor supervision and excellent health benefits. The only the I didn't like that they only offered 2nd and 3rd shift at the time I worked there. But, that has since chanced."
good,This is a good job if you enjoy driving and being by yourself for the most part throughout the day. They have good benefits and the health insurance is great. There does seem to be a lack of communication between supervisors though.
good,"Good work place and strong culture. Management needs to be more involved with day to day operations so everyone is treated fairly, PAITENTS Satisfaction is usually positive."
good,productive everyday is a learning experience. management is always near by and helpful with assistance. variety in culture. hardest part will be knowing where to search for uncommon issues. enjoyable part is helping people with health and getting results to them as soon as possible.
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a great company to work for.  They are very patient driven and are always striving to better the experience for their patients.  Quest Diagnostics works hard at keeping their staff up to date and trained with all the latest testing.  We strive our selves on being the best we can be, so that are patients get the best care possible."
good,"not a bad place to work, but like all healthcare very stressful. Too many patients, not enough staff. language barrier, patients do not speak english, but expect you to speak spanish."
good,"This was a good place to work for up until it was decided to close our facility."
good,"Good job, but low pay.strong corporate structure and have a consistent routine. Good training program, and for full-time workers, paid vacations. Part time workers have nothing coming."
good,This company is a good place to work if you are fresh out of high school or needing a job asap. I would not recommend this position to people who are single parents with children. if ever you need to leave early or miss a day for medical reason they will count against you as an unexcused absence or tardy. The pay is fair and the hours are consistent.
good,"I enjoyed working with Quest Diagnostics Inc. I found the work challenging, and interesting with ample room for growth. Unfortunately the contracts come and go."
good,"It's a good company for advancement but the work is repetitive, and rehire seems impossible. Overall nice pay and really good benefits, and very flexible."
good,My overall experience working for quest was generally great . The one thing I could say about it is that we were very much not staffed enough for the amounts of people we would see on a day to day basis
good,"This company is very fast paced and it works best if everyone will remember that and pitch in.  I worked in Southern California and there were times that I was with a crew that would not pull their own weight and when I mentioned it, the management did nothing about it.  Quest Diagnostics as a company, however, is amazing.  They are a pioneer in Laboratory testing and I love the company for what they do."
good,"Learned how to multi task within each department.  Was given the opportunity to learn within and outside of our facility by providing constant training."
good,"Everyone gets along routes are evenly spread out from pickups, no stress."
good,I worked the third shift for 16 years and this was perfect for me at that time. I learned a lot of new skills and had opportunity to become a lead in my department. The best part of the job was getting my team to work together to meet productivity standards.
good,Great co-workers and good work environment. Pretty easy job but you do have to learn a lot at the beginning . I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,Quest is a good company to work for. It can be stressful at times but manageable when handled correctly.There is a chance for advancement within the company.
good,"GOOD PLACE TO WORK UNDER PROPER MANAGEMENT. If you have a good manager and your co-workers pull their load, it's a great place to work. You get a pretty good yearly bonus. Most employees are nice to work with."
good,very highly motivated company. management is fair. high energy type of culture. the hardest part of the job was keeping the customers happy due to their circumstances. the most enjoyable part of my job was making the customers happy.
good,While working for quest. I enjoyed the people and the job duties. Office setup was hard to control patient flow. My personal site saw 90 to 100+ a day. It was hard to keep patient times low with the high volume and lack of support.
good,"Horrible management! Had to take extended lunches to get rid of overtime, Scheduling enough employees was always lacking, PTO was never approved due to scheduling issues. I enjoyed the fast pace environment, and the different variety of patients. I would typically draw anywhere from 20-60 patients a day."
good,"I really enjoy working for this company, good environment, nice people and very good working hours, however their attendance policy  is not very flexible."
good,"Fast paced days as we were usually under a deadline.  Once, the deadline was reached we would at that time be able to lighten up and would be able to enjoy ourselves and chat with one another to a certain degree."
good,This position was a great experience and I learned a lot being in the laboratory industry. The job was very good and I enjoyed each and every day as my clients were the best.
good,"One of the best jobs I've had. People would say being a CSR is hard and sucks but it only does if you make it suck. Management is great, offer benefits and bonuses, rewards and random food days. Easy to learn the content."
good,"Daily entering patient info, with any corrections necessary. occasionally answering telephones. Was trained in processing specimens, to help with overflow or short staffing.  Management was"
good,"Very high volume about 10,000 samples a day. Learned supervisory scales and management of technicians working under me.  Management had high expectation on quality because the business was volume driven.  Hard work but enjoyable days driven by team work."
good,"Daily tasks with Quest Diagnostics included aiding doctors and nurses with all account related inquiries including, billing, test related questions, documentation of all client interactions, logistics and supplies requests and aiding team members when needed."
good,cares about their employees. great benefits. management tried to work with employees.cares about their patients. lots of changes over the years.
good,"Busy, productive work, billing patients' health insurance for lab work performed.  Pleasant company to work for, co-workers were great.  Company went through major reorganization starting in 2015, eliminating the billing department and eliminating my position."
good,it was nice place working with the co workers night shift some people are to cranky at night team work is a must at that place some friendly staff good
good,"The manny patients that we see in this type set up  job help me very much in be coming a great phlebotomist, seen patients of all ages taking care of at least 50-70 patients gave me a great practice and experience. The harder part of the job was when dealing with small children its never easy to see them cry! Great team work help me to make my job more essay and enjoyable."
good,"Quest is a good place to work if you are out of college but with it being a very busy and fast pace lab, it makes training slow and also, long work days."
good,A typical day at work included fast paced data entry processing of toxi specimens from remote locations for us to process for millions of clients. The hardest part of the job is the overtime
good,Quest was a very fast pace lab which I loved but I was only here for my externship. The phlebotomists were very helpful and were great teachers. I learned a lot from Quest.
good,"Go in, log into computer and be on phones non stop all day, get 2 15 minute breaks and 1 hour lunch. Had mandatory overtime that range from 2-16 hours per week, then you will have opportunity to come into work on a Saturday to complete overtime that wasn't finished during the week. I really enjoyed my co-workers we were all really like family. Overall it was an enjoyable place to work."
good,"Challenging work place, long hours, great people to work with, the Management very knowledgeable and helpful, great company benefits and work environment."
good,"Work hours 730-400pm Mon- Fri"
good,"I am currently working part-time but my position will be unavailable soon. The company is changing it's position of hiring part-time employees. I have learned a great deal by reading abnormal slides in Hematology. Management is quiet typical but generally good. The hardest part of working at Quest is working efficiently within a specific time frame, but my co-workers were always there to help and vice versa. The best part of working for Quest are my co-workers which I will miss very much."
good,"Good company to work for.  Looks out for their employees.  "
good,"Enter daily invoices into the medical billing system"
good,Quest always came up with new workshops to better work relations between departments.  You always needed to be at your peak performance to satisfy management. Sometimes it was hard to keep up with your work when you were pulled to help other workers get caught with their work.
good,This job is certainly not boring. You are on the phone's all day talking to around 70 - 100 people a day. You play an important role in getting results out to patients and doctors. The co-workers are great. You can ask them anything and they will help you out. The hardest part of the job is when you get an irate patient who will yell and carry on and ask to speak to the CEO and threatens to write a letter to the president because they are so angry. And it's all because they do not agree with Quest Diagnostics policies and how things are done within the company. I've learned how to handle such irate patients and how to de-escalate a patient so that we can get on to solving the problem.
good,"A good place to work at, decent pay and hardly a way to advance without relocating. Other than that management is good and so are the benefits."
good,"assists the department manager and supervisor obtain production and quality standards. problem resolution, proper test selection, training ,cross training team of 8-10 on current and new procedures."
good,You have set schedules and every week mandatory OT. but with unlimited OT after you do what you are asked. Which gives you room to make lots more money.
good,"Great environment to work in, loved my superiors. Only problem I had is the attendance policy. You are not allowed to miss more than one day and I went to the hospital from work and missed a day came with a letter from my doctor showing my diagnosis and notice to return to work an they didn't accept it and let me go for missing the days"
good,"Very productive It had very long hours but i got to drive around all day alone. I met people all day, ate breakfast and lunch where ever and when ever I wanted. I was working the mobile department so you made your own schedule. The hardest part of the job was driving in the snow and when patients where home alone and could not open door fast enough so I could finish my day. Another down side was coming home after a long day and having to clock back in to call patients for the following day."
good,Pretty cool you can make your own schedule the pay is nothing to write home about and the supervisor can be annoying but its just make a little extra cash
good,Worked as a Medical Technologist at one of their main labs.  Very fast paced work environment with high workload.  Difficult to manage workload at times.
good,"Quest, despite numerous changes within the company in recent years, remains a leader in the industry. As an employer, they offer competitive wages and benefits. "
good,"Good management, open door policy, good hours, good benefits for full-time staff, no benefits for part time staff, however, we do receive a shift differential"
good,"Right now there is a large culture change going on at Quest Diagnostics. Many cut-backs, budget tightening, and personnel issues take the fun and enjoyment I once had away. They pay fairly well and the benefits are very good but that is not enough to stick around."
good,"They really make you feel like a family here. Hours are a drain but free ice cream can make in a ton better. :)"
good,"good environment. friendly, fast and upbeat.Patients are friendly. Management is currently changing for the good. Leaning many new things on a daily basis. Hardest part of the job is reading slopping Doctors writing on scripts."
good,A typical day at work would be analyzing credit balances and determined patient or insurance refunds. Answering customer service calls and insurance letter request for refund audits. My co workers were like my second family. The most enjoyable part of my job was the challenges of learning new things and being able to expand my knowledge.
good,"greet patients as they enter the facility, registered patients input and update patient information including insurance, transcribe phys. orders, prepare documents and patient for specimen collection, collect specimen via blood, urine , stool, ect. process the specimen , get them prepared or the lab, make sure patient is satisfied with services provided.. maintain visible appearance of facility."
good,"Open lab at 8  a.m.  Meet and greet patients for check-in. Provide phlebotomy services as well as great customer service. Update all demographics into computer as well as Insurance. Collection of blood samples, centrifuge and prepare for courier pick-up.  There is no hard part to my job. Enjoyed every aspect of my job."
good,Nice environment. Very far and dangerous drive to and from work.
good,"I get to meet new people everyday, but also have the same patients come in on a monthly basis."
good,"My first 10 years with this company were great. Management and co workers were professional, friendly and well organized in New Jersey & Texas main labs. Excellent benefits with opportunity for growth. Fast paced work environment which is a good challenge for those who like stay busy. The only hard part on a daily basis was if we were short staffed. It made an already busy day overwhelming at times."
good,Quest has been making changes and it has influenced the way they treat their employees.
good,Very busy days which made the time fly by. Learned processing and was interim manager during manager's vacation.
good,"Do not touch the dry ice, driving all day, the benefits here were excellent!"
good,"Being a part of a 40,000 plus employee has its challenges and rewards but the atmosphere was always pleasant."
good,"Reviewed patients information that wanted to apply for life insurance, determined if the amount of life insurance was either to high or too low based off patient medical expenses and income."
good,"Fast paced. Reviewing orders for blood work. Data entry, draw blood and process specimens according to company SOP. Fun enter action with other co workers. Being part of a team that works well together is awesome."
good,"learning something new everyday."
good,"•	Partner with business leaders to develop financial plans and projections for Q2 through Q4 2013 and 2014 budget for Corporate Support Cost Functions of approx. $1.01B.  Directly responsible for the Clinical Franchise area of approx. $60M."
good,"Process specimen for analysis and testing, qns samples and correspond with clients for various tests and samples. The best part was the family oriented environment and the networking. The hardest part was the parking."
good,A typical day at work consist of checking 30 emails a day. Pre call plan research at night. 7am field calls from customers and handle any service needs at that time. By 8am we begin door to door sales and service call some cold but mostly by appointments. We then present product or service by meeting there needs by exposing there pain points. We then relay successes to Management and set next appointments with Vendors/Specialist through multiple department collaboration. The hardest part of the job is keeping the customer happy. So many situations are out of our control. However you are the point person that resolves any issues. The most rewarding part of the job is the information learned and meeting the needs of customers that result in Commission/Bonus and Awards.
good,"I started off as a phlebotomist, but after several years I wanted a change. I was interested in learning the business side of the company. With their help, I was able to advance in other areas of expertise."
good,"I learned some new valuable skills on a software called Rally.  It is used for time tracking on projects, checking status of projects within my group."
good,Flexibility with working in the field.   Co-workers were always friendly and willing to help.
good,"I work five days a week and no rest except for breaktime/lunchbreak. My co-worker was always late for work and I have to serve 3-6  patients until she comes. For the earlier part of my employment, maybe four years, Supervisors/Management were all supportive to all  their employees but  later years, they were not . When Downsizing/Saving Program was implemented, a massive termination of older employees , including me , occurred with unbelievable reasons. In the two employee-manned  Patient Service Center where I worked,  the hardest part of the job, is when you work alone (co-worker is late/absent) and help/support is coming late, you have to deal/face with irate sick patients. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you serve/help a lot of patients who are understanding and patient , no complaints whatsoever, while waiting for their turn to be serve."
good,"8-10 hr work day,dealing with problem requisitions. "
good,"Good people, good benefits, great pay. Easy enough if you don't mind doing the same thing every day every hour every minute."

good,I learned so much about patient and client requirements and how to make sure they were always done in a professional way.
good,Relatively stable company with strong foothold in their respective market(s). Seemed to value its employees and offer chances to advance or move to other areas of the organization.
good,"Patients are always first. Customer services is great. Room for advancement,"
good,"It's non-stop all day, full of stress and numerous responsibility but at times there are moments to remind you the emotional rewards."
good,"A typical night at Quest Diagnostics would me basically being a self-starter. I was a data entry specialist, I needed no guidance and we were not looked over, we were left to do our jobs which I appreciated. After all paperwork was processed, specimen inventory would be next."
good,"I picked up medical specimens, delivered medical reports. delivered medical supplies."
good,good place to work
good,"Started with billing 3rd party insurance and medicaid/medicare, became team trainer and trainer overall for patient review, helped do pilot projects and earned rewards. Mentor program helped me out to advance. Great company atmosphere and people."
good,"Very fast paced, no nonsense environment. Skills can be a little difficult to learn, but work load is lighter for beginners. Highest productivity demands of all laboratories."
good,The hours were good for family. Stable hours with sites thoughout the United States with transfer options. I was previously employed by Unilab when Quest Diagnostics took over. Transition was not handled well for the Unilab employees. Many former Unilab employees were fired or quit out of frustration.
good,"Excellent opportunity to learn and explore clinical laboratory sales through multiple disease states. Chance to work cross functionally with internal teams, logistics, billing, client services, etc."
good,Loved the hours as well as the pay. Great staff to work with as well. I only had to resign because I had moved! Benefits were also wonderful. Would definitely go back if I could
good,The company is very well balanced and once you get the hang your able to go on your own and dont have any issues. Great support team and my managers are amazing. I enjoy driving for the company.

good,"Great company to work for.  You must always be mindful of paying attention to the details pertaining to your specific needs on your route,or a route. Never forget to scan all of your work into the handheld scanner.  Report all incidents to your immediate supervisor.  Check your vehicle at the end of the shift for any work that has to be turned in."
good,"I have no problems with the workload and flow of patients.  As long as you have a supervisor that is supportive and willing to help your career advance, that will make all the difference with your experience."
good,Quest is a great company to work. They offer great benefits and 401K plans. Training and certification classes offered. You can advance quickly within the company.
good,"Overall good...Last years management lacking. Integration of Florida as regional lead to displacement of management and poor lines of communication internal.  As a primary department,  I believe that our expertise and contribution were neither appreciated or recognized. 20 years of experience seemed to be"
good,"Nice company to work at for someone who has little experience. It was very thorough in teaching new employees. Nice challenge, very busy, lots of room to learn and experience new things. Some cons; no trashcans, airfreshners, handsanitizer, clocks, etc.."

good,"Good place  to work management could have  been  a  little better but overall  great benefits flexible work  schedules, and they showed appreciation  for  their employees"
good,"Lots of coworkers, busy environment. Training is good, but not all of the team leads are approachable (after training). No one really bothers you, but you really don't interact with anyone, either. After two months, I only know the names of supervisors, some team leads, and a few people who started at the same time as me."
good,Quest is a great stepping stone for new phlebotomist. Its a fast paced environment and you will learn alot. You will also perform blood draws on a wide range of people.
good,There isn’t room to move up at this site. Rate of pay is below the standard for higher education employees. Hourly instead of salary for degree employees.

good,Loved working here and my job.  There was no real advancement and you basically repeat the same day over and over.  I enjoyed meeting and working with clients old and new.
good,I like it there training could be better but everyone is friendly and helpful. Room for advancement. They do a lot of team building activities to help every one work as a team.
good,This job is very enjoyable to have if you like to work by yourself to complete task on your route. Everyone is like family here love to help one another when needed.
good,"I really enjoy working with the company, I did learn so much as a temp working as a"
good,"Being a client service rep for Quest is enjoyable. But I dont feel it is always about the numbers. You are set on time limits on how long it should take to handle a call, and when your running 2 separate computers, for both Quest and Solstas, sometimes it is hard to do so. Becuse you are searching and have to remember the correct protocol for both different lab companies. And the Quest management dont understand that.The Quest system is much easier than Solstas. Solstas is more detail required."
good,"Draw blood ,process specimens, care for patients and keeping a safe environment. Management was always changing. Enjoyable part of Quest most everyone knew hoe to draw blood great experience"
good,A typical day requires a lot of travel between clients especially if you are in a large market/city.  The freedom to adjust your meetings is appreciated though there will be times that you cannot fully receive the access or support you would like to get in front of providers.
good,"Quest was a good place to work. They will send you to school if you are interested in anything related to the job. A lot of incentives. Very fast paced but that just makes the time go faster. I just wish there was more money involved, but there is room for advancemant."
good,A constant pursuit of excellence for patient care. Always striving to have the highest educated and cross trained employees. Management always willing to help whenever possible.
good,"Loved working for Quest....great benefits!!  Uniforms provided, compensated for gas mileage. So many things offered and given to employees that are not offered with. Ost. Illion dollar corporations!!"
good,"I give this company a 4 star. Every single day is different, you don't know what issues you will encounter. It is Fun to work with the  people here because they treat each other as a family especially in my department. Of course there are some outlier people, you don't want to deal with. But all in all it's one of the best companies."
good,I loved working for quest. was upset when I got laid off due to loosing a insurance company. very fast place great place to work would love to work there again
good,"Good place to work, highly recommend to anyone who wants a good job with plenty of promotion opportunities. "
good,No negative feedback. The experience was rewarding. I would recommend this position to a friend of mine. I enjoyed working with my supervisor. The hardest part was getting us to the hours!!!
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a fantastic company to be employed with, however working as a phlebotomist with a varying skill set, did not provide the opportunities for advancement."
good,"Very Busy."
good,The job is very fast paced and at the same time very detail oriented. Must be able to handle both at an excellent standard. The job is very rewarding as well.
good,"I believe this is a great place to work. Pretty laid-back but busy place, you're not being micromanage. But with the Austin economy rising the salary demands are not competitive."
good,"I would have liked to work here longer, but not long enough to give a substantial review. It was a fine place to work while I was here, that is all I can say."
good,"Quest diagnostics provides a great place to learn and grow and the medical career. There is plenty of culture, and  Job security . It's also a great place to develop relationships with staff as well as patients ."
good,I've been an employee of Quest Diagnostics for 10+ years and they truly were great years.  I was blessed with excellent benefits although the pay could have been better.  The people I worked with were great as well as management.  The only problem was they changed management numerous times.
good,Flexible work life balance. Great pay and room to continue education and can work almost anywhere Quest is located. No health benefits because I was a Per-diem employee.
good,Work days varied due to patient volume and needs of each patient. I worked independently so staying busy and controlling my environment was key to working efficiently. This was a great place to work for and it allowed me to gain experience and learning the importance of putting each patient's needs first at all times while keeping up with the standards expected by each employee who worked for them. I would recommend them to anyone there was just not too much room to advance.
good,Excellent place to work ! Employees were nice and helpful. Work was face-paced but fun. Breaks were more than enough. Even got off early on Fridays due to slow work which was a plus.
good,I did not like night shift but the people were great and even though we were busy we were not micro-managed.I would go back if I could get a day shift
good,"I enjoy working for Quest Diagnostics. The pay is decent compared to other labs in the area, the benefits are only mediocre at best. Health insurance is over priced, paid time off is decent."
good,"Empresa con altos estándares de calidad, amplia capacitación y reconocimiento."
good,"Quest can be a great company if you do your job well and work with your team.  Find someone who can mentor you and expose you to different departments. "
good,"very fast paced. routine work had to work as a team, which some did not do. learn how to work as a team on my shift. the hardest part is when instruments break down and you had to troubleshoot and still try to make the deadline."
good,"Great place to work , I loved the medical field "
good,Not bad company however they have had recent issues with CEO and room for growth hard to navigate due to favoritism and salary increments are very low and took several years to make up difference.
good,"I've been working for a great manager, but there are some parts of the organization with people in leadership roles who seem to have problems actually leading."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced, serving patients of all ages."
good,"I really enjoyed what I did at quest, and they really catered to their employees! We were able to help patients in the community by getting results to their doctor as soon as we could."
good,"A typical day at work would be fun, very energetic, relaxed and normal , the management was very understanding and they were very professional and also they sometimes were unorganized"
good,"I learn about teamwork. working with deferent group of people. "
good,It is a fast paced job with high volume.They can try to care for there employee some more and not try to find the bad in everyone.The supervisor can also make themselves more available to the employee as well.
good,Handle multiple large projects handling client accounts. Organize the urgency of each request to make sure we better serve our clients needs. Job is quite detail oriented.
good,"great company to work for."
good,"in my position at Quest i was given multiple projects on a daily basis and was expected to finish that as well as production, they liked to hound you and breath down your back to get everything done. the job itself i found very rewarding and i loved what i did. Management on the other hand needs to take a step back and look at what is going wrong as opposed to complaining to employees that things are not getting done properly. majority of my coworkers were extremely nice, all employees i worked with and trained we got along very well. my only complaint would be the micro managing other than that it was a great company to work for."
good,Quest Diagnostics has been a company such as Lab Corp that is constantly growing and constantly inventing new ways of promoting health care services. Quest withstands the test of time.
good,I learned so much from Quest and still am learning from them. They have great pay and benefits and definitely room for growth. I will say that the only reason I am looking else ware for work is due to new management. I love Quest as a company but I can't handle the politics and favoritism.
good,"i worked in microbiology and become very good friends with my co-workers and my boss was like a dad to all of us. but when i worked there we got bought out by another company. my assistant supervisor was awesome as a teacher and as a friend,we still keep in touch with each other."
good,Currently a supervisor with Quest Diagnostics. Excellent phlebotomy skills with 30 plus years including geriatric and pediatric specialty in venipunture.
good,"Good place to work...Great company,,good benefit ...Good booss , hardest part of the job is diving for a hour to get to my job ,."

good,"Fast paced environment, steady flow of patients, good for working with a diverse selection of people. If you want your day to go fast this is definitely the place to be!"
good,A typical day at work involves performing maintenance and QC on instruments and testing patient samples.  It is important to be able to multi-task to give accurate results with least amount of turn around time as possible.  Employees must also be able to communicate efficiently with other healthcare personnel in a professional manner.
good,Large company with a serious culture as your a re dealing with patients personal Health Information. Policies change all the time and sometimes without the changes being passed along in a timely manner. ie...sites closed for the holidays at the last minute.
good,Transporting blood work from doc's offices to our lab offices.  Meeting different people and doctors was always a joy.  That was the most fun. The worst part of the job was favortism at the job.
good,"A great company.  Good Co-workers, Great Benefits, relatively easy job.  Hardest part of job is; it shouldn't be hard. Other than that a great company!"
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, Most of the other coworkers I dealt with were friendly and outgoing. Each office has its own vibe that works well with the employees."
good,"good place to work as long as your doing what you suppose to, nobody bothers you. its a friendly enviroment all over the company.the hardest part of the job is when everthing comes in the same day at the same time. And some one is out on that day.the most enjoyable part will be when we get it all done."
good,"The place is a good job to work for. A typical day is a total of 20 employers working on a assembly line, order picking and closing boxes. I learned how  to work with all different personality.Management  was always good,co-workers were the best. The job didn't pay to much. The best part of the job, was actually performing at a high level."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company for the simple fact that I was able to make a change in many different peoples lives on a daily basis. My management team was exceptional and I would love to have the opportunity to work with another set of people similar to them. the employees of this company goes above and beyond on assuring their patient's satisfaction. One of the hardest part of my job was having to review  patient's results that were positive for Cancer or HIV. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my career with this company."
good,I was able to apply consistent effort to meet demanding quotas and increased work load over a period of time. I was able to adapt to the business merger from Lab One to Quest Diagnostics and the changing technology and computer based programs that this brought.
good,"Enjoyable and Productive"
good,"Quest is a great place to work ..it has a great way that you can buy stock and be a part of the numbers and the up and coming changes, "
good,A typical day was often long hours and a repetitive job but it was not very hard or stressful. They sometimes worked you hard but they always took care of you with lunch and other things to show that they cared.
good,Overall the company is great!  The benefits were good.  The training was lacking.  I wanted to excel but the opportunity was not there.
good,"A typical night would entail getting to work early enough to set up and start on time. Print important documents before the start of production. Sort out specimens for distribution to be processed by coworkers. Processing for the remainder of work shift with an hour break and you are done. Hardest part of the job is working at night, best part of the job is you don't have to be stuck in traffic because you are going the opposite way to go home."
good,I had learned a lot at Quest while just starting off into doing phlebotomy. Its was a great place with great people to get experience also. I worked with al types of patients from young to old and got to really learn all types of ways of drawing. I really found my passion for drawing from the well knowledgeable and experienced coworkers who helped me along the way.
good,The manager keep you inform with the lates information about new labs. They value your opions on improvement or concerns. Co-worker is always ready to help. We work as a team.
good,"Utility knows all routes in case route couriers need time off. Could be covering a route, could be running STAT runs, could be moving equipment, could be delivering supplies. Good coworkers."
good,"I loved getting out on the road for Quest-Diagnostics as a part-time driver with a rural route here in the Tallahassee area. I felt the job was important and took great pride in meeting the demands of my employer and our clients. My supervisor, Joe Collins, is a great human being and won my respect and trust. I hated to leave the job, but the sudden responsibility for raising a ten-year-old grandchild, required me to obtain a full-time job. I especially enjoyed meeting the various doctors, nurses and medical techs in the various small towns where I stopped to deliver medical items and picked-up specimens for analysis. I looked forward each day to meeting my new friends at those clinics, doctor offices and hospitals."
good,"We all did have fun, but there are times to have fun and times to get back to work. We were serious about our work, during work hours, our patients on the only thing on all of our mines, no one ever had a cell phone out, everyone was doing exactly what they needed to do. it was a wonderful workplace, not to serious, but not to much craziness."
good,Quest Diagnostics has a great team atmosphere that enables you to be successful at whatever you do.
good,Good place to work. People were  very nice and all ways there to help you if you needed.
good,"Troubleshoot/installed/configured network printers for Quest Diagnostics via phone and scheduled follow-ups. Communicated and bridged productive relationships with doctors, managers, and associates related to Quest products. Escalated unresolved technical equipment issue to Tier 2 and 3 while consulting staff members for possible solutions."
good,I enjoyed working for this company because my employer allowed me to be independent and accountable but made sure that I don't loose sight of my responsibilities to the patient.
good,"usually was slow . but gained good work experience, good co-workers ,enjoyed work hours."
good,I love this company I have been with them almost 12 years! Everyone is like family
good,I have been here for over 5 years and I love it. I enjoy working with my coworkers and management is great!
good,"I have my job down to a science so my day is pretty much routine. Every so often I may encounter a situation that may require some critical thinking. I believe that the most important lesson  I've learned is how to be independent, in problem solving. My supervisor does not work on site so I am pretty much on my own. The hardest part of my job is remembering that I am not employed within the organization, in which I work. I am only allowed to perform the duties directly related to my job, so it is really hard for me because I am a team player. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I am a part of caring for and possibly keeping someone alive."
good,Adjustable Work Load....Manageable Deadlines  made working at Quest a joy.... but new 2013 management direction feels like they're gutting the company for the sake of the bottom line/stock holders
good,"A typical day at work was sorting  test results for different clients,checking route car for any unseen problems,load supplies for clients as needed,and get containers properly set for transport of specimens.Get route for the day.Go meet clients,deliver results,supplies,and pick-up any specimems for transport.Handle any problems they may have or direct them to someone who will. After all of my clients have been serviced,transport all speciems back to office get them ready for the shuttle to transport them to the main lab.Then go document the number of stops made,specimens picked-up,mileage used,and any problems with the car if any."
good,Management worked very well with employees.  Co-workers worked very well together. Day flew by very quickly...
good,I come into work ahead of time to start the day making sure my area is clean and get ready to take care of my patient's along with helping my co-workers.  The toughest job of phlebotomy are some the patient's that are dehydrated we as phlebotomist/medical staff try to encourage the patient to drink water so that we can preform drawing their bloods. The enjoyable part of the day is that you as a Phlebotomist you handle the task and make the patient feels comfortable leaving the clinic at ease.
good,"Worked all nights , that's when most of the work came into this reference lab. we worked hard and fast to keep up with the volume of samples each night. The immediate crew in this department was good , I still have strong friendship ties with most of them. Management was for the quantity instead of quality."
good,"Quest is a good place to work with decent benefits. I work on a college campus in the Wellness Center, as well as perform STAT testing for outside Quest clients."
good,there is a friendly and professional atmosphere with your peers
good,"Good company to work for, typical day sort my specimens and see what are the problems that either were omitted or names and demographics corrections, once this was done I will call the different "
good,A typical day at work is very busy. It can be stressful unhappy clients difficult traffic conditions. Very strict time time tables. I learn something everyday. The most important thing I have learned is how to read people. I work with very little supervision. The hardest part of my job is the constant hour changes. I am required to cover all hours. My coworkers are great we all work together and play as one team. As a trainer I have built many friendships and trust. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet all the different people I encounter in one day. I also enjoy the fact that every specimen I pick up is a human life and I am responsible for it.
good,Quest was a great place to work and offered great benefits and free lunches during holidays.
good,A typical day at work for me is busy depending what I am scheduled to do that day. I enjoy working with my co-workers which now have become friends. The hardest part of my job is making sure that we meet deadline when we are short staffed.
good,It was good working at quest but i could not cope up with the sleep as it was the night job.
good,"Performed daily work requirement involving routine screening of the specimen, as well as some quality control work. Occasionally was involved in the preperatory lab as the work volume and staff schedule demanded. The management was proclaiming open door policies, but later there were always repercussions."
good,"A cooperative work enviroment. Patient orientated. Customer service a priority. Phlebotomy collection and processing. Drug screen collections. Cross department duties. Logistics, dispatch client pickup calls. Update route information. Suppy department, ordering of client supplies for delivery. Secretary and receptionist duties. Assigned special projects. Great team of co-workers to work with. Planning of charity events. Multi tasking was apart of daily work."
good,It was a great opportunity and experience working for Quest Diagnostics.
good,Same any other

good,"My previous manager always was available to assist and guide me in my new lead position. She was a wonderful person to work under, I learned so much from her during my time at Quest."
good,It is okay company. The salary rate depend on what license or certification you have. There is no increase in salary rate so far for me. I have been workingvhere for over a year.
good,Large company with many job opportunities for someone to explore many different types of career options.  Company has very competitive salary and benefits.
good,"I enjoy working at Quest, it is a large company with lots of opportunities and locations. A lot of potential for job growth. Many good benefits and possibilities to further your career and education."
good,"I took a risk moving to a startup business that didn't pan out.  I was with them for 20 years and had excellent benefits.  Startup businesses are hard, but I learned a lot of new skills and met wonderful people."
good,"I love working at Quest, its the best place I have worked so far. my supervisor is the best and she really listen and try hard to help out if needed with anything. Ive been here for 2yrs and I plan on staying with the company for a while. I like that I can transfer my job because im looking to move and want to stay with quest so that's a plus"
good,"•	Performed medical examinations for life insurance applicants"
good,This is a good company to work for. The company has a large number of departments and it provides the ability learn. You do have to be organized and keep clear records.
good,"My review caption is : 12 years ago"
good,I liked working with quest except for my supervisor she would always try and guilt me for calling out which I didn't do much I was a dependable employee worked well with others.liked my schedule .would like to come back if a position came available
good,Patient volume was high at the time because Quest had most of the top insurance companies. Enjoyed meeting many different people during the course of the day.
good,Quest clinical laboratory offers a doorway into healthcare for people with no prior experience. Great place to work if you like working graveyard shift. Management really tries to listen and helps when needed and shows appreciation for hard work with regularity.
good,"as an intern at quest diagnostics,i would say that had learned and mastered my skills perfectly. my supervisor was really nice and helpful.the workplace environment was pretty busy which was excellent for me to practice ."

good,It was a good and excellent opportunity to at Quest.Enjoyed the work environment and loved my co-workers.An ideal place to work and show your talent.Would recommend the lab to any person.And also excellent benefits.
good,"From the start the pace is fast, however it is manageable. You're able to listen your music as you work. Most of the time you're on your own but to some people this is exactly what they want, without anyone looking over their shoulder all the time."
good,I wish I could get more hours closer to home but that will come in due time I guess. I have really enjoyed the clinics that I have been accepted to work at. Mostly nice people on my team.
good,"Quest Diagnostics is a great job. It gives you the opportunity to grow with the company, offers good benefits and discounts. Also allows you to go back to school and Quest pays for it!!"
good,Open door policy. Dealing with potential traffic backups can prove frustrating. Seeing smiles on your customer faces when you interact with them. Learning more about the behind the scenes of a doctor's visit.
good,If  you like driving and picking up specimens and delivering them to laboratories this job has great rewards and benefits.  Most weekends off and sometimes overtime
good,It was a great place to work. Management was professional and explained the job duties efficiently. Coworkers were very professional and helped me when I had questions.
good,I worked in the hospital first it was a lot of work and a lot of walking. In the outpatient setting people work together do their work and have good days.
good,good job. I always liked to work with Quest. I worked for long time and never complained. I always helped my coworkers in case they didn't know what to do in the field.
good,"I've been at Quest for 11 years now and like any job it has it's ups and downs, but it's a huge company with great benefits and as long as you do what is asked of you you will never have to worry about losing your job or having your hours cut back. And I would have to say that most of my coworkers are good people that I am very comfortable working with, and those who are really negative or disgruntled usually don't stick around very long."
good,"Nice laid back atmosphere in the logistics area. Can't comment on other departments. Management was good."
good,"Cared about employees, especially by management. Benefits were great and pay was okay. The lunch breaks were decent and there was room for advancement."

good,"typical day was very busy, needed to be attentive to the kind of call and ber very flexible due to the nature of the questions you are asking customers. very quiet and with environment to focus. Hardest part was not being able to get a supervisor/lead person in the event of an customer or technical issue."
good,"Overall I enjoy my job as an RSR (courier). It's busy but it's also a great way to get some fast paced walking while tracking how many steps a day. I enjoy interacting with my clients, even though some of them need constant reminders on ensuring the specimens are appropriately prepared for pickup. The schedule is great and the management is very accommodating."
good,Good company to work for just very high stress job.Company starting not caring as much about patients and employees and just about money.They started cutting benefits.Wanted 10 hour of work done in 8 hours.
good,"Fair management and co workers were great and willing to support each other.  Work load is heavy, but working hours are flexible.  Open chances for learning code of Irish gyn screening."
good,Quest diagnostics is one of the best companies I work for.  There are so many great opportunities for you to climb up in your career. Quest Diagnostics
good,"I have no complaints about working at Quest Diagnostics.  I am currently working part time."
good,"This is one of the better call center jobs I have worked. The pay is decent. You get healthcare. They pay a portion and you pay the rest. Paid days off. Most of the people that work here are good people, mature. Not petty like a lot of call centers. There are some ghetto acting people, but Quest doesn’t play. They will walk you out. The worst part of the whole thing is they measure every move you make. From how long you are on your calls to how many transfers you make, to how long you put the client on hold. So much so, we are told if we have to put them on hold. Just mute them instead. Then it’s not counted as a hold. Or if you have to transfer, do a conference call instead, then complete. It’s ridiculous. So it’s basically call quantity over quality. The job itself is not bad. Not too many angry clients on a daily basis, sometimes none."
good,Had a great work day because of the co works.  We worked great together and shared all the tasks needed to have a smooth day.  There was never an issue of jealousy.
good,Nicest boss I've ever had. It's a pretty relaxed environment yet you still need to abide by the rules to make everything run smoothly. The right amount of training yet not overwhelming.
good,This position gave me an opportunity to discover that I enjoy finding trends and identify possible solutions.  I learned how to use SQL and different databases to pull all my data together.
good,"I was only there for a couple of weeks for an unpaid internship. From the time I was there, it is a good job to have. Everyone was friendly. The only thing you have to be very patient with the clients."
good,"Management at Quest was not very professional. There was a lot of favoritism though out the company. I felt I was held back from learning, due to the favoritism."
good,"Worked for Quest many years. The culture of the company changed as the country's approach to health care changed. Initially, although it was a very large company the atmosphere was very personal...this became less so over the years. However, it was still a very good place to work."
good,When I arrive at work I make sure everything is good to go and then I like to get my day started by having a wonderful time and day with my patients and co workers.  I make sure all TNPs are getting done for the day and make sure everyone has what they need for the day.  I begin checking my emails and start my day with greeting my pts.  I love working with pts and co workers.  The word TEAM is a huge work in my vocabulary!
good,"During my 12 years with the company, I had the chance to expand my knowledge in the billing world and to grow personally as well. The company is always changing. I made many friends within the company and the clients that I handled. They offer great benefits on top of a fair salary. In hindsight, I would’ve taken advantage of the tution reimbursement program that they offered as a benefit. I am very glad that I had the chance to work there. I would definitely recommend this company as a good place to work."

good,"Working with Quest as a Health and Wellness screener is an easy job."
good,has its ups and downs but what job doesnt have those? it didnt take me long to catch on because I am a fast learner and it wasnt as complicated as they make it seem. Its been one of the best jobs ive had so far
good,Great place to work. Co workers were amazing  Had flex hours which made life a lot easier. Working in South West Florida was also a plus. great weather and great people
good,Quest Diagnostics staff are friendly and welcoming. They assist those who are fearful of needles and make the experience and painless as possible. Quest Diagnostics accepts internship students and inspire them to become a great phlebotomist.
good,Typical day flew by. Pretty much easy going. The work place environment was great. Really was no hard part about the job. Paid holidays off were great.
good,I love working at Quest Diagnostics processing specimen samples for testing.  The work environment was family oriented.  This work is very much a production based work environment. Attention to detail is a must.
good,Good company. Collaborative efforts among teammates and departments. Goalsharing/profit sharing. Employee appreciation shown for years of service. Annual company picnic.
good,"Working in the billing department was about what you'd expect. It was a standard office job with pretty good benefits. There was lots of work so it was always busy, but not overwhelming and the management didn't interfere too much."
good,I enjoyed the time at spent at this company while completing my clinical training.  The staff were very helpful and encouraging to me.  They offered great advice and taught my new skills on how to obtain the blood from the patient.
good,"I worked here for just under a year. I only left because the 3rd shift scheduled wasn't compatible with me anymore. At this job you're working by yourself. There is the option to listen to music, podcast, audiobooks, etc. They do promote from within the company and it's pretty easy to move up. I was working there during the transition from Solstas to Quest Diagnostics. I would go back if there was an option to work 1st or 2nd shift."
good,nice people to work with. Its easier for people who is starting up their career. nice people who helps new employees to settle down. gives confidence.

good,A qualifying agency that selects excellent employees. The hardest part of job was position advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job were the employes
good,It's not fair to rate them from my perspective since it has been 10 years since I've worked there and they have a whole new leadership team from the top down.  I did enjoy my 29 years with this organization.
good,"Overall good work day, job is stressful, management can be demanding, little room for flexibility, overall Okay,  Working for company can be demanding with the number of insurances procedures and policies that is required to learn and be up on at all times. Not very much lead way given to error, must be almost completely error fee."
good,Always open doors at Quest from the janitorial staff to the President of the company. they are very community involved and do a lot of fundraising work in the community.
good,I really enjoyed and appreciated the fact that I had the option to work from home. It allowed me time with my children. It helped me save on gas and wear and tear on my car.
good,I worked for Quest Diagnostics for 11 years. I was a Mobile Phlebotomist driving to houses and some Nursing Homes drawing blood from the elderly. Working for Quest I rarely had interaction with any of my co-workers because we was on the road all day only at meetings and we had them every three months or so. When your doing house calls you really need to know what your doing because sometimes you are the only phlebotomist in the area so if you unable to obtain the patients blood it's a inconvenience for the patients because some of them have no way of getting to the doctors office themselves and sometimes patients have to wait a couple of days for someone to come back to the house. The  most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I'm provided a service for those how don't really have no means of transportation.
good,"I liked it here. I worked night shifts and I still get paid good.  I receive and process specimen, prepare them, encode the tests needed to be done with the specimen. Double and triple check the patient's name on the computer and the name on the specimen if it matches. Making sure handling the specimen carefully and in a timely matter. Making sure that they get to the testing area fast and uncontaminated."
good,They would have been better to work for if they did not outsource the helpdesk to India. The health benefits they had were great.  Free blood screenings.
good,"Quest is an amazing company to work for. With the family-like atmosphere, entry level positions and flexible hours, what more could you ask for? At the time, I was a part of the Brazil project. A typical day consisted of coming in, clocking in on the temp time clock, greeting the team, setting up at my desk, having a quick meeting with the supervisor and team members and starting the day. Before the Brazil project ended this summer, I was transferred out to another department at lesser pay which was the sole reason for my departure from Quest. Overall, I’ve enjoyed my experience and the many different things I’ve learned over the past year. I’ve experienced a tremendous amount of growth and I couldn’t thank them more. However, they tend to let a lot of temps go to cut back on costs, especially most recently. I’ve seen a lot of new faces disappear only after 2-3 months of being there. Also the overtime fluctuates; one month you might be able to get as much overtime as you want and the next month they’re telling you to come in on time and leave on time. Other times the overtime is mandatory which could be up to 2-3 hours."
good,"very exciting and past paced workplace, with advancement opportunities; hardest part of the job is working overtime unexpectedly; most enjoyable is working with patients and doctors."
good,"The past 6 years working with Quest Diagnostics have been both challenging and rewarding. A typical day at work begins with prompt arrival at the site, introducing myself and my team to the event coordinator and setting up our stations.  Once the set up is complete, we begin the health screenings with intent to be both effective and efficient.  Upon completion of the event, I double check all applicant information, clean up our work space and submit all the paperwork.  I have learned quite a bit about the industry and have grown in my personal career goals.  Because of both my time as an examiner and health fair event lead, I have developed my skills in phlebotomy,  time management, phone professionalism, leadership, and management responsibility.  Through the encouragement of a few event specialists who watched me work, I have realized how many more personal opportunities could be reached. "
good,"Quest is great place to work, it promotes collaboration and ongoing career improvement. Management team is supportive and always provides help as needed. Company is leader in health care industry, so culture and people are one of best i have ever worked with."
good,"Most patient service centers are run and operated by a single phlebotomist.  You are solely responsible for opening and closing the site, greeting patients, registering patients, and verifying and ordering tests.  You are also responsible for ordering and unpacking and organizing equipment and supplies.  The work flow is fast and sometimes stressful, but the patients are amazing."

What I enjoyed about the job was getting along with just about everyone and learning how to handle different specimens and what tests were ordered.

With this job you have to have the compassion for people."

Also, on top of drawing patients you also have to take stool, urine samples and you will also have to do drug screenings. Most of the staff is nice depending on your supervisor. Quest is really a good company to work for the biggest dilemma is always the patients because you deal with so many different walks of life and you still have to be compassionate and professional, which is not always easy if you don't have the heart for the medical field."

good,"Great employee benefits "
good,Loved it there was a great place to work only left because of reduction in force... Took time off got my severance and did alot of things I couldnt do when committed to a full time job

To share a little wisdom with potential future employees, do not take patients attitudes personal because you do not know what is going on in their lives. Provide the best customer service regardless to those you will serve on a daily basis. Good luck!"
good,This is a fast paced job. I learned the process of how specimens are collected and processed in the lab. The most enjoyable part of the job was collecting the specimen from the route drivers and separating it for the individual lab departments.
good,"The largest advantage at working for Quest is their fantastic amount of time they give employees off. Most jobs are very interesting and stimulating. Management was very good for the most part and I had zero problems with any managers."

good,"I would enter a patient medical requisition into the system under whichever insurance they had and enter patient information as well as ICD10 codes.  If there was a written diagnosis, I would look for the proper ICD10 code.  I have learned so much about medical coding and would like to continue in this line of work.  I got along with my supervisors and co-workers.  It was always so busy that the day would go by fast.  Too fast sometimes.  I also did quality control checking for errors for about a year."

I've learned ICD-9 coding, medical billing from different aspects, and patient/client customer service. Co-workers come from all walks of life. Hardest/frustrating part of a job is when you don't receive the proper training or updates needed to complete the task at hand. Also, some employees don't want to share updated information to make your job easier. Health care benefits -more out of pocket expenses placed on the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits, paid time off, flex hours, and casual dress code."

Typically I start my day at between 6pm and 7pm depending on the evenings run and weather, and finish between 1:30am and 6am depending on the same afformentioned conditions.  I've learned a great deal of self confidence in that we only fly single pilot, and the discipline that goes with that.  This includes, but surely not limited to, maintaining the highest standards of safe and efficient operating procedures.  It's easy to cheat when no one is looking, however, that's what gets people into trouble.  With or without a CVR on board, there's no room for distractions or lax behavior.  The hardest part of the job would be the schedule, not hard on myself, but hard on my family / children.  The most enjoyable part of my job would be the fact that I get to, as opposed to have to, go to work every day and fly around nice equipment and work with some real professionals."

I also had the opportunity to work with an excellent team of sales reps and managers that support our efforts in the field. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing our development team with feedback and then later seeing the enhancements incorporated into our product.
good,A typical begins in employee solutions department(toxicology). We recieve loads from clients and the loads are process for interpation.
good,Good place to work and the co-workers were easy to like and get along with. My day would consist of keeping patient and client billling information current and accurate. I would make phone calls and answer phone calls regarding a multitude of billing concearns. If I needed assistance my co-workers were very quick to help me. I guess the hardest part of the job was dealing with an angry phone call. I took pride in correcting billing information and making the customer feel better but occassionally there is someone you are unable to make completely happy. Even if they were not as happy as they could be I at least made them feel better. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing a task well and feeling that sense of accomplishment.
good,"I was very young when I started this job. While it included some phlebotomy, I had been promoted to Asst Mananger, which included sales. I do not care for sales."
good,I am currently employed with Quest Diagnostic. I am very pleased with the company but I relocated and am having trouble transfering with them.

good,Very flexible to work with the Company. They are very highly focused on safety when working on the job which it was very important. The hardest part of the job was when I was working alone doing multitasking jobs while the co-workers called in sick or other reasons.
good,Good Co. Better than it's biggest competitor. Lately there focus is in cost cutting and not retention.
good,Its is a good company to work to. Even though my job is kinda stressful it can also be rewarding. Rewarding in way that it enhances each one's knowledge about certain test without having a medical background
good,Very enjoyable. Always something new to work on and to learn
good,"Clock in, prepare vehicle for route, collect supplies to deliver, look over scheduled stops and leave for route. Pick up specimens, drop off supplies, go to call-in stops, communicate client concerns with sales and management, then bring back specimens for testing to be done by lab techs."
good,I can honestly say that the team I work for is great. We work together really well and we are always there to back each other up when needed. Our manager has always got our backs because she knows what an outstanding team she has
good,"As soon as I enter work, I find out if there were a lot of specimens for prescription drug management. I usually help pipette and build loads for different drugs ie ecstasy, marijuana, methadone.

I learned a lot of things in the department. We do have our continuing education presentation per month, which is informative and useful."
good,"I loved working at Quest Diagnostics as a Medical Technologist. I worked third shift in the Special Chemistry department. We had a really good team at the time of employment, we worked together, diverse bunch. We rotated weekly, so it was never boring."
good,"Great benefits. "
good,"-international opportunities"
good,Loved my job as a Route Service representative. The only downfall was when there was extreme weather conditions and often treacherous roads. The other year when everything was shut down for awful weather we were still forced to go out and brave -30 weather.
good,Not enough motivation and support for night shift. Hours are decent . Night shift in LTS needs more help and motivation to ease on your feet and back .
good,Everyday its the same thing so you know what you're walking into beforehand which is a positive. I like that I can either work in a team or separately depending on what I prefer.
good,"I learned a lot during training my time there. I enjoyed the staff and generally enjoyed my job. The customers were never a bother even when they get frustrated with the questioning, I know and understand it's not personal and was always able to get through the interview without issue."

good,"You show up on time, do your route, and go home."
good,"When I worked there, it was stressful bc the lab manager allows her friends/subordinates to bully people. They'll criticize almost everything you do but won't hold themselves to the same standards. It is hard to get vacation time. Most requests will be denied especially if one of her friends wants the same dates as you. The job isn't hard but the people working there will make you miserable."
good,This was a really great job to work for in the beginning. The culture  was very family oriented  and had incentives. You also received a yearly raise and goal sharing checks. This company is no longer family oriented  and over works employees right before the lay offs for the billing departments company wide
good,"I had a great instructor, good training, and was semi independent. "
good,"Management listens to its employees and suggestions are taken seriously. Provides training and advancement opportunity."
good,"Working there is good, the only thing is that they have very little overtime. Bit overall its a good place to work with paid time off ,employee benefits."
good,Gives the employee an opportunity to grow and support to be a successful individual in pursuing higher education within the company's approved programs.
good,Worked in the accounting department with accounts payable.  Provided payment to vendors who provided supplies to help healing ill children.  Had good rapport with co workers.
good,"Best job I’ve ever had except for the hourly rate of pay."
good,I am able to work with others and  by myself on a nightly basis. My manager and supervisor allow me to function with minimal supervision and that makes my nights lovely.
good,Quest Diagnostics has great benefits and stock options. People that work for Quest usually stay with the company for many years to come. You definitely get job security working here.
good,"Too many good to mention. If you are an ex qdx employee for atleast 5 years, i guaranteed that your next employer got a really competitive , labor tested and trained new employee."

good,"It is a fast paced work place and co-workers are understanding and helpful, from my experience as a night (11:00pm-7:30am) employee. The manager, of which I was under with, is very understanding and helpful, balancing both company and employee interests."
good,I love the people and benefits. i would recommend for employment.  Compensation/Benefits Great.  Management- Great. Culture-Great.  Job Work/Life Balance-Great. Clients-Great.
good,"A typical day consists of signing in, seeing how much work is available and figuring out where to being working. There are multiple different areas we work in and we are usually assigned somewhere for a 2 hour span and then we go somewhere else. We can go cross train in the different areas of the lab if it is available."
good,Quest is a wonderful place to work the hours are a challenge but I have always adjusted. Call center culture is also a challenge to get the employees to come to work everyday
good,great company with awesome benefits. I like working for Quest. Working at Quest is not a hard job even though it can get very busy at times. Management should be put through more criteria because some of the managers are not great managers but other than that I like working for the company.
good,I am a floater with Quest and I learn a lot in the years working for them. I have learned to manage a team and also how to show compassion for others.
good,The work here was good. The pay was nice and the benefits were good. There was a lot of internal movement and advancement that could be done but the lack of references is not good.
good,I loved my job other than the pay. They promised more due to my experience. But never gave the raise I deserved. I didn't resent them for it. The company went thru hard times. So I understood it and continues to love my job. I still miss the people. And they miss me. Occasionally one will call and want to go to lunch. And they always say how everyone misses me.
good,"I feel like there are times we are over worked for what we have to deal with on a daily basis, especially with all the extra work they have us doing now...we don't get paid to be a medical biller."
good,I worked here 11 years and must say it was a pleasure working for Quest Diagnostics. There's so much you can learn. Many opportunities for growth here.
good,"Things began to change drastically after my first year of employment and more positions began requiring a degree. The amount they start you off with (while requiring a degree) is pretty pathetic. Otherwise, it was a job that held me over during my ""gap years"" at school."
good,Enjoy working for Quest Diagnostic drawing blood is amazing. I enjoy team work also helping others. Sometimes we have patient that are hard sticks. Management is good.
good,"It's a good company that dealing people who cares and understands when things need to process for better.The management to improve things conceited and orderly as much as possible.The workers make people to feel they are welcome, like families.We work as team and any issues that we will find solution to the co-workers or let the leaders know, as well as the supervisor.This company is growing and full befits always helps.I gladly to be in a company where they see there be more furture and new processing in new equipments for our employees."
good,I have learned a lot at Quest and was compensated well. There was never a moment where I was in short demand of tools or equipments that I needed to complete my job. Quest is very supportive of helping employees meet the demands and goals of Quest's vision.
good,"Learned care360"
good,"I enjoy working with people as a team player and meeting new people as the mobile phlebotomist, i enjoy what i do i have been certified for over 10 years."
good,"I worked the graveyard shift at Quest Diagnostics, i would clock in at 10:00 pm, put on the appropriate safety gear, lab coats, face mask, and gloves. Prepare my lab station and collect my batch of specimens. I was part of Quest miscellaneous group taking care of all requisitions that needed to be entered manually. I learned time management, making sure i work in a fast and timely matter so that patients can receive their results as soon as possible. We were very much like a family, everyone respected one another and also helped one another during stressful times at work. The hardest part about the job had to be making sure everything gets processed in timely matter without making any mistakes with the patients test order. The part i enjoyed the most about the job is that were always busy, there were very few slow days. i love working in a fast past environment."
good,Great place to work. I really enjoyed the management staff and employees. Very fast paced place to work. Continuous improvement culture is always a plus. Company is very supportive of furthering career objectives through training and schooling.
good,"Working at QUEST Diagnostics was a great experience for me. Cooperation between departments was never an issue, projects were completed on time.  "
good,"Good opportunities to grow within the company. However, compensation is low. Employees could use more training. Good amount of overtime available. Consistent work."
good,working environment is nice and friendly. excellent benefits. easy to get permanent position if you work really hard for the company.
good,I would say a good company to work for other then management was a bit unorganized. I enjoyed staying busy but worked through contracts from my employer to different clinics around the city.  I enjoy a Hospital environment much better because you get to stay sharp on your phlebotomy skills and have variation instead of the same aged patient all of the time.
good,"This is a great job with excellent benefits. Although it requires a lot of physical work and driving even in extreme conditions, you are on your own for most of night and do not need to have the stress of an office."
good,"One of my worst days was when I received a call from a Courier"
good,"A pleasant environment, to work in, with very co operative managers. a pressure job but a helpful staff. a growing company. a very responsible job. Good work always appreciated"
good,Great environment where collaboration of team is encouraged.  Overall great team lots of experience and education.  Flexibility with work life balance a definite plus.
good,"HGA Quest is a wonderful place to work if you don't mind the traveling and putting the hours into the days. Many of the managers and project leaders are helpful and approachable when problems or questions arise. As long as projects are available, you can see a busy work month. But only when projects are available do you see any type of work. Sometimes the weather doesn't agree with your schedule, but if you can tough out the rain, snow, or heat, the days will fly by your third day on a project."
good,I enjoy going into clients home and allowing them to be comfortable in their own setting while i perform their physical. I learned that each client has their own way of expressing things and they are more comfortable sharing medical history when at home. The hardest part of my jon is the traveling but the most enjoyable part of my job is knowing i do my job to the best of my ability and treat my clients as i would like to be treated.
good,"I really had great opportunity working, and i learned many new thing which help to show my effort . mangment was not good,over all I enjoyed working, as its more team work."

good,i enjoyed working for Quest for almost five years. I did like my coworkers enviroment and the teamplayer.
good,"I enjoyed everyday at work.  It provided me with great learning potential.  I was able to grow from a lab assistant to a title of Medical Technologist.  I learned about the field of forensic toxicology and drug testing.  I proved myself by becoming part of a two person team who provided all the reagents, controls, & standards for all of  testing done in the lab; and monitored all the QA/QC paperwork.  Was able to learn new instruments and analyzers.  From a simple pippettor to a GCMS analyzer."
good,"I enjoyed opening and starting new accounts at Dr. offices and training the staff, then moving on to open another account."
good,My co-workers were warm and friendly. I had to work very fast while maintaining excellent accuracy.
good,"Good company with strong values. Good place to work."

It was a highly stressful and demanding job, but very rewarding at the same time to work for a company with such consistent results. My coworkers were some of the hardest working people ive come across, and had a passion for their jobs that helped me along the way."
good,"Management sleeping with lower staff, Unrealistic goals. I would take jobs out of what we called an ""Alert file"" and call the lab results to doctors offices, nursing homes, etc. I enjoyed talking to some of the customers. The hardest part was working in the same file with other people who did not work as effectively or did not follow proper protocol. I learned that I like to do things on my own and be responsible for only my work."
good,"Quest is a great company. It's a very stable company but the economy is getting tougher on everyone including Quest. Unfortunately, they are not able to recruit and keep the highest level staff."
good,Wonderful and friendly management staff. this was a very upbeat and fun place to work.
good,The patient must always be what everything
good,My internship as medical laboratory technician starts here. Everyone are helping me to learn how to use the system and I am very happy to learn new thing in healthcare environment. I am enjoy it as I know that my works are important to people and society. I love the job very much and I would like to continue doing it for a long long time.
good,"Physicians require their patient diagnostic results when they need them. Operational challenges such as time of day, type of diagnostics, lab staffing and location are inconsequential. This provided the opportunity develop effective problem solving skills based on collaborative relationships with colleagues."
good,I personally enjoyed working at Quest Diagnostics but the management was sorta kinda bad. They had one trainer when they could of had more. The benefits were good.
good,The job was good I only worked there for a short time but the training staff was helpful and everything!! I also made new friends there and learned new things!!!!!!!!!
good,"It's a good company to work for. Good benefits, nice perks along the way but it's hard to move up within the company. They do promote career advancement but I yet to have seen it in my experience and I worked for the company going on 8 years"
good,"A typical day at work, preparing patients for venipuncture and a short conversation of how patients day is going, Meeting new faces is awesome. Hardest part of my job is not being able to get blood."
good,Working at quest they encourage for employee to participate in continuous improvement. We get ideas from the front line employees because they are the ones who are actually doing the work and understands the nature of the work.
good,"I enjoy my job.................................... I couldnt ask for a better supervisor and manager.. They are both customer driven and family oriented "
good,"A typical work day is seeing around 50 patients, making sure I give them the best care possible The hardest part of my job is trying to go as fast as I can to not make the patients wait.  I have to bring the patient back go over all the paper work, make sure it's all correct. If not I then call the Doctor's office and get the information I am needing.  Draw the specimens, process the specimens and get ready to ship out for the day. "
good,"Working at Quest was fine.  They have great benefits.  My coworkers were great.  I left because the job function was always monotonous and I hadn't learned anything new in 10 years of working there and there was no room for vertical advancement.  I tried applying for a horizontal move once and the company hired someone from outside, when I knew I could have done the job."
good,"This is a excellent company to work for. This job requires a lot of patients an extreme attention to detail, do to the high volume of specimens being processed on the third shift. The third shift is generally the hardest shift to work. the working hours include but not limited to 11 pm - 7-8 am. This shift doesn't work in every ones work ideal schedule, but if your up to working at night, it's a nice individual work environment."
good,Ok place to work but the upper level managers didn't see value in our division so we were ignored and finally dismissed. Not much room to advance in most fields.
good,"My expertise was Data Entry at Quest Diagnostics were to process tissues and bodily fluids specimens as like urine, feces, blood to different pathology departments. Data Entry was my main expertise manually or electric processing in a high speed on urgent clients demands. The overnight shift overall was the most difficult part to adapt for myself."
good,but I was becoming nervous because I was getting next to no NON GYN experience and then I got the job at Temple It was a really nice place to work I never had any problems there.
good,"Quest diagnostics Is a great place to work. "
good,Typical day on job is when everything happen that day is the way the schedule was lay out for that day. This is fast moving company. Management is high level of  multi- tasking.  Work culture very diverse. Hardest part of the job is problems we face everyday in our life. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the company grow rapidly.
good,"Draw patients, patient identification, process specimen, management is amazing. everything about working at quest was great except for the iffy schedule."
good,"Great pay to start off and Great hours, but there is required overtime that is not talked about. This is regularly 10 hours a week that is required to work. But, benefits are good, and have an easy time requesting days off work. Vacation days also add up pretty quickly."
good,"I worked there several years Washington was fun .My favorite boss washer in Seattle and I began getting to know new one and she seemed nice, approachable as well.When the team. Is good the company is strong."
good,The place is a team environment and everyone works and help each other without any complains. everyone enjoys working and upper and lower levels works really well together.
good,"I wished I had never left Quest. It was very professionally run.  We were able to have a bit of fun after our work was finished.  Unlike the Lab I work at now. Go, go, go, from when you walk in the door until you leave. "
good,Quest Diagnostics is a great company and I have grown with the company professionally for the past 10 years.The employees at this company are great.
good,quest is a great place to work and I loved working for them.. If I didn't loose my car I would still be working for them. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
good,"Quest has been a very fulfilling experience for me. I was with the company for almost two years and was promoted 4 times. I enjoyed my time with the company and genuinely valued the experience. I was sad to have to leave, however, due to family issues the duty called."
good,"High volume of patients ( new born, children, youth, adults and aged)"
good,"Interacted with multiple clients on a daily basis, fast paced day that allows the RSR to move freely throughout the day with limited restrictions, great co-workers and best supervisor I ever had. My only complaints are second shift which meant late nights, repetitive nature of the route and not much chance for advancement. Most enjoyable parts are not having a supervisor (although, I do love the guy to death) looking over your shoulder all day and not being trapped in the office."
good,"I work in a doctor office in the lab area where I draw the patients blood, process specimens and data entry.  I work around the office staff members but not with my quest diagnostics employees.  Being by yourself you become a manager because if there is a problem I am the only one on site for my employment to solve the issues and always set the standards"
good,"Working for Quest was like working with a large extended family. A typical day at work started with warm greetings from all, then a dive into the work that came in overnight. Management was good,even though they were very busy with implementing changes in the company. Co-workers were easy to work with and all had a very professional attitude. The hardest part o the job was the volume, though this was to be expected in a reference lab. The most enjoyable part was the camaraderie with my fellow co-workers"
good,Working for Quest Diagnostics has provided me with a great work environment and is a great place to grow and learn. Management always has open doors and is very earger to hear any opinions or ideas.
good,Management and other staff make the work day pleasant and enjoyable
good,"I work in the Surgical Pathology department so i see things that people do not see everyday. It is a very fun and interesting job, i learn a lot of things in through out the whole laboratory. I'm very sociable and a team player if it means getting the job done. I see surgically removed parts of the human body like livers, kidneys, gallbladder and etc. I know how to process tissue by operating three different machines which are the VIP, Pathos and Sakura Tissue Tek for smaller biopsy's. I can type at least 60 WPM i use to work in Specimen Processing Department so i have knowledge about Doctors order forms and very well with data entry.  "
good,I go to work and challenge myself everyday to meet and exceed the production goals. I have learned a lot about the processing  aspect of the job. Management is understanding and try to make sure  that the employees are happy. I have some co-workers who work just as hard as I do and care about   their production. There are some who do not. 
good,Traveled a great deal.
good,"Working for Quest Diagnostics is a great experience for an entry-level employee who wants to enter the market of laboratory diagnostics and testing industry. "
good,"Everyday at Quest Diagnostics is a learning experience"
good,Been with Quest almost 20yrs. I have worked in many areas of this company. At times I have been very happy working for this company and other times found it disappointing because my expectations have been so high that in my eyes we missed the mark.
good,"The team I worked with was great.  My manager was great.  She understood the value of family. My co workers were reliable, trustworthy, and readily assessable when I needed help or had a question.  They all know their jobs."
good,"The hours were fantastic, management worked well with me so I could run the patient service center by myself, unsupervised.  The hardest part was being the only face for the company when someone came in with a test we did not perform as a whole.  The most enjoyable part was the patient interactions."
good,At this job I had a lot of opportunities to learn new working habits. I learned how to take blood pressure. I also learned how to take people's cholesterol.
good,Getting along with people will make a better place. I learned to always keep myself buzy will stay away from doing my job bad. Always looking for something to do will make the hours fastet
good,"Spec tech 1 third shift. Intake spec bins on a belt like line work every night. Swabs, blood, stool, urine, etc.. process to departments and verify information. "
good,"I have fun working in Quest. I love my job very much because it fits of what I'm good at - numbers. I get along with all my co-workers. If our billing department just not relocated to California, I'm sure I'm still working there."
good,"AT least for me, the place was great. My supervisor was one of the best managers that I have had. The coworkers were also great and there was a team spirit."
good,"Reference to working in the field of histology has provide different "
good,I was able to learn quite a bit and work in different departments during my time there.  They do seem to have a good balance of promoting from within and hiring outside when needed.
good,"This is a wonderful company to work for and the management is great, unfortunately they do not pay you what you are worth. You are not just a phlebotomist, you take payments and process your specimens and deal with a lot of paperwork. Employees on average should at least start at $16 but they start closer to $12."
good,"Very helpful, friendly etc. employees.  Very understanding people especially the Supervisor.  I have learned so much working here.  More knowledge on Medical Field like certain test for patients (man and woman)."
good,"Certain days of the week are busy comparing to others, and that depends on if you are working in outpatient or inpatient lab. Advancement with this company is easy to obtain."
good,The company is great im just not happy in my position And would like to find a diffrent job either as a phlebotomist or a medial secretary.
good,"It's an exceptional place to began a career in the medical industry."
good,"very busy, nice co-workers"
good,Wonderful environment and great culture. Unfortunate that it sold to Quest Diagnostics.  They focused on the employees and built a high quality leadership team.
good,High volume production lab with many employees retained for more than 20 years; these folks were inspiring and knowledgeable professionals dedicated to providing exceptional patient care.
good,"Quest Diagnostics is driven to discover and deliver diagnostic insights and innovations that help to improve human health. We offer a wide range of products and services that benefit patients, healthcare providers, and pharmaceutical medical device companies, life insurance companies and employers."
good,I loved working at Sedgwick cms. I had a great work place and great co workers.
good,A typical day of work includes greeting patients and drawing their blood for the doctors orders.  I have learned many computer and phlebotomy skills.  My co-workers are great. They are supportive and fun to work with.  The hardest part of the job is having to work alone especially in the afternoon when management does not provide the help to deal with the existing patients.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when someone pays you a compliment.
good,"Sometime it can be very crazy we can see over 200 people, but knowing that I am helping someone and I also enjoy what I do is great. I learned to show compassion, to take my time. I enjoy the people that I worked with it was fun and there are times when we had our disagreements but we always come together to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is when it gets really busy and people get very rude when you are trying to help. What I like most about working at Quest was we were like a family we all were very close even my manager."
good,"The job was a fast paced facility,you learned to be a good multi-tasker.I had the best supervisor in all my 16 yrs working for the company.She was fair and really cared about her employees."
good,Typical day started with processing samples by auto analyzers.
good,Responsible for splitting up the daily cash deposit amongst 12 teams to key. Also QA batches that were keyed to assess refunds and or adjustments. Worked the Blues and Medicare also created a Medicare Denial Book for quick reference when posting cash. One of the top 10 cash posters for the company.
good,"This job demanded attention to detail. Employees performed designated tasks with great enthusiasm. Practically all employees enjoyed their job. As team players, everyone cooperated to create innovative strategies; ultimately leading to a staggering increase in productivity. This success was relayed to employees through numeric proof as well as the appreciation of management. Everyone performed his or job within the safety guidelines of OSHA and recognized client privacy through HIPPA. Regular training was provided in these areas and proven highly effective. I learned a great deal about the medical field, as well as the importance of a great work environment."
good,When i first started working there great hours pays good and then no hours no pay
good,Duties:
good,"Good place to work. The team members are really helpful and friendly, the benefits are really good and I've heard it has a good reputation."
good,"Quest is a wonderful company to work for, this company is an industry leader and their rigorous and continous training help to instill this same quality and integrity in all their employees. They continously train their staff to produce Six Sigma quality work and they settle for nothing less. I love this company."
good,"Quest Diagnostics offered a work place with a future and room for advancement. Sick leave, vacation time and time off was great. Team work was relaxed with adequate coverage for breaks, lunches and time off."
good,Working in a call center is fast pace because you want to answer calls as quickly as possible. I learned how to bill medical claims to all insurances. Management attempted to work with employee's to resolve issues with patient's and billing. The hardest part of the job was trying to get an irate caller to understand what they were requesting couldn't be done. The best part of the job was satisfying a customer that had been dealing with the same problem for awhile.
good,", can work your own , schedule get to move around ., flexible pay and hours , really good staffing . Placed at various nursing homes . Great nursing homes"
good,"A great starter job for someone fresh out of school. People I worked with and for were great, supportive and encouraging for me, and all the disable workers there.  If I could go back, I would."
good,"My desk was right next to my supervisors, I was her right hand.  She was the supervisor of two departments so she trained me to run Logistics/Referral Testing department while she oversaw Processing.  I liked working with her we got along great. The hardest part was rewriting procedures."
good,I believe the hardest part of my job was not getting attached to my regular patients. Having to leave my job because of my medical condition.
good,"A typical day at work consists of coming in for overtime and working 13 hour shifts on a daily basis with only 2 breaks and then of course lunch. What i learned is that everyone is different but you have to treat everyone with respect, which of course i already  knew that. Management and the company all together, went all good. Overall the company sometimes did not take in consideration of our needs as well. For instance there was a death in the family and i was only able to take off 2 days as opposed too a week, is what i asked for. The hardest part of the job was learning the different criteria for all 40 insurance companies we interviewed with on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make more then minimum wage and saving your time for vacation. Also, getting to know each and everyone's cultures."
good,"Very professional environment as far as management and coworkers. I learned different assays and techniques, training and lectures were provided.  It was a great learning and working experience. Working in the lab was challenging and motivating."
good,"your constantly on the move setting up machines, meeting new donors watching for any signs of  negative reaction during donation process. data entry of every person. Expect to bbe at the blood drive at least 12 hours straight with at least a 15 minute break. and you are out of town every night of the week"
good,Good benefits.
good,"Very oriented company, advancement,"
good,I took care of my patients I made sure they were comfortable and I got the blood done in a timely matter and made sure the dr got those results right away.
good,Very nice company to start a career and advance Had been awarded for best team in Kansas. Very welcoming environment. Employee benefits very rewarding. Fun and warm managements. Never boring
good,I cross trained and am very knowledgeable with all aspects of medical billing and worked in a wide variety of roles. Assisted the manager in the daily workflow and all administrative duties.
good,"A typical day for me..I'm  at work from 8:30 to 5 p.m its very fast paste..I'm on my feet nonstop. I have learned a lot about the different specimens and how they get processed. I am at that account by myself and I process over 100 patients specimens a day. The hardest part of the job is standing on my feet all day but, now I'm use to it. I enjoy my job and to me processing patients specimens and making sure they go to the right destination for quality testing makes me feel like I have done a great job."
good,"I love to work at Quest but lately is note fun management at logistics got no clue at what they are doing más treading employees with not respect, but beside that Quest is a great  place to work...also  pay is so low and we are loosing benefits every year..."
good,"Great job environment to learn and practice phlebotomy skills , Clerical skills . Bad for employees pay and benefits . Staffing is always short supplies unstocked"
good,"Worked as a contractor.  Brought into well established team with each team member having a minimum of 5 years Quest employment, so they already knew the various internal contacts, procedures, processes, etc.  Basically thrown into the deep end of the pool with little support.  When hired, was advised by two team members it would take at least a year to start getting a hold of the numerous challenges.  Also found that I was not the first person they had tried to fill this position with.  Manager basically looking for a unicorn."
good,"you can get a variety job skills , the work is not full-time but the benefits are excellent not much room for growth but overall great company. Hard to get time off"
good,"The managers are very inconsiderate and disrespectful. Management does not care about you life outside of work"
good,"Quest had great pay and great benefits. Micromanaged with and Iron fist. Cut Throat environment with liars, and evil people. Sales is Cut Throat as well. Careful working here!!!!!!"
good,"This position was highly stressful, I was expected to produce, however I had no direction, nor the right tools provided to do the job successfully. So I took it upon myself to get things done and in the end I had made a name for my clinic that I represented and I also was able to produce over 13 managed care contracts in less than 2yrs. "
good,"A typical day at work is making sure staffing is in place and the needs of employees are met. Getting in production if necessary, training, making sure the operation of the IOP's/ PSC's are running smoothly as possible."
good,"I put stable with question mark, although the corporation was stable career path, the people (women) were crazy and emotional and scary had undertones of “ cutthroat “"
good,"Drawing blood from home bound patients. Using the companies car to go to different boros. I have learned to have patience with the sick and elderly and, also with people in general you never know what a person is going through in there personal life. I do what i'm told with management . My co workers are great we all work well together and help one another. I think the hardest part of my job is the Scheduling of the paient no one wants to be first to be seen and no one wants to be last. The most enjoyable part is after the patients are seen the satisfaction of the sevice I've just given them."
good,On any given day there is a oppunity to learn something new.It is a fast paced place.I enjoyed working with all types of people.The only problem there wasn't enough time during the day to complete all that was expected of me.
good,"Career opportunities, hires within first, pay could be much better opportunity to grow in skills and patience is excellent. Very busy and you will always learn to be better or fall out"
good,My experience with Quest Diagnostics was in my opinion was a wonderful company to work for. Unfortunately the location i worked at was not a good experience at all for me. the company would not work with me to  accommodate the distance i travel to work 5 days a week. having to drive over 62 miles daily and no accommodation realized i no longer can work for this company. management was not in good hands. supervised employees are not at their best. overall the employees where i worked at has been a nightmare for me.
good,"very rewarding career, could really use some advancement for growth and to over lap, of being treated fairly for my years of services. And to not to say anything negatives but for my 15 years of true hard labor and dealing with general public,  has taught me to be more considerate and  professional conduct matter."
good,"The environment looks like friendly, but there is too much political game to play. management is to volatile and unsecure. All is about play a political game."
good,Sorry I do not want to write down some negative stuff. The only thing in my opinion to much unrealistic targets and goals. Some times those targets create stress for employees.
good,While working for Quest Diagnostic out of Pittsburg it was hard for me to make any money. I would be scheduled appointments too far between each other and not making any money as the travel mileage was far in between time and distance. While I have tried to resolve this issue with management it couldn't be resolved. Living in a less dense area I was at a disadvantage.  I really enjoyed the work and using my skills I had acquired  but I just couldn't afford the travel part.
good,"I learned many things at this position, going from a desk side technician to a system admin."
good,"Quest Diagnostics was an excellent place to work, the staff is very friendly and its easy to get along. Certain decisions by managers made it very difficult to get all work done and there seems to be no reason behind it. Quest spent quite a bit of money and time into a cloud based program in which all decisions seemed to be based around this program that was not working."
good,"This company taught me alot, it gave me more confidence to lead and be able to lead a team and to work alone as well. This company has growth opportunities but did not support families and life outside of work."
good,"was a great company to work for"
good,"Looking to expand in the Medical field with growth opportunity im very efficient and reliable either Full time or Part time,im a team player,vibrant personality cant wait for a new opportunity to shine."
good,Quest makes diagnostics available to all populations. Varied levels of work needed depending on your role. If you have account owner role will handle much of the day to day. If you have specialist role most of time goes into travel.
good,Consisted of both outpatient blood draws and processing. Venipunctures on patients of all different ages. Fast paced and great work environment. Great company to work for.
good,The job wasn't that bad but when in came time to transfer into a different area was unable to transfer. But was never was given a reason why was unable to transfer.
good,"The friendly, positive and energetic environment with a beautiful break room, great team to work with, while at work help is always around the corner."
good,"Quest was a great company to work for. The benefits for the employees are great. Getting holiday pay, weekend differentials, 2nd and 3rd shift differentials are important for employees who must work during these times. It allows the employees to feel like their work is valued."
good,I worked for the company for. A few months. Before. I had relocate. To Tampa Florida. They are a very fast paced environment. Work rotating weekends.a bunch of different situations that you can find yourself jn
good,I enjoy taking care of people. I love working on my own and being responsible for what u do. I am a strong person that can work on my own with the ability to get done what needs to w done. With little supervision.
good,Currently employed here. Still learning something new everyday.  A lot of training is involved in my position of courier. Coworkers are great and management at our hub is great.
good,"Overall a good company, RN hires are primarily per diem provider of Biometric screening events.  "
good,At one time I thought I'd retire from this company.  Now I am not so sure.  The advancements are few and far between.  My current Supervisor is fine but she has her hands full also.  The hardest part of my job is knowing what test to order but because I have been doing this for so long it is easy to me.  I have learned a lot from my previous Supervisors but I am still at a stalemate as far as advancements.  The only thing I will say is that I do have everything I need for my family.  At one time Quest Diagnostics was a great place to work.
good,My position at quest diagnostics was complex because I collaborated with different departments to make the processing of specimens easier and more productive.
good,This is a wonderful place to work.  There are many opportunities for growth.  The benefits are amazing.  I loved working nights.  My hours were 11 pm to 7:30 am.
good,I only worked there 3 years before they consolidated but I really liked working there.  They took care of their employees and we all worked very hard and had fun while working
good,"Since, I was employed on two different occasions by this company. I must say the first five  years I worked for the company was very rewarding.  Quest overall is a great company to work for, however some parts of management should be address at the lower levels."
good,"I was able to create my own schedule."
good,"Good place to work, Quest provides job training and education to employees to develop their career. good team members helps in problem solving , helps new employees to develop their skills"
good,Very fun and great learning experience! This is a place where you can really lear how to become a good phlebotomist! you'll have your share of hard sticks!
good,Expect to service any where between 100-150 patients per day ( and that is a slow site) Sites can see upwards of 250-300 patients a day especially during busy season.

good,I enjoyed working at Quest. I decided to leave because I thrived better in a hospital setting. Quest is a laboratory that was a little slow-paced for me.
good,"good place to work.  I would recommend.  They are going through a transition phase which is the only reason i'm looking for something else.  Other than that, I would gladly keep working for Quest."

good,"Excellent team working group..  Would recommend others to work at Quest. Schedule was hard specially if you are far from work facility."
good,Extremely hectic yet productive and challenging at times.  Days are consumed with problem solving and trying to meet deadlines.  Attending several meeting and trying to engage in day to day activities.
good,"Very repetitive work. Once you get started and know what you are doing, then you will be doing that day after day. There is a little learning curve, but management is there to help you along."
good,great place to work friendly coworkers. cleanly place fast work pace. great patients usually have the same patients consistently each week so you get to know them pretty well.
good,"Challenges on your daily day by day task can be from very light to extremely stressful. I have learned to accept all challenges with a smile and know they will add to your experience. I have been involved in stressful situations and how find myself in a similar situation a year later. It was such a relief that because of my previous experience I was able to think outside the box, provide different ways to resolve the issue and I was successful at it. I could not stop smiling on days like this"

good,"I initially was responsible for inputting diagnosis codes for lab work in order to send it to insurances.  I later became responsible for working in the phone bank.  There, I took phone calls from patients that had received a bill and did not understand it.  It was my responsibility to work with the customer to understand why this was happening.  I also was responsible for completing reports that were created when a secondary insurance had not been billed or when the explanation of benefits that the customer had received did not match what was being billed."
good,"I like working here, great company and employees."
good,"Processing specimens accurately and in timely matter."

good,"Very peaceful work environment. Excellent team work always something new to learn, open to learning. Very pleased when patient complemented my good job and the professionalism that they received from me. On the other side very hard when for any reason I was unable to perform my job."
good,"no much to say. while it is good pay, company overwork employees lacks of education and training, and they change processes to  often"
good,"Quest Diagnostics is an icon of quality healthcare, a reputation it has earned through its commitment to patient care.  Staff of Quest Diagnostics' staff feel a strong belonging to this organization which is continuously investing in its staff and technology."
good,During my internship I really got to work on all of the details in the skills that are required for a Phlebotomist. The staff was very helpful and went out of their way to make me feel comfortable

I wear many hats each day from the moment I come into work at 4 a.m. until the time I kiss my children good night.  I pride myself in delivering outstanding client-specific service to those I do business with.  On a typical day at work, I will produce between 250 and 350 transcribed reports (these are short reports).

good,They are very professional and gentle. Loved working for Quest
good,"A typical day at work was very rewarding in helping patients who were fearful of getting there blood drawn to help them to relax to listen to them if they had concerns with what  the outcome of the blood test may be. It was rewarding in developing a personal relationship with the staff and physicians. The hardest part of this particular type of job would be to draw blood from a baby and to see the face of a helpless mother that knew the blood test was necessary for that child. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that every patient that needed there blood drawn was drawn successfully in one stick, the samples were handled properly and sent to the lab with care, the insurance company was billed correctly, everything went well with the co workers and the physician was pleased when the patient praised the phlebotomist for sticking the first time and they didn't feel any pain!"

good,"taking calls, helping clients with billing issues, working in groups and divisions"
good,I love the fast paced work environment. We all work as a team to provide quality care in a timely matter. The patients can tell we are working hard and are always complimenting our work.
good,"Very busy fast paced job, I learned the importance of being compassionate and patient and yet aware of time, getting things done in a timely but efficient manner. There were 4 of us in the lab and our supervisor would stop in on some days but mostly we were on our own, I had wonderful co workers we were all team players, the hardest part of the job was probably the time restraints because it was such a busy lab, The best part of my Job was my co workers, it really helps to work with people who are always trying to do their best and of course the patients it really helps when you do your job right that they just love and adore you."
good,"successfully obtained more than 100 blood specimens from a broad range of patients by performing venipuncture sticks, tracked collected specimens by initialing, dating and noting times of collection. verified patients information by reading and verbal identification"
good,"I work in a PSC that is typically busy. On a typical day we see over 100 patients between 3 full time employees and 1 temp. You never know what kind of day you are going to have when you walk thru those doors in the morning. Everyday is different and exciting as well as difficult at times. "
good,"I interact with geriatric and  pediatric patients on a day to day bases. I learned how to be more compasionate for the patient as they are asking questions about the procedures they are having done. I learned how to work at a faster paste, but at a level where my patients are comfortable and are ensured that I know what I am doing. I am in a doctors office where I am the only Quest Diagnostics employee.  The hardest part of my job is knowing that I am about to ""stick"" a baby. I enjoy interacting with my patients, actually taking time to get to know them as a person and not just a ""req. number""."
good,Very face-paced and great for experience! They have numerous locations and good schedules

good,"Answered incoming calls regarding their bills received for lab work, I submit it to their secondary coverage for payment."
good,"A typical day is your busy for the minute you walk in to just about the minute you clock out. It's very busy, but still very well organized and maintained. great staff!"
good,"A typical day at work as a phlebotomist at this Quest Diagnostics location was very busy. The other phlebotomists as well as the patients were generally very friendly and work usually would go very smoothly throughout the day. Each patient would be brought back in the order they arrived, their personal information would be verified on the computer, and they would then have a seat to have their blood drawn for laboratory testing."
good,"A fun fast paced environment, where management and coworkers did not hesitate to lend  a helping hand. I advanced my knowledge in laboratory testing and handeling of blood and urine specimens. Management was always there for help and could answer any questions. Co-workers worked hard and were never too busy to help. The hardest part of the job was a difficult draw, more experienced Phlebotomist would then step in and help. Being able to laugh and learn with the job and employees."
good,"I currently work at a faced paced, sometimes hectic, Nephrologist office. I draw lab work and prepare it for the courier to pick it up at the end of the day. I have learned so much about kidneys and how they function I was thinking of furthering my education as a doctor. Our office is one of the most fun, energetic places to work. Our patients know us by first name. The hardest part of the job is when one of the patients either passes or has to be put on dialysis. The most enjoyable part is the staff and patients, we are like family."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,Good Services Staff was nice to work with.  Evveryone worked as a team when it came to patient care.
good,Loved my job!!!!! Enjoyed everyday I was there but needed change.
good,A typical day at work is processing the specimens and data entry. I have learned to work productively and with quality.I have learned the different tests for different illness. I also learned to work with speed because we have a quota to meet. I also learned to value and care for the patients eventhough its just their bloodworks that i see. I have great co workers and a nice supervisor.
good,"The location where I completed my intership was a fast pace environment. I learned how to draw blood from a variety of age groups, different forms of drug testing, separate the blood in the lab and prepare it to be shipped out to the main branch. The hardest part of the job was knowing from the type of testing the many illnesses people battle with on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part was the people contact and I never got bored."
good,I had the opportunity to learn about developing and executing strategies to drive growth and customer retention.
good,"A typical day at Quest would be to make sure everything is stocked and cleaned before we open the doors to our patients. I learned a lot of things such as how to deal with troublesome patients and small children during a procedure. The most enjoyable part of my job was feeling accomplished after a good procedure. The hardest part of the job was ... really nothing, I enjoyed everything about it. I enjoyed learning new things and meeting new people and doing my procedures."
good,I draw blood and put in patient demographics. I also send the specimens to the lab.
good,"Third shift is the most exciting and at the same time stressful lab environment. On your feet decisions and organization was a must. The management was serious about following 6-sigma compliance basically, you as a tech had to be a robot with no errors. Co-workers were just as busy as I was and not much talk. The hardest part was the work schedule between 12 hours and 8 hour work nights. The enjoyable part was going home."
good,This is a high volume reference lab. Most of the work is done in the hours between 11 pm and 7 am (hematology).
good,"I think it depends on what department you work in, and who you work for. I was lucky to have amazing peers and managers."
good,"A typical day start out responding back to clients calls from the night before any issues,or concerns,or problem,reassuring them of Questquality service,preraring weekly reports relating to staffing issues,scheduling daily workflow for RSR(Route Service Representatives)Supporting sales department by updating client information in specialized computer database.Learned no matter what the clients are the reason i'm here,take good care of the clients and they will return.Mangement recognized employees for service above and beyond the norm with the 'Take a Bow""awards and gift cards.Hardest part when clients lab test were left for whatevery reason,Most enjoyable clients receive a good report back."

good,Very good place to work. I've learned how to be more hands on around the home and willing to repair
good,"I ensured timely delivery and accuracy of pricing on purchase orders. I ensured prompt order placement of various items for all business units. I responded to customer and vendor inquiries via telephone and E-mail. I performed duties such as faxing, filing, and tracking and confirming purchase orders. I provided resolutions to simple and complex problems. I performed customer service and call center duties. I learned a great deal about customer satisfaction and gained most of my experience in customer service with this company. Management and co-workers treated everyone like family. The hardest part of the job was finding something to do on slow days. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team and consistently making progress."
good,"Great staff to work with! Learned a lot, they were very helpful for me to grow as a health care professional."
good,I mainley worked between an oncology office and a patient service center. I was able to better my self as a Phlebotomist as oncology patients can be very difficult to get blood from. I was also able to learn more about the various types of testing that are performed based on the dx. I learned about chemotherapy and the effects on the body as well as different types of cancers.
good,Great company to work for. Supervised 24 local employees. Responsible for daily activity at location. Kept employees informed of changes and update on training in order to enhance their performance.
good,Quest is a nice place to work. Management needs to work on getting to know their employees personally. Knowing each employee inorder to place them in a client base office is important. Clients are trying to get the most out of the company.
good,It is awarding to work at Quest Diagnostics. It prepares you to go work for any other  Fortune 500 company and be a success. Management in different departments are not always consistent in their style but they are working on it.
good,"good company to work for.  Nice atmosphere and pretty good pay.  The call center may not be there much longer, but it was fast paced and I enjoyed the overall atmosphere"
good,Working for Quest is a great opportunity and great way to begin a career in a laboratory environment. You'll learn a lot as well as have opportunities to advance if that's what want from your experience while working there.
good,It is awarding to work at Quest Diagnostics. It prepares you to go work for any other  Fortune 500 company and be a success. Management in different departments are not always consistent in their style but they are working on it.
good,Cytology side was amazing working with pap slides filing finding slides as needed to be sent out.  Could not have asked for better group to work with.
good,We contacted medical doctor offices to provide test results for patients confidentially and with in hippa guidlines. It was a fast paced environment but not too overwhelming.
good,"A typical at Quest Diagnostics is walking in the door ready to achieve your daily goals. The goal is to take as many successful calls as possible. The rush of having a goal each day, gave me the push to perform to the best of my ability."
good,"Great Opportunity , fast pace great co- workers "
good,"Great company but to much favoritism, Co. needed to do a good clean up in their supervisor dept. "
good,Good company and work environment.  The company is focused on patient care and up to date testing. Quest has a good culture and the CEO is moving the company in the right direction.
good,"Quest is a well known diagnostic laboratory.  It is a very large company with thousands of employees around the world.  As a front line employee performing direct patient care, I feel a bit detached from the company.  I am finding that advancement is extremely difficult due to stringent rules on ""time in grade"" and such.  It is a great company, but without the ability to move up and grow, I find it incredibly frustrating."
good,"Great place to work.  Many great managers that allowed me to grow, and develop my skill.  Started as an assistant and ended as a Senior Billing Specialist."
good,Processing specimens for the clients/patients daily to ensure proper test results. Increased my knowledge by working in other areas of the Lab.  The hardest part of the job was working 3rd shift and the best part was the continuous overtime.
good,The company in general is very progressive and the changes they have made are all positive changes.  I am concern that I was told by an HR person that Quest Irving tends to hire the wrong people for their supervisory and  management positions in the technical part of the laboratory.
good,The flexible schedule is very nice in the Service Center.  The company has great benefits and compensation.  Management is all about the numbers and not quality.  It does have your typical red tape and politics.
good,"From start to finish in a work day was a journey of knowledge and power, within myself- working for others in a way I didn't think possible.  The co-workers were very knowledgeable and attentive to my needs and the needs of the patients arriving and leaving the clinic. It was honorable to work with such a professional group of women. The hardest part of the job was explaining to each patient that I was a student; building that trust from the start."
good,"Strong household-name, Company that is re-building.  A solid core of Mid & Upper Management."
good,"A great learning experience, very interesting laboratory, I learned how to communicate with all my team players in the lab and patients, I learned how to problem solve and ensure quality specimen processing, management was very patient and willing to put in extra time to make sure you had a clear understanding of what was expected in the lab, the coworkers were real team players, they would stay over until everyone work was don't in a timely professional order. the hardest part of my job was making sure we met our quota every night and the enjoyable part  was knowing that we did meet our quota in a timely fashion with no errors.."
good,This was a temporary position through a temp agency. My assignment was ended on 11/27/2013. I liked working there. This was a great experience for myself.
good,"I worked for Quest for 21 years, as with all companies, it is a challenge, that is what makes the job worth while.  The customers/patients.  The Diversity Team, and Quest Green Team."
good,I love my patients and my coworkers were great to work with. The management was very unprofessional and they told all the employees business to the other employee.
good,"Not the job where you can grow unless you get promoted to lead or supervisor."
good,Fast paced environment which I loved my boss was a great person however it is a very stressful experience for which I should have been compensated a little more than I was. To move up was impossible due revolving door of temporary employees. Always short staffed which made my position a lot more stressful than it should’ve been. But it’s a great company to work for as far as benefits and hours
good,"One of the best companies to work for in the medical laboratory industry. Great Co-workers, health conscious company with many programs geared towards a healthy lifestyle including smoking cessation and health awareness."
good,A typical day at work is very fast paced and can be challenging because every day is different. I have learned how to manage time and prioritize. Workplace culture is wonderful because quest is a diverse organization. There is not a hard part of the job I can recall and the most is enjoyable part of the job is servicing patients.
good,Learned a lot from this company with billing and medical coding.   Was able to do advanced learning programs.   Great team manager that followed me.    My hours weee pretty flexible for life events or appointments.   Would recommend this company to others.
good,"I really enjoyed this job. I had actually let my NP license lapse and they called and asked me to renew. Which I need and now they are no longer on line so I am looking actively for a job."
good,I have provided my ratings for the different categories above. I do not have anything else to add to this review except that I enjoyed working at Quest Diagnostics and attribute my career development in the lab to them.
good,"I like a fast paced environment; it makes the day go by fast. I worked there for two years as a contractor. I learned all four databases and was called upon frequently to assist with a clients medical records equipment if it wasn't working properly. The Sales reps loved me, and the technicians I would schedule liked that I would factor in their locations and the travel time to get there in time."
good,"a typical day at work was busy but pleasant "
good,I would order tests as dictated by the doctors script and perform phlebotomy and finger sticks. It could be very busy at times and it was a fast paced service center.
good,"Quest is a great company, but you work on a contract and therefore you are not eligible for any company benefits. But, the pay is really good and they are flexible work hours. I enjoyed working for Quest "
good,"This company is a good place to work, you just need to have to be able to play politics with other employees as well as management. The  benifits were great, Health, Dental, Eyes, 401k, life insurancce, stock options. Most of the co-workers were easy going and down to earth. It really was alot of fun working there. I had made alot of close friends while working there."
good,"Quest was a good company to work for. They, however, had to downsize the department I was working in due to merging with another laboratory company. I was sad to be let go."
good,"Overall this is a vary good company to work for management and coworkers are plaasant. This is a company I would go back to work for . "
good,just not enough work to do 40 hours so you have to use your top the get your hours in plus its hard to move to a different department because no one has open
good,This job site was very focused on meeting quarterly goals. They motivated the staff to push forward and rewarded those who did well. the environment as a whole was great.
good,"Love working for this company, Better pay is needed for the job that is expected. Need more work at home positions. Hours of operation should stop after 6 p.m. But I know that will not happen because of the states that are in a different time zone."
good,Great company to work for. We definitely earn our money but FT positions here in San Diego are difficult to come by. Being a PT employee this can be rather frustrating. Apart from that I have a great supervisor/manager who is very accommodating and runs his section very well. My coworkers are very knowledgeable and always willing to help. The most difficult part of my job is the paperwork involved with each patient. They sometimes can be very complicated.
good,fast paced work enviorment in the mornings ..i learned how to be gently and caring with other peoples lives in my hands. managment is very respectful and flexible with any barriers that may occur.the hardest part of the job was once the work load slows down you can not be as busy
good,Good company to work for I have really enjoyed working here so far. The job is not too far and I enjoy going to work. Management is very nice and the hardest part of the job is all the hours put in.
good,"Many aspects are covered from preparing documents, to filing, to settling disputes, to advertising, etc.  Was a great learning aspect of several different fields."
good,my job duties were the same when working at Orange Park Medical Center.  I also did data entry and as well client service. Love a challenge when it comes to a hard patient to get blood from
good,"I learned new data-entry system and medical terminology."
good,"A typical work day, had to make over 200 calls to customer & get 15 appointments set. The atmosphere inside the job was amazing."
good,"I loved this place.  Every one was really nice.  Lab manager was very attentive to my trainings. It was an externship but i've learned alot and get trainings on what i wanted to become, a phlobotomist"
good,coming into the office getting right to work calling customers helping to resolve issues and upgrade accounts and products . management not always around for help supportive when around. Hardest part of the job not satisfied customers . enjoyable part of the job co-workers.
good,A typical day at Quest is very hectic and sometimes mentally exhausting. I have learned all facets of phlebotomy and lab processing. I have a good relationship with my supervisor and co workers due to my position as a float I am in many different locations on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job is the time constriction we have with each patient. I see sometimes upward of 70 to 90 patients a day by myself. The satisfaction of keeping my patient comfortable and safe.
good,I did work here for my externship. I loved working here because of the people and the patients that we served everyday. It was a real pleasure and rewarding job to work for.
good,"learned alot of skills working for Quest was very good place to work, management was a little difficult but other than that everyone i worked with was awesome."
good,dealing with the public in a draw station and Stat draws with all ages and lab assistant work to prep for pick up of specimens.
good,"on a regular day i deal with all kinds of people. you need to have very good customer service skills. take down their info, verify requisitions with ordering physician.draw their blood. make sure ordering physician receive results"
good,"I opened the doors at Quest Diagnostics Monday- Friday and every other Saturday at 6am. I registered patients and performed venipuncture for the requested tests per doctor's order. Afterwards, I processed the blood and shipped it out to the lab. I really enjoyed my patients and eased their mind to make them feel comfortable because nobody likes blood drawn. I work well as part of a team and I am eager to learn more in the medical field."
good,"busy and steady work place. fast pace moving, call doctors office for any Dx and Clarification. work as team member."
good,Very well organizrd fun enviroment management was prodctive and clients were always pleased with thier emviroment.
good,I loved working here. The management and co-workers were just terrific.
good,Workplace culture has drastically decreased as many  jobs have shifted away from the office building.  Very hard to be seen as management is off site.
good,We are allowed to work from home 2 days per week and the hours are extremely flexible in the department where I work.  I am able to set my own hours as long as I am in the office by 9 am.
good,I have positive and productive work with ExamOne. I really enjoy management and professionalism in the workplace. Would recommend to anyone. Organized and always growing.
good,Overall a good job as long as you stay to yourself. When it comes to your supervisor communication is the best key. Don't get to personal but be sure to communicate effectively.
good,I love the staff and the learning experiences at Quest Diagnostics.  The job responsibilities was a fit with the expectations of the job.  Work life home life was not something that was well managed or managed fairly across the departments or staff.  The compensation is great with Goal Sharing and annual wage increases made you feel appreciated for what you do year after year.
good,"all jobs have responsibilities, in this particular is more stressful since the life of patients depends on you, you have to have more attention at all times, not to mention that your life is at risk of being affected if you are not more than outstanding."
good,Great place to start phlebotomy!! It is a lot of information to gain . I enjoyed meeting new people and gaining experience!! It’s a great place to work.
good,I like the people I work with. The management pushes very hard for perfection. There is not enough staff to cover when others are sick or need time off so it is hard to take time off.
good,"I was very happy at Quest. only quit because of the commute, wish Quest was in the area I currently live in. it was a good fit for me when I lived closer."
good,"Overall, my career at Quest Diagnostics was filled with challenges and was rewarding.  The people I worked with were second to none in their commitment to patient care."
good,Quest is a good company to obtain employment i would recommend the company  as i have done so to many potential candidates. I think quest can improve with compensation
good,"Quest Diagnostic is a great place to work, the company is patient focused and I love that. My days work is field with meeting and helping good people."
good,Excellent company to work. Fair.Honest.Leadership is excellent.This is a good place to work for serious self starters. Offers competitive compensation and good benefits.
good,"Flexibility to make your own schedule. Early morning shifts so a typical day ends around noon. You travel to various locations and get paid to do so.. If you enjoy traveling this is an awesome fit."
good,On an average  day I would go into work and print out the daily appointment schedule. I would put patient orders into the computer and perform venipunctures on patients of all ages. I would also do capillary draws and perform urine or hair drug screens. I would do labs for life insurance policies and other employers. I would set up patient appointments and train new employees. I would order inventory and I would also do specimen processing and prepare the samples to be picked up from the courier and sent to the main lab. The hardest part of the job I would say that there wasn't always enough staff for the amount of patients they would have in an day. Being the only tech and having to call doctors offices for clarificaions and having a room of very unhappy patients makes for a very over whelming situation. the best part of the job were the patients. a lot of patients were weekly patients and you start to build friendships with some of them . Its rewarding. Sometimes the management was hard to talk too but I was lucky enough to have an amazing co worker that was always willing to help.
good,Quest Diagnostic found me the job at Mobile Infirmary. It was on contract.  The manager in the lab at Mobile Infirmary was very petty and really pushes her employees to quit.  Mobile Infirmary would be a great place to work if there was a new manager.
good,I worked for Quest on a part time basis.My job was to draw patients at Stozneheadge nursing home and deliver specimens to Quest Laboratory in Syracuse New York.
good,"I loved my Job at Quest Diagnostics. I worked in the Long-term care department for 2 years. They closed my department down and didn't have any full-time positions available at the time. So they let us go. If It wasn't for that reason, I'll still be employed with Quest"
good,My manager is awesome she works really hard to make sure her employees are taking care of. The pay is really low for everything we have to do. their is also a lack of team work .
good,"Awe company  there wasn't a supervisor for the area only a team lead that's been there for ever, she very unprofessional.

good,"On a daily basis I process over 200 requisitions and prepare them to be tested at the local hospital. The hardest part of the job is the hours, I work from 5p-130am and this is not a guarantee if we complete our tasks before then."
good,"Quest diagnostic is a good place to work, work atmosphere is good and there is plenty of opportunity for advancement. what I learned to definitely stay on task and continue to do your best"
good,"Management within the office was the best i've had thus far, also the staff is amazing. It was a fun and good place to work. Only concern i had was the fact that i was hired as a temp. and was told after 6 months that i wouldn't/couldn't be offered the full time position for at least another year, which means i didn't get the benefits and PTO. Which is very important to me."
good,"My company is fun and a great place to work. Pay could be better, and they should add a bonus structure. But we work hard and play harder. Please apply"
good,I really enjoyed working at Quest.The environment and employees were really grate to be around.The location of the job was perfect. The hours work great with my school schedule.
good,"It is a healthy envirment to work with quest, i will refer family and friends to work with them."
good,"Working to together and pacing your day so that things can get done . I have learned to meet people where they are . In managing people you have wit be willing to have their input of things so that the plan that was placed with them have some of their input in them. "
good,I was introduced to the medical field at Quest.  Talked a variety of patients and had satisfaction in filling their needs.  Learned programs that could assist me. Interaction with Leads to guide you.
good,"Great place to work.  Job security.  Very busy and easy to meet people.  The managers I've worked for were very professional, courteous and helpful."
good,"I loved this company, It saddens me when I think about why I left. Quest Diagnostics was a great company with great people, patients and coworkers."
good,Some of the best people I've ever had the pleasure to work beside. Long hours and commute were just more than I cared to give. I would and have recommended Quest to others.
good,"Although I love my job as a courier it's very difficult to live on the rate of pay and hours provided by the routes.  My supervisors are great guys that are easy to talk to and answer when you're in a place of ""need to know"".  Quest has been a fun place of employment while I've been in school.  It seems to work for others as ""the second pay in the home"" or a second job.  Full time at Quest is 30 hours, but it's not really possible to live on that 30 hr pay check."
good,I append my day constantly answering high volume of incoming calls without direct supervision and enjoyed everything about my responsibility. I learned to a outstanding listener to patient needs and how to diffuse irate patients.
good,"Fast pace"
good,I worked with 2 great ladies we worked well together. Had great patients. Very organized office staff.
good,drawing blood every day is a very challenging but rewarding job. Most people are not happy about having to come to a lab. so my was job was to not only draw their labs but to make them comfortable and confident that I would perform my job efficiently. having a patient walk away happy and pleased was always my goal.
good,Enjoy working with my co-workers and the employees that work for me.
good,"Good place to work. Job Security, very organized and well structured"
good,"Busy psc, love my co workers days can be hectic at times they seem to invest a lot in there workers."
good,I love working there but some departments are full of drama. The factions and cliques can be a burden. They can cause unnecessary stress if they happen to not like you.
good,"I loved working at this job due to it being close and was very fast paced which I love. Also if you are a person who loves working alone doing your job and going home this is the perfect job for you. Also the give you a very significant amount of PTO the first year and goes up your second year, 5th year and so on. The only few things I disliked was the lack of organization in my dept. There was no formal training procedure as in a set up with a binder explaining your job just a different person everyday teaching you there way of doing the job. Also the supervisor in my dept was very rude and inexperienced due to that he had never been one before and came from a different department in the building. Overall I loved the job just a few things I would've changed if possible."
good,Great company to work for. However Shreveport management was undesirable.   The company has great retirement and benefits.  Also they pay was great .  I would work for this company again under different circumstances.
good,"A great place to work at , you get benefits and a lot of flexible hours, they try to work with you as much as possible. Highly recommend! They are always hiring too ."
good,"my day at work started with Inbound calls i would take   for 8 + hrs from Dr and Nurses to deliver patient  Lab results test add on requests to overseeing any mislable forms,  ie no patient names on blood tubes correction forms to send to client. via fax  stat request anf forms to upgrade Lab work. calling microbiology to request culutre and senisitivites to urine samples  within stability period. on all lab work advising on how to perform blood draws from our test directory information system."
good,I work from home dealing with inbound and outbound calls. I also handle problem resolutions. I would handle any issues with customer labs and results.
good,I’ve been here for a while and it’s a great company to work for I’ve left on good standers and come back plan on retiring form quest. Lots of changes all the time so just ride the wave
good,Good place to work; nice coworkers; no room to advance in your career (if that is what you are looking for)... I was satisfied in my job; management was good no complaints
good,"Quest is a time sensitive,  goal sensitive place to work. It's not for everyone. But if you are self driven, it is a good place to work. It can be stressful and exhausting."
good,"I’ve worked for 4 labs in my entire steer as a phlebotomist. Some went by the book and some made opinions the rules of the book, some didn’t have a book, and one other practicallyburned the book. Quest has been good to me."
good,Fast paced and rewarding everyone works together very family oriented company your constantly learning and you can always excel to the next position. Great company

good,"collect blood from various age group,specimen accessioning, specimen processing, employees rotate task every week to allow each worker training in different department."
good,"A very dynamic fast paced work culture. Lots of different hats to be worn but very fulfilling too. The work culture is stressful but the salary and time off makes up for that. Very, very enjoyable company to work for. They treat their employees well and acknowledge their value......I have nothing bad to say about Quest. This company is fantastic to work for!!!!"
good,The benefits compared to my current employer are much better.   I would go back to Quest if an opportunity arised.  I would rather a Day shift position.
good,The days were long but far from boring with Quest.  There was always a problem to solve and we enjoyed ourselves while completing tasks.  Senior management was extremely supportive in allowing supervisors and managers to take initiative as to avoid delay in progress.  I was able to learn a great deal during my time there and walked away with great references and mentors.  The hardest part of the job was meeting the daily goals while being understaffed which led to required 14 hour work days.
good,A typical day at Quest Diagnostics consist of clocking in on time and ready to take call from several different business units the benefits are great the company is good to work for but the have unfair management
good,"A typical day at Quest, requires me running reports, calling clients, documenting problems, and releasing patient results."
good,"Quest is a very busy work place.Very strict on company policies and to stay in compliance with company procedures.Great team work,great place to work."
good,I was responsible for processing all requests for diagnostic materials need by other medical facilities. These materials were very important when planning patient care. Knowing the request were all processed at the end of the day was the best part of the day.
good,"Very fast paced, challenging, always changing. Every patient order is different, so you just don't know what you will encounter. I do enjoy the experience of drawing all ages. My coworkers and I work together to best serve the patients."
good,"Very good place to work, heavy data entry and phone work, need to "
good,Fast pace environment.  Room for advancement.  Helpful leadership.  Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to meet so many interesting people and knowing the you have helped to make a difference.
good,"Quest is a great place to work, lunch and breaks a very fair. good time off and great benefits for the value. Quests cares about the needs of their employees."
good,"I learned a lot from working at Quest , different ways to draw blood and other tests and also learning how to use all the computers. Most of all making the patients comfortable and happy with their experience"
good,Im a single mother of 4 and the pay here is not that good but great company to work for. The supervisors and nurses and doctors are always nice Overall best company.
good,"I loved working at Quest, would go back in a heartbeat, I am greatful for the opportunity, salary,benefits and perks were great, I learned a lot, being that I never worked in IOP setting, I had really great trainers and with that knowledge, I believe quest has prepared and taught me how to be more productive in an iop setting"
good,Great Place to work and they value their customers. Goes through changes at times but as long as your a good worker and give your best and always do your job (and maybe more) plus take pride in your work you will be taken care of.
good,"Responsible for all responsibilities of the Specimen Preparation Assistant."
good,Quest is an equal opportunity employer. There are many ways to advance in this company and they are nationwide. I currently work in client services and it is a struggle at first. Once you become comfortable with the job function and become familiar with testing information it is a breeze! I have attained a lot of knowledge about patient care working in this department.
good,Love working for Examone and I love my co-workers I have there is just no place for advancement and at the present time we do not have health Insurance.
good,"Working as a Team Lead in the call center for Quest Diagnostics was a rewarding experience. No two days were the same. The staff was great, it felt more like a family. "
good,I worked for the Omaha PSC and it was Amazing. I had to relocate but I would have stayed and worked in that environment for as long as I could. The family you have in the coworkers are second to none. I truly enjoyed my job
good,I enjoy working with patient care interacting with our patients.Every day as a different setting of people.
good,job was very demanding for excellence and couriers were made totally responsible for all expectations by courier management in a  very  impossible foremat -  Training was non existent and required each courier to self teach  due to non availability of time for daily requirements of  the job  each  day to be  thorough with always unexpected delays -
good,"Draw blood from patients, put in doctor orders, give lab reports to doctor(s). Prepair specimen for shipping and have specimen in drop box for driver to pick up on a daily bases."
good,Loved my previous job with Quest Diagnostics.....love doing phlebotomy and the patients
good,"Not a fun job."
good,"I was very young when I started with them. I was 19, but keep in mind I had already GRADUATED college and taken and passed all of my training. I was more than qualified. My manager always talked down to me because I was so young. My work record was impeccable but he always tried to make me feel like I didn't know what I was doing. He was ultimately the reason I left because it was no longer enjoyable going to work."
good,I have six years experience in phlebotomy!  There is not a duty that I cannot complete.
good,"Learned alot, met and worked with great people! Fast paced enviroment with many clinical sites abroad."
good,They were helpful to me and a great environment to work. A lots of interaction with clients on the phone.
good,The supervisors were all very nice. Great staff to work with. It made me realize working there that I wanted to pursue a further education in the medical field which I did. I worked a shift that was from 8pm to 4am so it was a big sacrifice with a small child.
good,I loved the lab clerk position. When specimens were received i entered patient info into chart and what labs came in. put a sticker on them and sent to the phlebotomist. I also did billing which was very boring and repetitive.
good,"Overall, this is a great company to work for. I have been a Medical Billing Specialist for five years and really enjoyed working with my coworkers. This is a very good company as far as advancement if steered in the right direction. I truly feel with proper management the company can exceed even higher. With proper management, I would indeed still be with the company. The hardest part of my job was month end closings. That was normally the most stressful time because of production but still an enjoyable time especially when the numbers were met."
good,"On all the years that I worked there I had a great time, teamwork was always a plus, but lack of management and poor work ethics"
good,Quest Labs was a very interesting place to work. The people there were like family after working there for serveral years. My boss was great and very fair with all the employees there.
good,This was my second job in the field and I am so thankful to have worked here. I has an awesome supervisor wjo had ben with the company 25 years. She taught me everything and was very encouraging which gave me the motivation to always do my best. I love being able to travel to different accounts which gave me the ability to be very versatile. There wasnt any clients office or patient service center I couldnt handle. Wonderful Experience
good,"Knowing you can do the job that is required and doing a excellant job,and having the patient giving you the best complement."
good,I enjoyed my time with Quest!
good,"Have a great location, pay and benefits are very competitive. Very busy and definitely customer friendly. They really aim to please their customers and employees."
good,"Quest Diagnostics offers a challenging workplace full of highly effective people, whom there is a lot to learn from, while also allowing a flexible work/life balance that focuses on family and integrity and personal growth and happiness."
good,Working for quest kinda fell in my lap and was the correct choice for me to join the Quest team.  I’ve worked with Quest for 1.5 year now and have participated in helping 4 other labs and have been able to benefit my team from past experiences
good,"I worked for Quest for 14 years as a phlebotomist. The first two sites I worked at were very fast paced and stressful, and the last site was a very easy IOP, with clients I loved. I had to leave this position because of family medical issues, and could no longer work days. I've been trying to get hired back working night shift hours in a different department, with no luck yet. Very competitive hiring process! But if you can get hired, It's a great, secure job, with great benefits!"
good,operated single lab for dr's office  until I became ill stemming from fluid on the heart due to fluid on the heart/ MVP-Quest graciously offered rehire anytime
good,Quest Diagnostics is a good company in general to work. The company has some good benefits and the work is not hard but requires a lot of attention and details.
good,"•	Studied existing LIS(Laboratory Information System)and processes, collected end user requirements and suggested the improvised business process model."
good,Loved working there. I worked at a one person site. Learned so much. Management was fair.  Good pay. Some time you felt out of the loop. Over all a great company.
good,I have been employeed with Quest Diagnostics for nearly 5 years. While there are times things seem to get hectic I overall love the fast pace culture of the company. I can say that with my time with the company I have been provided multiple promotions and advancement oppurtunities.
good,"Very busy working environment.  Constantly learning something new each day.  New corporate facilities in Secaucus, NJ are excellent with an employee parking lot adjacent to the building.  The surrounding area is heavily travelled and traffic is a nightmare."
good,great place to work  room for advancement great managment/training  I enjoy working with the people everyone so helpful. Tuition reimbursment at the company was great
good,A typical day would begin by me arriving at my first site for the day which was a half a day at a doctors office as a quest diagnostics in office phlebotomist (IOP). There were very few blood draws done here each day but the work station was very small and a lot of the time I would draw patients in the bed in the exam rooms rather than having them walk to my work station in the rear of the office. After my half a day I then took my lunch break and then proceeded to a Patient service center (PSC) to complete the remaining work hours. These sites were rather busy a lot of times depending on the lab location. I learned to work with a wide range of personalities and work skills. This was important because we worked as a flowing team with each person having a task and rotating the work load. The hardest part of the job was working behind someone else's work because sometimes the phlebotomist would not have drawn enough blood or specimen type in order for it to be properly processed and by the time you realized this the phlebotomist might be gone or the patient was gone. The most enjoyable part of the job was the company provided all employees with numerous and various uniforms and the retirement plan was great. Also I learned a lot here that bettered my skill set a lot because we did a wide range of tests that a lot of other labs do not perform on site.
good,The most enjoyable part of working for this fortune 500 company is the people and company culture. There are flexible working hours and an open door policy. This makes work enjoyable and building working relationships easy.
good,"Great company, flexible, relaxed yet fast paced environment, pay was good the position, but not enough for cost of living, management and culture of organization was always communicated and transparency was present"
good,Great company to work for. The company offers many opportunities to its staff to develop and progress within the company ladder. Very good culture and structure.
good,"Quest Diagnostics has a very relaxed and friendly work environment. When specimens come in the work is very fast-paced, making work days pass quickly."
good,"The management is very professional and skilled. Quest is a great place to work, but advancement opportunities do not come available often enough. The culture of my coworkers is very productive and they strive to meet the metrics, which is great for the company."
good,"I loved working at quests, we were always busy, the staff was mostly friendly to new hires. Phlebotomy is something that I really enjoyed and quest made it a lot more fun."
good,"Absolutely loved working for quest! Everyone communicated well with each other, and kept the workflow as easy as possible. Only down side was having to travel with short notices."
good,Overall good company. The pay is poor even with time the pay is still not fair. Good leadership just the compensation needs improvement in regards to the amount of work that is put in
good,"I enjoyed my job as a phlebotomist in every aspect."
good,"I no longer work for this company"
good,Great place to work and advance. Hard to balance work and personal life if working third shift. Very fast paced environment. Upper management can improve greatly. Overall enjoyed my experience with the company. Was sad to have to leave under circumstances I had no control over.
good,is a good place to work if u want to go full-time it has good benefits and they train you to do all sorts of things to learn and the pay was pretty good.
good,"I learned the use of a lot of technology used to diagnose and treat many diseases, innovative diagnostic instruments, and troubleshooting. I was able to advance year after year, making it to the leadership team in the Microbiology Dept."
good,"Fast pace job, with all ages, and gives me great experience and challenges.. I love patient interaction and great quality care, and I enjoy my job and getting all the experience that I can get."
good,I was the office lead so I would train others how to collect blood and run the front office. I would also travel from locate to locate to cover for staff.
good,Quest is an okay  place to work. Some of the co workers are not friendly. My pay sucks but my job is just that my job and I dont have to worry about my job if im doing the right things to keep my job. The men make way more money then the ladies. Its male coworkers that have been drawing blood for 5 years that make more money then i do and i have neen drawing blood for over 15. Years. I wish people would talk to the little people because we are the ones that count
good,Great place to work because of the hardworking culture. It's fast paced but rewarding because you think about all the patients you're helping by getting them their test results in a timely manner
good,Overall it was definitely a good place to work. I learned a lot about the medical field I had no idea about... Outside of the mandatory overtime I really liked the job.
good,Great place to work the overall manager isn't the best but the staff under her was amazing. If the job gets done perfectly there will not be any problems for you.
good,"This was suppose to be a long term temp assignment, however, it got cut very short due to lack of budget."
good,Quest is a great company to work for. It's fast pace environment. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the doctor's office. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting people for all different back rounds and providing them a supreme service.
good,"Externship was basically learning the ropes of phlebotomy. The main technician there was fun to be around and talk to, I learned a lot from working there."
good,Quest is a good place to work. If you have children that play sports or other school activities you will miss out on a lot because of the hours that the shift ends. The people are easy to get along with and they works as a team.
good,"The company is a great place to work. They value their employees, pay is fair, and work-life balance is excellent. Great Job security and employee engagement."
good,"ITs a great company to work for,"
good,"This company is great! however they do not pay for mileage and you drive over 40 miles daily. You do not get pad hourly, only per test. When your training you get paid per hour."
good,"This job allows you to work independently as long as you show that you can handle the responsibility of representing the company in a positive light while interacting with clients on a daily basis.  "
good,"I do not work their anymore. Between the three laboratories they were all fine to work for, But when I did I enjoyed working their and learned a lot.  I would go back again"
good,I like working at Quest Diagnostics it's a good place to work. I've learned a lot at working at Quest. Friendly staff who worked as a team.
good,"A typical day at work consisted in arriving at 8am, doing phlebotomy procedures on adults and children. The children, I believe was the hardest part of my job. I did drug screenings through out the day. We did procurement at our establishment. Also billed insurance companies. Being a lead phlebotomist, I ordered supplies once a week. I also may of had to travel to other facilities to fill in for another worker or help out. The management was great and very helpful. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers. Working for Quest Diagnostics did not seem like a job. Everyday at work was a pleasant experience."
good,"Very Busy, constant workflow, Polite people to work with."
good,"Good company to work for, awesome benefits. Pay is okay."
good,Good place to work and learn. Love working here. Work environment is good. Team work is required. If you are the people person than the PSR is good position for you.
good,"I loved being a phlebotomist,  I always got along with my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job was not being able to obtain a specimen but that did not happen often . The best part of my job was having pt. request me again because they felt comfortable with me."
good,"Management was not too good, but work environment and employees were fun to be around. I really enjoyed coming into work everyday. But it was a very commute from home and took up a lot of gas on the daily."
good,"fast paste environment ,requires 8 hours of pacing back and forth, "
good,"I found the job on Indeed and I love it. Its easy and enjoyable. The management team is easy and helpful. Training was interesting and helpful. If you like having a great place to work, this it it."

good,"A typical day at work as for me would be steady. Not too busy but not dead. I've learned to balance and keep a steady pace when its comes to having more than one patient or patients lined up. Worked with very minimum supervision, but the best part of my day was my patients. I enjoying talking to and seeing my patients"
good,I enjoyed the work and the people I worked with. I especially liked the fulfilling feeling when someone thanks you for assisting them in a way that was most helpful for them.
good,"I enjoyed working with new and current employees in southern CA in the cities of Anaheim, San Diego, Riverside, and Palm Springs area."
good,"Work all started busy, there's was always something to learn being each patient had a different order sometimes from totally different physicians."
good,I work on my own daily but the people I do work with are amazing. Management really wants to see you grow and they are very supportive of my future growth.
good,The environment at work is at a fast paced and focused. We are work as a team and support one another if needed to meet all deadlines and requirements. I have dedicated over two years and have no regrets.
good,I lost my job when my father passed away because I missed 1 additional day for bereavement
good,"Working at Quest Diagnostics has been one of the most rewarding experience in my career. The company shows the typical corporate structure, yet gives one the feel of a mom and pop operation in the way deal work with their employees, mainly because of its management culture, as well as, the culture of the employees themselves.Care, Compassion, Understanding somewhat defines this corporate giant in dealing with it's employees, even in their desire for production and excellence."

Not only did I have to draw their blood but I also processed all the specimens and got them ready for the labs to pick up, distributed the results to the doctors, ordered supplies, kept draw station well stocked, kept statistics, computer entry, and had to work one Saturday out of the month in a Patient Service Center."

good,market research and data collection was main focus of my intern project.
good,"i was an intern there at quest diagnostics i believe its a great place to work and to obtain traning for your next step in your carrer as a phlebotomist, also the phlebotomist i was under where very patient and uncredical with the students but made sure things were done professional and correctly and kind as ever with the patients i believe that sort of attitude and behavior with the workers can effect a more positive outcome on the new entry level phlebotomist... i learned how to review paper work with patient labs, i kept my area clean and set up ready with order of draw and labeling specimens but the hardest part of the job are the children and the most enjoyable is actually getting hard stick and drawing successfully on every patient your first draw. "
good,I worked as an in office phlebotomist for Ouest Diagnostics where I was placed in a doctor's office. Began work at 8am and ended at 5pm. some days were very busy and others were very slow. I loved working in this setting! I learned how different an office setting was from a hospital setting! I believe it helped me strengthen my management skills due to the fact I was the only IOP at this site! I never ran into anything that I would consider too difficult. I enjoyed meeting people and being a part of the office!
good,good company
good,"busy field, friendly environment, friendly patients, multi culture, fast pace, lots of training, new materials to learn everyday, time management, training."
good,Manager could have been a bit more involved in the Office Managers reactions to quite a few situations. An exit interview would have been very needed.
good,The only reason I am no longer there was due to a reduction in force.  Quest is a great company to work for with a great benefits package.  Management is also flexible with work/life balance.

I also learned numerous of things to apply toward gaining experience for a future job.
good,A typical day at work consists of 20-70 patients.  The busier sites have more than one person working in them.  Ever-changing learning environment. Hardest part of the job is when patients pass away the most enjoyable part of the job is when patients beat illnesses.

good,"My day was very structured.  You knew what was expected by management in your job field.  It was a very friendly atmosphere, easy to ask questions.  Difficult billing customer services calls was the hardest part of my job.  It was offset by the assistant's from my Lead."
good,The staff goes out of there way to help the new staff.  The staff shares their knowledge from their years of experience. It is a very enjoyable place to work.  Everyone works well with each other.
good,I love going to work every day knowing that there is plenty of work that will allow me to have as much OT as I want. I enjoy the atmosphere and most of the managers are great. However the promotion and advancement is not so great. The people I'm supposed to look up to some are dumb as rocks.

good,"enjoyable environment, fun place to work, great benefits, traveling experience"
good,"Very fast pace energetic work place. I would do any where from 20-70 patients a day. I learned how to be fast and efficient! The hardest part of my job was when we had children come in. Not because I couldn't do it, just because I hate when children get upset. The most enjoyable was just knowing that I am helping people everyday! I love when people would walk in nervous and walk out saying ""that wasn't so bad!"". It makes me feel really good knowing I made some people confortable with coming in to get their blood drawn!"
good,"I arrive at work around 0830, the doctors office I work in doesn't see patience till 0900. I clock in, log into computer. The doctor brings me lab orders if the patient needs them. I put orders in computer, draw patients blood, spin and/or seperate specimens for delivery driver to pick up. It is a slow office. I would prefer a fast paced work environment."
good,Seeking a stable work environment to develope skills and opportunities to grow with company

good,"I did my internship here.. Enjoyed working with the two employees that worked at that location. My trainer was very patient with me, explained everything that needed to be done. I realized it wasn't just about drawing blood but much more. The hardest part of the job I felt was figuring out all the codes in the computer for all the the tests needed to be done on a patient. But I'm sure with more help I could of learned it quite well. Most enjoyable part were the patients. They were very understanding about me practicing on them."

good,While employed at quest I learned to work with a program called Care 360.  I enjoyed my job and everyone that I had the opportunity to meet and work with.  The employees at Quest are very friendly and welcoming.  What I enjoy about my job the most was helping take care of the patient.  I take great pride in the job I do and really truly enjoy working with patients.
good,I have through expertise in two distinct but intertwined fields of Microbiology and Quality Assurance. Both industries are vital for a high level of laboratory performance as well as stringent quality control standards.

In the most recent years I have taken on more of the Quality Assurance type role to supplement my expertise in Laboratory Medicine. 
good,"Your typical day starts at 5am. going to Nursing homes collecting blood samples. Back at office by 7am. to start collecting patient blood samples."
good,My day starts as soon as I sign in. Calls are constantly coming in with Patient Service Centers and Doctors Offices requesting results. My co-workers are just as busy as myself. The hardest part of the job is telling some clients results that are heart breaking. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist to clients with the respect as though it was me calling looking for my own results. Just being able to help someone know that yes I do understand the importance of each and every call that comes into the call center.
good,It has been a wonderful journey. I am looking for advancement and personal growth.
good,Clock in head to mail room to sort mail. Once mail has been sorted you grab a tote of work and head to your desk. You sign in to the terminal and scan your specimens and input patients information and check test requested by physician. I learned medical terminology and how to prepare samples for testing. Management was cordial and always helpful. My co-workers were helpful if you needed it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours I worked and the fact that the job was hands on with very minimal supervision.
good,"I enjoyed working for quest diagnostics, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable."

good,I enjoyed working for Quest! I was part time but felt like a real part of the team. The managers are great at making sure you stay up to date on new procedures and test.
good,"They offer plenty of training tools for assistance. Shadow training. Immediate manager had weekly meetings to discuss progress and comfort-ability. Breaks are given. Facility had a relax room, a break room to wind down and picnic tables outside as well.

good,"Quest was a wonderful employer. Management was always supportive and the training was top notch. The only downside was the insane amount of mandatory overtime (10-20 hours every week, no exceptions). It was almost impossible to complete all of it since at the time I had a newborn child. However, this job made you feel appreciated with bonus incentives, encouragement both from floor managers and their managers. I wish I did not have to leave the employer but life happened, and I needed to be there for my family."

good,"My typical day would be to greet everyone with warm words of Good Morning,then settling down with a hot cup of Coffee to get my day started right. I run my Census Report to work on first thing in the morning, then go into my emails to print and  fax sheets to be filed in a filing ban in numeric order to get started with my report.This report is for months end invoices to assure we are getting paid for our services on the dates that Patients have Lab work done.  There are over 50 nursing homes to work on at a timely manner, and finish before or by noon. Then, I go on to patient insurance changes and build up new patient information in a masters screen just for this type of work. This allows Insurance billing to locate patient information when needed or help finding information for Nursing homes; they will bring it to my attention this makes it easier for co-workers because of my PR contacts from clients. There is always something to keep me busy. Doing my very best for the company and working as a team player is rewarding, because the outcome of it all is better all-around for me, clients and patients. l am accountable for doing my job well and besides I love working with people, trying things to make the job better is what makes me happy and what I thrive for excellence !"

good,Enjoyed working in doctor offices. It was like have my own business and I could make it or brake it. I was set free to make a lot of my own decisions on how to run the office. The company is a great company over all and I am sad to have been laid off
good,Quest Diagnostics is a great company to work for. unfortunately my position was eliminated company wide. Everyone I worked with was willing to help and grow my knowledge in the industry. It's a team effort and we use one another to grow our book of business. Service and insurance plans drive our relationships with our customers. The hardest par was qualifying my leads and sending them to my external reps at the perfect time where both the external rep and myself benefit the most on the growth in the unforeseen future.
good,I love working with clients giving them results for their patients. It has allowed me to comprehend more test results and what they are for. I love working in the medical group
good,"I learned so much valuable things at my time at quest diagnostics, the girls there did an excellent job at letting me get a hands on experience!"
good,"A typical day for me at Quest was logging on the phones and answering in a polite pleasant tone of voice. We had a quote to make each day of 100+ calls and also a phone percentage of 90% or better. My supervisor Patricia Escamilla was always there to help us in all we needed it was nice having that support from her. I learned to have lots of patients and to not be afraid to ask for help when is needed. I have also learned that every spicemen is someone mother,farther,sister,brother ect... One of the things I loved of this job was the people I worked with they where always with possitive attitude and always willing to help we were a team and always worked as one. I wouldn't say it was the hardest but it took a lot of patients and keep clam under pressure. The most enjoyable part for me was getting that ""oh thank you for your help"" and knowing I helped someone and I gave my 100%."
good,"I used to work for this company, always had a great time, loved my patients and co workers, my supervisors where always there for me. Just a great fun place to work. I only left because at the time I was working two full time jobs and was getting tired so I chose the night hour at a hosp. But know I don't need to work nights anymore and am trying to get back in, really did love to work here."
good,over all this was a great place to work the co-work that i work with was very nice the hardest part of the job was if i was unable to draw blood from a patient (an infant) the most important part of the job was making sure that the patient was please with every thing.over all management was great..
good,"Arrived at work at 8:00 A.M. and either would spend the day drawing patients and preparing specimens or getting paper work ready for phlebotomist drawing that day. Our duties were alternated daily.  "
good,"Everyday is a challenge working with patients and sometimes my office is in a vehicle traveling to different locations. When I have a chance to work with my co-workers, we work as a team as well as management, we are a team. The hardest part of my job is having to work by myself, but I have learned to work on my own and the most enjoyable part is being able to help someone."
good,I feel that Quest Diagnostics is a great company to work for. My only complaint is the lack of advancement opportunities.
good,"great place to work, benefits are great,  but hours can be very long and you do not know when you will be leaving work"

good,"A typical day in my work place consist of approximately 30 blood draws per day. Properly check all insurance. Enter all labs per doctors orders.

I love working with all ages of patients in this office. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I am making a difference in each patients life I come in contact with. "
good,I adored this job due to the fact that the training is very detail oriented and they actually appreciate employees while always makng it known. I was actually proud to be part of this team.
good,"A typical day at Quest Diagnostics would be receiving inbound and outbound calls about Insurance applications from different Companies, going through series of questions about health issues. Management will monitor calls to make sure I am on track with information, Co-workers were there to help. The hardest part about the job is having the knowledge about what diseases people had and what category to place them in, the most enjoyable part was being able to talk to people on the phones every day, and answering any questions they had to the best of my knowledge."

I always solve problems on the spot and often assist others in there difficult situations. I love being a team player. I think that the job moves so much smoother when you have everyone on the same page. I have learned a tremendous amount of knowledge through out the years in the phlebotomy field. The job is very rewarding."
good,"Did drug test, blood tests, draws, clerical work and able to work onsite at Dr offices and performed Med. asst duties while there."

good,"This is a great company with the ability to advance within many different departments. However, location and transportation wise, it could be a problem."

good,I worked in Customer Service and delivered critical and priority lab results to physicians. Learning the different types of tests and what's required for each test is really interesting. Management is a great team of knowledgeable people who maintain an open door policy for anyone that needs them. They celebrate all the holidays and dress up and decorate. They have costume contests and raffles to make things interesting. The hardest part of the job is making sure you know everything before calling to report the results to the physician. The most enjoyable part of the job and the way everyone gets along and you can ask almost anyone a question and they will know it. It's a great company.
good,Worked there for 9 years and I had a good time until the last day. It's a great place to work and I have no complains. Good benefits and pay. A lot of opportunity for growth.

good,"Great company to work for. Don’t want to leave, hope I can find a comparable position. Need to relocate back to Florida. Company can be political and seniority does not hold allot of weight."
good,"I loved working for this company, they were very good to me the only reason I transfered was to take care of my older sister who was very sick and since passed away. Quest is all about taking great care of their patients and getting the lab results back to the Dr's asap."

good,"A typical day at work would be arriving early (I always do). I make sure that all rooms are stocked and ready for the day ahead. The temps have to be checked in the room, refrigerator, and freezer to make sure the specimens collected are going to be stable. Messages are checked from the night prior so that I can respond accordingly and a appointment schedule is printed as well. "

good,"I couldn't ask for a better boss and group of people to work with. The only thing I would change is the pay per hour, other then that my boss alone is enough reason to stay. He understands not only work life as a phlebotomist but also that people have families and things comes up."
good,Quest is a rapidly growing company.  I worked for Summit before they bought it.  I worked for Cigna before Summit bought Cigna.  Jobs are not always readily available near home and this is one reason I am applying with Aduro.
good,"Some mornings I start my day with a phone call at 4 or 5 am on where I am working.  I start my day there with checking the freezer and refrigerator temps. Getting the appointments pulled up for the day. I then make sure my work station is fully stocked before I open the door. "

good,Quest Diagostics is great place to work for. One of the main attractions with quest is that it has many locations all over the US and employees can transfer due to re-location.
good,"I love this field of work. I was a CNA for a little over 6 years I would never want to go back to the part of the medical field. Being a Phlebotomist is one of the best things in the world, to be able to come to work every day and LOVE the job that you do is great."

I had the opportunity to see first hand how other places operated and Quest Diagnostics is with out a doubt the best out there and strive on a daily basis to do better and be better. If I ever had the chance I would happily work for them again. If you are hard working, dedicated and committed you can g far."
good,I worked in a very busy environment with great people.  I wish corporate headquarters did not move out of CT.  There were many aspects of my job that I was able to excel in due to great management.

good,"Quest Diagnostics was a wonderful company to work for. They treated everyone fairly and with respect. If i could go back to work for them, I would in a heartbeat."
good,"Great environment to work in. Make the required 40 hrs/week. Some overtime is needed. Night shift is great, however, very hard to do with schooling during the day. The hardest part of the job is being able to get the amount of sleep you need before coming to work. The job itself is very repetitive and easy to be done. Just follow the rules and guidelines and you are set for success."
good,Great place to work and learn. ..just need to be able to get out on time at 5...But that won't happen  because it's opened till 5...workers done afterwards

I also assisted with phlebotomy at the Montgomery office and that has to be the most enjoyable thing about the job. Because I learned how to do something I really love doing. The hardest part of the job is being relocated to the hospital in Opelika, but I get to learn more things that I can use in other jobs that come along."

There are many special orders that requires a lot of investigation and online research.  There is no change for mistakes.  You have to work extensive hours always having in mind that every patient is unique and important, that needs quickly and especial attention. You work schedule requires extra hours if is need it. This company is a huge company that requires and excellent management to keep growing. Due to the detail oriented work requirement and the responsibilities of each individual, the co-workers relationship depends of the team work and the work environment of each Quest Diagnostics facilities.

Later I learned computer skills working in IT and after several years I transfered to Data Mgmt for a daylight position.  I did my job with little supervision and did it well.

I miss the work and the people."

I learned a variety of on the job responsibilities and got a well informed idea of what I could expect working for this company in the future. I has an amazing mentor for this program. I thought she was an excellent phlebotomist and she gave me the chance to do most of the sticking every day of the program and I believe that put me at an advantage because I hear my other classmates didn't all get the same opportunities. She gave me a phenomenal review and I received compliments from the customers on a daily basis. They couldn't believe I was a student and thought that i had been doing this for years! The hardest part of the job was leaving once my program was completed! I believe the most enjoyable part of this program was that I was able to help people in a positive way, and also that I was able to get a preview of this company because I would be honored to one day work for them! Thank you Ashley and the entire quest team for this opportunity!"

I cleaned the office every morning as well as the Laboratory as I waited for my patients to arrive. I entered patient info into our company data base. I processed patients blood specimens along with the blood draw order from their doctor, for the courier who would transfer to the main lab for further testing. I had a 100% accuracy rate, not missing one blood draw."

The customer service people were all so nice every time you called, unlike another lab company that I worked for."

I stayed as a temporary worker until my work was complete. If they ever need another courier (1st shift), I would love to work with this company again."
good,I started with the company and was able to work my way up. I was with the company for 10 years and it is not uncommon for people to be with the company 20+ years.

good,"It was  a fun place to work, especially as a floater in the company and driving to different sites on a dailey basis.I love interacting and helping each patient (client) who was potentially fasting, going through a challenging season in life and being to encourage them while drawing their blood.

Working in logistics I think several keys components are important when learning the dos and donts for completing ones route. We were taught defensive driving techniques, along with handling a scanner to log every specimen, bags used for specimen handling, and offices or medical centers.

I love my job and meeting and taking care of my patients. I work by myself in a doctors office so I am around the client and their staff, and patients. I do not work with anyone else from my company during the week. The hardest part of my job is having a hard stick and trying to let the patient know they are in good hands and you will have a great experience because all I want is for my patients to be happy, and not scared. No one likes to be stuck with a needle. I love meeting and interacting with all of my patients. Everyone is so friendly. I love my job."

Quest makes you feel like part of the company not just an employee.  Their benefit packages and share holdings are amazing.  Not to mention that they offer advancement within the company the as well.  Their wages are comparable with other companies, if not better than most. The whole company works as a team to deliver the best patient care available."

good,"My typical day at work"
good,"I loved every single day! Majority of patients come in as soon as they wake up due to fasting or work schedule, being their first smile to set the day is very rewarding. I learned how to properly label specimens, how to enter data in to the system, providing accurate test results is crucial. A typical day at work is challenging but joyful. I have never enjoyed a job as such! After I got a hang of it, it became very easy to communicate properly with all patients and explaining the procedure to them as i performed the blood draw. The ladies that trained me were very lovely and always a step away to help but also gave me enough independence to master my skills. The hardest part of the job would probably be standing for long periods of time. The most enjoyable is having patients give you their trust, knowing what you do may save their life, and getting positive feedback from the patients."

good,"My experience with Quest on a daily basis as a phlebotomist was enjoyable, very challenging, with over a hundred patients per day on some occasions that were scheduled for various tests. I was able to manage my time to provide the best service for each individual patient arriving at out facilities. Management provided the workers with all the proper supplies necessary for daily functions. Quest management provided all staff with updated training and classes for its large diverse staff. I had the pleasure of excellent trained co-workers who were just as focused as I on providing the best service possible for our patients. The challenge for me was to keep my training updated for all the new various tests in a ever changing work environment. Lastly, the most rewarding aspect of my position was assisting the so many different patients who crossed my path and that I was able to provide them the best service and representation for Quest Diagnostic."

I learned how to do ""stat"" requisition, how to find missing and lost specimens and what ""TIQ""( test in question) meant and how to solve it. Management was awesome. Because we were on production, we had contests on who could key in the most reqs every hour. They gave out prizes for the best performers such as extended lunch breaks, dinning coupons, gift cards, etc. They made it fun to come to work every night. We also had potlucks and company lunches and dinners. The benefits were awesome. We received bonuses every year and depending on how good the company did during that year, the higher the bonus. The hardest part of the job to me in the beginning was having to get use to working over night. The best part was learning and seeing different and exciting specimens that came through our lab. The best job I ever had!!!!!"
