rating,review
bad,great place to work and need to fill out this form. I do not want to say anything else.  Just compete the form. and too bad about the multiple characters.
bad,"Hostile Place, people are terrible, not team players, backstabbers, malicious, management was bad, a terrible environment, Human Resources not helpful."
bad,if your not kin your not in !! or if your parents work for eastman you do no wrong !! or dad uncle brother or best friend works in management your are a super fitter .
bad,"i don`t want come back jacobs for work."
bad,"Its such a political place where there is race preference. If you family works there then it is very easy for you. But when you are a qualified individual, people under you make working miserable because they have reach to the top."
bad,"As a Government contractor, you are totaly unprotected by any laws governing the workplace...The ""least cost vendor"" wins the contract and then makes up the difference by pocketing your hard earned salary and benefits. Being a government contractor should not be a long term career choice for the above multiple reasons."
bad,"It’s a great company"
bad,They dont have direction after bought over companies and end up offer vss to the staff. A lot high lever ranking compare to those lower ranks and the higher ranking doing nothing and the staff have to be dismissed
bad,"Not sure about other Jacobs' sites, but the area i worked at is simply not recommended."
bad,We were hired onto the Jacobs Electronic Proving Grounds (EPG) contract when the EPG contract was transferred from ManTech. The transfer took place during an Network Integration Event and was handled remotely. Once the event was concluded and we returned to home station (JBLM) and all of the travel expenses were completed we were place on Company Convenience Leave (CCL) for thirty days and then were laid off. During the CCL we were not paid and but were still required to pay for benefits.
bad,Structural group (bridge) has minimal competitiveness against other consulting groups in the Boston area. Consistent minimal work load. Structural bridge engineering team has little exposure to complex work and struggle to win projects.
bad,The company only cares about making more money and no concern about the employees. Training is non existent no bonuses raises minimal .  Just a job not a career.
bad,"They commit FRAUD, LIE and discriminate again women! Reserch them! They were a construction company and 70 employees DIED per their negligence! RUN!!!"
bad,No life work balance . Meeting takes all day long and poor planning and no job security with jacobs. Now Jacobs is getting worse with the new management
bad,"They don't keep people for even a week of non-billable hours. They under-estimate the Man-hours for the projects they bid (in Calgary office) and as soon as the Project proceeds, they expect people to work overtime (for the hours actual required versus their assumption of lowest budgetted man-hours they estimated - just to win the orders from the customer) without getting paid for any minute more than their (wrongly estimated) budget of hours."
bad,I was terminated because I fractured my ankle so they came up with some bogus accusations. Now workers comp doesn't want to cover my medical treatment because the adjuster said I injured my ankle in a car accident (even though this is on video).
bad,When I started my apprenticeship I was told from an older veteran “stay away from Jacobs & stay away from PCL” now I see why. After 11 years of not visiting Shell Scotford I’d decided to revisit as my workplace. Need be reminded as a 1st year apprentice I’d never forget my first job & it left a lasting impression on me it was the best. Well not Jacobs sincerely I wish  I never met anyone from there. My advice be prepared to to be the sucker because of your not blowing smoke up somebody you won’t have a job. Let me remind they will let you know real soon that no outsiders are welcome. Forget about brother hood forget about unity that ain’t happening here. If they don’t like you they’ll find a reason to get rid of you. Oh & don’t forget to learn there loto system or flag & tags. But not that it matters if you conduct the flags & tags accordingly and hand them in to your foreman like your supposed too they’ll just lose them. Because they don’t like you. I’ve seen it done to some real stand up guys (brothers if you will). Also they are very tender hearted here so don’t hurt any feelings because they’ll pipeline that he said she said stuff right back to their superiors so look out the cut throat lives here.
bad,The job is good but the company is not. Benefits are not good. The Managers are not reachable. More than 75% of the employees are not satisfied with the company.
bad,No communication but jobs that you don't know about nor were never showed are expected to be done there way but they gave you no drawing or direction to go in.
bad,"It was an unorganized disaster, Upper management was horrible. Safety was not a concern. Poor instruction and expectations. I wont ever work here again"
bad,"Back Stabbing Clicks and terrible management.  Management is a revolving door, new management brings job instability to provide a job positions for their entourage.  Career success depends on who you know and not job performance and experience.  Pay disparity gap huge between men and women."
bad,"Took over contract I was currently on so I just transitioned over to Jacobs.  At first it seemed like it was going to be a great company to work for, was promised open door management, pay for days that the base was closed (i.e. snow days), increases in pay, and promotions.  It turned out to be all a lie.  "
bad,The merger of CH2M and Jacobs is going poorly. Jacobs exercises no control over CH2M offices which run without any real corporate leadership. Some offices are seriously adrift.
bad,"They promise you in the beginning that they want you to move up and get as many credentials as you can, but when you ask to start working towards getting the credentials, they tell you that you can not do that until you've been there for a year, and then they lay you off.  Right before Christmas."
bad,"It started out good. But didn't take long for the favoritism came out and if they like you its great. Otherwise my experience has been that it is ahorrible company, and no room for advancement."
bad,Alvin Project.....Unfair company to work for and pay was low for the amount of work you do. No career advancement and its all about you know and not about the work you can produce. The project superintendent was cutthroat and not a team player.
bad,"Worked over 60 to 70 hours a week overtime pay not paid ended up taking them to court and blowing the whistle through DOL eight other people were denied their hourly wages also was harassed after complaining about hours and wages. lost court case because Jacobs lawyers refused to submit and perjured about  findings by DOL of $70,000 of hour violations Jacob's lawyers destroyed all access key card records all computer login times and emails."
bad,The management at Jacobs is terrible. Their hiring process does not look at any disable people violating law and instead their hiring process automatically rejects overqualified candidates with disabilities.
bad,"If there are is no project(s), you have no job.  Jacobs will not dip into their own pockets to retain good employees.  It's a survival mission.  There is also a lot of nepotism and promotions made to unqualified employees.  Benefits are horrible...only 6 paid holidays per holiday, high deductibles for Medical & Dental benefits, and 401K match is only .50 on the dollar up to 6%.  I do not recommend Jacobs."
bad,"It was a great place to work, however I had to move on because the contract that took over was not competitive with the salary. I look forward to moving to GA and starting a new position and learning new things."
bad,i was bullied and harassed everyday . The boss and his minions would even get my lunch out of the trash to criticize it. I  was made to do unsafe task and made to fear an HR report which did come back as retaliation. I was singled out and made to work a shift so “ no one would have to look at me “ I hated going to work nearly every shift.
bad,Poor Management  Very Disappointing  Manager was so immature and very support of pets in the department.  the place was a nightmare I saw tem fire person after person
bad,Not fun at all to work  poor management poor training getting started is hardest part of the day work culture low ping pong table not at all the morale is very low
bad,This is the most regrettable company I have ever worked for. I hope I never have to go back there. You are just a number and treated that way. company is to big to care in my opinion.
bad,Worst benefits possible.  Does not care about its employees only getting the job done as cheaply as possible.  Only stays in business by buying smaller companies to show growth.
bad,"By this point I was a Lead Field Technician. There was no more room for advancement with this Company. The people I worked with, some had come over from URS thus making the transition easy for me."
bad,"These reviews are for the snack/biscuit factory Jacobs rather than the bailiff company. I'd bet they wouldnt be 5 star listening to all the people in debt calling in. I'd sooner pack biscuits than work for this shower."
bad,Poor work place people not treated very good nasty hard jobs not enough help to do they and the help they have hired don't have a clue to the work being preformed
bad,Poor upper management worse company ever worked for. Loved my job but cut throat management that only care about not having issues instead of trying to help employees and company development.
bad,"stressful, I learned you cannot please everyone, do not take on more work than you can handle, some of the most ignorant managers I've ever worked with, managers without common sense or personable, dealing with managers, most enjoyable part is going on vacation,"
bad,"Jacobs is cut throat and you will only be a number that generates revenue. Once the project is over, you are too regardless of performance. Placing people after projects is done within 30 days of projects ending."
bad,"Management does not allow employees to utilize any of their skills or use their creative side. Supervisor consistently micro manages and is annoying. Impossible to progress or advance within the company. "
bad,"I wish I can say something enjoyable about this place.  Pay is lackluster, management really won't help you out with a problem and there is no opportunity for advancement.  Management will set impossible deadlines to meet.  When the job doesn’t get done on time, it’s always the employees fault.  Management carries on a “greater than thou” attitude.  If you need time off, wait to be complained about it on your return.  The company swears they provide a tuition reimbursement program.  Only problem is they won’t pay for your education – at all.  The company says they have money for training.  Try asking for training and you get yelled at."
bad,"i was liad off after almost 3 years, and they chose to lay me off after only a couple months my daughter was born leaving me with no way to provide for her."
bad,"civil engineer working experience in residential and commercial buildings,and also earth works in site execution, billing,preparing work schedules and sub contractor bills"
bad,Insurance is very very very expensive.They will lie to your face and when they are done with you they will dis-guard you like trash. Tool Room employees do not get raises at all and when you go in there watch your back. Those who appear to be your friend may have ulterior motives especially if they think you want their job. In the last 3 years they have had 3 supervisors and 3 different lead people only because they ratted their bosses out to get their jobs. They ABSOLUTELY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES AT THE KINGSPORT SITE. Safety record is very poor and morale is even worse. do not go to work there.
bad,If you constantly want to be bullied by supervisors then this is the place for you. If you love to work in a stressful and unhealthy environment then this is the place for you. If you want to be treated less than a professional then this is the place for you. The people that actually work for the City of Sandy Springs  are really nice and professional. Jacobs employees at the Sandy Springs Municipal Court are ALWAYS frowned upon because of all the useless DRAMA UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISRESPECTFUL ways only the contracted employees of Jacobs are like this not the city employees! This was truly the WORST Job i have ever had in my life!!! I loved to work with the people outside of Jacobs Judges Solicitors Attorneys but not the Court Staff with Jacobs... The Supervisors ALWAYS KEEP UP DRAMA!!! You cant trust no one there instead of lifting either other up they always find away to bring you down and report you to Jacobs higher up or the actual Court Administrator which favors the supervisors which are messy!! So if you do decide to give this a go then i pray for you! but you have been warned...Its ok if you are trying to get the experience of the court and how it works but its best if you just stay away from Court Services! BEWARE STAY AWAY!!
bad,after the company being both by Jacobs working with  new rules  is very depressing. Working with my own team is the experience that I would treasure as we had fun and enjoyable environment that you want to look forward working the following day.
bad,Jacobs has a habit of making acquisitions and running those companies into the ground. I have seen this happen twice in the same city nearly 20 years apart.
bad,Refinery process engineering design working with a team of various engineering disciplines lead by a Project Manager.  Projects includes complex chemical equipment design and construction.  Company did an excellent job of supporting the team and providing work tools.
bad,Jacobs was very good and nice to their employees.  Always supportive and communicated important issues to employees.  They were very professional and made sure we were aware of our safety on an assignment
bad,"Was sexually harassed in an isolated area on an isolated job. I notified my foreman asap. nothing happened, so I complained. Got transferred, and then got laid off. So I am not happy with this company. Cause working for them and getting sexually harassed can make you loose your job. makes no sense right. horrible experience."
bad,"6 10's"
bad,"Based on poor ethics, and unlawfully making a hostile work environment"
bad,Horrible place to work.  Their description of management is bullying and imitation.
bad,Don't even apply there…. Govt vs Contractors  is like the 1960's all over again
bad,"Co worker are friendly and cooperating with the job assignment."
bad,"Lab Analyst position has been posted for 6 months. Went to interview and the Interviewer was very unprofessional. Possible mental issues. Small laboratory. When I tried to explain why I was on the premises but 20 minutes late trying to find the building. I was immediately interrupted and told "" I don't want to have a conversation on why you were late"". When I was pickup up by interviewer and taken to the building it was like I was talking to a wall. No people skills. After interview was over instead of taking me back to where I was picked up, interviewer took me the equivalent of 50 yard line in parking lot and said I will be interviewing other candidates. The interview did tell me they needed to use some of their vacation before they lost some time.... (Bad picture if you ask me.) Maybe this only happens at the Marietta facility..."
bad,I have never worked in a place where the supervisors are so unprofessional. This company seriously needs some restructure.
bad,"- preparing the materials for meetings"
bad,"This company is the worst. The management is a joke. Never seen so much complete cover ups from management for the ""in crowd"" such as sexual harassment complaints, safety issues, hiring and firing. Currently hoping to leave company ASAP. This place needs complete management wiped out starting with HR dept."
bad,"Horrible Management,Unethical Practices,Unorganized, Racial Favoritism, Broken Promises, Tampers with your paperwork, Liars, the list goes on and on"
bad,"This company is horrible. A coworker and I were told to do a job that we had no experience to do in a chemical plant just because they had no one to do the job. Safety is of no concern. The field management is a joke.(Foreman, General Forman, Superintendent) It truly is amazing how much this company is took advantage of by these people. Safety and Rules only apply to the convenience of the situation."
bad,11 hour work days . I met and worked with people from many different countries.
bad,Non reliable company.
bad,"I worked with this company and hated every minute of it. The project managers, engineers were all rude and complained every single day. The senior staff cannot take responsibility for its own actions and had no problem throwing subordinates ""under the bus"". They were very unfriendly and clique-ish."
bad,In jacobs you are a money sign not a person when the project is finish you get layoff even if is a job available you would not get that job.
bad,Jacobs makes work easy with superior technology and a spirit of cooperative respect.
bad,Overall Rating
bad,"Low pay, no respect for workers.  Management driven by greed at the expense of the workers.  Not a good company for IT workers as they have no concept of compensating workers for advanced education, certifications, ok rare skills."
bad,"Management has no clue how to manage people or resources. "
bad,"You will be laid off so that executives can make their quarterly bonuses, or if your project is completed or if any type acquisition occurs and the culture is very, very corporate, lots of PC games and clicks so be careful!"
bad,"As above, poor working environment, only importance is keeping clients happy, to the detriment of staff well-being. Big corporate feel, not a relaxed place to be."
bad,"Laid off after 2 months. Terrible company to work for.  Benefits were terrible. If you don't mind an insecure place to work and don't mind only working for a couple months, this is your place."
bad,"probably the worst company I've ever worked for, expect to get played like a fiddle and don't expect to get treated like a normal human being. They will constantly ask you to do them favors but the moment you need something from them its a huge issue or they just lay you off. They will also sell you out without thinking twice if there is any dispute between you and the contract holder so expect a lay off if you don't like working unsafe."
bad,"It is a great place to work if you have some friend, or you are relative to some upper level guy."
bad,No value in employees. Will let you go as soon as a higher up's offspring needs a job. Does not value your opinion unless you suck up to to the bosses. You are not allowed to disagree with what the upper management decides.
bad,"Co-worker with a faction of my qualifications made $10,000 more me.  I gave 2 weeks notice to accept a job with another company doing basically the same job at the same location for twice the pay.  They would not give a counter offer to keep me and then hired another new individual for the same pay that I was offered by the new company."
bad,I would not recommend anybody to get a job in the facilities Department. Too many backstabbers working there. Pretend to be your friend but then yet talk about you behind your back.
bad,management seems to need more smokes than to actually do their jobs. and your lucky to get paid on time. was working a shut down and morale was zero everyone just sat in lunch room . full of false hope. they should try hiring guys that have knowledge not a bunch of unticketed yes men
bad,"The accounting department is full of malcontent, underpaid, miserable people, understandably, the work load is nonstop, and the pay is way too low for this volume and pace."
bad,"A great deal of favoritism.  "
bad,Most un-under educated workplace I have ever worked for.  Atmosphere was horrible.  Company lied about bonus structure and all senior-level management thrived in regards to bonuses and raises.  Never apply for a job at this organization.
bad,Horrible Management. Ask unbelievable things of you. Make you eat time. They don't pay their bill on the AMEX card that they give you and then you are stuck paying it! Collection company harassing you. Poor Office support for the field crews. The worst PM I have ever worked with in 35 years!!!
bad,The best people at there jobs that I knew have left. It seemed more about milking the client than serving the client. I had an underqualified and incompetent boss. He was subsequently fired.
bad,"This job wasn't the job for me long term.  Management has it's opportunities for growth.  However, there is really an open door policy."
bad,My experience with Jacobs ASG is very poor at best.  Management was more interested in cutting salaries by low balling their bid.  The employees took the brunt of the Jacobs contract by getting their salaries drastically cut.
bad,In my 4.5 years at the company I had 3 different managers and only one was even proactively involved in developing my skills and furthering my career. Management is not only unresponsive but completely uninterested in anything that doesn't directly benefit or impact them. 
bad,"I work in the operations project in The Villages, FL where there is one manager for every 10 employees. Half the time none of the employees know who to answer to and the other half of the time the managers have different ways of solving the same problem. They try to act like an exceptionally ethical company when it all comes down to the is good ol' boys club. Employees are treated unequally and management is fast to throw employees under the bus. Another issue is that they want to work the hardest working employees to death for minimal wages while rewarding the biggest complainers and laziest employees with higher wages just to shut them up.  "
bad,Very busy days went buy quick
bad,Ch2m Hill used to be a good company to work for. It had a great culture and they cared about the employees. Now it is only about the bottom line and taking away everything that once made this a great place to work.
bad,"Jacobs hires and lays off at a whim.   Upper management acts like they have a culture of safety, but really is all for show.  Fake reports filled out to score ""points"" for identifying safety ""concerns.""  Get hurt and you're fired or laid off.  Skill and dependability don't determine whether you keep your job.  Friends in high places determine whether or not you keep your job...even if you can't do your job."
bad,"We were treated like children. My supervisor had a miserable attitude. She played favorites and she was lazy. Reviews and raises were never done on time. I have never worked at a place like this,  where the management asked around, trying to find out the latest gossip. It had the opportunity to be a good working place, but it was not. The turn over rate was off the charts. The management was very bad about not sticking up for the under dogs in the office. They initiated ganging up on and then excluding employees. I felt like it was beginning to happen to me, and that was a big part of why I left. I am not a fan of the word bully, but that is how management dealt with issues they needed solved. There was a handful of great employees that I enjoyed working with. My job was very easy, just too much and too overwhelming."
bad,Management did not treat employees with respect. I did not enjoying work for this company and I would not recommend this company to anyone else. Do not work here.
bad,Jacobs is a public company based in US and their office in Calgary is managed very poorly. There is no consistency in company policies. There are few gangs who just look after the benefit of their own group. Performance and expertise are the last thing the management look at for any promotion. It all depends who you know.
bad,If you're desperate or between jobs this is the place to be. Promotions are given to who's liked the most they're not earned. Management does what they want for who they want. Extremely unprofessional. No trust. Manager makes promises that he can't keep and make deals under the table. Turnover is horrible but nobody can figure out why. HR is a joke.
bad,Company was just bought out by Jacobs who is outsourcing jobs overseas and laying off people all over US that were CH2M employees. I would not recommend this company as it is all about the bottom line and not the people
bad,This position did not take advantage of the talents I had to offer and the job culture was counter productive. I did the best I could with what was available to be but was happy to leave
bad,No the same company it once was.  Everyday was a fire drill.  Many changes.  Management cannot decide what they want.  They want you to do something but they are unsure what they want you do do.
bad,"Hard work does not cause one to advance at Jacobs.  It's a culture of politics and if you're part of the Good Ole Boy network, you'll fit right in.  Work here only if you're in desperate need of employment, but don't expect any advancement opportunities."
bad,Rigid development protocols. Transitioned from high quality software provider to lowest cost. Management thinks they have implemented agile methodologies but they have not.
bad,Never knew what you were going to be blamed for or threatened to be fired for. Management has no idea how the plant runs. Employees fired without training. Very cut throat environment which affected morale.
bad,"The pay and benefits are good for a normal 40 work week and the OT rate is the normal 1.5 but there is no extra pay for weekends or holidays.  Constantly change shifts in the middle of the work week and last minute notices to work on regular days off. Management is practically non-existent, they are so far removed that I couldn't even pick them out of a lineup. Also, there is absolutely no room for advancement."
bad,"Worst Place to work.  They hire young ""professionals"" who have not idea what they are doing......and then after they have worked there for a year they make them your manager."
bad,I have worked there before at the same site for 2 other crews that was really good to work for. this time I got with the worse bunch on the job site .you can't get nothing you need even if its something to do with safety no matter how many times you ask you just get put off .I may as well took my tools in and be working by myself management dont want to be bothered with having to do nothing unless it benefits them and if you need to check on anything over at the office or go to the tool room good luck with that .can't seem to keep people at all no one seems happy where there at always talking about finding something better.
bad,Jacob was a very good place to work the piping group really worked great with the process group and Civil group everybody worked hand on hand helping each other group out to complete each project.you were always learning from each day you worked there and the management was great to work for the hardest part of the day was leaving to go home in the afternoons at was alway enjoyable being at work...
bad,"This is the absolute worst company I've ever worked for. They do NOT trust their employees, and have no regard for the best ones. As long as you're a warm body, that's all they want. I have over 46 years of construction inspection experience, but that did not matter to them. All they wanted was a scapegoat, to cover for their own mistakes. They track your every move by the phone they give you, so you don't want to make even the tiniest mistake. Believe me, you would rather be a greeter at Walmart, or pick up cans on the side of the road, before you would want to work for them. No, I am not a disgruntled employee, just one that tells the truth. If you are any good at all, look elsewhere for a job."
bad,You must be a pretty girl or a very political guy to survive there. Managers are so unreliable and rude and political. This is not people deserve to be
bad,"Management is weak with no vision."
bad,Horrible....  If you are interested in apply please consider that all money is not good money. Management is the worst I have ever dealt with in over 10  years in the workplace. The pay was great but I lost my mind in that place.  It's a lot of negative energy and favoritism...  One min your in the next your out.  Unprofessional rude ghetto....  Employee beware
bad,"I have been with the company for just over a month, the first thing I can say is that after our safety meeting some guy came in,I think was a manager and told everyone he would like to fire everyone for any error or if you get sick,you are fired,he says it is just business to fire everyone. Real nice welcome. Then they put us with a pipe crew that takes pride in putting people down,telling them they are all stupid. The foreman likes to bully people and can fire you for anything at the drop of a hat,he puts people down on a daily basis. The guy is a drunk who harasses the work force every day because he can,all the guys already want to leave or transfer to another pipe crew, I am so stressed out, I have to take a medication just to cope with the abuse."
bad,Eastman kingsport tn jacobs not good they treat there employees like you are not nothing.. No cares in them what so ever..!! You dont want to work at eastman jacobs..!!
bad,"My direct supervisor exhibited an extremely poor, vendictive, unprofessional management style."
bad,"Working for Jacobs has been my worst job experience. The management structure leaves employees with no one to turn to when they have questions or concerns about the specifics of a project. Communication is lacking at every level. Time/money is wasted on meetings that are not fruitful or relevant to most employees. Groups are isolated and it's hard to work in different groups even if you have a skill set that is suited to multiple groups. Career advancement is nonexistent. Merit increases are cost of living increases, nothing more."
bad,"Sims to be a good company for the first glance. Unfortunately in Portland office, I met strong opposition to racial belonging, put it with other words a "
bad,"Jacob could be a good company to work with, but they need effective leaders who know and can enforce their role and responsibility they all got fire in the end so justice pervailed"
bad,The one star is being generous!!! Did not feel like I was a part of any team. As I was training I felt like I should know everything the first time and if I asked questions after that I was being annoying based on the tone of the answers I got.
bad,Jacobs is a great company.  Poor management and no training in one area doesn't change the company.  I was very disappointed to be misled about this position. Employees don't leave companies.  They leave poor management.
bad,Jacobs aquired my company and then tore down years of work sent us backward in time 5 years and removed vast security and infasturucture from IT. Jacobs can only grow by buying other companies and due to a terrible wall of middle managment many employees are unheard and not represented. I think the CEO has a vision of what he wants the company to be but due to a very poor organizational structure they are light years away from getting there.
bad,Not a good place to work. You are asked to follow people around for harassment even though it is against company policy. It is a good old boy culture.
bad,lack of respect as you will be only seen as a number the management team is uncertain in their direction. Good company if you need a job but keep looking
bad,"JACOBS Jokers and Clowns On Big Shutdowns"
bad,"I worked for 2weeks the company sold 2 times "
bad,"For many years, I was proud to say I was employed by Jacobs. Once Jacobs merged with CH2M, the culture changed drastically and the benefits that we once had with Jacobs were cut in an effort to streamline with CH2M employees. Vacation hours were cut, salaries were reviewed, and employees with specific titles were cut across the board.  Long time Jacobs employees are being replaced with CH employees and management no longer fosters a culture of Caring for employees.  For years the slogan was Employees are our Greatest Asset - that has now been taken off the logo as well."
bad,The management team has a tough time listening to employees.  Management has their way of doing things and it is not dependent on what is correct for the situation.  Compensation and benefits are what the government are willing to pay.  Company willing to do what client asks - regardless if it is in the employees best interest.
bad,Very high turnovers due to low pay bad management and office politics. Many had to drive through the worst traffic to get to the office yet for low pay. I was warned by my friends yet learned first hand of CH2M. Great co workers and met many good friends. Moved on to a closer job with better pay.
bad,It didnt happen to me but I watched as they brought in a new technical services deputy director and he laid off all of the older ex Fluor employees  for no reason and then 2 months later he brought in college graduates to do the same job. When the main hr guy was called in Baton Rouge nothing was done because the two guys were longtime buddies. Sad when age and previous employment gets you laid off. Management is a joke for letting this happen. Upper management makes in excess of 100.00 an hour but cant give the craft workers raises. Culture of caring is a joke also.
bad,"I liked the area of the job, and I liked what I was doing. I had a problem with Management and the fact that they allowed their employees who were not in any position of authority""bully"" other employees.  I didn't like the fact that when software problems arose, management would send you home. They would also tell you to come in to work, then while on your way into work have a co worker call you and tell you not to come in. This happened to me for almost a week. I was not compensated for my time, I turned down other positions. I would not work for this company again, at least not in the Accounts Payable department."
bad,"As a Grad. their is great oppurtunities to Travel."
bad,"Assure quality work and client specifications are being met at Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil field maintenance."
bad,"if you need a job, keep on looking ,do not work for this Jacobs location, if you don't fit with the gang you done, all the new hires do the dirty jobs, the senior electricians do not get dirty."
bad,Lima Ohio used to be the best job ever but then new management and rules. upper management does nothing but look for ways to get good people fired. If you kiss up to upper management you might last a few years. Do not waste your time here as it is headed down the drain fast!!!
bad,"I worked for Jacobs 4 years without a performance review, and when I asked for opportunities for advancement, training, and clarification of my job responsibilities, I was laid off. Current management does not like to be held responsible."
bad,"I had aspirations to work at CH2M Hill for several years because of its global presence. I accepted a contract position, and this gave me an up-front and personal view of what is going on here. One would think (as I did) that with such a large international company, that the management, HR department and ability to grow would be stellar. WRONG! There is NO HR DEPARTMENT. Yes, you read that right. So if you have any issues whatsoever, you have no recourse, no one to listen (unless you consider filling out an email form and hearing back months later listening). This is not a company that you want to jump ship to. Your job is not secure, due to the fact that the people who work here have been there their whole lives, and there is no recourse for the bad management structure. I cannot really speak on the compensation as I was a contract employee and made alot of money, but from conversations with a few employees that have been there for years, it wasn't that great (I was making way more money than them). Also, what I learned about the benefits (as far as health insurance) is disheartening. I also thought, naively, that the benefits would be second to none. NOT TRUE. Unless you are single with no dependents, you will pay out the wazoo and the deductibles are ridiculous no matter who you are! "
bad,"Stay away from this company. Management publicly demeans employees and if you go to HR about it, you can expect retaliation. The company only grows by gobbling up other companies, not by moving technology and practices with the times."
bad,"As a white, heterosexual, Christian female, I felt so uncomfortable and excluded from the company ""Values"" that I resigned. Newcomers definitely have to check certain boxes to have favorite status - thus during the time I was there, I watched several good employees walk out the door."
bad,"I would be honest and open about my experience, but I think it would kill my career."
bad,If they had better people in In the higher office part of the company it would have been a lot better place for employment  they could have been a lot better if only they had more professional office staff in upper management
bad,"The company barely pays. If I was single I probably won't have taken the offer. I would have been living paycheck to paycheck because they first paycheck in a biweekly schedule isn't even enough for rent. There is no room for growth. The company doesn't care about their employees at all.  HR is another issue, No organization at all. "
bad,"repetetive work, horrible management, with no offer of training and little to no chance of a full time position. Not to bad to fill a gap in employment if you are between jobs and they have positions, but career wise wouldn't hold your breath."
bad,Very bad experience  in this company.......... poor engineering team work.............. Bad attitude people especially engineering side people........
bad,"I was not a fan of working for Jacobs Engineering.  I thought the management/culture/etc... in the Baton Rouge Office was terrible.  I would not recommend working for them.  The Culture in the Greenville, SC office was significantly better but ultimately, I left that office to be closer to home."
bad,"Large company, that prefers to promote within social circles rather than on talent alone."
bad,I was hired because of someone I know and my reporting supervisor seemed to be unhappy with his decision.  I was there for the first two weeks without management coming to me to let me know what they were expecting from me as a Team Lead for this position.  I finally has to turn to my team of employees to advise me and train me for the job position that I has just been hired for.
bad,"Leads run the show. If you make a lead mad, they will punish you by switching you off trucks when you should be a driver.  If, you work good, you are by yourself with no help, if you ask for help it makes the leads mad and then they give you a helper, but then you must go help a slacker. Leads will slow down so they do not have to help the ones that are alone. Start time is great, but during the winters you are out till 5-6 for some depends on your # on their favoritism list. Place like this can not keep guys, but do not want to pay the ones who do great. Just another number on the payroll documents. Water side does spy and gets paid to spy on you as you work. No where to move up in the company, a driver is all you will ever be."
bad,"The management is so poor. There is no one masters in business administration here."
bad,"Jacobs claims to be a major E&C firm but behaves more like a huge staffing company.  Not sure this is the case throughout the company or if it is specific to this division.  Company states as a core value ""People are our greatest asset"" but does not actually understand the value of its people."
bad,Don't ever leave and try to go back. The person in charge of the hiring will do whatever they can to make sure you don't get hired even if you are the most qualified candidate for the job.
bad,"Terrible benefits, no sick time.Senior Executive Assistants VERY cliquey. It's far worse than anything I have ever dealt with in middle school. Stay where you are, you don't want to work here!"
bad,Although they speak the corporate speak about safety and security if it cost money then they are not interested
bad,Everyone is worried about their job.  Makes for a bad work environment.  Management tells you what you want to hear.
bad,"worst place I ever worked, the managers are bullies and they hate it if you do not brown nose to them all the time. They use people then throw them away if your manager does not like you."
bad,"Pros: The company is very generous in providing basic facilities, the working time is truly flexible, the company trusts its employees in recording the attendance and overtime. They are very generous and flexible in giving annual vacations. The co-workers are very friendly although they are not able to spend time to train you as they themselves are very busy."
bad,The substation design team here is outstanding. There is one person in charge of getting work that is the worst I've ever experienced. We have little to no work and he turns work down. He also blocks any of the engineers here from using their contacts to get work.
bad,The dysfunction within the Survey department is awful.  People quitting at a rate of 1 per month.  Mid-level managers trying to climb the corporate ladder make life miserable for everyone.  No one trusts the management.
bad,"Very good working conditions, I learned how to use LFM a powerful 3D laser scanning software of existing piping. Used Smart Plan review to check piping."
bad,"Management is completely clueless about what goes on at this company. No one is treated the same across the board, everyone is treated differently based on whether the manager likes them or not. Managers sneak around and talk about you behind your back, they check the badge logs to see when and where you pass through doors, they lie about you on your performance report and there is nothing you can do about it. And they absolutely refuse to listen to anything you have to say. HR is rude, unprofessional, and downright incompetent. IT answers the phone sometimes, but usually it rolls to their voice mail. And forget about getting in touch with them at night or on weekends. They aren't there."
bad,"Poor management, managers did not have people skills, they did not know how to communicate to the employees."
bad,Part time = no work not a great company would never work there as a full time job anybody that thinks this is a career is insane so dont even attempt it
bad,"Great place to work,co -workers were good group to work with,"
bad,"Jacobs sent accounting jobs overseas as a way to increase profit. Lots of people lost their jobs. Feedback from project managers is not positive. A couple of months after the accounting jobs were sent overseas, Jacobs has openings listed for Portland and Corvallis."
bad,"A typical day at work would be somewhat planned according to preventative maintenance scheduled work.  Workers would also be on call for any situation or unscheduled work that came up.  "
bad,"I have never worked worse people in management in my life. It was the most chaotic job I ever had, and the managers just wanted to pass the blame to everyone but themselves. My immediate supervisor was at later stage of his career, and would never question what his manager said because she was signing for all of his expenses IE: Hotel bills, meals etc... I moved 2400 hundred miles on my own dime to take this job under the pretense that this was going to be one big team working together. When I asked for teamwork, I was told if you need help, we don't need you. I cannot say all of CH2M HIIL is this way. Just what I dealt with."
bad,a company only concerned with their advancement. not considering the benefit or satisfaction of their employees.
bad,"Managements have no care at all to the welfare of employees. They are pretending to care but in reality they don't. Don't trust them since all they do is covered their rear. They protected themselves at all cost even with your job. They do not stand up and take responsibility for what they did especially the Project manager. They found someone to blame for their designed failure, and ineffectiveness.   "
bad,Management expects a lot from the employees. You spend more time at work then home. Management unreasonable.
bad,"The first time I worked there I loved it.  I loved the work and the people on my project teams were great.  I would have loved to have stayed until retirement.  I got unexpectedly laid off in Jan 2015.  I went back in May 2017 to same position but to half my salary with no benefits.  It was wonderful to be back working with the staff again.  I was there until Dec 2018.  In June 2018 the Administrative Manager moved to a different role and the position went to another Administrative Assistant who I had worked with previously.  Once she became my Manager she became hard to work with. Jacobs had purchased CH2M the previous year and became integrated into Jacobs in 2018.  I was tasked with assisting their staff with booking their meetings and other general tasks.  It was approximately 4 hours per day which I charged to a non-bill account.  Jacobs staff charge their hours to projects they are working on eg:  Suncor, Nova Chemicals etc.  I was given the non-bill code for this work.  There came a time when they were almost fully integrated and I was only charge 5 - 10 hours per week.  I was told by this Manager I could no longer charge to the code and would have to charge to projects I did not work on.  As this was unethical i refused and the job became very stressful with the result of me being laid off December 21, 2018 even though there was no issues with my work. It got so bad that I went to HR and it was never resolved."
bad,"Very hard company to work for they are fast to fire and lay off personal, no medical insurance and management was fearful to make any decisions for fear of being fired themselves. Military contractor with no accountability!!!"
bad,"Was hired for one thing but was put to doing something totally different that I had no idea of I was doing,then was punished for not knowing what to do! When it sounds to hood to be true,believe it!!"
bad,Worst company to work for. The Management has no skills. They work less and do politics more. Totally Hippocratic.
bad,I was fired by a manager who spent his last week seeing how I would react to being fired. The manager misled everyone and moved to Shell after taking a two week vacation in Florida. 
bad,the biggest plus about the job was that it was close to home and i got to be home every night
bad,"Be careful coming in to this job. It is dangerous. But it pays 3 to 10 dollars less than the other contracters in the areas. Unless you have high up family, the management just sleeps in the office all day you won't see him once. And you are doing too much for the pay. Plus the pay doesn't even make being out there worth it"
bad,"Great pay, work and life balance, very poor job security, poor management, and a very bad job culture. I had a great team but too political at the top with too much focus on individuals climbing the ladder then the whole benefit of the people and the company."
bad,"good teams"
bad,"Learing new things."
bad,I didn't like this place.This place was terrible. this place was terrible. This place was intolerable. Car got broke in. Will never go back. Liquor stores everywhere.
bad,"The company is great, however, a lot of layoffs. No guarantees of Permanent employment. New faces, new project, able to meet new people. Management in certain department was hard to deal with at times."
bad,"A great company and a great place to work. You had plenty of benefits and free parking downtown. It was a fun, friendly place to work. They offered fringe benefits such as, skiing gatherings, baseball tickets & gathering. Pot luck lunches. Just an overall good place to be."
bad,Terrible place to work.  No one wanted a self starter or a person that went out to find their own work.  Very clique-ish workplace.  People were quick to judge.
bad,"hands-down the worst bureaucratic corporation I have ever experienced working for, where employees are coming and going constantly. Projects are subject to management ""analysis paralysis"", to the point of exhaustion, even on small construction projects. No management integrity whatsoever, especially in the so-called Telecommunications Group"
bad,"If you are a hard worker trying to make a difference DO NOT WORK HERE!!!! "
bad,"This company is not making a profit and has not done so for a long time. It laid off lots of good staff this year after they bought Tera Environmental Consultants. They cannot get a foothold in Alberta. There are far better companies to work for than this one. They go on and on about their little yellow book and how you should enjoy working there. They make you work long hours with little or no reward.  The only reason this company is advertising jobs is to try and save face. "
bad,"Overall Rating is a 5"
bad,"I’ve been with the company more than 5 years. They promise promotions, but they talk it up constantly. Then when you ask about it, i“I never promised you that”. Pay is decent, but you are always doing the work of 2-3 people. Never enough compensation-raises are rare. Management focused on other things than their employees. Fake and lying management."
bad,once I start working they are two sides of the warehouse and I'm my side is always very hot making it hard for me to working and have no fans to cool me down
bad,"I worked for CH2Mhill for over 4 years and loved it for the 1st 3 years but than everything changed with Management where there was a lot of Discrimination, Bullying going on where management did not do anything about and later I was the one who suffered and was let go."
bad,"Let go due to a on the job injury, Management didn't want to talk to me. All around bad experience and I've been working for 40 years worst place so far."
bad,"Management, in accounting depts.,  was very unprofessional, micro-managed, very demeaning, workflow expectations were ridiculous!  Treated staff like slaves not employees and verbally abusive!  HORRIBLE!"
bad,"Good company, not much opportunity in legal department when I worked their as contract paralegal."
bad,systems worked well while I was there. they like to pigeon hole you. they give opportunities once you are ready to leave. don't give bonuses. hi cost for benefits.
bad,Just like all the other companies who work in the plant it’s not what you know but who you know. Not recommended to people trying to work their way up
bad,writing reports for military prototype testing. my job includes working in outdoor environments and working with various people and having to manage testing and schedules.
bad,Jacobs purchased the company I worked for 2 years ago and it has been disasterous.  No one feels safe and the morale is the lowest it has ever been.  I used to love coming to work but now I work for managers that have no idea who I am or what I do.
bad,"Contracted through JACOBS and worked onsite at American Honda Motor Co., Inc. This rating is a direct reflection on Honda. The culture is very traditional and results driven, less care about the people. In my experience with working in Inclusion and Diversity, the environment was cold. I did learn a great deal within this dept."
bad,"Always talk about being family oriented and supportive, yet they expect you to do everything that you're asked of--even if it's not a position that you were hired for--without asking any questions or for supporting documentations/regulations."
bad,"The facilities manager ran the team through fear and intimidation. Everyone was stressed and overworked. Employees would come to me upset about something the facilities manager did or said to them because they were scared to talk to that person. One person on the team suffered a stroke due to the stresses put upon them. Another person had a medical condition that when stressed, would cause a flare up. The manager knew of the medical condition. The expectations of the company are extremely high, unachievable without the proper resources. We were not given the proper resources. Everything must be done ""in house"". The whole team lived in constant fear of being fired. The manager did not hesitate to fire someone quickly. I live in ""right to work"" state, so there is no probable cause need to terminate and employee."
bad,"They process people for their project needs. Once done you are on your own to find work. Thus your always looking for the next assignment.  Do not have tools and no training provided."
bad,The culture that the Los Angles office had was not a good fit for me. I have a great work ethic and most places I have had room to advance. Over all I've heard great things about Jacobs
bad,Company changes to much bad leadership from the top down they lead by using scar tactics they cut money and jobs and position and never bat a eye to it poor HR department there hands is tied
bad,"Nothing remarkable about working here.  I was never given anything challenging to do.  They do not want employees who ""rock the boat"".  Stay in your lane and you'll be fine."
bad,Engineering department supervisors hire their friends or people of the same origin country as them. One department in particular only hires same ethnicity as the managers. Why Canadians allow caste system hiring in Canada is beyond me
bad,no thank you...no nononononononononnononoonononononononononnoonononoonnoonononononononononononononononononnononononononononononononononononoonnononononon
bad,"Long hours and great pay, however, 25 percent of the people do 90 percent of the work.  Management doesn't care about people, just their bottom line and filling their bank accounts."
bad,"Was a good company, bad financial management of the company now has led to layoffs without notice. Stock price continues to decline and company freezes ability to sell stock."
bad,My previous company was purchased by Jacobs. Once the transition happened our overhead cost tripled. It became very hard to sell and complete the work for our customer base due to the high overhead cost.
bad,"CH2MHILL is an excellent corporation, great core values and friendly knowledgeable team members in other office locations.  EPC small and large project engagement experience and training opportunities."
bad,"Disloyal Management, only interested in the bottom line to protect bonus structure of management"
bad,Great place to work except being micromanaged. Overworked and little pay.
bad,"There is too much work at this office.  You can work 70 hour weeks and not be caught up."
bad,they sold out! living icon in philly and they sold out for money. management is horrible. they are at least 7 years behind in regards to infrastructure and technology.
bad,"For the pros, the company seems to be stable and profitable. The benefits are also pretty good, but unless you are a manager or engineer, the pay isn't what it should be."
bad,"Training, support and team collaboration are promised but never delivered.  Departing staff are rarely replaced.  The most stressful work environment I have ever encountered."
bad,"My review of working at Jacob's would be that need to Improve on management, expectations, and  training. I feel that they lacked in training because their basically was none they just expected you know how to do everything from the start and were upset when you asked questions. Their management lacked because there was poor communication between them and they treated their employees poorly."
bad,"Its akright Take it easy work at Jacobs if"
bad,"Management could care less about you or your family environment. I tried to help my employees have a good work experience and coming from the military, make sure their work/life balance was considered. I got teamed up against by the other leads. Also, they just kept throwing more employees and work at me with little compensation. Horrible experience and I’d recommend looking elsewhere."
bad,No support from management to provide adequate qualified resources for projects.  No support from management to accurately document cost and schedule impact due to scope changes.
bad,Used to work for an environmental firm that was acquired by Jacobs and things have changed a lot since the merger. Company culture leaves a lot to be desired and office culture is very stiff. Would not recommend for those who like to work with a solid team in person - a lot of work gets done via skype. It has not been easy to identify an upward path for myself in this position or within the company.
bad,"I only received a paycheck from Jacobs.  I was an Owner's Rep. and didn't have any interaction with Jacobs at all other than getting a paycheck, so it is hard for me to rate them.  However, my time being a Jacobs employee, it was reiterated daily that I was a contract employee.  In other words, I was ""less than"", however, I wasn't singled out, all contract employees were treated the same."
bad,"The management is struggling to keep afloat with minimal staff. This puts everyone in a position where the insufficient man power fails to keep equipment properly maintained. Many quick fixes and shady unsafe practices are done behind closed doors just to get by. Management will turn on the project managers/ engineers when things fail or fail to be completed. This place is a sink or swim type work place where you will be thrown into the deep end. "
bad,"Poor company management and planning. Management inexperience and getting their positions not because knowledge or experience but politicks and friendships..."
bad,"Worked first for babtie group then unfortunately Jacobs took over the company around early 2000’s."
bad,"The company is in a state of flux due to the recent acquisition of CH2M Hill and internally, it's a mess. Employees are waiting to hear if they will have jobs in the coming year."
bad,Didn't know the CEO or how they performed.  Upper information poorly disseminated.  Management did not appear to promote job performance issues in a constructive way.  No direction for promotion or much salary increases.
bad,Jacobs has not provided any interaction with their supervision or other Jacobs employees.  I worked at Bayer under contract with Jacobs but had no interaction with Jacobs management or technical employees in six months of employment.
bad,"It was not a good place to work for females. There was a ""good old boy"" feel about the managers. As a woman, it was hard to be taken seriously. There was less emphasis on job performance and more on being ""liked"" by upper management."
bad,Test America likes to keep employee salaries low but they pay a fair amount for overtime. Advancement is possible but difficult. Corporate employees are terrible at communicating with analysts and they absolutely will not give raises every year.
bad,"Typical EPC company in Calgary, similar as Fluor, SNC-Lavalin, Bantrel,  PTO is 4 weeks, no sick days, no vision or dental benefits, no massage or acunpuncture"
bad,"Se trabaja mas allá del horario, sin pago extra ni remplazo por horas de descanso"
bad,I would never work at this place or recommend anyone that I knew to work there. The management was not the best and you were not given the correct training or support you needed for the job.
bad,"I worked at CH for nearly a decade and while CH has a culture of mainly friendly and good people to work with, it is not a good place to advance your career nor is it a good place for a person who values work-life balance. You will receive more and more and assignments and opportunities however, you will not receive pay increases nor advance upward within the organization. Also, work-life balance is non-existent. In fact, drawing a boundary between life and work is looked down upon by peers and management, even despite the fact that work-life balance is something the firm constantly touts. I worked around the clock and all days of the week as did my peers and management. This was the case in different parts of the organization as I worked in several different divisions and functions during my years there. Lastly, and unfortunately, the organization has fallen victim of poor management and leadership during the past decade and the firm finds itself now in financial trouble, floundering without direction, and losing ground against competitors; even execs and leadership seem to be ""jumping ship"". I certainly do hope things will improve for the firm and they will be able to stay afloat."
bad,Managers fosters an unhealthy atmosphere of unethical competition. Branded message is not an accurate depiction of the company.  They do not care about their employees or work-life balance.  They care about sucking clients dry by utilizing the industry's highest rates imaginable.
bad,"if I were to list the pro and cons of this job, the pro would be the hours. That is it. Nothing positive to say about this employer."
bad,"I was not happy with the way this job site was run, at Baytown TX."
bad,"The company has a very phony facade. The processes were for the most part were great as far as planning and idea’s however not very realistic, it was like you were being set up to fail. My supervisor could have used a Supervisor training course as well as learning how to keep confidential information confidential. All in all this was a position of moving targets, what I was told to do today was no longer OK tomorrow. I am glad to be gone from this jeckel and hide management team…"
bad,"work was good. learned a lot from other co-workers not company at all. co-workers were amazing to work with & be around. dealing with upper mangement bs from some bosses over crews all the way up to the top they never gave a rats behinds about you, as long as they covered there own behinds they were happy. working in Eastman & with co workers was good."
bad,"Was hired away from other company with promises of a great professional opportunity. After 3 months there was a management change, he rearranged the department and my position was eliminated."
bad,I was relocated into an office that simply didn't have a position for me and no discussion of options. I was part of a workforce reduction in an office with independent culture. I should have realized why the MOP suggested me renting a place to live. I was in process of being eliminated as soon as I arrived.
bad,I would not recommend this Company. Never ever even learned what their Mission statement was. Did not understand or was briefed about the organizational structure.
bad,its is a poor workplace with bad managment and lack of good leadership alot of poor attitude and it reflects on the work and the work enviornment wouldnt recommend
bad,I was hired on by Jacobs during a contract transition and I was part of what seasoned contractors claim was the worst transition they have been part of.  They kept about 56% of the staff while others left because salaries were slashed.
bad,"Co workers were friendly as was immediate supervisor. Too many stop work issues preventing progress. No job security, always having lay offs. Safe work conditions."
bad,"Co-workers were very clickish.  Small group, but not friendly environment at all. Knowledge wasn't shared within the group.  Management was source of most conflicts pitting employees against each other.  Did not encourage cohesiveness at all."
bad,Large emphasis on building towards shifting employment to work share overseas.  No real emphasis on enterprise solutions - never met a spread sheet that they didn't like.  Culture at the company is very siloed and insular.
bad,"Typical work day starts with team meeting reviewing work assignments. Client meetings and interface with contractors. Job site visits, planning, scheduling, resource balancing and requirements for upcoming work. Dealing with logistics, material, parole and billing issues. Communicating with remotes sites. two offshore platforms, two process facility and one offloading facility."
bad,I have a very poor review of this company.Their needs to be a whole lot better job of what you are supposed to do in the scope of your daily duties. most of the time the management doesn't even know what you are doing. i work at a vast complex. it covers alot of square footage and you cover alot of ground
bad,Management cannot move beyond what worked yesterday.  Status quo is OK and acceptable.  Soon the company will go under due to poor leadership and closed mindedness.
bad,It is like every other contractor in the industry. Work long hours minimum 10 hours a day with hardly any time off. Base pay is based on years of experience as well as verifiable certifications. Along with the set wages other contractors are paying in the area. Some jobs are better than others almost always as bad as the job you left. Typical industrial construction job.
bad,"Very disappointed in this company. When I accepted the position, I was told I would be issued a truck and a computer. Upon arrival I discovered that there would not be a truck and I would share access to a computer with multiple other employees. There was not a way to get to the jobsite each day as the client would not let anyone park a non company vehicle onsite."
bad,"All these reviews are for Jacobs biscuit company and not Jacobs Bailiffs, thus giving incorrect ratings on positions."
bad,"Stay away from this Company. You are better off getting a stable position with another company and not just be a glorified day labor. If the Client will not pay for you, you are gone........"
bad,Jacobs technology only worry about fulltime employees and dose not worry about their part time employees who's being there is the reason for jobs getting done
bad,"I was so excited to start working for Jacobs the week after graduation. I was suppose to go into safety but something happened and I ended up being a flagger for the longest time. In the 4 months I was there, I saw 10 accidents (reportable), safety always just standing around, the supervisors of Jacobs literally not knowing what they were doing, head foremans who seem to not have a care in the world.  Weekly meetings with promises of moving up but never happened, basically just blowing smoke up your rearend. Latino/Latina is the main culture.  If you do not know anyone, you do not get in even if you have multiple degrees.  Other things that happened that I dare not mention."
bad,"The low scores given above are for the Lima Ohio Job only. The management personnel there need a lot of improvement. They have problems keeping people. 4 out of 5 people hired at the same time did not last 6 months. "
bad,"This company had a challenging onboarding process due to various reasons including outsourcing to background screening company, along with four different hiring and onboarding employees all of which were in different states.  Extensive duplication of efforts due to lack of communication among engineers, chemists and staff."
bad,"Like most big companies you're only a number and those who play politics get to stay through the rough times."
bad,"Limited or zero growth opportunities. Favoritism reigns higher than talent."
bad,"Company is quite corporate and not very employee oriented.  "
bad,"A typical day at work is never the same though we are accounting and have same deadlines every month.  "
bad,A typical day of work was to log-on read email of adjustments made to work load and assignments. Execute per given directives which change weekly if not daily. New to Oil & Gas Refinery plants as well as Mining Facilities. Learned the process of both. Co-workers are helpful and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what the management and leads expected because there was no clear communication as it should have been. The most enjoyable part of the Job was getting to use the SP3D tool and interfacing with co-workers.
bad,"I don't know if it's just my branch or the organization at large, but the management across the board is lacking in a multitude of areas. There is a lack of vision, little to no advancement opportunities, little to no on the job training, the corporate culture is one of scarcity and lack whereby people scramble to keep their jobs by doing the minimal amount of work, yet the corporation maintains that they are cultivating a ""Culture of Caring"" which is complete nonsense given their actions toward their employees. Truly the only way to get ahead in this company is to interview elsewhere, period!!!"
bad,"It was difficult to balance work and expectations for this company.  From the moment I started to the day I was laid off, I had little to no assistance from the woman to whom I directly reported.  Despite this, I did manage to find my way and become an integral part of the studio.  I was given a lot of free reign and was able to hone many skills, as well as create a myriad of new ones."
bad,Poor management and professionalism. Long working hours with unpaid overtime. Seriously short of resources. Unhappiness felt across all disciplines.
bad,"Plan on working till you drop, then they will be glad to drop you. Regret spending over ten years working for them. Get everything in writing & keep a copy when it comes to assignment letters. There are 26 loyal employee days a year & they are called pay days..."
bad,"The interface management between clients, Engineering and Procurement is weak in complying with any and all client demands and is not functional related to best practices learned."
bad,-Decent money: brought in as a safety tech. 9 days later was made the manager and given 4% raise a year later
bad,"I left Jacobs because of the IT culture. Speed is valued over Cost and Quality. Morale is very poor. I was able to work from home 100% and the pay is good, however, the flexibility I so cherished was ultimately lost working 70+ hour weeks."
bad,Jacobs as a company doesn't pay their employees at a competitive rate as do other companies. I feel we're treated as tools rather than employees. The turnover rate is high as employees leave for other company's on average make $5 to $10 more doing the same type of work.
bad,The experience I had at CH2M before Jacobs was not good and very hostile. I don't know how it is under the new company as I was no longer working their when it was sold.
bad,This is probably a different company from the one that I worked for (CH2M) several years ago.  I found advancement at CH2M to be difficult despite having completed several successful projects.  Eventually I became a high bill-rate technical person and it became difficult to find work.
bad,"In 2014 I began to split my time between Norcon and CH as we were experiencing large reductions in the workforce due to declines in our profits and big reductions in revenue volume.  For the first couple of years I worked heavily on the Point Thomson project; a major construction contract east of Prudhoe Bay, and managed 15 admin staff.  It was very intense, but the most profitable portion of the company's business by far.  When completed, I advanced to Regional Business Manager and oversaw a dozen people or so.  There was extensive interaction with the corporate office on a weekly, sometimes daily, basis, and considerable analytical review and financial planning.  I also worked very closely with project managers and senior leadership in Anchorage."
bad,My opinion is that management is out for themselves and the employees are there to do the job.  In the end the employees are responsible for their own conditions and enjoyment.
bad,I quit my position at CH2M Hill due to my supervisor changing my job description to make it a requirement for me to have to enter a confined space knowing I'm  claustrophobic.
bad,The hours are great. The work is good to do. Job duties & getting the job done is what we all do.The benefits are great. Jacobs it self is great company to work for. Management at other sites are great. It's just the management at this site that is lacking. Only bad down fall. Everything else is wonderful.
bad,"Your just a number to them.  Your job description, your Managers, ever your work space changes monthly. dont get used to anything.                   .             ."
bad,It all about the company they don’t care about the employees . The company cares only about making money and does care about there employees. You can work until your 62 and have worked there almost 20 years and they will let you go and keep someone who has been there a year just so they not have to pay them as much . NO Loyalty on the company part at all
bad,"Throughout most of my 13+ years as an employee, I enjoyed working there.  I had a few good managers and some exceptional managers.  I was lucky enough to find a mentor who provided a new direction for my career.  I ultimately left the firm because my last project manager pigeon-holed me in an administrative role instead of encouraging me to advance in project controls. My next position outside CH2M Hill provided me a 25% pay increase (project controls) and the next position provided me an additional 25% pay increase (project controls).  I was under-valued and under-paid."
bad,"Management need to give more support the the project managers Workplace culture has suffered in recent years and currently there is no motivation in the Engineering and Drafting Personnel to achieve and surpass previous stds and working to achieve, When deadlines are presented the Culture should be to achieve and bring in the project early, There is no support mechanism and a high turnover of staff personnel from burnout,"
bad,"Cost cutting instead of revenue building in order to appease shareholders and reach the bottom line, Terrible company. US ownership, not really interested in learning Canadian culture, holds the US-centric ideals, and ask silly questions about the amount of snow etc. One manager refused to travel to Toronto until the summer when the climate in his state was much worse."
bad,"Hired on as a construction inspector with misleading information that there were plenty of upcoming projects on the way where job security would not be an issue. 3 months later found out that this was not the case and that no jobs were secured only bid upon. A majority of the employees I was working with had less than 5 years with the company, which revealed a lot about the job security, and one by one were let go within the year with only 2 engineers being retained. In just 11 months I was relieved of my duties because there were no projects to be supplanted until a new project was to begin. Very very disorganized company with bad leadership."
bad,"I have learned a lot working at CH2M Hill, but just not happy with the management, salary and career advancements.  Not being provided with opportunities to advance my career."
bad,"I like my job but the management is whats wrong with this company!! They treat you like kids and look down on you, my job is not that hard i enjoy what i do but being treated like I'm nobidy is not away for a hig company to act!!!! I like the people i work with just the upper management needs to Be changed."
bad,This is not a good company to work for. There is no job security. Everyone fears being laid off each and every day. I would not recommend this company to a friend.
bad,Co-workers are great from all parts of the US. If your in need of quick easy money and don't mind being outdoors in the middle of the desert then this job is right for you. Management is kind of weird with a lot of favoritism.
bad,The company talks a good line about ethics and integrity. CEO held regular meetings with the employees but was not really forth-coming about the timing of the sale of Ch2m.
bad,I enjoyed my time at Jacobs and learned a great deal about the EPC environment. This experience really developed my skills and increased my understanding of the integration of EPC and Operations.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of a morning safety meeting followed by waiting to get you're work permits, once you had those I would watch the crew I was with do they're job with a water hose or fire extinguisher nearby. I would sweep or occasionally pick up garbage in the work area. Being a fire watch you don't really learn a lot besides how to use an extinguisher or hook up a fire hose. Management wasn't great either, I and many other employees had things that we had to do at certain times during our employment that was overlooked by my foreman and couldn't be taken care of for lack of an arranged work rotation. The hardest part of my job was the lack of anything to do and the fact that i wasn't getting any experience toward anything to better myself. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with or close to another fire watch that you could at least talk too."
bad,"The firm cares about the environment and the clients, but is really out of touch with the employees.  This is evident by two reorgs in 3 years, and yet employee comp was not addressed.  Unless you are in the Denver (HQ) bubble, you are a commodity."
bad,Company is very short sided and all major and minor decisions are influenced heavily by their internal accounting team's interpretation of your decisions.  The company lives and dies by the quarter.  This mentality stifles organic growth and hinders sustainable growth by M&A.
bad,Answered multi line phone and work on any other work provided to me. I learned how to do Piping Line-List along with other programs to help sales associates.
bad,"This outfit is run by ex Air Force Sargent's with no background in Facilities Engineering. Miss managed, constantly over budget."
bad,"Management unknowledgeable about their employees typical work duties"
bad,There are a lot of talented professionals that work for Jacobs.  The management takes a hands-off approach.  Lousy job security.  When the project/contract ends you are out of a job.
bad,"Nice job culture, with good people around. They give people option s to explore new ideas. Employee opinion is given great importance."
bad,"I worked as an contract inspector at a local pipe fabrication facility."
bad,"Presently working on a site team working directly with client on a daily basis.  Working with all disciplines, give direction to disciplines."
bad,"Company tries to act like they are good company - worst benefits, management is selfish and unapproachable. Worst handled layoffs - very unprofessional and cold-hearted."
bad,"CH2M HILL was once a small company that grew into a large one very quickly.  Challenges are around every corner, as is customary with such significant growth, for those who are dedicated to the job."
bad,"not a bad company if in the right circumstances, not much for advancement, health insurance is terrible and but hours are good and home work balance is good"
bad,"If you want to find a job that offers experience but no advancement  then this is the place for you to work.  You are promised advancement time after time but when you achieve those goals, you are faced with more steps and ridicule.  There is absolutely no HR department so when you have a concern, you are forced to address them with the exact people that are at the stem of the issues.   You are trained and then thrown under the bus when the training doesn't work for each individual project.  Their benefits are over priced and minimal.  They expect suggestions on improvement and then you are told you are lucky to have a job.  I had high expectations for this company but have been let down every step of the way.  Unless you are friends with the right person, you will not get any further then a Non-Manager position regardless of your performance or ability to out perform.  You are also given yearly reviews that are nothing more than a chance for the mangers to knit pick every little thing. Reviews are setup to have your peers review your performance and after 2 years of receiving outstanding reviews, manager still has every excuse why I am not getting promoted to the next level of my position.   This may sound like a bitter employee but the feeling is mutual among 95% of the employees currently working with the company.  I was told that I don't make myself available enough to the team after committing 60+ hours a week so I took the initiative to go to team members to offer help and then I was told I am not at my desk enough.  This company is a lose lose situation, no matter what"
bad,"buen ambiente laboral, buenas relaciones interpersonales"
bad,"First thing is to do The Pre- Trip, Inspection, making shore every thing in the truck is safe and working and the helpers have their safety gear (PPE) ,after checking with supervisor, we go on the route and pick up according to the day of the week ; Garbage, Recycle or Yard waste; once we are done, I call my supervisor to let him know that I am going to empty the truck, after that, I take my helpers to the office where they sign out and go home and I stay getting fuel and doing a Post-Trip, then, sign out and go home. At this job I learn a lot about safety in the job and about efficient ways to cover routs. I always said we have poor management in this company and they fire one, switch another, hired a new manager, and things were even a lot worst. Discrimination and favoritism are so obvious at this place, some people brake the rules and nothing is done and if it is too obvious, they just get switch to a different department, but others get fire for little things and no second chances. Not being a white person the hardest part of the job was dealing with management . As the most enjoyable part of my job was the relationship I was building up with my customers who did not show any kind discrimination. For the last couple months the job was very stressful ."
bad,My co-workers at Jacobs were amazing. Management on the other hand was very secretive; and withheld information from their teams that would have been benificial for them to know about the projects the were working on. Managers held grudges against employees and showed favortism to other employees.
bad,"The Human Resource Department is horrible. The current HR Manager is managing in a communistic style and delegates her authority to her chosen selectee. It’s appalling to see the favoritism and inappropriate relationship that are being carried on by the HR Manager. The employees have no say and are to conform out of fear of upsetting the HR Manager or their chosen selectee. If the selectee complains or see fit that one of their peers is not meeting her needs, the HR Manager quickly takes action to chastise the employee or up to firing. The worst part is that once again the OGM office is not aware of how things are being managed in their own HR department."
bad,"Jacobs is a publicly traded business beholding to its stock holders. As such its main focus is on the bottom line. Support of and loyalty to employees, long term or short, is non-existant."
bad,"Typical day at work is reacting to whatever fire you must put out first.  Lack of resources, lack of planning and lack of effective management make each day a fire drill rather than allowing staff to spend the required time focusing on projects.  Good old boys club. Firm is only going after engineering projects and not creative or design projects. No bonus structure except for upper management.  No benefits or acknowledgement for working hard - everyone gets the same raise each year.  No reason to excel.  Each department is siloed which creates problems on projects.  It’s just a C grade architectural/engineering firm.  Nothing special about its work.  They pay well which makes up for the benefits, which are greatly lacking.   It’s a job.  Don’t expect anything more."
bad,"They pay well, but that’s the only positive."
bad,"Once the project is completed and handed over that's about it! then your terminated with no benefits or anything.HR's avoid your calls and only pick your call to add misery to the tough time your going through!  Its sad that such management exist in MNC's but again I am sharing my personnel experience. So many new job postings and new hire, but barley consider the existing employee."
bad,Fair wage. Poorly managed. Overreactive to small situations. Slow to provide necessary man power levels.  Training programs should be better managed and a higher priority
bad,"a typical day started at 7 am and finished at 3:30 pm"
bad,The contract was at a stage that there was not enough daily software development to maintain the interest of a senior software developer. Skill sets required were generally antiquated. No modern day web application frameworks in use.
bad,This was an administrative/remote position on Alaska's North Slope. My management team gave me only 2 weeks to learn my new position. I was unsuccessful and was terminated.
bad,"Perfect Team."
bad,Average large scale company. Not much more that I want to say about Jacobs. I shouldn't have to continue saying anymore than I want to say just to move on to the next step with Indeed.
bad,"This is the first job I’ve had that gave me great raises then took them away in 3% and 7% pay cuts Throughout the years."
bad,"I am speaking of Jacobs Telecommunications, not Jacobs as a whole.  I want that to be clear.  "
bad,"Political, bias, racism in terms of work culture."
bad,"People are not the priority, reducing cost is on everyone's mind.  Very insecure management.  They have forgotten that the company is run on the backs of their people.  Bad things happen when companies miss that lesson."
bad,"Jacobs is an Engineering/architectural company.  I worked as an administrator. As such, I was not content and eventually laid off due to lack of work."
bad,"It's a revolving door company. People stay just long enough to find their next jobs. Site supervision blames hourly employees if anything goes wrong. Reviews are typically low, as are pay raises.."
bad,"Constant changes in procedures made it difficult for our group to get our projects to follow. There was a lack of Management support with projects that refused to follow policies & procedures."
bad,Company is in the midst of a transformation and a recent acquisition.  Building a strong network is the key to success.  Collaborating with colleagues and clients is the most rewarding aspect of the work.
bad,"If oil prices are consistent it's a decent job around Coalinga. However, be prepared to switch whatever company hat Chevron prefers to be using at the time."
bad,"Buddy buddy mentality, poor management, top heavy on project services, and increasingly outsourcing most of their work to India. They replacing American workers with India workers via work share, and are getting rid of senior level people in favor on recent college grads. Nice place to work if you want to get up before the chickens, and talk to a bunch of people overseas who you cannot understand."
bad,"Work Culture is poor, no work / life balance. Poisoned environment. No job security. Management does nor care. Very stressful. But, the pay is good. It is our choice."
bad,The workplace is extremely dull because of the lack of vision and outdated attitude of the top management. This of course applies to Kolkata office where I work and not Jacobs India as a whole. What I mentioned above and nepotism particularly for the non performers are the factors driving me to look for a change.
bad,"Hard work, no praise. harder workers who care are ultimately considered dispensable and frankly are the ones who are pushed out."
bad,Your vacation is forced at Christmas.  Health benefits cost as much as something you could buy on your own.  No raises last year either despite the company doing well.
bad,"Working with customers to devise solutions to technical problems"
bad,"New management is replacing old boy network, hopefully will result in better performance and retention. Cost effective changes being made."
bad,I held the Buyer position in Erie PA at GE Transportation for 7 months.  The position has been posted numerous times since.  The working conditions are terrible.  Instead of fixing the problems management chooses to keep hiring people hoping that someone will stay.  If you apply for this position-don't accept anything less than 3 figures.
bad,"Working in the wind tunnels for Jacobs is a great place to start your career in the field of automotive testing. With the quick turnaround of employees due to uncompetitive wages and poor management decisions, the wind tunnels are a great place to rise to the top if you can stick it out. Within 2 years you can build your resume into one that will demand higher wages from competitors with better chances of being direct hire. Jacobs safety culture is over the top and takes shotgun on everything else including productivity."
bad,"CH2M Hill bid for and rec'd the facility operations contract at my data center. Unfortunately, they are NOT AT ALL an operations company. They are a projects company, who was hoping to drum-up some projects by ""already being there"" through operations."
bad,"Jacobs has lost for some time its connection with its people...the foundation of this company. The senior management, not office managers, do not know how to run a company. Their only concern is their own job. How can a company with 66,000 employees not keep large projects in backlog? The local Dallas and FW offices have been struggling to have large projects to keep the sustained troops busy for years. Jacobs at one time had the highest turnover rate (people leaving on their own plus fired) of any A/E firm. "
bad,"I really enjoyed my job at Jacobs as a Test Officer in support of the Special Programs Division.  After working *very* hard almost nonstop for 2 years and being awarded with numerous accolades, I was rewarded by being laid off.  Just goes to show that Jacobs Dugway Team management doesn't believe in hard work; they believe in nepotism.  If you aren't in the ""Good Ol' Boy Club"" or you are a woman in a position of power, you won't stand a chance."
bad,CH2M has huge potential in Oil and Gas. Management needs to listen to the experience in the group.
bad,"Worked im maintenance for a client.Executing work orders.Learned that their philosophy is if you want to get ahead you have to bring out the knives.Favouritism was the order of the day.Management on the site are a bunch of paranoid control freaks who encourage finking and demand blind loyalty.If oyu get injured they treat you like a criminal.They peddle their culture of caring,then break WNB rules regarding incident reporting.Co-workers were ok.Hardest part of job was watching the atmosphere change from let's go to work to ""watch your back"".Most enjoyable part of the job was the physical job itself."
bad,"Started out with the company in a lower position to get my foot into the door in a supposed ""Good company to work for"". The management staff in the southern region will reward you and help you to progress in your career path. The management in the Chicago area will give you NO training, have high expectations....yet never explain them to you prior to your delivery date, and if you are not part of the ""in"" crowd they will out right lie to you. I had concerns about other employees and their motives and was told not to worry about it. Management LIED to me about this, and there was some back door dealings that transpired while I was there.....ETHICAL my behind. I do not believe that when a manager tells you to ""shut up"" and yells at you, that gives them the reason to dicipline you later for speaking up about it. Terrible, I hated going into work because I always had to be looking over my shoulder, instead of doing my job! Left the company, and immediately was making $15K more....they pay you poorly and expect your left leg and right arm."
bad,"CH2M Hill gave me the opportunity to get my career in progress and to be able to live in Denver, Colorado. Over the years the company has focused less on its employees while being an employee owned company. Their goals as a company have changed and do not fit what I am now looking for in a long term employer."
bad,Weak architectural portfolio.The major architectural work that is displayed has been done by the internal group that performs as an Owner's Rep.
bad,10 to 16 Hr. a day
bad,"good working experience, all was good worked on very good big projects, Jacobs was very good company to worked for hopefully get a chance to work again,"
bad,good working on vaious projects. good working with various colleagues. good in attaining completion of projects. good attaining good life style through jobs.
bad,I worked 10 years for Jacobs but was never promoted even though I was given great reviews. Jacobs seem to be interested only in how much money you can generate for them.
bad,Jacobs only goes for the extra large bids because they loose the smaller ones to smaller firms. Poor in-house training for employees. Management not exposed to or afraid to explore latest project delivery methologies.
bad,So much tension in the office after new management took over.  People secretly let go.  Management didn't share information of the office closing. Staff went from 150 to only 30 people. No raises given in three years. The remaining employees were sent to Conshohocken.
bad,Worked very long hours and had too be away from family most of the time. Management wasn't too bad but had extreme expectations for us to complete. They put all of their eggs in one basket and it ended up costing us our jobs.
bad,"Good  place to work & learn related to Detailed Engineering, but lack of Fun loving Culture like too much Work pressure & no relaxation, but got an opportunity to work on Quality of Engineering work."
bad,I was laydoff at Jacobs for what I don't know ? not a good job are place to work management not good benefits are the only thing that's good about the company
bad,"I wasn't given any guidance on what meetings I have to go to, what am I supposed to be learning, schedule conflicts. However my trainer himself was a very good trainer but even he didn't know exactly what I was supposed to be doing."
bad,"Poor staffing, office is to""clicky"" (if you're not in popular group, you don't have a future here)"
bad,"I never met my boss while working.  There were watchers in the office.  Lack of clear communication on company standings, job reviews, and productivity reviews."
bad,This company has helped me grow in my field by providing me with piping leads and co-workers that are easy to work with and enjoyable to be around.
bad,"If you are going to be doing GOVT contracting with JACOBS, move on.  They over promise what they can give and then make their employees do the work of 3 people to compensate.  They have pretty good benefits but I do not see them as a long term position for anything."
bad,Typical day was VERY busy and stressful.  What I learned was patience.  All my co-workers were wonderful.  The hardest part of my job was keeping up with all the changes that could occur in an 8 hour day.
bad,"receive orders,pull orders,ship orders, then finish up day with inventory"
bad,"11 hour days."
bad,Cover Prototype armor vehicle in varying test environments working longs hours in various conditions.  Work site was off-site from company location.  Was self managed.  Work with outstanding co-work and military personal.  Test Vehicles were highy technically  advanced Prototypes.  Getting out test reports out when high amounts of test failures occurred during a given test  period.  Working with the military.
bad,the job was great the people were great just the management did not care about the employee
bad,"Company hired a lot of people that had no knowledge or experience in the field that they were hired for."
bad,"Like all Service companies, Susceptible to the Ups & Downs of the Oil & Gas Industry"
bad,very unstable company in this economy. worked for one month and got laid off due to lack of work.
bad,"alot of management were corrupt, didnt care about no one but there selfs"
bad,"I joined Jacobs as an intern and was given some responsibilities. I was not given training or strong mentorship in my field, which continued for my time there."
bad,"Jacobs is a huge company with great projects.  As a publically traded company, overhead and utilization drive the company with people's careers and objectives a distance third place. Great place to gain experience and build a network. Not a place to grow a career."
bad,"There is high turnover. You can come in with a staffing firm with decent pay, but after 6 months if Jacobs decides to transition you over to them full-time they will give you a very low-ball offer for the market conditions."
bad,"CH2M is a good work/life balance place. However the culture is very exclusive and not open or welcoming new hires. Unless you know somebody inside, it will be too difficult to secure enough work load for yourself."
bad,"Coworkers a pleasure too work with., Management not truthful about job longevity. Working conditions average for chemical plant facility."
bad,"challenging work environment, not very organized, re-org was not done well, the company had no strong direction and zero marketing processes or procedures in place."
bad,"I have been constantly let down by this company whether it's in pay, job experience, mentorship, project execution. This company cares more about the big wigs than the worker bees. I have found lack of training, mentorship, and development for young engineers which is supposed to be the time to do so for young people."
bad,"Its good experience but a grind. Remote area , warm relationships with trades, very disorganized and chaotic leaderhsip"
bad,Working for Jacobs at the Motiva PAR refinery was not difficult. My two weeks consisted of 80 hours and normal job duties for an Admin. Assistant.  I liked to variety of my assignment and liked assisting the managers and team members on a regular basis.  I worked along side of many Motiva employees on a daily basis.  Everyone treated me with utmost respect.
bad,"Through a relentless drive to increase billability senior managers have lost sight of one of the companies key values ""people are our greatest asset"". Insufficient training allowance in terms of both time and cost is resulting in a workforce of reduced competence which has lead to project write-off's and poor technical performance."
bad,"A typical day at work was project related deadlines."
bad,"Jacobs just started a new contract. There's currently no job security. There has been tons of layoffs since I've been employed with the company. There's also no room for advancement, unless you have some outside personal relationship with upper management. So with that being said, apply for  position with Jacobs Technology in Hampton, VA at your own risk."
bad,"I looked after around 80 projects as a Project Accountant, I would have to analyse reports, monitor WIP, issue bills to clients and monitor debts."
bad,Very good company.Very friendly working environment. There is lack of fareness.
bad,"This review is only for the Spartanburg office of CH2M HILL, and specifically the mechanical engineering department."
bad,"Great company to work for, The managment lacks to communicate with the employees. I tried for months to keep my job but was put on convience leave anyway."
bad,"As long as your a big wig it’s all good, and then if you don’t contribute to what they want, higher up or not, you’re gone. They don’t offer any incentive or help for the lower paid people, even if you have dedicated 7 plus years  of your life, sorry for you. Stepping stone and nothing else. It helps you build a hard skin for sure."
bad,"This company did not provide the advancement opportunity or the ability to add needed skills to move on.  If you are looking for a job, this is ok, but if you are looking to get the skills to continue to get promoted, this was not available"
bad,"Company very unstable, outsourced to countries outside of U.S. putting hundreds of employees out of work. Management would overlook issues and never address.  Company recently bought out by another engineering company - more lay offs."
bad,I didn't have any job security and felt that I could've been treated better as not just a human but an employee as well. The hours was flexible but other than that I have nothing else to say about the job.
bad,"No long term potential always struggling for charge numbers, people are nice, budgets are super tight and never carry anyone over, furloughs are current"
bad,"Global corporation that provides engineering design and construction management services to clients all around the world in all industries. My assignments were in construction and commissioning of large industrial facilities with the field services group in Saudi Arabia based in Houston,Texas."
bad,"An great learning curve in my career, being able to work with international co-workers and share working experience and solutions to common construction difficulties."
bad,As sub to Dyncorp International on the logCAP IV program they are very independant of the DI group in regards to the employee interactions.The company itself prospers well in the relationship and the overall direction is clear and easy to interpret. The usual CH2M Hill culture is missing and the overall performance is based on factors you will never control in that part of the world. Having prior knowledge of work in afghanistan helped me to set my expectations and deliver the final product as expected. It was a good time and great experience with a group of people I am friends with still to this day. With it all said and done it has its problems but it was worth the ride.
bad,"Do not have much to say I mostly worked in the field. Management was ok, workplace culture was good. The company also has challenges, career progression is not very clear."
bad,I wouldn't say it's a bad place to work or that the people are bad to work with but if you have any personal issues going on in your life they're not very understanding
bad,conduct daily HSE activities for completion of construction site. Supervisor input is only provide when problems arise or when persistence is provided.
bad,"Very busy work during turnaround."
bad,"It was very stressful to me knowing that I could do something better with my life. In my opinion, Jacobs is for people that don’t have anywhere else to go."
bad,A hostile environment with too many difficult people.  Some of the managers were openly critical of their employees.  Finding assistance on tasks was somewhat non-existent.
bad,"Learned alot, didn't care for the benifits. Manager's were great people to work for, they did their best to get us what we needed. The max vacation time you cold earn wasn't worth staying with them."
bad,"I worked in Prudhoe Bay for CH2 for 8 years.  My coworkers were very knowledgeable and great to work with. I was a lead of a crew and was ""laid off"" mainly because I knew more about safety and the job than mgt. I will miss the job itself and the crew, but not the FBI (Friends, Brothers, and Inlaws) mgt. I hope Karma will prevail."
bad,Monthly forecast and spend reporting for Capital and Maintenance Projects. Jacobs provided no  administrative support during entire employment.
bad,"Perform all Maintenance Mechanic duties. Electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic components as well as robotics and conveyor systems. See resume' for more details."
bad,"Hardest part: dealing with multiple projects and politics in almost each of the projects i had to deal with."
bad,Enjoyed working with staff and assisting others. My job consisted of assisting 4 managers and 40 staff members.  When I started we had a staff of 150.  I very much enjoyed assisting the staff with questions and concerns.
bad,"They brought in a new group of people to manage the PSEP program and they're prejudice against women in the field work. They lowered the pay of everyone after 4 months of everyone being there by 30%, they're ring leaders of the good ol' boys club."
bad,"hot, busy and multiple task work place. you learned somthing new almost every day. they went threw boss men all the time.you work by yourself alot. working by myself."
bad,Was a good place to work before the new contract took over. Management  has some very serious issues.
bad,Interesting Place to work for the last 6 years.
bad,"Project Document Control Administrator , Port Arthur, Jacobs Engineering, Oct 2010 – Feb 2012"
bad,"large company, not much support, to many family friends atmosphere, to buddy buddy, just lack almost everything a large company stands for if you are looking at it from the inside out."
bad,"""Hurry up and wait"" is too often the mentality of the CHPRC workforce. Projects push to meet deadlines that are pressed upon them from upper management, and yet nothing is done with the work in a timely fashion. The culture is stagnant and innovation is frowned upon or usually passed up to ""get the job done now."" In addition, career development for younger professionals is not a priority and Hanford as a whole has found itself in a predicament where an aging workforce is looking to take their ""know-how"" with them or charge a premium to keep them around."
bad,was a real eye opener on a daily life of an office worker.It pushed me to work harder and be more productive in new environments.I manage ranges of task given by our manager.From this i became more sociable and approachable to people.
bad,Antiquated management philosophy. Culturally shark infested.
bad,Felt like I was just an employee number.  Was promised extensive training before I was to be sent to a site during the interview but received none.  Sent to a job site where I was unqualified for the position.  Things never got better from each assignment there after.
bad,"Ich habe gelernt wie es gehen kann wenn gar keine Führung vorhanden. Chaos hat ja auch eine Struktur. Organisation und Strukturen gibt es, aber keine kompetenten und fähigen Führungskräfte, die in der Lage sind, eine schlagkräftige Organisation und leistungsfähige Teams aufzubauen. Das führt zu sehr schlechten Arbeitsergebnissen und ist demotivierend."
bad,Major companies seem to merge and if you are working for upper management and they are fired you will also be fired because of your association with the manager.
bad,"Did not receive proper guidance from supervisor.  Left to accomplish my own daily activity plan without feedback.  While the autonomy was nice, I found myself questioning if I was going in the correct direction."
bad,I  am currently doing voluntary work for sefton O.P.E.R.A.  However I love doing this because it's the best thing I have ever done.  All the girls are very nice to work with.  It is something I enjoy doing.
bad,"They were professional, nice management, employees & working environment. Always was willing to help and checked on you. The working hours was good."
good,Muy mala cultura de trabajo. La gente no se esfuerza mas de lo necesario
good,Uneducated bosses and very dangerous working conditions. Very low pay for the work that you have to do. I would never tell a friend that this is a good place to work.
good,If you're looking for a place without a future this is it you come in every day not knowing if you have a job or not they lay people off all the time without  notice
good,Company expects 70 to 80 hours of work a week for 40 hours of pay.  Company is very lax on safety especially when it comes to employees getting proper rest between shifts.  I have personally worked all 3 shifts in one week.
good,"Ford pays Jacobs a killing for us, Jacobs pays 1/3 of that. They’ll promote idiots and admit they did but do nothing about it. Good stepping stone but no actual career to be found here."
good,"Great people to work with, but with low pay for the type of work. With high turn over rate! I wouldn't recommend them as a work place until they raise the pay higher."
good,"Legacy CH2M Hill was not the company that had been advertised. They were financially in trouble since 2012. Constantly reorganization and changing management so no momentum can get completed or accomplished.  The professional staff are some of the brightest to ever work with. Very Poor Market segment management, with little knowledge and very poor leadership skills. Has the take care of the buddy type system so advancement for average white male is almost zero. Jacobs management seems good and well organized. Not sure that the Legacy CH2M team will survive after year one."
good,"Looking at Jacobs - Cincinnati from a contractor's point of view, it was harsh, very click-ish and management didn't have the ability to keep their employees ( both under contract or regulars ) informed of any changes within the project. I worked for Jacobs - Houston before and never encountered this lack of leadership and professionalism."
good,"I wouldnt recommend anyone to work for this company. They are very unorganized and unprofessional. There are nobenefits for craft workers, so you are basically working for free."
good,"A tipical day at work for me , i sign on a safe work permit the i do a hazzard assessment for the task at hand.most of my co-workers are pleasent ,the hardest part of the job is the commute to work.the most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge of building scaffolding in akward places."
good,"Moving all Shared Services jobs over to Poland and laying off US employees."
good,CH2M HILL is new in SAGD EPCM work and it will still take this company few years to get a solid understanding of the EPCM for SAGD process.
good,"Jacobs works on many different projects.  When work is slow, they tend to downsize by laying off workforce. Compensation talked about at the interview was not the compensation in the actual offer. Very high turnover rate."
good,"Let more employers advance, teach younger employers, help them move up n not just throw them to aside. Coach and instruct employers. Pay more money. Give employers some type of reward!"
good,"KlingStubbins was acquired by Jacobs Engineering. The old company was pretty good - excellent people, good clients, long history of quality projects and excellent products. Jacobs is much larger, but it is not better. The company is going through a lot of upheaval at the upper levels and has not been capable of smooth integration with the companies it acquires."
good,"Money was okay and if you like the hours with no home life it was fine but my role was all work and no time off."
good,"i am lucky they hired me since I had no experience.But this what I have experienced..."
good,"Upper management suck, they would make calls on different things to do and they wouldn't have No clue to whats going on and you try to tell them it's not going to work they wouldn't listen....  After they would do it wrong then they would take your suggestion,  Really........"
good,"Not a great place to work, worlds biggest cul d sac.  They management are not really interested in you but their own well being and advancement.  They are two faced."
good,In the lab they over worked me and paid little attention to my efforts. It felt impossible to advance in this field. There was no good work life balance.
good,"Not a Great company to work for , there are clicks of people who regardless of their ability to do their job continue to keep the job and others have to pick up the slack. After a job assignment is over you have to look for your next job."
good,"Typical day at work included field work such as audit or assessment and office work completing audits and developing programs"
good,Too much turnover on all levels. Work flow is up and down. Rotated through three managers and only worked there for one year. Not a very steady environment.
good,"Very interesting job, proposals, LOI, and contracts.  Busy office"
good,Learn what you can and move on. Hard work and dedication can't overcome favoritism.
good,"Great people in the office I worked.  Manager was had to work with didn't like Ethnic people, ie Mexican's to be specific and didn't like females working that were not white."
good,There was no opportunity for advancement.  The work did not have a challenge.
good,"The restructuring that has taken place after CH2M merged with Jacobs is taking the company in a negative direction as it relates to viewing employees as more human than resources. Upper, middle and lower management levels are disjointed. The drive is to maintain big contracts overlooking the realities and day to day needs of staff members. Complaining to HR and or the various other help lines that are provided by Jacobs is futile and those options that are given to staff members is a company CYA tactic. It seldom yields any positive outcome. I was affiliated with CH for some  decades  and the sharp  change disturbed me enough to leave. It's become a machine."
good,I would not work for Jacobs at that facility again. The Field Quality inspectors was inexperienced. They were not held accountable for their actions in the field when they signed off for unsatisfactory  work.
good,"I would have stayed for the people, but the job itself wasn't for me. Overall, Jacobs is a good place to work, and the benefits are great; however, the main thing that needs to be worked on is sometimes work-life balance, and encouraging upper management to take a break every once in a while."
good,"Hot and cold climates. Fast paced job. Detailed work. Cant be complacent.  Have to stay focused. Your dealing with chemicals that are flammable, toxic and corrosive."
good,"some days would be more work than others but other than that not a bad job. i would either be on bottoms, tops, or driving once a day. just the paying and benefits are not good."
good,"Company OK to work for but, training lacks most people do a fine job.  the staff under a lot of pressure to get the work done by the client.  if you are an engineer maybe it would be a better work place."
good,Jacobs needs to incorporate all entities as one. The segregation of different departments/projects leaves much to be desired by those who don't work major projects at the Rogerdale office. There is a division that does not allow employees in different areas of the company to have full advantage of what Jacobs has to offer
good,"Great opportunity to learn a lot of troubleshooting skills and Cisco commands."
good,"Good people, constant organizational churn, inconsistent brand, lack of career advancement for junior level employees. Opportunities to work on some cool projects but overall the practices are very distinct from one another and impenetrable, and made it difficult to work across business sectors."
good,"Great company to work for, excellent environment , great work- life balance, flexible schedule, great benefits, it has several offices in US and abroad."
good,They will walk all over you and use you for every minute if you LET them.
good,"Work environment is okay. But management hold a grudge. if you quite, they most likely never hire you back regardless of how many years of service you had with them."
good,"Co workers are top notch,skilled Craftsman, management killed any other idea on advancement, always had there picks to move up,and more snakes in the grass,back stabbing sobs, I ever had the pleasure of working with"
good,"There is not a lot a lot of room to move up or advance with positions/departments. Flexible hours with 9/80 schedule (every other Friday off, working 9 hr days)."
good,"Working schedules change depending on what personnel have been tasked to support with only a one to two day notice that at times require supporting night operations. "
good,"The overall leadership at Jacobs is great, but this breaks down once you go lower on the org chart. Mid-level management seems confused, as though they do not receive clear direction or do not agree with the company's strategy. In the Houston office, most people in lower positions seem very disheartened and afraid to lose their jobs. Consequently, people tend to keep their heads down and try to be mediocre to average so as not to bring unwanted attention to themselves. Very depressing office to work in."
good,I did the job that should have had 3 people. No one would listen. Finally I received help in but they replaced me with admin ending their positions on projects.
good,I liked the work and the crew I was on but there is a lot of favoritism . and you cant advance. the work is layed back. they are big on safety. a lot of waiting on material.
good,Very high paced work environment which is wonderful. Not great on family time when you have young babies at home. Job security is up and down depending on projects and the economy.
good,Company with a branch plant mentality and not promoting from within. Singularly focused on profit without motivation to create best financial deal for clients.
good,I loved going to work  every day but some of the people high up did not care about the working man they just wonted more for their pocket. they had to many chiefs in charge a company  like Jacobs don't care we are just a number.
good,Not a fit for me. Corporate environment does not encourage diversification within the workforce. I have far too much experience to be placed in a box and forgotten about.
good,Good place for start up. Worldwide company with a lot of internal opportunities. Culture and management need improvement and coordination. Benefits also needs some tweaking.
good,"Mainly went over our safety hazards, gave a safety tip, stretched and flex. Reviewed our progress then reviewed the schematics to assign personal to existing area or new. report all finding and issues to our immediate supervisor or manager."
good,"somewhat smooth until dealing with management"
good,worked in field as a first job in the oil industry. It was a great stepping stone in getting into the oil field work as other or a lot of the contractors paid more in trade work. over all good company.
good,IT Team worked well together and provided great support to the Maximo implementation and support team.
good,"went to work everyday an it would have lack of materials lack of work."
good,Lots of hours. They dont seem to care if you have a life outside of work.
good,My immediate superiors are good and co-workers are also good but management is not upto the mark.
good,"The work force had little or no bridge experience. It was a teaching and learning experience daily. I learned that it is very important to have positive people skills and patience. Management was easy to work with but not a lot of bridge experience there as well. I enjoyed working with my co-workers , I feel it was a learning experience for them also. The hardest part of the job was trying to get a solid work force. The most enjoyable part of the job was being a part of  teaching a bunch of guys a trade that they can be proud of and grow."
good,"In my opinion, Better managment would make the company much better."
good,Do not work for this company as a Firefighter/Paramedic. The management at ARNOLD AFB. Tullahoma TN. For ATA Starting with the Chief down to the ACO'S who run the shifts are all very limited in their IPC skills. They especially the Chief is prejudice against non retired or ex military personnel. He will stab you in the back like he did the last chief that was there before him.This use to be a place where the localized citizens of Tennessee that have experience in fighting real fires and doing actual EMS calls would be able to go and be employed. You will find allot of ex Air Force retirees in the top positions that have never been to a real fire. This I would take very seriously. The Chief is a nomad implanted from another state that is a legend in his own mind. If you are ever employed ask him how he let a plain burn up on the tarmac at one of his last bases.
good,"A typical day of work consists of complete engineering task such as perform calculations, write a report, assist other engineer for project site and offices. You learn through the different assigned task, they put you in multiple projects. The management doesn't care about your career development, they do not care if you are facing a sick event or other hard event in your live. They only care about productivity and the need of completing work. They do not back you up or help you when off time is needed. I really regret join them last year."
good,"Co-workers where great to work around. Learned allot about slow Live Link. The Management just stinks in this department, very rude, and always looking over your shoulder, snarky, actually feels like your always on egg shells so BEWARE of this stressful environment."
good,The company has no since of identity other than that of services provider to NASA-JSC.
good,Not to bad of a place to work. Treat it as a stepping stone and dont plan to Career it there... not alot of oppertunities for advancement
good,The work was easy. The mgmt was lacking. Organization was poor. I learned that Big Engr Companies were very different than small companies. We worked with floppy disc then and lost a lot of work. Had to wait for replacement disc to redo the dwgs.
good,No team Work. Line manager did not share business information. I had more skills to support the position and business that were not considered. There was non working communication. Workplace culture was good. I felt welcomed in the beginning but not appreciated at the end of the fixed term contract.
good,I loved my job just the expectations were out of reach. Several people had issues with the management team on site. The site was very unorganized and ran by many chiefs and not enough indians.
good,Typical engineering consulting firm.  Very regimented policies and procedures.  Little flexibility and creativity.  There was a pretty big revolving door in  the St. Louis office for awhile and I think it has stabilized more recently.
good,"At a typical day at work, I was very heavily scrutinized. I learned to be sure that any actions taken were justified. I also learned that management would find me at fault for any actions that contractors under my responsibility."
good,"WIll lay you off at the drop of a hat, or they will put someone they like better in your job. They seem to have the buddy system, and if you are not in the click you are the outcast."
good,"Semiconductor industry is boring and gives no room to actually engineer anything. Jacobs does not encourage growth opportunities or desired training. Potential for travel for company is months, or years, at a time. Not a place to be for those who want a family."
good,Jacobs NSS is a basic beltway body shop if you are overhead you have very little value. If your on contract your safe and then they are a good company. The leaders dont communicate and the purchasing of other smaller companies has created an us versus them mentality.
good,"Jacobs was good for the first couple of years, but then started going down hill, due to loss of work and mistakes by CEO,  which lead to"
good,"Great place for your first 7 years, Not so great for your last 10 years. You have value as long as you are billable 100%. You have to find your next project yourself."
good,"Fast pace good experience chance to learn new skills."
good,"alright place to work but not room for advancement unless management seems to like you that day."
good,Challenging work environment for accounting regulated heavily per Federal guidelines. Most co workers were good. Upper management did not share important info and had many changes making more challenges
good,"Work 4 days, 10 hours"
good,"project work is well executed.  probably the best in the business."
good,Jacobs has an excellent leadership team and they are well positioned for a bright future in developing solutions that they can provide to the large portfolio of clients!
good,Not real Project Controls. More like accounting finance.  Management is a do as I say not as I do mentality and culture. No room for advancement. Type of work.
good,The best thing about CH2M is the flexible work schedule. Raises are small for some.  Large for others.  Depending on who you know or how much they like you. It isn't based on performance.  Very little room for advancement.
good,Jacob is large firm with multiple locations worldwide but they operates solo.  Even withing the USA regional office not willing to share the resources and work.  If you don't have work Jacobs effort to keep to billable is zero.
good,"Decent company, very busy when oil price is high, layoffs when oil price is low. Sometimes coworkers do not want to help you learn something new. Because they think you might do it better and they will get laid off."
good,"day at Jacobs "
good,"at first seemed like a good job, as time passed more and more imjuries that lead to doctors visits became present , never knew what to expect from management from day to day. they arent honest with you concerning job changes and layoffs"
good,"Nice place to work if you are young and without dependents."
good,"I've worked a variety of hours in the course of a day, learned a strong work ethnic and communication skills. Worked well with management and elevated.Hardest part of my careers was working in extreme outdoors environments( Bering Sea/ Prudhoe Bay AK.)."
good,"Jacobs has allowed dealing with new Oil & Gas Clients such as ADCO , ADMA , ADGAS and others. i have lead the utilities section to meet Client satisfactions"
good,"I resided and worked in one of the satellite offices. Therefore, I am unable to provide any valuable information of Jacobs culture and management."
good,"While the environment changes from office to office and manager to manager....one truth remains....that you need to be constantly looking for work. Even though it is a company of 60,000 employees with offices both domestic and international....each office still needs to fight for its own P&L..."
good,"I enjoyed this job very much, It was fun, people were friendly and out going. Co-workers were the ones that made this place enjoyable."
good,"Nice work/Life Balance, medium salary rating and minimum possible support from management plus low job security make this company hard to work for in Australia."
good,"My time with VECO/CH2MHILL has been in remote construction within the context of working oneself out of a Job, the pace has been fast. We live at our place of work, family doesn't visit or stay. The work times are between 12 & 18 hours per day as you are generally understaffed because of the shortness in preparedness offered by our clients. The projects are typically 1 to several years in length. On the bright side, there is no holding back; if you wish to learn and do you may and I took advantage of that.  The extremes offered a better reward, however it was easy to go from hero to zero in less than 30 seconds, especially in the materials field.  Everyone depends on what you have coming and of course if something didn't show when expected, that's when the zero fits. Great learning opportunity. ."
good,"Mobile Equipment, Maintain Inventory, Logistic, Site Leadership Team"
good,"this industry has allot of people who have seriously broken families and life styles, It requires allot of travel and lots of time away from family. Jacobs Seems to only care about the bottom line and liability. There is no desire to better their tower techs with proper rope management training and how to tie correct knots."
good,I learned to use Bentley 3D Pro Structures.  The work was interesting.  I thought highly of some of my co-workers; others not so much.
good,no typical day  never knew from one day to next where you were going to be working not good management. co workers were not friendly
good,"Checked documents to be issued against Jacobs Project Information (JPI) cards for conformance, completed Document Distribution Request (DDR) form and Flat Reports and attached to JPI Notification, inspected Scope of Work write-ups to be sure all documents are included in the package, transferred to Document Control, and notified leads and managers to approve"
good,Busy from morning till night - typical EPC company but with usual bck-stabbing by jealous associates that know of only one way to achieve their goals. Did not understand their management style.
good,"Management is of very poor quality. They don't seem to know what they are doing and get promoted for making bad decisions. Many workers do a bad job and the ones that do a good job are treated badly. Work days are long (10 to 12 hours +) and hectic with mandatory over-time - no work-life balance at all. Clients are difficult and demanding with no push-back from management. I learned that doing a good job didn't matter, it's all about who likes you. The one good thing was that many co-workers are nice. Tucson is a small town and everyone is very friendly."
good,I worked on site:
good,"good company but struggle to be in the team, jacobs required a full time on site and independent person to fully in charge at project. i dont have anything to comment since jacobs no longer in malaysia"
good,"I don't have anything to add to my rating. This is a government contractor. Take that as you will. I have learned much from working for a government contractor, but I will not post those lessons here. This is a starred box and I must put in a minimum of 150 characters in here to get to the next section."
good,The Company in a whole did not offer exceptional benefits but was not bad to work for. I worked for a specific government contract that the company had won.
good,"Not in position to offer an opinion as I was based on site."
good,"Jacobs helped me gain necessary skills needed to move forward. While I would have liked to have stayed with the company, moving up can be difficult. But overall, they provide great training and give great opportunities to work with impressive companies."
good,"Strong company but IT is considered a necessary burden rather than maximized as an asset. Advancement is purely up to individuals, management does not set forth clear career paths. Too much bureaucracy causes unnecessary inefficiencies."
good,"The management is very friendly, easy to work for and will let you know what they expect from you. Good pay with good benefits and flexible work hours. They need to work on job security for the employees, but in all a good company to work for. I would work for them again."
good,The crew was good. But the foreman that I work for was not the best . He had it out for crew that were for out of town. And made it not the best place to work.
good,During the economic boom years Jacobs was a great place to work with commitment to employee development and team work. Once the economy in Alberta went south everyone become just a number and only folks with good connections got to keep their jobs.
good,"Hallo,"
good,"Growing company that does great work in the world for clients.  The company is going through change with divestitures and M&A activities.  It is global organization focused on a safety, mental health and inclusion for the employees and building sustainable solutions for its clients."
good,If you were not an Engineer they did not focus on your career path or have training sessions catered to your job function. Only employed as long as there was a project available. They cater to new grads and forget about seasoned or non-new grad individuals.
good,I would show up to work and we would have our meeting to talk about what needed to be done for the day. Go out in the field and get to work. Hardest part of the job was when we had to suit up because the product we were making was hazardous.
good,"Attend tool box meeting and exchange work stat. walk work site location and inspect tools, locate materials, get needed tools. safe out work area. layout,Fitting and Welding."
good,The time spent here was very essential for my development in my career for the most part  I was expected to know how to use cad and make pick ups for designers and engineers
good,The people who work here are wonderful to be around and most are easy to collaborate with on projects.The pace of thing gets out of control often and the hours consistently hover around 60.
good,"They hire you when they need you and get rid of you when they can.  The workshare program is very bad for morale and for the client.  Employee told me that if a building fell down due to incompetence of workshare, it would be the responsbiility of the stamping engineer and Jacobs would be off the hook.  Not a nice place to work."
good,pretty decent start out job but nothing more. no way to advance. favoritism is played pretty big role. after a situation i had i realized they did not care about employees as much as i would have hope. i appreciate the opportunity and they helped me get my feet on the ground but would not work here more than 3 years
good,"Worked down in abandoned communications facility, doing special projects for Down range military assets. Comm by satellite to Afghan/iraq special force customers."
good,Jacobs is a business that is managed by friends and family. The company does.not set guidelines on speaking with vulgarity nor willing to discipline for using it. I had a manager that cursed with the first two minutes of the work day and that createz a hostile environment. It is hard to use this business as a reference because none of the managers follow up.
good,"You are just another nameless, faceless, billable employee.  In fact, you aren't referred to by your name when you have to call IT or Payroll, you are just your employee id."
good,"The site manager had a constant battle with the client, and coworkers. We had a mass exodus of people going to another contractor. I stayed as long as possible."
good,"Because of lack of jobs, employee are required to do different kind of works that is not related to their position."
good,"This company, while being on the Fortune 1000 list, lacks abysmally in employee training especially for its drafting staff. The drafting staff have only internet sites, on-the-job training and YouTube videos to enhance their skills.  Other companies of this size/type, and even most of the smaller ones, offer far more structured training for their new hires.   There is also a significant gap and lack of respect of employee input to the company itself. Employees are encouraged to be a team and yet their opinions are almost totally ignored by those higher than the immediate supervisor.  Women's health care is the same as with most other large companies....non-existent!  It seems that myself, and my co-workers, are there for the money.  I would expected far better from a global-based company such as this."
good,The staff was pretty good at fostering a collaborative work culture with fun activities included. The office environment was relaxed and there were plenty of resources available to staff for individual self-learning of the business.
good,"Laid off after 19 years of service along with an attorney that had 30+ years, management/director with 15 years, collections manager just shy of 20 years and so on...all to be replaced by contract labor and outsourcing to other international offices to save a buck"
good,"Coming from CH2M into Jacobs is quite a culture shock. Curious to see how it goes as much information is still unknown. With such a large acquisition, it will likely be awhile before the dust settles."
good,Lack of communication from upper management on job related information needed to complete the job in a timely manner. Has a large pool of talented employees that excel at there jobs and craft.  Employees tend to get along and help each other with whatever problems arise.
good,"Competitive work place"
good,"CH2M Hill has grown into a very successful international company.  However in the process the average employee cannot be acknowledge for any level of effort or achievement.  Not room for advancement since no one ones know your name.,"
good,"The company is a large, worldwide company.  It has grown much over the years.  It has involvement in many countries around the world, and in many diverse fields."
good,"It's an ok place to work. The people were nice. "
good,"Jacobs world wide is a tremendous company.   As the company transitions to Line of Business orientation, some of the offices have lost their way. What was once ""One Jacobs"", has split into territorial silos that do not communicate well across business lines. This has caused some local offices to loose their client diversity, leading to staff reductions due to lack of work."
good,it was an ok job . The management had issues but they tried to work with you. i wouldn't go back though i would go straight to adm first. i worked a lot of overtime.
good,"Most of the employees in my division were very nice people. The management on the other hand never listened to any of us and did whatever they want and that's the reason the oil and gas division is going to shut down, AGAIN!"
good,"People are great, management does not care to spend money on updating and keeping the company systems up to date. They also lack process for achieving ones work flow."
good,"You can work a 4/10 here which is nice, but that's pretty much the only benefit of working here now. Everyone was so nice and the culture was great 2 years ago, but everyone's stressed and angry all the time now."
good,Not a bad place to work if you want the opportunity to do projects all over the world.  Jacobs provides either a project mangement or technical path as a career.
good,"Good global company, however not much management support for Ohio based employees. More like a temp service for Honda."
good,Layoff likely. Job security an issue. Work being sent to India due to low wages. Quality of work poor from India requiring rework.
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company."
good,I just worked as support for a 6 week outage. The entire team performed in reactive mode instead of being proactive. The work environment was confrontational within the Jacobs team.  It was not a pleasant work experience nor did it measure up to the standards that I had heard of the Jacobs group.
good,Low morale and high turnover after many changes with board members. Great place to learn and move on. Many staff affected by the open floor plan seating.
good,Learned a lot about purchasing and was not able to stay in this group.  The supervisor wanted to move me back to projects and I preferred procurement.
good,"Engineering contract company that provides Engineering, Procurement, Construction services to multiple client types.  A typical work day is spent satisfying client requirements for projects in Mining, Oil & Gas, Food & Beverage, Buildings, Infrastructure."
good,"I worked in a contracted call center, and the only thing that was awful was the management. They were horrible power hungry people who sat around as everyone else did everything for them. The majority of people were brought through a staffing agency and were treated terribly until hired on where they got treated even worse. They constantly acted like you owed them something since they let you stick around. The job was great, easy to do, and fairly flexible, but the people were not easy to work with."
good,Like the people I work with at both locations.  The hours are great and the parking is wonderful.  Jacobs is a big company. :-) :-) :-)
good,Had some good experiences with the company and got to work with some awesome folks.
good,Worked in Edison office.  Nice people technology is very antiquated alot of copy and paste.  No advancement
good,"•	Demonstrated a thorough understanding of Accounts Payable and Procurement and able to interpret P2P (Procure to Pay) process requirements for special projects."
good,"CH2MHILL was a good company as far as promoting teamwork. I learned to excel in operating all types of equipment. It was an outside work environment. We had to work in all types of environment extreme, cold, rain and winds."
good,justification should be done at the employees who are at work by paying to their talent and qualities
good,"I'm working in this firm as a cad technician,Here i'm learned work in micro station, In this company i don;t have good work as per my experience. Management of this organization is very chief level worked.My coworkers are very helpful to me & understandable."
good,Management does not speak about what is wanted. Favortism. Mens club. Women are not invited into the mens club. Senority and wages mean nothing.
good,A typical day involves the testing of bituminous materials. I have learnt about the Environmental aspects and legislation to ISO 14001:2004 standards. Management is ok small laboratory easy to get on with and involved. Co-workers are in the main easy to get of with and have a laugh with. Jobs are un taxing to the mind and the most enjoyable is the environmental side.
good,"I worked for CH2M Hill for nearly 3 years. Then one day I was laid off without an hour's notice. It was a shock. I would recommend if you take a position, be ready for the inevitable. They are concerned with the stock value like any other company. They required over 95% billable hours. If they didn't have enough work, they let people go."
good,good place to work. people were good. just not much work in co.
good,Recently hired as part of a services contract re-compete. My previous employer failed to maintain the contract.
good,"As any other traditional big company. "
good,"Management was poor and lots of miscommunication"
good,"no career advancement"
good,"The branch of Jacobs that I worked with in an industrial plant as a contractor, gave almost no regard for you as an employee, despite going to daily briefings, weekly safety meetings. In the year and a half that I worked at the site, I was never once approached about taking safety courses that the site owner required all contractors to hold. No one in my crew held a forklift ticket, however everyone drove them constantly as they were necessities in our work. A 2 day ""orientation"" where every employee had to complete tests and questionaires based on safety and overall practices, where the safety coordinator would sit in front of you and whoever else had been hired, and tell you what to write down."
good,"When I started at Jacobs it was a great place to work with a great work/life balance.  Since the change in senior management work/life balance has deteriorated and benefits and perks have been reduced; all in the name being more in line with other comparable companies.  I appreciated the people I worked with, but as time went by and the company became more ""corporate"" I felt less appreciated and less support from management."
good,"Having worked in and with several Jacobs' offices, each has a distinct approach to job culture, security, and management. Other than most project reporting and job procedures, there is no unity from one office to the next which is typically guided by the office head. There seems to be no checking guidelines by the primary corporation to insure unity. Some offices are people oriented, others are not; some offer flexible work schedules, others do not; some reward exceptional effort, others do not. There is no bonus structure and salary increases barely meet cost=of-living."
good,"Poor Senior Management - Micro Managed "
good,"Prudhoe is a decent place to start your career but suggest moving along quickly. Companies been sold 3 times in 5 years (CH2M, Jacobs, now Worely in 2019) with no wage increase for 6 straight years. Can visually see management has checked out with an easy come / easy go attitude. Everyone in pure survival mode right now. Recommend staying away from this company or use as a stepping stone to other opportunities where you will be appreciated."
good,My experience there was easy for the most part but no job is secure there and you work outside no matter how hot or cold and they don’t care about the value of a person
good,"great wages, lots of hours. Rhey not worried how you feel, whether you happy or not. get it done. mostly it a seen but not heard type of mentality. from what I saw was all reactionary not much happened proactively. Supervision was okay, the culture created was a kill or be killed type of mind set."
good,"IT management has gone way down hill and the best have left.  Too bad, was a great company in the past.  If they recruit a new IT management team then might improve"
good,"Loved having the option to work remotely and also having a flexible work schedule.  Not sure how things have changed however since the acquisition has been finalized.  Not sure how the environment has changed, but know they just had a change in systems."
good,Management never gave me the opportunity to explain the issues that I have been facing with other employees. I was let go without never hearing my side of the story. Very unfair and unjust situation.
good,decent work but poor management. constant threats of getting rid of employees and unfair disciplinary actions for minor things.  Worked hard and only reason i was moved up was for passing NCCER and only to lowest position available.
good,"Stressful and less job security since new CEO took over.  New software could have improved productivity and efficiency, but was not considered. Need to listen more to what non-management staff have to say - management does not have all the answers or know how best to make decisions without seriously considering staff input."
good,"I met good people at Jacobs, but i can find good people anywhere. Management's only focus was doing everything by the book. Even if it was less efficient or didn't make sense. Highly Micro-managed environment and the morale was very low. After i had been there for a month, there was not a day that went by without a co-worker mentioning to me how much they didn't like their job. I did gain decent experience with the amount of work i had so  it was bittersweet. More bitter than sweet however."
good,"While at CH2M Hill, I worked in the field for 2 years on a bridge construction project.  The work atmosphere was enjoyable, everyone was a team player.  After the bridge construction was complete I moved back to the office, the work atmosphere was very group orientated, like being back in high school."
good,"Be guarded whether you are a local higher or a corporate higher.  I was a ""corporate higher"" being promised all sorts of things by executive management; however local management had their own ""rock stars"" that they were wanting to promote.  Definitely a clash of cultures - local control vs. corporate control."
good,Upper management wasn’t very good but direct supervision was great. The employees were almost always happy. For the amount of responsibility for a warehouse coordinator the pay should have been more.
good,"Lack of honest up front people. Things change according to moods and not job at hand.  Often workers are over looked for their efforts. Has never happened to me personally, but have had to manage many disgruntled workers. Hard to motivate someone whom feels they aren't appreciated, and harder when their lack of work falls on your hands."
good,"Overall acceptable work place, finding the perfect work place any more is like finding a tooth pic in a hay stack, winning the mega millions, or stumbling into the mythical unicorn."
good,Company was great. Went down hill quick and still falling. Not obtaining enough work. Well at least not for legacy CH2M employees. This caused tension in the work enivorment and several people to leave or start to look to leave. People feeling that Jacobs bought CH2M to knock out comp instead of for the employee and sucess rate.
good,"I resent having to fill out a summary of a company that I worked for previously."
good,"Well understood production goals with free coffee. Not overly stressful, but there is no job security. The company is very dependent on contract labor."
good,"Good positive culture, fairly good company to work for, managers on the whole were approachable and professional in their dealings,"
good,"The company is experiencing changes, as a result of the acquisition by Jacobs. After the integration pains, I'm certain it will be a terrific place to work."
good,"Day started early, continue with assignments.  Follow up with superiors - hardest part wag getting everyone delayed to give you the updates to finish files."
good,"I had a poor supervisor, no flexible work schedule. She treated employees differently and not equally.  Pay was too low and did not earn enough vacation days."
good,"Tight deadline in a fast moving environment, never a dull moment.  Love the daily challenges the job offered and the ability to met and excel above expectation. "
good,"I was part of a newer division of CH2M-Hill at the time, facility maintenance.  One of the main worries of management was making sure that our maintenance contract was renewed.  Because of this, priority was given to aesthetics and costs over the employees.  The pay was very low for the area, the benefits were poor (the company stock was not bad though), and the facility I was at was in disrepair."
good,"Excellent projects to experience for career. Good training program, many activities to participate. competitive environment and good location to enjoy many things."
good,"A company of over 75k people operates like a well oiled machine. That is the myth that most people believe when in-fact there is a fair bit of difference between perception and reality. The people who work @ Jacobs understand the culture and the games that are played politically and internally. The people who do the work are, excellent, tried and true intellectuals bent on doing good work. The mgmt team is altogether another story. The people are cows, treated like numbers. This, unfortunately, is to be expected in a large company in America. Excellent benefits, excellent tools used by professionals - managed by robots ready to exterminate those professionals at the dip of stock. Go to work and work hard, financially, you'll be rewarded - until you're no longer needed. Don't bother about loyalty here - it's not reciprocated - but what a place to get some experience."
good,"Jacobs may be a good place to work if you are a direct hire employee, but they seem not to care for temporary contract workers. It is very hard for me to find a direct hire job at my age and experience level. I am sure that their lower management would rather hire younger and less experienced people that are cheaper and easer to integrate into there work culture. I have mostly been contract during my career due to the extreme ups and downs in work loads at the majority of A&E firms like Jacobs. I think it will be very hard for people to work as contractors at Jacobs due to negative attitudes and the great variety of software that a new employee must adapt to in a short period of time."
good,"I was only there a short time, but lots of changes and overhauling. To many changes, critical people removed when they were needed to guide new procurement team that was a year old and very inexperienced."
good,"Ok place to work, can work your own hours to a point, most of the people are easy to work with a few not so much. Not everyone is treated equally, in the firm."
good,If You are required to do something do it it don't be expecting applaud or congratulations after you get it done just look for someone to say it was better ways you could've gotten it done.
good,I actually enjoyed the job. Unfortunately there were a lot of problems with the coworkers and people couldn't just get along. now that I switvhed companys I wish I could go back to Jacobs though
good,"Great values with a strong focus on Ethics and Safety.  Great stock options and good benefits.  "
good,"Good company to work with and to gain experience. "
good,"Overall this is a good company to work for, you are give multiple opportunities to prove your self."
good,"Engineering activities which includes equipment and line sizing, preparation of equipment datasheet. deliverable documents such as equipment lists, tie-in lists and line lists."
good,"they are all about upper brass, they don't care about the worker."
good,"great empowerment and learning exposure, long working hours, a typical day would include diversified experiences, the hardest part is that you would be reporting to more than one area."
good,The day is completely full on from the minute i arrive in the office lots of meetings to attend a s I was looking over 18 projects which were in different stages of maturity
good,"Global company provides opportunity to grow professionally and advance within the company. Professional development is promoted, though supported at a minimum.  Billable time is crucial for any consultancy and often seems paramount at Jacobs.  Self starters excel in this environment."
good,"I worked with some great people there however, it is a big company that's ran like a machine and you can get eaten up and spit out if you aren't careful....actually, even if you are very careful."
good,"I enjoyed working with a lot of good people, challenging and interesting projects.  "
good,"Daily field work throughout NYC, worked on hurricane sandy relief efforts throughout NYC. All the projects were for NYCHA. The scope of the work required was a phase 1 of pre inspection of toxic levels within the crawl spaces under all housing developments. Phase 2 was the complete remediation of pipe ACM and non ACM pipe insulation and soil, all debris was also removed from within the crawlspaces. the pipe insulation was re installed after all the remediation."
good,"Overall I have no issues with JACOBS, They are fair and do all they can to assist employees in being successful. They are very goal oriented and off great benefits and perks."
good,Great place to work at if you need a flexible schedule. Raises are minimal and don't always go with your abilities or hard work.
good,"Good Working atmosphere with Supportive Seniors."
good,Jacobs got me out of California and for that im thankful. I love the work and the industry and look forward to living and working in Texas.
good,This company is constantly laying people off. They have very little growth. My manager was also pretty bad. She doesn't know how to interact with different personalities. She isn't qualified for her position.
good,I was brought on board at Jacobs for a second time as a temp with the promise of being made a permanent employee. After  a year and a month nothing has been set in stone at all!
good,"Jacobs had to lay off 10% of their workforce due to the client's unforeseen budget shortfall.  The five of us let go were the newest members to the team."
good,"Jacobs es una buena empresa, aprendi diversas tareas en diferentes areas."
good,"Jacob's seems to be a midsize IT company.  Because of that they focus on hiring higher quality IT;s for their various positions.  You will be expected to learn your job quickly at this company.  Management isn't very forgiving or understanding here, so you will need to be about your business and try to anticipate what their goals are.  Coworkers here seem to take on a little of the company's business first, people second mentality, but overall they're nice people. I learned remote pc management and basic troubleshooting skills here, as well as the basics of Active Directory.  I Most enjoyable part of the job here was interacting with my customers who'd call into the helpdesk."
good,Entry-level salary levels and responsibilities are good.  The ability to travel and relocate for positions all over the world is a perk.
good,"Very isolated environment, work gets routine, very little challenges. Very conservative work culture. Departments are separate within the company, very difficult to learn about other departments."
good,The revenue strategy of this business is outstanding. The employer is well equipped to understand their role in that the leadership makes no compromises towards their integrity when dealing with extraordinary demanding clients.
good,I have learned a lot about testing and evaluating materials while employeed with Jacobs.  I am greatful to Jacobs because most positions pay very well but when you excel there seems to be no clear path for advancement.
good,fill out paper work. then start job. good work environment.
good,"A typical day at work is pleasant with co-operatve co-workers,Manager & Management."
good,"- Good pay"
good,"Check time sheets to the gate logs, adjust hours accordingly, enter employees time in various systems."
good,"Learned a whole lot about pipe fitting and the rebuilding of pumps, insulation removal and instulation."
good,Primarily good people to work with.  Some of the senior managers do not see things in the same light.
good,"* Happy people to work with"
good,A small business feel where folks are personable. Their motto is people are our greatest asset and you feel like they mean it.
good,Most of the projects were supported fom the corporate office and they have a good Safety culture.
good,"Jacobs is a good company for the most part in my 1 year with them. My biggest issue, is that the schedule takes from a lot from time with family, and even just regular life outside of work. On the positive side having 1 day off in 14, (Specific to our project) Since before Christmas sure does allow for some nice paycheck. "
good,"Decent employer, I've learned a lot about the many various forms of data acquisition to fill out. Management seems to have a very ""good ol boy club"" way of doing things. "
good,"While Jacobs is basically a decent company it is little more than a body shop.  It is the ""client"" that one works for.  Jacobs just handles the billing for your time and your salary."
good,"this was one of my favorite oppertunities, i got to build the biggers crusher in N. America... Also a prototype mill for FMI and Jacobs,"
good,"Typical day included checking of piping drawings, co-workers were fine to work with but management leaves a lot to be desired."
good,"I enjoyed that no day was ever the same, there was never a dull day and there was always something to keep me busy."
good,Efficient. With no new key accounts obtained the department in which I work was downsized considerably.
good,A multi-national company that grows through acquisition. Good group of employees that are fun to work with.
good,"Well there isn't much room for growth and the salary cap is very low for our job...many times we are stuck at work for 16 hours because the planner isn't the greatest, or we just don't have enough people to do the job so it takes longer."
good,"Very stressful environment, job tasks are straight forward but management is overbearing."
good,The company is a really exciting and was fairly respected in its hay day. Relatively recently they started acquiring other companies and seemed to lose focus on their employees. Now it seems they are more profit based and less caring about their clients and employees. I learned a great deal with this company but it has come with a lack of direction and support.
good,Management was always changing and picked favorites. Never really felt secure with the job and always reported to ford bosses. You work along side ford employees who make you do all the annoying work and majority of the work while they make 2x more than you for the same job titles.
good,"I worked with good people, which was a plus. However, development opportunities were limited and communications from upper management inconsistent with the actual work."
good,Jacobs has really done a great job of making new recruits feel valued and find a place. Lots of opportunities to work and serve in various inclusive groups as well.
good,The engineering staff was knowledgeable but some of the managers believe that they are the smartest in the group and this causes a lot of issues. Upper management has to deal with poor managers in a better fashion.
good,"Great team of people to work with, wide range of projects and disciplines. The opportunity to work in a locations worldwide. Flexible work arrangements available."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Jacob's. We had become like family. Unfortunately the accounting and HR work was sent to be done in India so I was laid off.
good,"The company did not function cohesively but offices competed against each other instead of working together. It was like hundreds of small companies, each office was it's own entity."
good,"Experience was not what was promised. Even after 2 years. Corporate culture does not line up with my beliefs. Not a terrible place to work, just doesn't offer me any advancement opportunities."
good,"I worked for Jacobs because I needed a job, and I had just finished my Mechanical Engineering Degree. Unfortunately the lead engineer didn't have time to train me so I got stuck plotting the existing chilled water pipes in the factory for documentation. I got sick of it really fast and quit when I started a graduate program."
good,"Rushed to work,and materials needed are not always available, iv learned how to better read wire blueprints, bend conduit and tubing. In that particular workplace I was truly the minority and many times treated as such by the foremen, yet I still worked my hardest and performed every job and task asked of me. The most enjoyable part would be working with other co-worker that treats me equal and with respect."
good,"Very monotone work environment. Work day was very repetitive and redundant. No room for advancement, and no offers for cross training. No cafeteria, although they did have a ping pong table."
good,Good company some places are better to work for them Louisiana was great places to work form South Carolina wasn't that great all in all good people to work for a good company to work for keep you working if you want to work.
good,"If taken in stride and enjoy 35hr work weeks, freedom of working all over Colorado and don't want or need overtime this could be a good fit. Working for giant companies is not for everyone and sometimes good surveyors can get lost in middle management."
good,"The environment is great, and I loved all the people that I have worked with, however, like any large corporation the corporate offices have a few policies that I didn't agree with, and wish that things would have played out differently."
good,Management sold the company for big profits.  Was an engineering firm that made money.  Turned into a company that happened to do engineering. Now owned by Jacobs Engineering.
good,"Jacobs is an exceptional company to work for, however, with the M&A work that is being done, we are asked to do so much more than humanly possible, with less. Work life balance is nonexistent, and the work volume is all consuming. I am proud to work for a company that does the type of work we are doing, but discouraged at the inappropriate expectations to work 60+ hours a week to get everything complete all while still being behind."
good,Not a bad company to work for. On par with other contractors. Great training and tuition benefits. Company culture is based around safety. Salaries seem fair.
good,"Its an ok place to work but management at this location needs to be better, I think they could have better benefits, and better treatment to employees"
good,"Jacobs Technology Group tries very hard to keep their employees happy.  They have Employee Moral events regularly.  What they don't tell you is, they would prefer to not give you more money at your end of year review.  For me, i worked my behind off for years, made lasting impressions on management on the clients side and on Jacobs side, but when it came time to thank me for all the incredible things I've done, they gave me a bonus check.  Not a raise that could equate to more money at the end of the year.  A check.  Thanks for paying me in peanuts Jacobs."
good,"Jacobs provides a comfortable and safe work environment. The compensation isn't anything to write home about, but the benefits are pretty nice. It's a nice stepping stone to gain experience and reach you ultimate career goals."
good,"I have always enjoyed working for CH2M, we had great management, crew, customers and working relationships based upon great ideas with project delivery excellence.  Now that we have been bought, all the people that made the company work at it's best are now gone."
good,"Jacobs competes for American contracts, however sends a vast percentage of the project work overseas....I don't like this tactic...It takes money out of our own economy."
good,We had a great team. Everyone helped each other. Management per project was great. The hardest part about my job is understanding why they laid me off
good,we were working 10 hrs. on site not including 1 1/2 hr. bus ride in then out and never got payed for it .
good,"I only left because there was no work at the time, I happen to find a new job while on layoff. Manager where willing to work with us, training was given and travel / trip were planned out. Expenses were paid out in time and made easy with direct deposit."
good,"The benefits were good but there too many silos  within the company itself.  No direct supervision that I could ask for help.  The company recently merged with another company and pending status on positions, pay, and benefits."
good,"Overall good company, but a typical day at work was stressful. A lot of office politics and favoritism made it difficult for those who didn't ""play the game."""
good,local construction company athens ohio very easy going good place to work. I had a lot of fun working with the managment and other employees. i would tell my friends to work here.
good,"Hard place to work for and not the best job security out there. Great co-workers though. Dealt with engineers on a daily basics. run conduit, pulled wire, and terminated."
good,"Very large project. 18 oil well pad for Conoco on the North Slope"
good,"Job security is based on project billability.  As work goes up or down, staff fluctuates to match. Jacobs will generally not hold on to you if you are not billable for more than 2 weeks. The pay is good, but best advice....put some away for a rainy day."
good,working at Jacobs was exciting and interesting because you never knew what to expect working on a project. as for any question your pretty much on your own to find your question on the projects which to me was fine that's how we learn.
good,"I've learned safety and control valves, work culture is fair, some disrespectful people in supervision."
good,Jacobs is a company that grows well within the Engineering and Tech sectors. Have not put much emphasis on growing the Industrial Maintenance sectors.
good,"Overall Jacobs is a nice place to work for. Upon accepting the job the management made it sound like it would be "" The American Dream Job'. The management at Jacobs was and still is very poor. They show favoritism towards certain workers and it also seems like you'd move up faster by doing the wrong things. The management and site manager would preach about safety and self imposed rushes, but as soon as the safety meetings are over and production gets behind, all of that goes out of the window. 39 out of 50 of the workers were AWESOME! The other eleven just took up space and still got praised."
good,"Nothing Special, but it is a Job. Been there a little over 11 years and it's just a job. No advancement. Management has their favorites and their little groups."
good,Decent job\ company could have better benefits and treat employees better. Government counter parts are great! Just interested in what else is out there.
good,"The projects I worked on were interesting, but no one helped you find work even in an entry level position. I was hired to work on two projects that never came into fruition so ended up having to work out of state away from family on hazardous projects because that's where I could find work. There is absolutely no work life balance.."
good,"I have been with Jacobs for 10 years and have worked in three different departments.  There is room for advancement and a good mentoring program.  With oil being at such low pricing, it has been hard to get new projects with our clients, therefore job security is uncertain these days."
good,"1. Work is on project basis. Management is inclined to retrench employees if there is little work due to downturn in project awards. "
good,"There were many corporate changes that changed the work environment from the familial team environment, to a more competitive angst ridden environment."
good,"Safety oriented company, ability to learn new jobs, management has open door policy, co-workers are very helpful and courteous, typically work 12+ hours per day 7 days per week for 3 weeks then had 3 weeks off at home"
good,Boring work.  No support from management.  Little collaboration.  Decisions are made in Denver by an ill-informed inner circle.
good,"When the Company has won Project there are lots of opportunities to grow as an engineer."
good,"Wonderful experience with CH2M HILL. Incredible colleagues and a depth of heritage and professionalism. I would stay away from EmployeeConnect careers as there is definitely favoritism in that department, and hard working people are overlooked. Overall incredible place to work."
good,Not  equal opportunity employer. Do not recognize the efforts of the junior engineers. Management is not interested to listen to employees.
good,"Days usually started at 5:00am to make Site by 7:00am, and from there problem solve/supervise any materials or transport issues that may arise and move onto the next Site.  Driving time was about 60% due to the distance between multiple Sites with about 40% spent in the warehouse office."
good,"don't get paid nearly as much as you need to survive in San Jose area."
good,Started as a maintenance welder and then team leader and then to planner. Opportunity is there for advancement.  more good things yet to come
good,"If you are a field staff person such as an inspector, project engineer or a project manager you are not eligible for all of the office holidays that the office personnel are. You have to work M-F, 40+ hours/week. The office staff get to work M-T, 4 nine hour days and a half day on Friday. There is no sick time at Jacobs. This is unfair. I have a boss but we have never met. There is no training offered that the company will pay to send you to. You have to make arrangements for time off from work to go to the training, pay for it yourself and then submit for expense reimbursement. I have never been asked by a manager or supervisor to seek any additional training or certifications other than the CCM through the CMAA though we are asked to work as uncertified MEP inspectors often. Many Jacobs field staff members have been asked and forced to take major pay cuts in the past few years so that Jacobs could remain competitive. This is unfair to the employees who have worked hard to earn their pay raises over the years only to have it all taken back. As long as we are working billable hours on a project, no one seems to care who we are, what our names are or how we are doing unless there is a problem. The culture within Jacobs is very stove piped and their business focus seems to be uncertain at this time."
good,Jscobs is changing with a new CEO on board since August and an acting CEO since December 2015.  We have yet to fully learn and understand the direction the company will take.
good,"Management easy to talk to. Typical day consists of overseeing all office activities, receiving guests. and setting up conference rooms. Loved the ability to where multiple hats but position has not much room for growth."
good,"I found Jacobs as an exciting place to work where I have lots of opportunities to learn and apply my knowledge."
good,Jacobs is one of the big five engineering companies and it is very easy to get lost in a firm that places its primary focus on mega projects that are different than the primarily public infrastructure  focus of the majority of staff in the NYC office.
good,"Senior Management too close to their own careers and goals..self serving..micro-management mentality!"
good,"Huge company with great opportunities, a true culture of caring"
good,"Planning, organising and prioritising your own workload according to client demand.  Difficult due to government legislation changes."
good,good place to work in general. Not enough room for growth in some departments. Work/Life balance nedds improvement.
good,"I clock in,  check for any orders that were printed late for today . Those i finish first. Only if there are no trucks or containers waiting to be loaded. After which i will continue on filling orders for the following day . Consisting of finding , wrapping ,and doing paperwork for each order. At 1pm i will begin to load LTL's or any independent trucks which will arrive up to 4:00. While helping the other workers continue to pick orders or finish full truck orders.Also helping co-workers to find or finish something they don't understand."
good,Jacobs is good place to work but is getting away from detail design in the Lakeland office. Co-workers good to work with. Had 24 yrs. with Jacobs
good,"a day working for Jacobs can be hard."
good,Administrativamente regular. Trato muy bueno. Buena calidad de gente.
good,"Jacobs is quick to hire in anticipation of work and quick to layoff when there is little work. Makes me very uncomfortable about my longevity with the company. "
good,"Overall I would rate CH as 3 star company.  Not the best, not the worst.  Young people have a good opportunity for advancement but will hit a brick wall at some point in their career.  So CH is not a good company for a long term career.  Good stepping stone otherwise.  As far as pay, good for younger employees and not so good for older ones.  Benefits are probably average."
good,"Jacobs was a great company to work for.  When I was a Field Specialist, better know as Building Services Coordinator, my job was very rewarding working with all Employees, contractors and vendors of Jacobs. As a Project Admin the job was just as rewarding but I was moved to a Document Controller. As a Document Controller I learned to work in a very fast paced environment and meet extremely tight deadlines. I was put in more contact with our Exxon clients and enjoyed every moment of it."
good,"Good place to work, gained valuable experience. Would rather work in a Bonus based salary compensation structure ( Pay for Performance)."
good,Widely eclectic group of colleagues with an immense pool of talent.
good,A day involved going to a clients housing replacing there roof and putting on a new one. I learned all the construction method of taking off and old roof and replacing it with a new one. Management were good in that they learned me quite a lot and also showed us how things can go wrong like leaks etc. My co workers were hardworking  and helpful and educational. The job was very labor intensive and off course heights was also difficult at times. The most enjoyable part is that its outdoors and you are in the sunshine plus the views are great.
good,"a global perspective, project pursuit and win oriented, management style B"
good,"They do not like to deal with the ""mom and pop"" businesses that would be beneficial to both their costs and their local economy. They would rather ship to several offices tasks that could be fully completed in one local office. Management are only concerned with their own movement up the corporate ladder and the bottom line. "
good,"- 9 to 5 work"
good,"Interesting technology firm that specializes in aerospace and automotive testing facilities, but can do just about any type of engineering work."
good,Rate company 1 to 10 a 7 same as any other company has its ups and downs under pay
good,"The human relations department needs improvement. Management needs to help their employees out when the customer defaults on the contract on resources and put their employees in a hostile environment,"
good,"Não acrescentou nada no desenvolvimento profissional, pessoal sem qualificação para determinadas funções."
good,"Não acrescentou nada no conhecimento tecnico, impossível prever um plano de carreira."
good,"I enjoyed the work atmosphere there, lots of support and the benefits were normal. I left the job for a substantial increase in salary that Jacobs was unable to match."
good,"Not a bad company but you can tell that it's now publicly traded. There is a huge disconnect between management and teams and very little of the old school mentality survives. The company (CH2M) used to be involved in R&D, used to have a lab, used to get involved with university research. Interns and juniors should make sure that there are existing projects to work on and a mentorship structure (like have a mentor named). At times it can look a little like the Hunger Games for the juniors as they hope to get hours..."
good,"Good Company, good benefits.  Supports great customers within the department of defense and military communities.  Highly recommend for any defense contractors."
good,"Enjoyable for the most part when you understood the direction the team needed to go.  Unfortunately, cutting back on the number of team members created issues."
good,Organized well not enough hours of work management was not open to workers feelings water should be more available and more information concerning chemicals
good,It was an ok place to work. I felt a little bit like a number instead of a person. It is a big company and it makes you feel a little like you are on a deserted island.
good,A lot of management changes often with the right management in place a good company to work for the project and also the client really invest a lot of time ensuring the conditions are safe for the employees
good,Not a bad place to work. Good core values and safety over all. They care about their people. Comprehensive pay rates and over all fairness. Willing to work on employee skills and encourage growth within.
good,"I don’t know much how Jacobs, I was there when it was CH2M. It was a struggle to juggle your clients interests and the companies interests. I worked for the public works/operations side and I noticed early on that there was a disconnect between the company and the client."
good,It’s a decent company to work for.get overtime and a good schedule.it is a little bit of a far drive from home is the one bad thing about it.the lack of security is a negative and the insurance isn’t that good
good,"It was a good place to work.  When you are dealing with oil and gas, it is good when the oil prices are high.  When the oil prices are low, they lay people off quickly."
good,"Hardest part of job was job location. D&D tasks were interesting at times."
good,"It a generally a good place to work, but I would not recommend developing Architect and designers, it's not a place to develop your craft. company leadership has a strong and clear direction for the company, office-level management does not."
good,"The people I worked with were pleasant but the controls in place at the client location made the job resistant to change. The client's requirements were so stringent, the easiest of integrations were impossible and when things were scheduled for improvement, I was told it was on a 3 year timetable (contracts were a single year)"
good,"Generate PR campaigns as well as media relations strategies"
good,"I have never worked for jacobs so there should be an option for me and other to pass this review section.  Therefore this is a huge flaw on indeeds part for not having this option.  I worked for ch2mhill prior to it being purchased by jacobs, so my review is not applicable whatsoever."
good,"Working with the government customer is difficult but they (Jacobs) are working toward creating change. Things do seem chaotic, though, not just in the government leadership but in Jacobs as well."
good,CH2M Hill (now Jacobs) has challenges to overcome that stem from a disconnected and authoritative corporate structure.  The billable timekeeping approach interferes with performance of roles that should be overhead.
good,"was a fast pace high hours job involving grueling schedule.was a one big job deal which at the end everyone was laid off (typical).Made some nice checks but at the expense of alot of time, energy, and time away from my family.all apart of the trade though"
good,"okay place have very imbalanced management. I enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere, and I actually enjoyed going to work each morning. I felt that the leadership team was great too. They knew all of their employees on a first name basis and tried to make those personal connections. I also enjoyed the fact that the office tried to do community outreach with local organizations."
good,"Typical Gov. contractor. This is a DoD contractor position. Just trying to fill butts in seat contract. No real commitment to employees. "
good,"The reason why I left the company was that they were shutting down their operations and they were not able to pay salaries to the employees."
good,"Selling off a division to Worley before fully recovered from acquisition of CH2M in the same year, has had negative impact on morale, performance and Customer perception."
good,Times could get stressful but all in all very well managed company. Alot of work performed is all manual labor in facilities that deal with grain production
good,It was a good job when i was there good company to work for looking forward to working for there company again in time on another good job like it was when i was there
good,"I was on a high profile federal job that Jacobs was construction manager for.  The job was a great opportunity.  However, Jacobs as a company lacked a lot.  Upper management showed little interest in retaining talented employees.  Little was offered to employees in terms of flexible scheduling, programs, wellness benefits."
good,"The company itself is a great company, however, some of the lower level management should not be in managerial positions. Hands off approach by upper management and a lot of nepotism."
good,They have their good and bad points like any other company. Just don't judge an overall company by the project you are on. They all work about the same.
good,over see welding pipe fitting weld mapping piping systems new construction I made sure my crew fooled and up held all safety guideline and the osha guideline
good,"as I was employed for Jacobs I did various tasks , working in the warehouse as a material handler,which allowed me to receive equipment,tools and all types of safety gear which I hade to perfporm inventory on a daily bassis,i also operated all types of vehicles like trucks,vans on and off the work site"
good,"Jacobs NSS describes itself as the best kept secret in DC.  But keeping yourself a secret while doing BD is counter.  doesn't work.  Did not work."
good,Good company.  Benefits are just OK.  Company pushes a sound safety culture and does invest in its people.  Overemphasizes financial over the client relationship issues.
good,The Project Manager was Bi Polar it seemed at some times. Very underpaid for the work performed. Very stressfull. Expected too much from a understaffed work crew
good,"Typical Government contract, however it did not treat all of its employees equally. If you were not part of the good old boys system then you were not treated the same. When you tried to complain then you were treated unfairly."
good,"Jacobs may be a good company to work for if they hired capable low level management.  Unfortunately, the employees on the government site do not have a voice."
good,"felt like a family business, on a large scale, when it was ch2m hill. Now as JACOBS, more corporate and let people go who'd been there for easily over a decade...sad and all for the bottom line."
good,I worked in Jacobs after CH2M Hill was acquired and things were changing constantly. For me it's hard to judge Jacobs and CH2M Hill no longer exists. For what I hear  Jacobs is a a company focused in results and you can do well if you perform.
good,"More communication, needs more attention with co worker ,people need to work in pair than work by himself, Safety  problem, one person always  get hurt by them self wor alone in da field always  occurred,  miss use of tools another  factor of injury!"
good,"Working 3D modeling using tekla, putting connection by applying design drawing. I've learned new techniques & strategy on how thw work become easy. The hardest part is when the plan have no enough information, you are waiting for the instruction which delaying your work. Waiting for the next project. But the most enjoyable part is when the time you and your co-worker are working as a team, the work become smooth and easily finish within the given period of time."
good,"Flexible working pattern, required to cover a 40hrs during the week. Allocated sufficient desk space. London is  small office, not much space to chill out over lunch. Office layout to be improved. "
good,It is a multi-disciplinaries well stablish company work on wide range of projects. It is not a bad company to work. They have some long-term program for their graduates.
good,Hardest part was the commute because it was in down town Tampa. The people I got to work with were great and all believed in what we were doing. Left the job for education but miss it!
good,Good to work here particularly at on-site work.  Always like to work on NASA projects.  Lot of experience as dynamics engineer.  Loads review and test plan review were great.
good,"Not a bad place to work, needed no structure and better management."
good,"I enjoyed working at Jacobs but did not stay with the company long enough to critic it. However I, the only major concern was the job security. You never know when is your last day."
good,Jacobs is one of the larges engineering companies in the world. I was there for a short time - at the time they went through a large restructuring of operations.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo durante el primer período de la empresa.
good,"Good company"
good,"For an entry level position, it is a good location to put the senior design courses to the test. Do not expect longevity or job security at this position."
good,"As most consulting companies - things change. The company today has totally different contracts and management than it did when I was employed there, so not much useful information here."
good,"Outside of the lack of career advancement and the opportunity to learn from the ground up in said discipline, it is a good company to work for. Management can be understanding of special circumstances and are flexible."
good,Jacobs is a good place to work if you don't mind being away from home for long periods of time. The people you work with for the most part are good to work with.
good,"management was very difficult to work with. I will never work with anyone like that. Belittled and bashed around, considered many times to speak to HR."
good,I really don't have much to say about working here because I don't remember much about it. We are getting pretty far back into my past careers. I wish I could help more.
good,"Variety of jobs, NCCER qualifications only. Training is supported each year by testing at the TASC. Once passed, continue to work. Rain outs are typical each year."
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced.  I mean work and very little time to be social.  Employees are nice, although not the most friendly.  "
good,"I had good exposure to process engineering, process design, project management, procurement, construction management, maintenance and manufacturing processes. "
good,"It is fun to work with colleagues that are friends as well. jacobs hires great people. "
good,Good engineering company with good basic salary and benefits. Very project driven and goal oriented company. Good client focus and responsiveness to client requirements.
good,"Started off Great..... Ended poorly.  Management was incredible at the start, but after new Management came on-board, things went south.  I guess that is the way things are run."
good,"Wonderful Location. Easy public transportation. Management weak."
good,There is a lot of freedom to do what you want if you are getting the job done.  There are slow days and there are some overwhelming days.  I would like if there was more consistency.
good,Good company to work for. It pays the bills. The staff there are friendly and cooperate with each other. It is a predominately engineering and architectural environment.
good,"Jacobs is a great company of many opportunities and training but could use a new management team in and out in the field. Above all, I had to fight for the corrections on my pay for 3 months, I kept getting passed around for promotion due to Nepotism or gender, but my work and career experience there taught me a lot and allowed me to become very savvy on employee rights, management,  and regulations in the Industrial world.  Thank for the opportunity Jacobs!"
good,This job is just like any other. Do what you are supposed to and you will succeed.Come to work on time. Make sure you have all your equipment ready and all your safety gear in order.
good,They laid me off. Bean counters without any knowledge of what I did for the company. After departure project was without proper support. The decision was made while my supervisor was on vacation.
good,"Jacobs kept me working for a very long time and I would still be there if the pay and benefits were better. All in all it wasn't bad though. The leadership was decent, lots of overtime."
good,Management was easy to communicate with. Enjoyed working with co-workers. Decent pay. Lots of hours. Company vehicles maintained well. Plenty of opportunities to advance.
good,Huge focus on safety. Not a bad job and the management was great and the workers were very knowledgeable and experienced. There was lots of room for growth.
good,"Liked the work/job, but there was no advancement in the company. No room for raises. There were often layoffs which left many people stressed and scared for their jobs. The management was great, and the coworkers were great to work with."
good,I enjoyed learning about certain types of electrical drawings and how to interpret certain parts. The co-workers were very nice and easy to get a long with.
good,Working at Jacobs is a fast pace position. The management was pretty fair for the most part.  The hardest part of the job would be communication.  The most enjoyable part was working with my co workers.
good,"The manager does not have a degree does not take advice on area's where he is weak, take work maters personal and retaliates."
good,"Jacobs has it's fingers in quite a few different business areas, so it's hard to review the company as a whole. I was an engineer contracted by Jacobs to work in defense applications, so my primary office location was on a military base with few (if any) other representation from the company. "
good,"it was fine, I didn't mind working for them  they paid me when they were supposed to  what more do you want in an employer  besides that I don't have much to say"
good,"I was seconded to the Marathon Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, TX where there are thousands of pressure vessels at the refinery, so there was always plenty to do."
good,"good work/life balance as on shift "
good,"The company has its ups and downs just as any company does. The schedule was nice but once the job was done, we were laid off. More job security would be nice."
good,"Just moved corporate office to Dallas, fast-passed environment, nice office design, culture changing with the new CEO, company has half day Fridays which is attractive."
good,"Lots of opportunity to grow and learn, was lead of projects, learned lots of new CAD software. was able ti be help interview people, Over all good experience."
good,just an ok place to work. crew is a good crew to work with for the most part. Scheduling uncertain and shifts change constantly making it al little challenging to plan time off.
good,It is a nice place to work. Nice salary pack. Nice working culture.But for the beginner level employees it is not good place to work. Learning new things has some difficulty.
good,"Smart people working there, but working on NASA contracted position related to goverment spending is horrible..................................................."
good,"75% of a typical day was fairly enjoyable.  Once you get the Jacobs systems down, most days were ok.  The most stressful things that you encounter is never knowing if you are secure in your position (which is typical for this industry)."
good,"Management still requires adjustment."
good,"Jacobs had some big engineering projects, but once the projects dried up, it was feast or famine and you didn't know if you had a job the next day. Would not recommend if you value stability."
good,"When they had projects everything went well. People were happy. Prejudicial treatment was very prevalent, not so much towards me, but I observed it towards others."
good,Alaska has just started the major effects of the last recession. Alaska is usually 12-18 months behind what happens in the states as far an economy ( good and bad). Seeing what is available out there in case the cuts get to me we've lost at least 150 out of my direct group. And we're told there's more to come
good,Ok place to work. Known for hiring low skilled/low paid resources and hiring heavily experienced people to supervise. Bad ratio of experienced to non experienced people.
good,"Joined the company as a Project Procurement Officer for the Nalco Project, a EPCM project for the chemical plant in Jurong Island. Involved in the procurement of mechanical equipment such as Reactors, Pressure vessels (Carbon steel and Stainless steel material), API Tanks (Carbon Steel and Stainless Steel), Centrifugal Pumps package, Air Compressors, Agitators, Flare package, Cooling Tower, etc."
good,Supervision was so so. My immediate supervision wasn't knowledgeable at all. The work hours were good but the pay was low. Great group of guys I worked with.
good,"It's an ok place to work. If all you're looking for is a job then it'll do.  Mostly the company seems to be mismanaged however, with management only wanting to appease those that are above them instead of working with their employees to resolve actual issues that likely will benefit the company."
good,"Good company to work for with good salary's and ability to transfer between different offices.  Get to work often with people from different offices and take assignments in other countries.  Work ranges from transportation, petrochemical, airport design and urban planning."
good,great professional environment but had long hours and challenging tasks   was good being in the city centre of london. management were great  help in the growth of my job
good,Just like any other job it was work had good days had its bad the managment was okay some of the workers was excellent to work around all around I enjoyed my time there and would go back when called
good,Everything was great with the company for the first 3 years until upper level shake-ups and the 3rd name change in 5 years... Benefits were good as was pay. Very cliquish and a lot of favoritism happening.
good,"With the exception of that one project lead, Who had no business in that  position, (this might be called nepotism).working at Jacobs was OK. Would consider working there again, not under that person."
good,"Jacobs is a great place to learn business at a fast pace and receive compensation with yearly bonuses based on your performance review.  The job can be difficult for a new graduate but if you get placed with a great boss, that is a win!"
good,"Grande companhia com ótimos profissionais, possui espaço no mercado."
good,"Spent four years as a compliance auditor for Jacobs Engineering.  Management was easy to get along with.  The job itself was easy, but became monontanous after a while.  No advancement opportunities within the Oak Ridge, TN office.  Jacobs is a large company with a decent company culture."
good,Overseen safety aspects of various jobs throughout plant. Loaded CL2 railcars to DOT regulations. Recordkeeping for the shipments/loads. Communicated with operations to coordinate upcoming shipments.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you are doing something to better the environment.  Close relationships with clients and vendors makes the working atmosphere pleasant.
good,"Work environment is good"
good,"normal work day"
good,"CH2M job work and life balance is a fabulous.  Management is flexible with work schedules, can work from home if needed. I feel as though CH2M overpays in section job sectors and underpays in others. I thought my job was secure, but after all of the massive lay off's nothing is secure. Advancement in my department was obsolete. Unfortunately the job culture was not that diverse.  There are worse companies in America to work for."
good,"Productive and safe workplace"
good,"Strong company to work for in the industry, well respected.  They had a few PM's that were not qualified and had poor management skills (micromanaged) to a frustrating level, but client was great to work with."
good,"It goes well when there are enough project work.  As you get assigned to projects and billed to clients, always stressful when moving between projects."
good,"This is a good company to work but currently there is no work and a lots of layoffs are happening. "
good,Fun place to work. Enjoyed it. Had a good time working there. Enjoyed the environment and setup they had. Good management. Good co workers.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when I have the information and parts available for the maintenance team to get the job done. It gives me a sense of satisfaction.
good,this is a position to establish experience in the desire field you are interested in and also stable position. Than once gain and have grasp full knowledge go somewhere that will pay you better for your skill set.
good,"Great home office management .support for field staff. As a previous employee I was happy to return. As this type of work is project based, it eventually comes to an end and in this current work environment no future opportunities are available with this company"
good,"Talented people. Good location.  Decent benefits, good work out facilities.  Good work life balance opportunities.  A lot of duplicate effort among the company.  A lot of manual processes for such a large company."
good,OK company. Work life balance OK. Compensation and benefits OK. Job Security and advancement OK. Management OK. Job culture OK. Overall it is an OK company.
good,"Our Client is the City of Norwalk and we specialize in Wastewater Operations. I love that my job at CH2M/City of Norwalk is very laid but never boring.  I handle things such as Loss Claims, Accounts Payable, Office Management and everything in between.  That is the beauty of a small office."
good,Fast pace job but safety always came first. learned different processes. good co workers. Management played favorites.
good,Still very much a boys club..  A day at work is very stressful knowing if you are going to get laid off or not.  Hardest part of the day was working with people that should not be there because being there is when senior management wont deal with HR issues properly.
good,"Jacobs has good management and employee focus, however they are losing work. The world of DoD contracting is a small business world at the moment. Jacobs is doing what they can to retain work."
good,"average company, not all leaders in Jacobs Middle East share the same mindset of the company's mission statement which is ""people are our greatest asset""."
good,"If you want a long-term career with a company, don't work for Jacobs. The upper management has little loyalty to employees. My immediate supervisor was great, but the middle to upper management at Jacobs is lousy."
good,"My co workers were hard working people and I admired their knowledge."
good,"CH2M Company is ok only some people in our discipline is not good."
good,The company I worked for was taken over by Jacobs shortly after the take over our office was closed in Cirencester so I was made redundant.
good,A professional services company with talented employees who are very committed to providing excellent services to the clients. Family oriented company which gives employees more time with their families through time flexibility. Provides us with an inclusive environment and meaningful work through which we can make lasting contributions as we develop and grow our careers.
good,"Worked at a on-site location."
good,"It was a nice company to work with. Friendly atmosphere. "
good,"CH2M HILL has had it's ups and downs over the past couple of years, but so have most organizations.  Overall it is a fair place to work."
good,The workplace is a mild workplace. Everyone is pretty much to their selves. Management needs more help on treating the employees equally.
good,"I check email, get job assignments, get to the floor and do my inspections for the day.  Get back to my office and take care of my paperwork and check my email be fore I go home."
good,"No existe mucha oportunidad para capacitación y crecimiento, se mantiene un buen ambiente de trabajo, otorga muy buenas prestaciones de trabajo. No hay prácticamente nada de apertura para nuevas ideas, no siempre hay buen liderazgo. Mucho por mejorar."
good,The work culture is negative and unhelpful to new members of the team. Good benefits and work-life balance. Growing business but a behind the times computer accounting system.
good,"It was and okay job for the time , but i think management could have been better and leave room to grow with the company. i also think if other skills was learned give a person a chance to advance with the company."
good,"there were not opportunities to go further unless you were a male employee, Our supervisors would cross the line such as throwing clip boards, disclosing person information to others and when HR got involved nothing ever changed. We worked very hard and had positive feed back from Plant supervisors but our Jacobs supervisors treated us like children. Excellent job just not the Jacobs supervisors."
good,"Typical day included answering phones, direct one on one meeting with customers and filing. Working with field staff and other management teams. Good company to work for."
good,"At first my job duties were to Spot and Flag Heavy Equip, Motor vehicles, and Trucks. Then I was Moved to Help out in the Warehouse, then later I was Moved to The Electronic Scale House. Which I where I stayed for the duration of my job. I would Weigh in Trucks coming in with loads then I would Weigh them going Out. Later on I would calculate loads coming in and out. Making sure it was less of a hassle when they got pulled over by DOT. The only issue I had was with my Direct Supervisor. He couldn't come to me with problems or with anything else that was going on. He would direct his issues with my co-workers. I didn't care for his work ethic."
good,Great place to work with supportive management. Provide opportunities to grow into new roles and take on challenges.  Great colleagues
good,"Based in the South Brisbane office my role specifically covered  Corporate reception duties, Customer Service and Administration support for approx 700 staff members, management and more importantly first impression to our client base."
good,"High energy and very professional engineering company."
good,Not a bad place to work but the pace is not as fast as I would like.  Leadership tries but too much interference from the corporate leaders.
good,"Originally was a fun place to work with company sports, happy hours and time off, which promoted a good work/life balance.  There was support and growth opportunities.  "
good,"Watching and controlling of equipment/systems by watching gauges, dials and other indicators to make sure a particular machine was working correctly, feeding biscuits into machinery whilst also maintaining a fast pace."
good,"I consider myself lucky. I was one of the few designers that was actually doing detailed engineering, as most of the design work was being sent out to the Mumbai office."
good,"working with Jacobs was definitely an experience, had a good time working with the company working at high heights and connecting, bolting up and shaking out iron."
good,Jacobs is a great place to work. The environment is friendly and my manager is the best boss ever. Because Jacobs is a global co. traveling and paperwork is cumbersome.
good,I started working there as a technician and in the end was still a CAD Tech. There was no opportunity for growth in the telecom branch. People were very nice and always helpful.
good,"great co-workers, no benefits. not a typical 9 to 5. lots of work. if you enjoy traveling as part of your work and there is lots of chances for that."
good,"its a simple co...as its a consultancy job pressure fluctuates,co-wrkers are quite indifferent...managent are nice one but we dont require this top level as for teams are small"
good,Calgary office is a good environment to work in but local economy has caused a slowdown at the Calgary office.  This resulted in massive reduction of staff.
good,"Jacobs Engineering is a run of the mill construction company. Many of the problems that they have are standard to the construction industry, that said they do run a safe job site."
good,"The work was interesting and I enjoyed the day to day activies.  As a government contractor, there was little room for any career advancement. The division between government employees and government contractors was weird."
good,"I was in the maintenance department,and was able to work independent and able to make some  off my own designs,and decisions,Worked with several hard workers,and enjoyed them."
good,"Because I am located at a customer site, there is very little contact with the Jacob's office.  I do not feel as if I am an employee of Jacob's.  Annual reviews are performed by my direct Jacob's supervisor located at the customer site, but annual increases are controlled by the management in the Jacob's office with total disregard to input provided by supervisor.  My overall experience has been less than expected from a company the size of Jacob's."
good,"Good site condition work was traditional industrial construction"
good,This is a great first time job for any HR associate. If you are looking for a place to get your foot in the door this is the place to be.
good,"Met a lot of good friends and learned a lot from many different crafts. the management was very poor an set poor examples as leaders,"
good,"i was called based on the recommendation of a friend for an interview. Was interviewed seperatelly by two. The first one asked, to my opinion, too many private question and the second one was very professional and confident. I did not like that Jacobs is not taking responsibility for their people in bad time with an attitude "" we are not the shelter"". I believe for a good company and stable society , it it important to keep good people coz they supported the company in good times, but in bad times, they are not good enough."
good,"Great experience working there, gives you the opportunity to learn different ways to accomplish the mission. Would prefer it to anyone who enjoys working shift work."
good,Good place to work. Saw a lot of neat things you cant see anywhere else. The mechanics there were top notch. You get to work on windtunnels
good,"it was some of the best  times of my career. I worked with some good people there. We built a good team"
good,Management has no clear picture of where the company is going.
good,I typically spent 60% of my day in meetings and performing damage control with our clients. I spent the balance of the day supporting engineering and construction teams in their work efforts. Management is often under qualified and lack focus. My co-workers and subordinates were typically good to work with. The hardest part of the job was playing the politics and not focusing on providing good value and quality to our clients. The best part of the job was being home with my family and the excellent compensation.
good,"Jacobs inherited the existing maintenance employees, and utilized this advantage very well to initially impress the customer. However when some employees showed signs of being non productive, and had issues with absenteeism and  illegal time swaping, management changed  working time schedules and affected the entire workforce instead of making and example of the employees who were actually comitting the infractions."
good,"I leaned a big deal in this company regarding pipeline and piping. I am doing alignment sheet using civil 3d. I am happy working in this company, however our project almost done"
good,Jacobs Engineering is a great place to work at and learn from due to the variety of projects that they are rewarded from time to time.  The quality and professionalism of the my colleagues and other employees I interfaced with was very satisfying and motivating.  There is certainly plenty of room for advancement and even travel to many parts of the world if you are so inclined.  Hardest part of my position was locating certain individuals when I needed to gather important project related information mostly with clients.  The most enjoyable was working with my colleagues and how unselfishly helpful they were to me at a time of need.
good,"I put together bid tabs, reviewed bid tabs, did material takeoffs, made sure all material made it to site per schedule. checked invoicing"
good,This was a large project and Jacobs gets points for getting it where it was with what they had to work with. I did get the impression that it was more about head count than actually getting the job done.
good,overall good company just need more pay. good safety culture
good,"Responsible for making corrections to drawings, and ensuring that they meet company and drafting standards. Worked mainly with AutoCAD 2011, AutoCAD Design Review 2011, and MicroSoft Office."
good,Loved working for Jacobs.  The opportunities and support of upper management to the project team was always visable and evident.
good,"Busy, busy, busy, and the days flew by. I made several great friends. Learned lots and lots. I really enjoyed working on this project."
good,good place to work and you feel like the job has a positive impact on the environment.
good,"A lot of opportunity to learn new things, many different departments and types of people. Hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult people during times when material is needed immediately. It always works out though."
good,Great large corporation to work in if you are looking for a stable work environment. Can be frustrating at times as you become labeled by your initial skillset and pigeonholed into a very specific job position.
good,"- Perfect balance of work and life"
good,"Enjoyed working with co-workers, location not the greatest."
good,"Everyday i would give a safety meeting on what ever we would be doing for that day. Offer training and insight to what we would be tackling. Then i would disperse the men and women to there work areas. Do spa job saftey awareness forms that authorized the men to work in those areas. Do timesheets. Handle blue stake meetings. Preplan out work for scheduling. take quanities of materials removed and installed. I would also do lift plans for rigging. Go to meetings. Train personnel on Jacobs HSE policies as well as certify operators."
good,"This position is away from home, staying in camp. Continued to learn the ins and outs of construction scope from initial installation  to commissioning for all disciplines while developing and maintaining an integrated schedule for all contractors."
good,"-political environment. "
good,company is not as under proper leadership.They over work there employees. although they treat there workers with respect.
good,Managed several contract administrators and subcontract managers for oil and gas clients.
good,Did not appreciate being forced to take a week of my vacation time (which I had not accumulated) at Christmas. A little notice would have been nice in order to accumulate some time. As it was we were notified of this at Thanksgiving. My PTO went into the negative and was hard to build it back up to positive hours. We had no choice in the matter. No consideration to employees at all.
good,Every morning we have safety meeting then exercise.I learned lot of welding works through my co-worker who are certified welders they are friendly and give us apprentice a technique in welding. The hardest part of my job was when I was assigned in night shift it was so cold and lot of wild animals around us that makes me scared.The job in heights in the building makes me set my mind to be always think for my safety and for others too.
good,"I have worked with CH2MHILL off and on since 1989. Mostly I have been involved in cleanroom manufacturing design and data center design. I am experienced in performing Lead Architect role, acting as Code Consultant and Project Manager role. "
good,The overall goal is the best part of working for this company.  It's all about helping the soldiers in theater.
good,Average government job. Busy work envronment. Lost job due to decress in funding.
good,"work on walls to prep concrete pours, how to build buildings. how to prep concrete walls, none, i got along with all my co work they taught me a lot of new ways to work faster., long days in the hot sun, the team work the positive attitude"
good,"Overall rating - Average"
good,I can't say that the company itself wasn't a good one but just the people that worked there.
good,"I learned more on this job, than I have in the last 5 years.  The Work was demanding, but rewarding, the Supervisors and Foreman were very proficient in their craft, and willing to teach others.  The physical labor was hard, but the environment was safe and help always available."
good,"This company used to be known as VECO, but was taken over by CH2M Hill.  CH2M Hill has never been in the arctic engineering field and seem to be having a hard time securing work and maintaining their employees."
good,I wish i had more time to work for the company because i enjoyed it.
good,"Typical labor job, low pay lots of hard work. Dangerous work."
good,hardest part of my job was dealing with frequent emergency water line breaks ..
good,First time experience at an office. Learnt about the trading and businees development process.
good,welding pipe. reviewing and working with blue prints. fitting pipe. 
good,Work culture is good with supportive PM. Since Jacobs doesn't follow hierarchy its become difficult in early days to understand the process. 
good,"The particular contract I work on is quite isolated from the rest of the division, which is quite isolated from the rest of the corporation. It is easy to get lost in the various systems of management."
good,In CH2MHill you could learn a lot of things about projects. We have a good organization structure & projects tools.
good,Learned a lot working with many plumbing engineers and designers
good,The work hours were hard but Friday 1/2 days are great. The commute was hard.
good,"Project Management, Project Financials, Budgets, Forcasting, Revenue Recognition"
good,"CH2MHILL is a great place to work; in certain positions, there is not much work/life balance; there is a lot of opportunity at CH2MHILL for those who are willing to take the tough assignments. CH2MHILL seems to be in a continuous reorganization."
good,"The typical week is Monday - Thursday, I love the four day work week. I am learning daily as I have since starting in the petrochemical industry in Louisiana. The hardest part of the job is the Louisiana heat, bar none."
good,Fast paced and very dynamic environment.
good,CH2M Hill offers very little job training for accountants. You are basically forced to learn on the job. The work days are fairly routine - 8 or 9 hours per day is the norm. There is very little room for advancement within the accounting department; you need to change departments entirely if that's your goal.
good,Everyday we would conduct multiple safety meetings and do things to a very high safety standard.
good,"Loved working at this Company. It was a fun place to work just not enough work, I would still be there, wanted to retire from there."
good,"They provide training and an overall good place to work. However, after our assignment was complete at Ft. Bliss, they did a poor job of placing people on subsequent assignments."
good,"Large American company, good for those who would like to go international-lots of opportunity for growth. Very fast paced. Great people in Calgary office. Hard if you like having supervisor in the same country as you, as many are scattered in NA. Great place for engineers-lots of work available."
good,"A solid engineering and construction company focused on safety, client satisfaction, and growing to challenge larger companies."
good,"Good team who work hard to get results and deliver the service required. Great location and company are very flexible if required. Variety or work required to support the project managers with the financial elements, tracking budgets to ensure now exceeded. Lots of interaction with different teams across the company and the client."
good,"If you get on with a cohesive contracting group within Jacobs, you could have a long standing career. The various contracting opportunities are almost endless and the education funding is a great perk."
good,"safety is good but the construction is tough, i had difficult time in jacob the expectation from my superior is high. Moreover you have to work straight 2 weeks without off."
good,"A company that had challenges with merging cultures of acquisitions made for a challenging work environment and gaps in strategic vision."
good,It was a convenient place to work at it was a good project I worked there like the people the culture it wa again to learn about other stuff other than just welding.
good,"Good company to work for, good work and life balance.  There is a flexible working agreement in place which means you can work longer hours Monday - Thursday and finish early on Friday. You can also work from home."
good,I really don't think they actually looked at our resumes prior to giving our offer letters. Someone working less than 1/3 of the time was offered Sr. positions compared to individuals who've been here over 5 years and given intermediate offers.
good,"Started in the old CH2M office, was moved to the Jacobs office"
good,"I work, Project Work... it all depends on what the client wants.  As such, we don't rock the boat - if the client wants five meetings a day, we have five meetings."
good,Working as a PC Tech is a great way to start your career in IT as a DoD contractor. You get exposed to a lot of different systems. Which helps build a good foundation to build your career upon.
good,I liked working here over all. Laid back but no room for advancement and they fired us all because this company is mostly moving to India.  I never got a raise and that would have been nice.
good,"Good place to learn how to put together buildings, from the design process up to the completion of the project.  The mentoring was a plus as the older staff was always willing to answer your questions and not talk down to you."
good,"Wish it would pay more.  We have a bunch of seasoned veterans working on a military contract and Jacobs is getting a fantastic deal for their money.  Great folks are adding true customer service to this contract but people can't make a living with low salaries. Let's face it, the cost of living has gone up so salaries need to reflect."
good,"the most enjoyable part of JE is having leaves & can take anytime managing work loads & other factors."
good,The company has changed a lot in the 30 years I have worked for then.  Liked better before and getting ready to retire and looking for something else.
good,"Conglomerate built by many acquisitions bolted onto the core company, which is a construction company. The culture is command and control from the top down.  The underlying processes and systems for dealing with staff fall into line with that culture.  Many leaders have extensive tenure with the company."
good,Very stable company depending on which division you are working for.  Lots of opportunity to grow especially if you are able to relocate and don't mind traveling.
good,Good work culture provided projects are in abundance to keep you busy. Lots to learn if in a right team. Still lot of scope of improvement in keeping transparency by management.
good,"The company has work in many locations throughout the world and is involved in many interesting projects from cars to rockets. There is always something interesting to work on, but some of the thinking and allocation of resources is not ideal. They are in desperate need of upgrading their computer system to fit current time tables and design needs of clients. They also do not welcome new ideas and prefer to work with old technology and designs from more senior individuals despite cost and time overruns."
good,"Pay OK for the job.  Tons of paperwork even for the rank and file.  New programs rolled out requiring complete rework of all paperwork.  Most of the time it was just a change in the name or acronym of the program."
good,Great company to work for but needs to hire more. Jacob's usually hire people that are local. That's not cool. Everyone needs a job that's qualified..
good,People/colleagues are friendly and helpful. Great workspace and nice location. Management is approachable and helpful. Makes new tasks/assignment seem fun and easy.
good,"If only Jacobs won some major projects, I might still be working with the company. I'm still applying and hope they will need my services."
good,Good working environment and there is balance of work load and time. Another good thing was flexible work schedule. There are opportunity for assignment to other Jacobs offices.
good,"fast paced and always changing environment dictated by the construction business. Costs tightly controlled, so initiatives require highly detailed cost benefit analysis.."
good,"The office location itself is very nice.  Enjoyed the interaction with employees and guests.  Each day brought different work requirements, which kept me busy.  My supervisor, was a difficult person to work with, but every job has it's negatives and positives.  As a whole, Jacobs is a good company to work for."
good,"You are just a number.  The company is to large and they don't have the correct culture to bring all the industries and divisions together.  Team oriented events cost money and was never paid for by the company.  Therefore, the turnouts were always small."
good,Jacobs was good to work for when we had a contract but as soon as that came to an end they did nothing to help their people.  The strung us along for a few months that we would have a job.  Then two weeks before the end of the contract they let us know that the contract was going to be handled by a different company.
good,"Good company for engineers but poor management for corporate functions in particular in accounting and finance"
good,Typical day was busy with specific assignments to complete. Enhanced skills with excel and company sponsored software. Management was adequate. Workplace culture was average. Hardest part of the job was communications. Most enjoyable part of the job was co-workers.
good,Fast paced environment.  Safety first is a culture at Jacobs.  Professional group and managers took interest in their people.  Everyone is very helpful and knowledgeable.
good,Some of the offices are great to work for. Others are not. Completely depends on the current management. Pay is sometimes fair and other times not. It's hard to rate a company this big to the the allowed variability between offices.
good,"CH2M HILL was sold.  When I joined CH2 they were an execellent company, promoted education, advancement, etc.  The project teams all worked well together until the end.  It was a pleasure serving with them and I enjoyed every encounter.  I believe it was a combination of poor management and the economy which ended up destroying the company and the company culture.  I was with them a very long time and do not regret one moment overall."
good,Jacobs is a great company but they lay off to often.  Management is also pretty good and the job workplace culture is family oriented.  Some jobs are more challenging then others.
good,"I believe this is limited to Jacobs Telecommunications on the TURF construction project, but the work/life balance is off. There's a culture that has developed that worked 40, even 50 hours a week isn't enough. Management is too busy to manage at times, and you're left without very much direction or support. Compensation starts out good, but the opportunity for advancement is rare."
good,"Si bien la empresa es reconocída mundialmente, el nivel en mandos medios es mediocre o malo. Eso hace una calidad del trabajo regular y desorganizada. La estabilidad laboral es debil ante la primera crisis. el ambiente en gral es bueno, comida y flexibilidad en el horario."
good,"The work entailed installing/mounting various components of the power plant, from turbines, valves, pumps, boilers, subsystems,etc. It also entailed aligning pumps, testing equipment, operating equipment such as overhead cranes,man lifts, and fork lifts. The most fascinating thing learned is how a natural gas power plant operates. The management was good. Many of them were highly educated professionals with a lot of experience in this type of work. The culture was very colorful with various types of people. In way the craft was a little rough around the edges but knew their job. The hardest part was  the work wasn't always active. At times we would have to wait for certain resources such as crane availability or sequence of work. The enjoyable part was seeing how things were coming together."
good,"Great site to learn different fields of IT, but there it can double edge sword the regards to your true responsibilities. Manager are not technical at all which can lead to problem and poor communications between management, engineers and technicians."
good,Do not put a lot of focus on employee needs. Too many family members working at company and it puts a stress on employees. Training in-house is non existing for employees. Salary is pretty good but benefits are sub par for such a large company. Not much longevity when work is up and down at copay.
good,No team of craftsmen better to do the work required in adverse conditions a lot of times.  I have learned to become more organized and be even more proactive in order to avoid work delays.
good,Jacobs Engineering Group is a great company to work for.  The environment and culture is a little family orientated.  The management team is really flexible and have an open door policy.  Like most telecommunication company business slows down during holidays.
good,"I found that once a person leaves, that position is not necessarily filled.  This caused undue stress to the employees that remained."
good,Seeking an ideal position Logistic Officer in the field a reputed establishment or Industry where I can utilize my knowledge and experience in optimum level to achieve the common objectives of the entity and grow with the institution.
good,"At CH2M HILL I learned many important fundamental aspects of consulting engineering. I also worked with many talented and knowledgeable people, who in turn taught me a great about the industry and techniques."
good,"Jacobs is an excellent company to work for. The pay well, however, it is only short term. As far as I'm concerned, the only downside with this company is the instability."
good,"Easy to become invisible, co-workers are friendly and helpful, learned a lot but primarily by teaching self or from a coworker, and management is there only for themselves not the employees."
good,"I thought I would retire from this place when I started.   As they continued to get bigger, the company feel went downhill and the only people that seem to benefit are the upper management."
good,"OK. The work was fine, the management left a lot to be desired.  There were two sets of sisters working in the finance office and that limited the other 6 workers for any form of advancement. Other than management the people at Jacobs were a great bunch of people to work with as were the NASA employees we came in contact with daily."
good,Not the best person to offer high praise in this area. each person must learn from their own experiences . It's not like I have a lot of love for this company. It's the same as most company's . never trust in any 1 thing to much and there is no loyalty in any company only in it's people and not all people can be trusted.
good,"Overall a good place to work. Fragmented departments that don't play well together though. Still, management was fair and job security was good when I worked there."
good,The culture is very professional. They are attempting to move 50+% of all engineering work to India. The hardest part of the job is there is no conformance between work packages. So from one client to the other they have different standards. Most enjoyable part is the challenges of large projects and the construction aspect. A typical day is several meetings and working with your leads on deliverables.
good,Overall great company. Don't think they care about the little man. Just overall profit. Would work there again. Great people there. Too much upper management.
good,"Over all a good experience, learned a lot over the years. "
good,"the pay made up for the bad supervision, slow workers, and the fact that nobody would talk to me in english to help me know what needed done"
good,a friendly environment and a place where there was a lot to learn.  The work life balance was very good
good,"Loved my job. Interacted with a lot of people through projects and my job scope."
good,"The typical day requires little to no actual work, which for the pay is amazing the problem is that with no responsibility comes no advancement, you will sit there doing almost nothing for years, Great if your going to night school awful if you want something better.  But pay is great and there is a lot of overtime."
good,"Top notch supplier of Engineering to some of the finest food production facilities in the breakfast foods area. Very well compensated monetarily, some long hours."
good,Very gratifying position as I was able to assist in restoring image of contractor with clients expectations for respective projects.
good,Great work life balance. Employee owned company. major competitor in Consulting for Govt Facility and Infrastructure Engineering.
good,"A typical day starts with short discussions with co-workers on outstanding workload and deliverables. Work would be re-organized among co-worker to keep up with timeline of deliverables, if needed. "
good,"For me, a typical day at work starts at 6:30Am and lasts until 7:00PM. I start my day with certain ideas of what I will accomplish during the day, however: there are so many interruptions, due to my position, I get very little of what I paneed to do, accomplished."
good,"The Company provided a serious training for their filing system. It was great to work in an international atmosphere. The engineers were mainly from France, Ireland, USA and many more from Europe working for other Companies with whom we had dealings with. The French Engineer Manager was a total jerk. He was abusive & misogynous. I was, thankfully, saved by the Irish Manager when he came on site and took me under his wing. Except for the French Manager, the rest of the people working for the Company were great. I had many dealings with the Scottish Office and they were a great help (actually the only help) when I first started as I was on my own with no one to tell what was going on. The beginning was tough, but it got much easier & even fun later on. It is a great pity that most of the people employed on this site were only to last for the length of a contract. Many were laid off at the end of it. Only the engineers who had been employed by the Company for a good while were kept. It was to be expected as it was a temporary project to last while the new Fab was being built. It was a shame as I would have loved to carry on working for them!"
good,Jacobs is a big growing Company w many opportunities to advance.
good,Ensuring contractors have the materials needed to complete construction of large facilities has led to better time management and delegation skills toward the employees working directly for me.
good,Jacobs is a decent company to work for. Sometimes they don't have their employees best interest at heart or management favors one person over another.
good,"Jacobs Technology was an awesome company to work for, but the management of the facility of which I was stationed was very poor. Supervisors went against policy and also played ""favorites"" amongst employees."
good,"Good company, but low job security. If there is no billable work, you will be sent home."
good,Was not at Jacobs long enough to really form an opinion.  I left because I did not see the company heading in a good direction.  Since I've left CH2MHill was sold to Jacobs and I understand the culture has improved the direction is known
good,"The benefits are are not that great, however many company's benefits are similar. I also did not find the pay to be very competitive with the market. Overall not a bad place to work, however there are many places to find better benefits and pay not making much to be desired working here for long."
good,"- Excellent colleagues"
good,It's a typical large company that says all the right things and then lays you off with no notice.  Saw no effort from anyone within the company at a higher level than the local office.
good,Work was consistent worked lots of hours and made a good wage management / supervision was great getting to work was fairly easy once you new the bus system
good,Aside from higher management issues Jacobs is a good place. My co-workers were excellent and made the job fun.  Most were willing to teach things in their area of expertise to anyone who wanted to learn.
good,As Construction Manager myself and the HSE Manager would leave the office early and watch and participate in daily toolbox talks. Working with multi cultural workforce was the most enjoyable part because teaching safety to these people was a challenge and worth doing.
good,Enjoyed working at a client's production facility. Lines of communication were often not established particularly with PMO. This led to scope redefinition a number of times when the central engineering expressed their preferences.
good,A growing joint venture between OCP and Jacobs. Very good opportunities for looking to grow up however systems yet to fully develop to become established to multi national levels and every one has to incur some advantages and disadvantages due to this
good,The atmosphere was energetic and fun. I was always able to ask questions and not feel ashamed to ask them.I really enjoyed the people I worked with an given the opportunity I would go back and work for them again.
good,"I enjoyed my time working here, It was one of the best jobs I have ever had, but it wont't last forever, when times are rough, they get rough. You can get laid off."
good,"I worked with Jacobs for almost 15 long years, I have seen some unfairness along the way in those 10 years. Managers who are in positions who feel they need to share their political views, views about gays, blacks, religion, women not given fair chance and so on. review process This is a good old boys kind of company!"
good,I cannot address the typical Jacobs workday as my work was based at a client location. The client culture was the major influencer which was a public agency.
good,Jacobs is a well structured company with great benefits. I left Jacobs due to lack of job advancement opportunities. I was always told that I was next in line for that to only be a lie. This has nothing to do with upper management but rather lower management at the supervisor level.
good,"I loved my job and my co-workers until I was moved under new supervision. I was laid off twice by the same supervisor without reason or warning. If given the opportunity, I'd work for Jacobs again."
good,Jacobs was great but had poor on-site management. Site lead created a hostile work environment but Jacobs did nothing to alleviate the conditions. They later lost the contract to HX5
good,"everyday before work, we have mass meetting, talk about safety on all jobsite, and bring a good safety meetting, and the company bring gits to the employees.."
good,"Good place to work with. However, it lacks clear direction from the top about the execution of fast paced projects. Flexible hours and nice colleagues to work with."
good,The days moved fast with a quick paced work day. The job was demanding which is a good thing. Management was engaged for the most part. I really enjoyed working directly with the clients.
good,"Check y our health at the door.. This place is not for the weak! Very stressful. The pay is good, benefits okay. OT is always required.. Holidays off."
good,Attractive Salary. Last 10 Years experience no job stability. Over all job environment is good. Good  to develop skill for the beginners but in terms of job stability it is questionable.
good,"Jacobs is an excellent firm with great benefits. The biggest challenge is the need to be very aggressive in a very competitive environment. The offices are beautiful and they have an open space plan. When you are on the phone, everyone is listing to your conversation. They do provide quiet rooms for making personal phone calls and they have plenty of conference rooms for business phone calls."
good,Interesting work but not well run.  Lots of activity going on all the time.  It was fast paced. I was only hired on as a temporary worker.  Was responsible for the safety of the numerous contractors assigned to the site.
good,Great Place to work with. Enhance my exposure to project management and engineering activities. Change management was hardest and most challenging. Leadership is well experience.
good,"En general, excelente ambiente laboral, horario flexible. Una de las mejores empresa de ingenieria de sudamerica."
good,Difficult to say the company was going through a change period. Wasn't to happy working more hours on less money. As I didn't have a permanent contract I didn't receive the same benifits as permanent staff.
good,"Lots of work, life work balance is there is you allow it, management is outdated, they are not up to speed with drafting software to help out and only delegate work. Don't lead by example"
good,Very challenging and enjoyable projects. Early mornings and late nights can be expected. trips home plus excellent per diem. Management were very professional and courteous. hardest part of the job were the late nights during start up and commissioning of equipment. the most enjoyable was the comaraderie with my co-workers.
good,"On one hand, Jacobs offers great opportunities for its employees to grow and get involved; if you share your interests with your manager, they will work to get you in the career path you choose, although it may be quite long. Unfortunately, this is a work hard environment. I have worked my fair share of overtime, and then some. Not all disciplines work similarly, but mine in particular is very heavy on the workload and can wear you out over time."
good,"Great job straight from Algeria with a company car"
good,"A typical day at work is just like any ordinary desk work where you are just on your computer throughout the day."
good,"An extremely nice place to work."
good,Not much room for advancement but pays the bills. Typical government contractor you are treated as expendable. not bad for a short run but look for something that you enjoy doing in the long run.
good,"The company has a lot of potential and is a financially secure company. However, it is ran as if it is not a construction company on the cellular end. Some decent guys and a very safety driven company in the field. Lots and lots of paper work. Office guys dont really seem to care if you are safe as long as you hurry up and get the job done."
good,They offer great benefits and flex schedules.  No job security.  The would hire several people then in lees than a year they would lay off.
good,"A typical day at work consist of safety meetings and productivity of work. Learned about alignments, oil changing, lubing and overall teamwork. Supervision was ok, a few changes in the two years i've been with this company and the supervisors seem to get worse and worse with the raise approving and just overall giving bad vibes to a lot of workers. The people i have worked with are extremely nice, willing to teach and to answer any questions that are asked, then there was some who really did not care if you got what you needed or not as if it was not there responsibility to teach you. The hardest part of the job was and still is being let free. I was and still is do a lot of the lube jobs and really not trusted to do other pump pulling jobs based on the time and experience which is a little frustrating. The most enjoyable parts are when we don't have much on schedule and its relaxed and not so much of the ""we need this done right now"" type of day."
good,nice company to work for. the pay pretty good...would like to go back but everythings slow since oil field crashed hopefully it pick back up so i can go back
good,"Jacobs Engineering Group is an international,publicly traded company that recently began purchasing smaller telecommunications companies across the US and will soon move to acquiring companies abroad. They are very customer and safety oriented, but definitely allow for an excellent work/family balance."
good,"Given my length of employment at CH2M HILL and Lockwood Greene, I obviously enjoyed the work enough to stay with them for a very long time (37 years). Unfortunately, decisions have been made recently to discontinue the type of work my group had done for many years developing into a reduction of forces affecting numerous employees including myself. Business is business and employee friendly is not some much the case anymore."
good,"The job overall was very rewarding and I learned a lot, however, I was paid at least 10-15% below other PE's with similar skills and job descriptions and I felt like I was taking on increasing responsibility without any decent pay increase."
good,"I loved working for this company during my employment. While it was a fast paced environment the personnel for the most part were great to work with. A typical day would start out with challenges and work scope changes that would test my problem solving abilities and that was most exciting for me and through this I learned alot about how to handle different situations whether it be with work scope changes, cliental, or personnel."
good,"All I have to say is a great company, with great benefits that happens to have a terrible management that do not plan ahead for new hirings. They hire people, just to let them go after few months of employment. Also are in the practice of letting very old, expensive employees in order to keep costs down, regardless of the impact that may have on that particular employee."
good,Salary and package are good but transportation for employee seem not good as per my view. Work tension is quiet easy to handle and thanks to the management people. Good place to learn technical details about work. Thanks for the team lead to handle people in good manner.
good,I was only at Jacobs Engineering for a short time and only worked as Office Admin. 
good,"I have learned time management, communication, and team work."
good,It was a great place for awhile but the culture kind of shifted along with some organizational changes. I ended up with two managers above me that treated people fairly poorly. That on top of being in a dead end job was enough. Annual raises were often cents and a low % despite performance.
good,Management goes above and beyond to support it's employee's.
good,Most enjoyable part of job is process/standards are defined.
good,They need more skilled tradesmen. But they still do a pretty good amount of work with quality results with what they have.
good,"Preparation of proposals for large pursuits, prequal packages, create and update project descriptions and resumes,"
good,"maintenance, demolishing, painting, building cabinets, putting in doors, etc"
good,"12 hour day, I'm an office worker (administrator) and the atmosphere is pretty good, I have single status office and window. Dual monitors, my job can be busy at times and slow others, there is a lot to remember and you are expected to know much about computers. management is helpful and supportive for the most part. co workers are fun and interesting. hardest part of job, is being away from home for 2 weeks. most enjoyable part of the job is having those two weeks off, and on the job would be it can be satisfactory helping others out."
good,"The company has an extremely strong safety emphasis. Compensation is good, however management training was weak. Difficult to be objective because I was laid off."
good,"Still living in the past in tech also they work you to the bone, I worked late every night."
good,"I was a teleworker for my last year with the company, working from my home.  That part was the best.  In order for me to continue my career, I needed to be retrained, because my primary skill was in less demand after Jacobs purchased CH2M.  During that retraining year, I had to constantly advertise my availability in order to be given work.  My manager did what she could, but in the end, I was let go.  I primarily think the layoff was due to my being a 30 year veteran, and so expensive.  It was not age discrimination, but it certainly felt like wage discrimination."
good,Fast- paced day to day work. My drive was somewhat long. The day went by very quickly and the ability to learn more was always available. Project Management world is unique.
good,"A good place to work with good collaborative efforts shared across offices in the UK. Always work available in the rail sector from different offices, with good management and communication."
good,Jacobs is a great company however my entry into Jacobs came from their acquisition of CH2M.  It is a different culture.  It was a bit of shock to go from an employee-owned company to  an  investor-owned company
good,Great co workers on a regular we work together to do preventative maintenance. The hardest thing about the job is the poor management an lack of overtime
good,The company had plenty of work at all times since i went to work at the turnaround. I worked there for almost 6 months and it was my first time working on my tools.
good,"Jacob's has some serious managment issues.  Employees are not told about polices or changes in policies but are held accountable for them.  I love the job culture though, I miss it."
good,"Majority of the job was staying safe everyday. A typical work day was talking about the job as a group and making sure we got the job done safely. The job was managed well, checking the job sites out in the field, making sure it was done productively and everyone was doing it safe. The workplace culture was makes sure we had a clean work area, talking about the job and how we can do it safe, and helping out all other crews besides the department you were in. The Hardest part of the job was making sure everyone was staying safe. And the most enjoyable part was everyone helped each other out."
good,Great atmosphere!  I loved working with the people at the JSF Program on Eglin.  They were all great and I only left because the contract changed hands.  I would go back in a flash if given the opportunity!
good,"A typical work day was spent trying to stay actively employed."
good,Upper management would never come down to see how things were being handled and that's why the management there was never that great. They will probably lose the contract due to this reason. But the upper they are not to worried about the people that work here and their families struggle or not. They just work the people to their breaking point and expect that from them without complainant.
good,"Very slow paced, safety driven company. Not your typical ""cowboy"" oilfield like Texas, OK,OH.. A very different culture that may seem harder to adjust to just because of the tempo"
good,Always something different to do from PMs to inspections to pulling and replacing pumps and blowers also did various types of alignments it was a challenging job
good,"toolbox meetings daily safety spot checks and many times safety stand downs where the current object of accidental oversight of any employee who got themselves hurt or caught is surgically taken apart and broken down into the minuscule cause and effect. This takes the job progress down considerable but is mostly Client Driven (BP) who is short on cash and long on promises. So if you want to be mindlessly driven everywhere, or if you want to be just another number in a large group of numbers then this company is for you.  The upside is the pay and benefits are great."
good,"They were always changing the shifts, days and weeks of work. They never ask what we thought about the changes or how it would affect our lives. They never gave a raise or any bonas,not even at Christmas."
good,"Jacobs provides many job opportunities in the field of engineering, design and construction. The company has world wide office locations and offers employees the opportunity to work on many different projects."
good,"Jacobs accounting office is a good, relaxed environment. The hours are excellent, PTO accumulates nicely, and there are milestone incentives. However, there is little to no room for growth. Yearly increases are usually very poor or non-existent. And the insurance offered is horrible."
good,"In Jacobs New Delhi, Supportive co-workers, Job security and safe work environment. Good time management between work and family."
good,"Work hours are not very flexible, but not too strictly enforced.  Good thing."
good,"A typical day at work involved walking down projects to perform estimates on and then managing the execution of the given project. I leaned what it takes to execute projects in all different types of terrain. My management was very supportive and saw that I was had a lot of potential and allowed me to climb the ladder fast, and there when I needed them. My co-workers were great crafts man and they respected my opinion and would execute the projects as planned on schedule and within budget. The hardest part of the job was working on the slope on a 2 week on 2 week of schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is that management saw my potential and allowed me to get into a position that I was qualified for and allowed to grow and learn with good mentors."
good,"The company has many perks and a very professorial atmosphere. However depending on the department, position and targets, the hours may be long and stress high."
good,Wonderful place to work had plenty of fun. And met plenty of wonderful people.
good,Business Culture morphing.  Executive Leadership Denver Centric.
good,"Decent company, not so good with the compensation and benefits."
good,"Typical work day is answer hotline that we have. The calls consist of safety questions, concerns, and incidents that we may have. I also perform industrial hygiene tasks. Recently I've been taking noise dosimeter surveys for our noise assessments. I have also perform asbestos sampling as well as indoor air quality sampling. I get along great with my co workers, they have taught me many things. The hardest part about my job is probably the communication throughout the facility. I sometimes have to go back and follow up on tasks to make sure they are done correctly and safely. The most enjoyable part about my job is making sure that everyone is safe and taken care of. I like to make people happy."
good,"* it is a long hours timings, we needed because its an oil and gas company and the client is very needed to work on the projects and getting more projects."
good,I learn a lot of different skills working for them a safety was number one
good,Good people at Jacobs to work with. I wish I could have stayed on with them. My direct supervisor was a good man and does his best for you and the group I worked with. Customer expectation can be very high for this company and they are not always placed in a position that they are given an easy task. I worked with a good group of people and hope to work with this company again in the future. As in the piping business when work gets a little slow they have to let some people go. I wish they had another placement for me but it seems for a while that they may be a little slow in my division. A typical day could range from slow to very busy depending on the schedule that was placed in front of you.
good,"My work experience has been satisfying and fulfilling.  Being a global company, I have enjoyed collaborating with employees from different countries and regions in the nation. Jacobs offers the opportunity for career advancement with its many diverse engineering services."
good,"The day would start with greeting co-workers and then reviewing emails and applying any job related information to jobs as required.  Piping designs would be reviewed as necessary and any problems noted for resolution.  Working out problem resolutions was the most enjoyable part of the job with the hardest part of the job was writing requisitions using CH2M Hill's CMAS ordering system."
good,We found corrosion on pipelines in the harsh weather of the arctic region and stripped the pipe to stop the process. We than lined the pipe with a special preventive chemical and then insulated the pipeline with insulation and sheet metal.
good,Satisfactory company structure and management. Great benefits.
good,Very safe and caring company to work for. They actually listen to the employees and take into consideration what they feel and the their safty. Good culture
good,"Jacobs can be a fast place operation. Work culture is demanding and is key on execution. This is a engineering firm and operates in light of achieving project goals, budget and maintaining safety."
good,When I joined there was no project work as the group was relatively new.  Most of my time involved business development.  There was usually some company event or activity each week to encourage interaction between the various departments.
good,"Overall Jacobs Technology is a good place to work. ""Family"" feeling with co-workers. Monthly or Bi-monthly company picnics. Lack of advancement opportunities."
good,"I was working 2 years there on two big oil sands projects. "
good,"American company. Typical management and work. 5 10 hour work day, 1 hour paid lunch. Overtime available when necessary. good learning environment for an apprentice."
good,"Great company but too top heavy. Too many projects managers, program managers, project accountants, directors, contract managers, sales managers, project coordinators.  Can kill a project with all the people working on it.  Too many mergers and acquisitions.  Different groups that do not want to change or accept change."
good,Internship here was great introduction into the consulting world.  Did not apply to what I was looking to do with my career.  The people were great.  Unsure on how the work place is as a full time employee.
good,"Does not pay much, but have great personal benefits.  Great job security from one year to the next.  Limited career movements with the space industry."
good,Very unorganized staff. Too much work and no time to complete it. very stressful. Company needed a new game plan for completing work. Overall it was tolerable
good,it was good work Experian's and I enjoy it working there with new people and there is some people who are really helpful. they let me work on line and they help me to learn on the line to packing the food.
good,"NO comment other than I wish we had a better start here in West Texas from our ""then"" upper management. It was and has benn a great experience working with all the different co-workers. I was given the great oppertunity to teach and train some very hard workers."
good,"Mi evaluación es de 8 ( ocho Puntos ), considerando que me falto conocer un poco mas la misma, en la cual termine terminado el contrato con Shell.Sino sería de 9 nueve puntos sin dudas."
good,"Licensing for Engineers, order, process, and approve invoice payments for PE seals, Data input scheduling for Engineers (Set up Resource and Task schedule on Microsoft Projects following a sample), did some travel arrangements, passport photos, and passport processing for some engineers, assist with Specifications processing, including editing, accepting track changes, making PDFs, proofing, etc,. help Project Assistants when needed, and miscellaneous jobs such as copying, labels, notebooks, filing, faxing, and phone. Have also processed, followed up on, and sent out submittals for Engineers; this included sending copies to clients, distributing, following up on, and faxing change orders, and other documents, filing originals, and also re-submittals. I also transferred information from Drawings. Talk with Vendors to set up lunch & learn seminars, book rooms, and order food. Also approved and processed payments for vendor food orders for lunch and learns and group meetings, and kept the files."
good,"Responsible for sourcing and placing management to entry-level chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineers, designers, engineering specialty positions, as well as support staff primarily within Heavy Process industry."
good,It is a great place to work for when you are attempting to go to school and further your career as well as a steppign stone to get oyur foot wet for any type of job description with the company if and when you set your mind to it.
good,Family oriented workplace and I love the banking industry.
good,"good takes three years to move up or increase in salary for those jist starting out , Be mindful of wahat you would like to accomplish working for the company,"
good,I was released because of a dis agreement the head of HR. He called me when I was on bearevment from buring my mother and I would not miss her funeral
good,"Rigging all day, constantly moving crane. Lean more about rigging. got along with co-workers. at the beginning trying to learn the rigging chart but got easy. Enjoy learning more about rigging"
good,the job is an ever learning one and the people are fantastic by far a great place to work 
good,"A typical day at work is not typical, everyday is something new and different. I always try to learn something new to better myself and to better the work group for their own safety. Management is all different in many aspects, locations, who is charge, attitudes and safey minded cultures. The employees I over see are a good group of individuals, but are no different than any other group of workers trying to get ahead in life and trying to provide for their families. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep everybody safety conscious at all times and to see safety in everyday life. The most enjoyable part of my job in interacting with the employees and coaching them on safety and getting to know them on a personal level."
good,I have worked for them twice the pay was awful but they are very easy to work for. they don't give you room to advance in your career the position they hire you as you are stuck there
good,CH2MHill is a good company to be employed with  and is recommended for individuals interested in a steady paced work environment with job security and multiple advancement / relocation opportunities within the company in the Hanford area.
good,Jacobs has a long history of promoting friends and family members over more qualified individuals.  This does more to encourage people to develop personal relationships more than professional relationships.
good,"i did plant studies,and land studies.we studied diffrent kind of plants and animal habitate.recorded everything we saw.went for helicopter rides."
good,"Duties: Prepared walk down P&I D’s using AutoCAD 2005. Prepared tie-ins, piping iso’s plans and sections using FlexCAD in the asphalt area of the refinery. I also used CADWorx Plan 2005 and CADWorx P&I D 2005 to work on P&I D’s and Vessels Drawings."
good,No complaints other than lack of advancement for my department. Benefits were decent and pay was great. No micromanaging. Worked in a medium-paced environment. Would recommend.
good,Co workers worry about the wrong thing do not worry about another employment. It was a good job money pays good. There is a lot of improvement needed to be done.
good,"Poor Management, No raises for 4 years. Work is not challenging, No changes to advance. Cannot move to other positions. Outdated working conditions.  Benefits are adequate."
good,Jacob was a great place to work for is just that the management inside the plant was it the best it could’ve been If I could I would go to another place and work for Jacob’s like I said it was a great company to work for
good,"During my work experience in Jacobs I worked in a few departments which were: Geology, Highway and Architecture. In the first couple of days I had to learn information and answer some questions in a small booklet for the geology department to give me some ideas about what geology was. After a couple of days, I was told to go to the architecture department. In that department, my aim was to complete some real-life tasks such as designing buildings. The highway department however was quite similar to the architecture department. I also had to do real life design; but on the computers this time. In the highway department, I had to create roads and tracks in the motorways and solve the problems by for example; adding traffic lights or roundabouts to prevent the transports from crashing."
good,"I enjoyed working at Jacobs. They have really good people there. Unfortunately I wasn't given the opportunity to become a full time employee, I would have liked to have stayed. I am a professional Temp so I didn't take it personally, I learned alot about Engineering, met some amazing people. The down side is I hurt my back during the move to the new office, I was part of the crew that stayed to clean out the old office. While I was paid the overtime, I wasn't afforded the health insurance. That's the only down side. Never the less I did meet some very pleasant, intelligent but genuine people."
good,"I have not worked at Jacobs for over 4 years, so it is likely they have changed in many ways.  For this reason, I cannot offer any commentary to their daily routine."
good,I really enjoyed working for jacobs. It was a good learning experience. I was paid fairly and it was a safe work envirment. Safety was number 1. I liked the overtime that i received.
good,"Good company, worked well together, they knew how to handle problems well ,I would work for them again ...I worked for jacobs for 3 yrs and enjoyed the work"
good,The company cannot provide job security in some markets and struggle to move employees around on contracts to keep them onboard until another contract is secured.
good,"a good place to work to make money quick."
good,"There are no typical days at work here, but that's part of the fascination. I learned to be flexible and to work hard on everything, because even the small projects may be what brings you the bid. My co-workers are very intelligent and great to work with, but the management structure is terrible and constantly re-organizing. The hardest part of the job is managing your manager, but the people you work with and the projects we win are the most rewarding."
good,Management pursues Safety as a great focus. Challenges arise with keeping project work to support continuous staffing.
good,Overall I enjoyed working there.  I worked there from 2011 to 2016 and went thru 3 different managers.  My latest manager only worked in the office 1 day week.  That is my only complaint.  I enjoyed the team I work with.
good,"In general, it's a good company to work for."
good,Environment changes drastically with each job site. Some site managers were completely non-communicative and difficult to work with while others were a complete opposite making the it a distinct pleasure to engage with them resulting in a much reduced stress level. You are expected to work ten hour days but are only allowed to charge for eight hours. Any over time is paid as straight time charges. Overall salary is quite good. It could be difficult to enforce all Jacobs Safety Policies as the overall management goal is more production oriented and always trying to play catchup for being behind schedule..
good,"CH2MHill is a great company for engineers to begin the career, following great senior engineers who love to coach.  A family-oriented job, the off-site activities were very important to develop a strong team."
good,A lot of employees throughout CH2M are willing to meet expectations for the client. I feel I have learned many skills. Many opportunities and privliges came my way
good,"Nice disciplined work culture! Transportation facility is provided and strict with women's safety. Sometimes if the job demands it could be long hours of work otherwise there is so culture of staying back in office after office hours! Colleagues and senior management is good, friendly and teaches and guides you well....! Overall a good com[any to work and one can nicely balance family and work. Appraisals maynot be that good as per expectations and salary hikes or bonus is not upto the mark!"
good,"I would get to work, inspect my work area, PPE, tools, & any equipment being used that day.Fill out S.P.A.(Safe Plan of Actions) & equipment pre-inspection forms.I learned allot about safety; like how to recognize hazards and handle them."
good,"A good place to work but not enough control over management , they do not execute all phases as needed by employees."
good,"This particular office did not have enough work to sustain a full-time Administrative Assistant. Had I not left on my own accord, I would have been laid off or had my hours cut back drastically. The local management did not do anything to ensure his employees had enough work to keep them billable. He is ""NOT"" a team player and only looks out for himself. I learned nothing while with this company and felt I was wasting my time."
good,"Management not that supportive..."
good,"a decent place to work but don't plan to have a life outside of the company, you work long hours, the bosses have favorites and there is constant drama. You can get decent over time during shut downs"
good,It was great working for them while they had plenty of work available. Once the workload slowed to a crawl I got put into a holding pattern and was put on-call for weeks at a time. The people were great for the most part.
good,"Currently employed by Jacobs ESSCA Group in Huntsville.  Lots of overtime, sometimes mandatory to meet customer deadlines.  Work-life balance is so-so, they offer a pretty generous PTO plan but when you are working 6 days a week at the behest of the customer you never get to use it.  Management is pretty decent, they are flexible and usually understanding of difficult situations.  The overall work environment is fine - I've been places much worse.  Where Jacobs really shows a weakness is the poor pay and nonexistent promotions.  Cost of living increases are usually below the national average.  Also, the benefits have been cut down to the bone in the past few years, especially health insurance.  The 401(k) match is substandard (only 3%.)  In short,  it's a good place to work if you've already retired from a career elsewhere, such as the federal government, and are looking for a decent job to fill your time.  I wouldn't work here if you are young and ambitious or have a large family to support."
good,Jacobs is great for people who are flexible to do many tasks at one time. I learned a great deal on how to manage my own time and also a great deal about company politics. 
good,You are on your own work and responsible with no training. What I learn from Jacobs is hardworking is needed.Management is very poor and they send work to India.
good,"For being a design engineer, I was asked too many times to oversee 3rd shift (7pm-7am) installation projects of my designs, the drawing packages were complete and self explanatory."
good,"This place is an ok place to work for, they don't want to pay you too much as far as the position goes, but their benefits were good and at a fair cost."
good,"A good place to work & advance.  I was on contract through an agency when I worked there.  The work day was spent following up with suppliers & other members of the team.  I learned how to work with a new data system.  Management were fine.  The workplace encouraged a follow up & feed back process.  "
good,"Nice firm to work with, but the job security is poor when working for a specific project. Some of the Project Managers shouldn't have been allowed to manage projects."
good,I have learned a lot about my field of work but advancement to move up and to get on the job training is slow. The work place culture is great and the people that work here are friendly and will help if asked.
good,Jacobs Polidora is a great place to work if you have a family.  They're flexible with your work hours and they understand the meaning of family.
good,"They'll tell you that you have a secure position and then turn around and lay you off because they ""had no choice"" but ""you didn't do anything wrong"" and all of this even though you left another job to join their company. They do not care about you as a person."
good,"great place to gain experience the hard way, no one will mentor you because every body is busy trying to keep his/her job."
good,"Starting my day be visiting the site to inspect the site progress of the previous day and to identify the next activities. Later during the day discuss with the Project Manager the areas of concern and the way to move forward in order to complete the project on time and within budget. Also discussing with the PM his concerns and ways to assist."
good,"Lots of new innovations in the safety culture, the labor crews were very young and inexperienced and some times hard to get the job done. All in all it was a good job."
good,"Safety is drilled into your brain the moment you walk into the door.  If you are not safe, you will be looking for a new job soon.  Electricians seem to hold their job, while pipe fitters seem to have a revolving door.  Good salary, but terrible benefits.  Very loud working conditions."
good,"My day was to help welders roll out the leads and gather tools for the work order they got. Sometimes we had to refabricate the work order to fit the order and completed to a professional look. As a an Ironworker helper, I helped the journeyman bolt, fit, fabricate the iron piece to complete. Sometimes we had to refit by cutting and welding to ensure the fit is sound and safe for all workers. Install grating, I-beams, stairs, secured by welding, bolting with common air tools or hand tools."
good,its mostly favortisem u gotta know someone to get on but it was real easy to let go i paused at a stop sign insted of making a compleat stop n thats why iam nolonger workin their the booses son took my position without warning n i did nothing wrong but do my job i stayed to myself an keep my mouth shut n i belive thats what hurt me
good,"Different scenario, challenging"
good,We would all come into the office by 7:30 am. We would all share all the job duties or take turn doing each duty. Everyone would help everyone out in completing the tasks. Everyone was very helpful and motivated at all times to complete the job asap. The hardest part of the job was completing the duties on hand by the deadline if the company system experianced technical difficulties. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we could take breaks at anytime we wished. There was no set timings for breaks. The management kept everyone on track and motivated. They also gave everyone a progress report while we were doing the job
good,A typical day at work was surveying and mapping proposed and dedicated routes of pipeline. Also surveying and mapping pipeline as it was constructed. I learned the operations of satellite GPS systems along with drawing blue prints up. Management seemed to be easy going. My co-workers and I had a good relationship. The hardest part of the job was traveling and being away from my family. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in an good environment and taking on the leadership of a party chief.
good,strive for better if possible. But the typical work day is short and strait to the point
good,I love the work plus there was always something to do. Although the management and leadership not to mention communication skills were very poor. I felt I had to be the leader instantly. That was a role I am familiar with and took upon to provide structure within the company.
good,"One on one, full of good people, but leadership are many layers of the onion away and not reachable.  I was part of a RIF that blindsided me.  They don't carry billable people on the bench like I would have assumed."
good,"Home/work life balance wasn't great I would work until 11pm on Friday evenings and hot desking was stressful, you booked your desk for 2 weeks in advance but could be asked to move"
good,Excellent place to work if you like the same position for years. I have to give credit I was fresh out of school the recruiter helped me a lot & I had a top notch supervisor who worked with me to get me up to an acceptable level as an operator. For that I will forever be greatful.
good,"This company provides a lot of opportunity for travel, and offers a wide variety of complex projects. As with most large companies there seems to be frequent turnover in upper management. During my employment  there the turn over rate was due to hiring individuals not qualified for their positions when they had excellent candidates with in the company."
good,Great company but they were never able to get the resources in place to work. I came on board and the company had great plans to develop a new AKO application but could not get the support or resources to even start the project.
good,"8 hrs days of the same thing everyday. No real change very easy to get a new position with more pay."
good,"Work load tends to slow down throughout the year"
good,The program that I work on is very political and not really exciting. Lot's of British expats on high positions that are pushing the locals out and limiting the possibilities for advancement.  The Client is the Government and there are too many entities involved. Very political program.
good,Good place to work but they will lay you off in a heartbeat if they don’t have a project.    The management really doesn’t care for the workers on a personal basis.  You are just a number.
good,"Enjoyed working at Jacobs. The new company structure and down sizing was a result of my leaving."
good,"I enjoyed the breadth of markets and services Jacobs focuses on. They were also ambitious with growth and M&A being an explicit part of their business model and management focus."
good,"The most significant benefit of Jacobs was the autonomy they gave me because of the trust of my managers, who had known me for 30 or more years.  However this particular office did not perform well enough to complete jobs within budget, so did no win subsequent projects that they bid.  This caused a downturn in the office which resulted in de-staffing."
good,Great company but too many mergers and acquisitions during my time and some roles got eliminated as a result. The compensation is very good and management is old school Americana. Do not expect a startup culture.
good,Challenging work with a diverse list of clients.  Ability to work on many different projects for different business groups keeps things challenging and interesting.
good,For the most part it was a decent company to work for. Down side was working in a chemical plant. best for me was doing the field verifying and field routing of piping systems.
good,"Challenging and work with others, sometimes stress full working with others, maintained positive under pressure,"
good,"When I first started with JACOBS it was a very friendly and family oriented environment, but over the last 5-6 yrs it has changed drastically.  It's still a great place to work.  But I found that it doesn't matter your skills, seniority or flexibility, your job is not secure."
good,"I was not there long enough to really put in a decent review and I was not use to the office politics.  I have a friend who has been with them a long time and as for a him it has been a great place for employment.  They claimed I was to be trained for Electrical Drafting  to add to my Instrumentation and INtools operations 5 years of experience.  I think the ladies spent to much time out in the back smoking and gossiping and not seeing that i needed training, which the company promised.   I felt sad leaving there with no experience to show for the time I was there which was very short.  Since then I have gained great experience in Electrical drafting from CB&I and Richard Design Services.  I am now considered a E&I Designer level 1 & have done some level 2 work."
good,Jacobs was a fun place to work and the people were great. but they changed management to many times. new manager came in brought his own personnel with him
good,Ch2 training was different from other companies they made you feel like they really cared no one rushed you to work and everyone treated you fair I would work for them again
good,"They were very professional,the orientation process was quick and efficient.They also provided the precision tools that were need for us to do our job.Planning could have been better and they needed a more experienced foreman that trusted his hands and knew how to measure in millimeters. Other than that I really enjoyed the job."
good,Work-life balance was phenomenal but management was lacking as well as expectations and structure. It is fast paced with a lack of communication on all levels. High expectations with minimum guidance.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Jacobs!  I would welcome the opportunity to rejoin the team.  As with all EPC firms, like Jacobs, it is much like working contract with no guarantee of long term employment.  No projects, no jobs."
good,Jacobs Management was more concerned with the appearance of work in front of the Client as opposed to reporting what actually happened.  Staff became expendable.
good,It can be a verry good place to work but you always have to worry about being laid off due to lack of work. Safety is really important there and most foremans do a good job.
good,Es una buena empresa como todas las del rubro de la gran minería en Chile.
good,"I received very good induction"
good,i worked at a chem plant on maintenance so depending on operations of the plant as to what hrs will be worked both daily and weekly usally its just lbusy work to give craftsmen something to do but when something breaks its a get it work place alot of 16 hr days worked and alot of consecutive days if something goes down or needs repairs supervision could be better
good,"The specialists and engineers are greatly compensated, but support staff and craft staff are not as much supported.  Other than that, it is a great place to work."
good,The opportunity to be a design manager and review plans and specifications was a great experience for a large scale infrastructure improvement program with the City.
good,"There is a lot of commuting to Dugway.  You can get transit benefits."
good,Has been a good place to work; the company is restructuring.(This means laying off Americans and moving projects to India.0
good,"Quite enjoyed my time here. Bosses showed patience as I re-learned how to do bridges."
good,"Overall I have enjoyed working at CH2M, I have been challenged and have been able to work with people that are highly motivated and skilled.  I have learned a great deal in this position. The hardest part of being a proposal manager is managing other people with regard to meeting required deadlines.  It helps if you are a creative person who has a sense of humor and does not take things personally."
good,Great employees and the company is good to work for but when working in the field there is little chance for advancement
good,"A great company, great co-workers and excellent choice if you're looking for a flexible work schedule."
good,"Aprendi que trabalhar em equipe é essencial, aprimorei meus conhecimentos em relação aos softwares, a criatividade e organização são fatores primordiais para a elaboração de tais peças gráficas, todas obedecendo o que o cliente desejar."
good,Working in the warehouse was the most physical work I have done. Having to take the inventory through out the stadium was hard but enjoyable because knowing that you have to work in teams to accomplish these tasks. I enjoyed meeting different people everyday. One thing that I did not like about the job was that you did not get a formal training at the begining. You had to either learn by watching someone or by doing it yourself.
good,Got to travel and work in Brisbane and Vietnam.
good,You often have the ability to set your own schedule.  You're able to work from home or at remote sites.  You're able to manage your workload as you see fit.
good,"No issues, work till jobs are done friendly and saftey 1st makeing sure workers are safe,and double checking work is always a priority. Workers and management are always trying to work together to make sure jobs are safely done and workers are aware of any situations that arise."
good,"Great experience. The on boarding was not difficult and they have a great team. Lots of exciting opportunities both locally and all over the world. So, definitely apply."
good,"Company is very focused on supporting the Department of Defencse. Company pays well, has good benefits, and gives employees flexibility needed to support customer."
good,Een werkdag is altijd verschillend en je weet nooit van tevoren wat je gaat doen.
good,"I am allowed to be an adult and work my 8 hours. I am not monitored on my comings and goings. "
good,"Back then it was CH2M Hill. I started working as a Junior Environmental Engineer in the Chemistry Team for a big project in the Environmental and Nuclear Department. "
good,"The job is technical and challenging. However I felt that that people at the office were a bit cold."
good,"Project manager I worked for at Jacobs was the best boss I'd ever worked for, pay was great, schedule was the best. Communication with corporate could use some improvements."
good,"Challenging work, rewarding financially, but ultimately frustrating in that I had no visibility at Denver office in project controls to be able to stay with Jacobs, and still be with my family."
good,I was treated fairly and provided tools and help when ever it was needed. Top priority is safety. Hard work is noticed and rewarded. Good benefits and bonuses
good,I was able to develop and refine my skill set in order to advance my career. I began working in the CMMS system via this job opportunity and was able to obtain valuable knowledge about the oil and gas industry.
good,"Big programme management business, so you are Just one of a number. not particularly personal. tend to sell their staff out on to major programmes and leave them to iy"
good,Would still be there if they had work the flood changed alot of people lives and had devestating impacts on people .the management that was in place was slowly making a turn for the worst but we hung on as long as we could for the most part alot of us swapped company's to the other contractor that was taking over at the time.
good,I was hired to help with a new client stat up Jacobs had taken on.  The job was supposed to be in the Oroville area but ended up being in Roseville which was too far to commute.
good,"I spent 6 years there. Company was bought out went in different direction, laid me off in good standing. I learned a lot about Adobe and Microsoft. The people there are good."
good,"Extremely quiet management in the mid level. They didn’t have a plan or place for you at the end of the contract? Did not know how much time or money was left on contract? Poor “Rearview mirror budgeting!”"
good,Great people. Great opportunities. Great working culture with a focus on safety both at work and at home. The downturn in the markets made them lose a lot of great people.
good,"Growing quickly with acquisitions of other companies.  Came from CH2M Hill, Jacobs has exciting projects and a great backlog.  Still going through merger growing pains."
good,"A typical day of work at Jacob's involved cleaning and maintenance tasks that were repeated almost daily. This was the least enjoyable part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the curtain was pulled back and you got to see how the plant ran and how these various machines operated in tandem. Being a part of this process, though small, was satisfying."
good,"After working for Jacob's on various sites and over the years (not consecutively), I have to say it was always organized and the people I worked with were professional."
good,Great place to work but there is no career advancement.  I think they need  to hire within first and advance the current staff they currently have.  Jacobs needs to offer classes to help assist employees learn new skills. Overall it is not a bad company.
good,"A typical day at work, Inspecting piping, valves, pumps, equipment, etc  based on specifications and codes. I have learned how to walk down systems for Turnover to the client. Management on this particular project is not that great. Its been a struggle at times. Workplace culture, well its construction. The hardest part of the job is being away from my family for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the many people you meet and build good working relationships with."
good,Very good company too work with the employees was very nice. The management was very great to work with and they really had the schedule land out very well. The best part working hear we new what our work schedule was at the beginning of the week.
good,"Its a decent place to work for. Have been losing business in their traditional line of business, and they are not pivoting fast enough for the changing landscape in petrochemical and construction business."
good,Working at Jacobs was a quick paced job that taught me to become a better welder and pipe fitter. It also taught me a lot about how to work safely and to recognize risks.
good,I was hired after JACOBS acquired another another local engineering firm.  Jacobs grows by buying out their competition.  Once the competitions contracts have been closed out then those people are offered the opportunity to relocate.  If you choose not to relocate then you are fired.  A couple of years later the people that were offered relocation again.  If you refused then you were fired.  once it became evident that the group i was hired into was not going to be allowed to bid on any new contracts we all started looking for other jobs.
good,"have nothing bad to say about the company."
good,"Working on multiple Projects very rewarding and satisfying with a n friendly and helpful team of colleagues."
good,"Was hard work, but we were constantly busy and given challenging tasks (which I enjoy). Pay was good, and work environment was overall positive. Would work for again."
good,"As in all thing in this industry it depends on the project and the people you work with. I worked with one or two less then grate people, and one or two of the best people while at Jacobs. I learned allot while there."
good,Working for Jacobs has been a positive experience although employees may not be compensated for their full value given to the company.  Management could work on increasing moral throughout the disciplines and showing employees that they are valued for their work effort.
good,"It was alright. Was seasonal help, and when it came to crunch worked ~60 hours a week (only for a short period though). Other than that, relaxed, taught me a lot, good friendly environment that was pretty open to my questions."

good,"I loved working for this company , I love how my supervisor would go out his way for his workers, we took breaks & got alot of overtime if we had to go home early the day before"
good,"When I worked for Jacobs it was still somewhat draconian. The job security was good, and company grew. But the global crisis which hit Jacobs and most companies changed the majority of the senior management team. I believe it is a better company today."
good,"Company has lots of resources but tends to overload with management personnel on projects, dropped their construction arm and failed at some key alternate delivery projects"
good,They offer good benefits and paid time off and paid holidays off. You are able to work around your school schedule and they help you pay for some approved schooling. There are many different jobs available to work and learn from at this company.
good,"Talented work force, people oriented and safety conscious. Varied skill set across contract. Best value for the money for the government. Consistent high performance."
good,I spent a total of 9 years with Jacobs. I worked on many new construction projects with them. My last 2 projects were overseas and I would say was a good experience. They gave me the opportunity to work in some new markets that I hadn't been a part of before.
good,Learned a lot about automotive testing. Also learned a lot about operating a chassis dyno. Most of the people were friendly and helpful. Good place to start in the automotive testing industry.

good,A lot of work is contract dependent and you need to be flexible. The cons are typical of big business. Changes at the top ripple down and are not always consistently deployed.
good,"Job is fairly friendly for students; however, the students should be compensated more. The rate students get is less than $10 an hour when starting. For the work you are required to perform, students should be paid a minimum of $12/hour, and have more opportunities for raises."
good,"I learned many Jacob's software and Jacob's way of business. "

good,"This company is easy to work for, on boarding is easy, just show up and they take care of the details, good supervision, pays well, detailed work plans"
good,"Overall the position was great. The only issue was that the salary range did not match the position requirements. The salary for the position was bid as entry level for the Digital Forensics field, but the position required a mid to senior level Analyst."
good,"Nice place to be, I love the work there and the people that I worked with."
good,"Good Company to work for"
good,"As an Assistant Engineer, I happened to work on Design of concrete Retaining Walls, Foundations, Highway Slabs & Small masonry structures. The staff was extremely helpful in & I received good on-job training."
good,"Main problem within Jacobs is luck of culture / advancement / belonging, no cense of integrated team, sporadic management inputs, and a complete absence of communication skills and  channels  between upper management and ""working bees"""
good,It was a great place to work.  The only down side is the communication about future projects and there available positions is slow.  So you may work 50 hours a week for 3 months and then nothing.
good,The last couple of years have been rough due to the downturn in the Oil industry economy.  Look forward to it turning upward. There is a great focus on safety.
good,Good company to work for. Good work life balance.Good people. Loved working from them for the 20 year I was there.  Decent benefits and working conditions.
good,I enjoyed the type of work I did but I was often forced to deal with extremely fast paced service requirements. I learned to juggle multiple tasks and prioritize work to insure the highest quality service was delivered.
good,"as an apprentice welder i work as what my supervisor given task for me in safely manner so that other may also be safe. I did cutting, welding, grinding in the job-site."
good,I was given a lot of projects to work on and the people are constantly offering up their time to help you learn. The most memorable part of my internship is the connections I made with my coworkers.

good,Good place to work. Industry standard benefits package. Not a lot of overtime. Kind co-workers. Qualified and competent co-workers. unique projects. Felt informed with company business.
good,Only a short shutdown. Nothing special to report. I got paid on time and they even payed out in full without taking anything off for taxes. Give it a go!
good,Evolutions sur projets de plus en plus conséquent au fil des années
good,"similar to all of the major E&C companies. very qualified personnel throughout the disciplines. middle management is just ok. I worked in 5 different offices of Jacobs, and they differ greatly. Smaller offices tend to be less stressful. I was lucky enough to attend Jacobs College, which is their in-house project management training class, that lasts 4 days, in Pasadena, CA. Take it if you get the chance."
good,"Management was fairly good, not many complaints there. Was my first job in the plants and the crew I was with taught me a lot. Learned not to touch live wires and how to use a sander; came in handy in the future"
good,Good Job for me.... there were always problem project holding back company profitability.  New leadership created huge turmoil and uncertainty.  Employees were very proud to work here.
good,Micro-managers are destroying the moral! Great place to work if you can get past them.  Let the leaders in the field do their job and keep the people happy.
good,"If you can get an internship here, do it.  It was great, and the pay was superb.  Some work is make-work, but you can make the most out of it, and really have the chance to learn some stuff."
good,"Very good place for people like my that like doing field design work ."

good,"Worked as piping designer in the beginning and piping engineer at later dates. Learned a lot about piping design and engineering standardpractices, codes, specifications, etc."
good,It is pleasure to work in this company.my seniors always give best direction to me for development of my career. Ch2m is the best company for supervision of highways.
good,helping electrician with wiring circuits installing wiring. learned a lot about industrial wiring. very little interaction with management lots of friendly competition. physically demanding.
good,"Genuinely hard working people at the company.  Good place to work.  All about billability.  Sales people do an excellent job with bringing in more work for the company.  Good comradery, people really do care."
good,There are experiences in working with different clients and different industries. You get to learn technical skills to earned value progress tracking.
good,The overall culture of the company is good.  There are disconnects and a focus only on the bottom line that have recently taken hold within the company that is changing the culture.
good,"Checked thousands of documents to be issued against Jacobs Project Information (JPI) cards for conformance, completed Document Distribution Request (DDR) form and Flat Reports and attached to JPI Notification, inspected Scope of Work write-ups to ensure all documents were included in package, sent to Document Control, and notified leads and managers to approve. Also maintained document package tracking log, flat files, and stick files. Updated weekly JPI issued drawing lists for management."
good,Was a contract position so it wasnt going to last forever although the time we worked together we had a great team effort going. Its unfortunate our location didnt get more work to keep the team strong.
good,"Really enjoyed working for Jacobs, in fact I wished I still worked there, there was a lot of office politics that happened the last few months I was there so decided it was best to leave as I wasn't into getting into the office politics."
good,Team work atmosphere especially around a specific project.  Co-workers were very helpful and working across functions was easy.  Had very interesting work including assignments in sub-project management which I had not done previously.
good,"I was fortunate in that I was placed with a lead who had an interest in developing junior engineers and giving them challenges so that they could grow, gain confidence, and become a contributing team member quickly. Unfortunately, it seems to be a coin-toss as to whether you will get a lead who wants you to grow, or one who will just give you grunt-work to do. You have a four-day work week which is great, but the health insurance is very costly. Additionally, job security is tied to how many projects the office has, so your job is never secure."
good,this is a good paying company i traveled a lot and long work days management was sub par they do not always  under stand the job we do they have unrealistic expectations at times but they are vary safety oriented and you will be given top of the line safety equipment
good,"This project has been very challenging - fitting a modern, world-class Airport Terminal into one of the most agressive sites in Abu Dhabi. We would not have been so successful without close collaboration between Jacobs team, design team and Contractor team."

good,"Involved in a number of projects including leading a few of my own. I joined as a graduate with no experience and now feel that I have excelled massively in both my technical skill and professionalism. I have gained a lot of experience in highway design and project management. I have a good relationship with my co-workers and I believe I'm a valuable asset to the team. Being the longest serving graduate in the office, I often provide guidance and share my skills with fellow graduates. the most difficult part of my job is the tight deadlines, however I also see this as a positive as I believe i work better and more efficient under pressure. I enjoy the joyful atmosphere and the fact that everyone is approachable and friendly regardless of grade or seniority."
good,"Company is dependable and taking care for the employees future. Co workers are very supportive as well as the management. The hardest part of the job is to conform to the highest degree the discipline being imposed by the company and after complying with it, feeling as an accomplishment"

The hardest part at Jacobs was picking up the heavy trays however packing all the biscuits were quite enjoyable and easy. The environment was also really friendly."
good,The overall company culture promotes and supports self driven leaders through cross-functional teams. MY experience when joining the project delivery team for the O&M services was considerably mediocre since the group had a high turn over through its team members and it affected negatively on the team spirit.
good,CH2M HILL was founded by three college students based on a class project and those principles which this company was founded are carried on today by a book written by its founders in the mid-1940's which hold true today. A great place to work and lots of fun.

Everyone pretty much stays to themselves as their work requires. Very quiet workplace. However, when the staff does get together for meetings, which are many, everyone is very personable and friendly.  Management is very easy to work with, and noticed they treat their employees very well as far as time off for illness, personal business, etc. A typical day for me included printing schedules and posting, keeping kitchens stocked/clean, answering switchboard, greeting visitors and receiving packages, typing invoices on Liquid Office (accts payable), scheduling conference rooms, processing incoming/outgoing mail.

good,Working for Jacobs is wonderful. Management is always there to help you succeed. You will most likely be a government contractor for another company and or local government. But overall has been a wonderful experience.
good,Capable of producing good engineering product.  Rather high stress.  Someone looking over your shoulder constantly.  Did not like office environment for engineers.  Old fashioned office environment like secretarial pool.  Management varies considerably.
good,"A typical work day consists of multiple meetings to discuss strategy with higher ups. meetings included agendas that focused on budgets, schedules and client satisfaction."
good,"As an environmental geologist who works in the field mostly but has to be in the office in between field events, I did enjoy parts of this job, but there were also some parts that I hated. I loved working in the field and working on different projects, but when it came time to come back to the office to work, the Tempe office's atmosphere was awful. There was way too much drama which was not positive at all."
good,"I worked at Jacobs for 9 years before they didn't have a project for me to go to. The downfall was that I was never notified of my termination until I received a letter from my medical facility. Otherwise, I enjoyed working on the projects and conquering the challenges."
good,"I have worked for a couple of engineering, procure and construct companies ~ Jacobs was probably the best for valuing experience and not micromanaging, they seemed quite capable of handling the uneasy balance between Client demands and expectations and Reality.  "
good,Despite being an extremely large organisation it felt that all the resources are in touching distance of each other. The seamless ability to work across the globe is an advantage.
good,the company is interested in advancing asset management and reliability as applied to complex infrastructure to lower the total cost of ownership. this is aligned with best practices
good,"Great people to work with.  Staff is incredibly had working and dedicated at all times. Morale was not great, but everyone worked together really well."
good,"Esprit d'appartenance, ampleur des projets et des missions"
good,"Good colabrative work ethics between all members of Jacobs, the contractor (their subcontractors) including Highways England."
good,When I first started working Jacobs it seemed to be daunting task. But after being interviewed and placed among the workforce I began to feel much more open to my surroundings. Was an overall great experience and would do again.
good,"Getting a raises and promotions are very difficult. The supervisors have too many people they supervise and are not always available to assist or help. Most enjoyable part of the job, are the people you meet."
good,"Jacobs as an organization has a strong push towards safety. They are very good at working with life events (children, deaths, births, etc.). The insurance is very expensive, but the pay is great."
good,Same old back stabbing and people feeling threatened by others skill levels. The owner is a great guy. Management Ok. I think management was threatened by my experience level.
good,Throughly enjoyed working my temporary assignment at Jacobs.  I found the employees to be professional and friendly and the work processes very organised.
good,"Jacobs Engineering was a great place to work with friendly people and pretty strict safety guidelines. You're mostly left alone to do your work with occasional meetings."
good,While at work everyone held an outstanding professional attitude. Work tasks were constant throughout the day. Management obtained a laid back approach which allowed employees feel appreciated and continually achieving a hard working type of attitude each day.
good,Jacobs is a great place for experience on large projects and to learn how a large corporation manages large projects. The office is a bit stuffy with most people very focused on their work. The people are easy to get a long with and are friendly. The work typically comes in waves and can be very slow at times and very fast paced at others. There are many opportunities to meet with clients and learn the ropes of bidding on projects that use public funding. There appeared to be limited room for growth within the company and limited budget for personal training.
good,"The pay is good, I have a meaningful job, but I have been maxed out at my position for 7 years. There is no upward advancement which is causing me to seek employment elsewhere."
good,Everyplace you work for them is differentIt is hard to review a construction company because some places are better than others overall Jacobs is a good employer.
good,Safety first culture that values employee education. Fast paced contract supporting a federal program. Typical contract situation. Flexible hours to a point.
good,Jacobs could have done way better in Edmonton by keeping knowledgeable people in the loop and let them help the company to keep it going in though time and not laying them off in slow time.
good,"Challenging opportunities for young professional."
good,"Growth is most important issue, people are secondary concerns.  Jacobs sometimes treat employees as commodities and replaceable.  All in all if the company is profitable and billability is high then employees are well compensated.  If billability is low then employees are the asset which is cut."
good,Good company to work for. Care about employees. Pay was good when I started 10 years ago but here I am still getting paid the same!  I am at my max within my category and there’s no growth for me here.
good,"CH2M was a great place to work, with a good management team, but the lack of pay was bad.  Otherwise, a great experience was had.  I would look at working with CH2M again in the future, if the pay was better"
good,"Diverse engineering work exposure including stress analysis, requisitions review and approval, isometrics sin and stamp for release to fabrication, support field engineering inquiries and resolve"
good,"Learned necessary tools to help me succeed in other fields of work.had a lot of patience with new employees and teaching them to work safely, and in an efficient manner."
good,"The only con that i could complain about is the fact that this company is considered a ""job shop"". Meaning, you must have a job number to charge your hours;  no overhead charging allowed. If there were no job charge numbers, you were more than likely laid off. Management didn't seem to take interest in moving valuable employees from one job to the next. More often than not, the employee would have to network to look for the next job charge number to ensure they weren't laid off."
good,Fast Paced/Competitive engineering consulting environment. Most offices have gone to open floor plan with no offices or cubicles.Flexible telework options.
good,"Jacobs in Greenville took on a project in Charleston, Tenn. to build a greenfield poly-silicon manufacturing plant for a Germany based company.  The role I had was as a design engineer with the HVAC department.  I was responsible for writing specifications for plant wide industrial ventilation systems, as well as P&ID development for HVAC/Utility distribution systems (i.e. chilled water, clean steam, compressed air, etc.). There was an entrenched management roster there, and it was difficult to establish a stable career track if you were not in close with the entrenched people, and they made it quite clear that outsiders were not welcome."
good,I enjoy working on the program that I currently do. I also appreciate the effort that my group puts in as a team. We all work hard towards our common goal and get projects accomplished successfully
good,"Moderate pace, helpful employees, a lot upcoming project uncertainty most of the time. Challenging and interesting work. Good atmosphere. Could be better on benefits."
good,Enjoyed my time there.  Had a poor manager at the time but he has since moved on.  Saddened that they did not build more on the upstream side of the oil and gas industry.
good,Jacobs has a lot of great policy's and procedures however there was too much red tape that became more a hindrance and time consuming than beneficial for the majority the project types that I was part of.
good,"the same people circulate between fluor, Jacobs, and Bechtel, It was an okay place to work, shoppers get short notice when laid off. I would go back. Located in a nice building in Mauldin."
good,Hard work was not always noticed showing up and being on-time was. That being on time made the management look good to the company they were working for in this case ADM in Clinton Iowa.
good,"Good co-workers, a fast paced environment for field operations of heavy equipment, aircraft dispatching and operations with telephone repair dispatch of outside plant on the North Slope and Anchorage areas.  Had to be detailed oriented, professional and help reconcillation data for a 200+ employee company."
good,Current position was offered and accepted due to my experience of 30+ years in piping/mechanical trades. Management does not fully allow for my experience. Given directions on how I must complete my tasks.
good,Jacobs was a good group to work for.  I did increase my understanding of instrumentation and was commissioning instrumentation for Exxon by the end of my tour with Jacobs.
good,"Minimum 10 hour 5 - 6 day shifts on turnarounds, very challenging work in a potentially dangerous plant environment. i loved the challenge and the job but in this environment with so many different trades the politics is a very big problem."
good,Did all work necessary to complete the task at hand. Management was great. Work place was competitive. Working overtime and throughout the night. Working at night.
good,"loved the aggressive ""go getter enviroment.  The benefits weren't the best high deductables. the co workers were very competative thats how i like it strong work environment ."
good,"Fast paced, stressful at times, and very competitive. Always plenty of work. Work place culture is ok. Hardest part of the job was working on Saturdays."
good,Cyclical market conditions in oil and gas creates uncertainty for long term employment and job security.  Heavily dependent on client satisfaction and client willingness to spend on operational improvements and capitol investments.
good,"Exciting to work for such a fast growing company, but work life balance is lacking. The company relocated HQ from Pasadena to Dallas so the whole corporate team is new which presents obvious issues."
good,"There seems to be better advancement and growth opportunities if you're an engineer versus other business support functions. Other than that, Jacobs is a good place to work overall. Managements seem to care about its people."
good,Long history of quality engineering service. Substantial American influence on company culture and staffing strategies. Excellent office location in Calgary Quarry Park.
good,Management needs to be changed up a bit other than that great place to work people are great to work with overall a decent company just wished they would pay more money starting out
good,"high salary, not much benefit. poor management. Have to find task for yourself after one is done too keep yourself busy and safe your position."
good,was able to perform quality survey jobs in a productive amount of time from the assistance from my other survey department information needed to obtain the proper data needed to accomplish the task
good,"Not a bad company to work for. The workload is pretty easy and the environment is relaxed. Raises are very hard to get and hard doesn't mean you'll get a raise. It is almost impossible to get fired, which means there is a lot of very bad workers that stick around and don't get punished. Sometimes they'll even get raises instead of you."
good,"I weldeed stainless and carbon steel pipe on a gas fired power plant that was a mulibillion dollar project in Utah that lasted about a year, it was fun and challenging, I really enjoyed it, I was proud of what I did."
good,"Jacobs contained many managers who had been there a long time, hiring and laying off persons on a job-by-job basis. Not much attention was given to job quality: their contracts were not continued for this reason. This led to their closing."
good,"Very good for learning. Freedom is available for responsibility. "
good,"Jacobs is a great place to work as long as the portfolio of billable projects is robust.  Unfortunately, they are quick to staff up when needed, but also quick to lay-off as projects come to a close.  They've often been referred to as a hire/fire company by many others in the industry."
good,My time with Jacobs was very educational.  I learned a lot as they gave me the opportunity when I didn't have very much construction experience for which I am eternally grateful.
good,"No supervision, learned a lot about Construction Management, great working hours, close to home, creating an office facility from the ground up, they showed favoritism in the workplace."
good,"I found that this company has a great employee benefit program.  However, this company was founded by 2 men who had a vision that contained ethics and morals.  I found that my experience with this company that many of the managers high up were not as ethical as the company boasted.  With a lot of the movement that was going on in management I found that as a ""boots on ground"" person that job security was always at risk.  I find that morale and positive role modeling needs to come from the top and somewhere it got lost in reaching the general employee."
good,"- Very professional and productive working place at Abu Dhabi office"
good,Great place to work and learn. Self management is allowed. Personnel all know how to design and how to complete projects. the benefits package is excellent
good,"Relationship based business model."
good,"Basic day in day out job, great people, great job, good money. Learnt to do certain activities, Mostly cleaning, Management was great and easy to get along with."
good,A good work place. Good people to work with. Fun at some times but is hard work at times. Get in get the job done and get out. Biggest thing is be safe and go home each day to ur family
good,"Their are many great people working for Jacobs; much integrity. However, top level managers seem disconnected and disinterested in personnel they direct."
good,Great culture and good company to work for.  Little strategy on career development for its employees.  Expensive health care and average PTO. The company offers a great work/life balance to its employees and very flexible.  The benefits are very expensive but salary is above average.
good,CH2M overall provides employees with leading edge strategies for success -- Not all departments share the same corporate views --
good,"Overall Jacob is about the employees, I was working for the DOD and most managers get the importance of treating the employees with respect.  But some managers don't understand the business model and are only concerned with short sighted customer interests.  Making sure you know the immediate supervisor has your back is a good idea before accepting a position.  For example one Division gave us a warning of a layoff and allowed us to find jobs within the company.  The new division gave us two weeks notice before letting a group of us go and made finding an internal switch impossible.  I wasn't upset because I knew the second set of management could care less about the employees and was more concerned about keeping us turning the hamster wheel.  In both cases I got what I expected."
good,"Good place to work. You must be multitask, ability to switch work very quickly. Nice environment. Learning new standards, possibility to interact with other companies."
good,"Co-workers are friendly, I learned a lot in this company.  Management is effective. There are all knids of social clubs inside the company such as Jacobs future, toast masters which is attractive for the young people"
good,"Interesting projects to work on."
good,"I worked as a process engineer for so many years but only with calculations and theoretical work, but at Jacobs I learned about actual process work in a plant. How all the equipment's are working and how to optimize it, re-rate it, how to replace part of the plant section without disturbing rest of the operation."
good,I am working with a great group of people and have meet several people that I would consider friends and great experience.
good,"Very Good and Healthy and Safe workplace with plenty of opportunity to Grew."
good,"Working in CH2M as full time consultant."
good,"Its been an excellent organisation to work along. Great work place ethics, motivating work place environment, had great co workers, learned new techniques everyday, however management needs to be more organised."
good,"Typical brown-field job, existing and running factory, modifications, renewals, small new parts to design."
good,"I enjoyed working with my colleagues and learned much more that I expected about the complicated, specialized business of Tolling Systems implementation, operations, and management.  My only engagement has been on the Washington Dept of Transportation (WSDOT) Tolling program, involved with much of the IT perspective on several projects.  While Jacobs and WSDOT embraced much of the best practices and perspectives that brought to the efforts, they are somewhat behind the curve on recognizing and utilizing data and business intelligence to support decisions and monitoring performance."
good,Jacob Engineering Is a global billion dollar global corporation.They are a very detail oriented company and there employees are the best asset.
good,"CH2M provides opportunities in nearly every city in the United States and has reaches throughout the globe."
good,"Half day Fridays, flex hours, good pay, not much for career advancement. New CEO and reorg should be a good thing for future employees."
good,"The People are Awesome to work with, with a professional manner and bearing.  They always keep a friendly face and I would work here again if possible"
good,People here are very friendly and helpful. Lots to learn from people who are more than willing to share their experiences.
good,"Please see resume, so much to cover. I work in engineering to lead projects to design complete. And may go the field site to do construction management to complete the construction project."
good,I got a chance to work with a bunch of people that knew the importance of team work and safety.I was given an opportunity to learn something new while making amazing pay from a friend of mine. I took the opportunity to experience something I otherwise would have never had a chance to do and it was great! We were contracted by ConocoPhillips to build high production oil batteries and oil wells. This company knows what they are doing and I am very grateful to have the experience that I did.
good,This is definitely one of the better contractors to work for. They definitely believe in safety. It was a all around good experience. I recommend this company to others.
good,Good placed to work co-workers always willing to help very safe place safety always number one priority. Management gets involve whit workers.
good,"Unfortunately, this employee-owned company does not show a consistant and strong support for it's employees.  There is a terrific culture of quality but it is not embraced and supported consistently at the project level and the bottom line drives all decisions. Opportunities are abundant, if you are willing to relocate.  The most important thing I have learned, here, is that you have to know when to say no."
good,"If you are assigned to a job, life can be very good.  However, if  you are between projects, it can be very challenging.  The people are great.  The management not so much."
good,"Nice people to work with, Good working environment, have regular working hours. Salaries and benefits are fair enough."
good,"Jacobs is a global engineering, design and construction management company with good employee relationship benefits and advancements. I would recommend Jacobs as a place to work."
good,"Updating the Contractor Data Requirements List (CDRL) Tracking Log. Writing Official Procurement Officer (PCO) Letters.  Tracking official Contractor and Government letters.Technical responsibility for interpreting, planning, organizing, executing and the coordination of system requirements, design, functional and physical attributes.   Capable of planning and developing projects concerned with unique or controversial items."
good,The office is comfortable and fairly clean.  Co-workers are friendly and fun to work with.  Very safety oriented which is very important to me.
good,Learned and developed management as well as technical skills
good,Great place to work. I wish I was still working there.  I enjoyed working with everyone and the diversity of projects is great.
good,Empresa con alto valor moral y buen manejo de administracion.
good,"When knowledgeable site management was in place, growth and success in all areas of the project excelled.  Staff supported each other, level of respect between departments was valued, there was an exceptional effort to recruit applicants who became long-term employees.  "
good,Check emails to start off my day.  I have learned 2 new software programs while working at Jacobs.  Co-workers are very intelligent and easy to work with.  Every day holds a new challenge; nothing is routine at this position.
good,"many opportunities to grow with this company, pays well and has excellent benfits"
good,"Jacobs as a company is great organisation to work with. Jacobs receives mostly overseas projects and  India office works as support office to lead overseas offices with very limited scope to reduce the cost of project. "
good,"Routine IT Management, working with a wide variety of industry and technical professionals."
good,I learned alot and worked on great projects.  Through out my time at Jacobs.
good,"A typical day-"
good,They have a strong client focus.  Mostly go after large to very large projects that may require staff to move around the country (or world).
good,"good company for experienced professionals."
good,Great place to learn the industry. Strict standards and a efficient management system. Great place to start a career.
good,The job itself is amazing however the work can really take a toll on you. Management could've used some help and the work was not very consistent.
good,this is not an IT company whice if it was may better serve my requirements
good,"Great team of folks "
good,"Since working on the north slope of Alaska I have gained extensive knowledge and skills not only hands on, but also on a social level. I work 12 hour days for 21 straight days with a wide variety of people from different parts of the world. I have learned to work together with these different personalities to operate and maintain a oil and gas facility in a very extreme environment. I communicate daily with management from my employer as well as the major oil company I am contracted to. I am able to keep a level mentality on a long work schedule while being thousands of miles away from friends and family. I thouroughly enjoy acomplishing tasks daily and on long term projects to better myself and the company."
good,"My job involves oversight of grantees that receive federal funding for transit projects.  I conduct Monthly Meetings, Quarterly Reviews, and Tech Reviews as required by the client.  I prepare monthly reports and technical reports based on the reviews conducted by the team I manage.  "
good,I like working on the Montgomery College Contract.  My co-workers are really good set of people to work with.
good,This is a company I would work for again.  They balance getting work done with making the employee feel like they are part of the companies success.
good,"Great company to work for, but the work culture is a little slow, and most of the work depends on available funding.  Great pay if your willing to work for a short period of time.  Overall a really good company with great benefits."
good,"Good employer"
good,Diverse projects ranging from government to petroleum and internal offices. Need to be self motivated.
good,"Company has a great culture. Company is global with 30,000 employees."
good,Not the place to work for more than a few years. There were a lot of promises made and they were not all kept.
good,Check in through gate and plan work day plus all work and safety hazzards. Be more safety contious of things around.Management and co-workers were pleasent to work with.The hardest part of the job was always remembering the safety first before doing a job.The ability to learn something new.
good,Good company; they just need to weed out some employees who take advantage of their power and authority.
good,"I had a clean working interment, Good teem members worked well with most of them. The trouble they have or had at the time was management was pore had big turn over with workers and management. In the time i was there we had went threw about 5 managers. I enjoyed working there and would like to work there again if management had changed."
good,Staff were good people but corporate management is not well entrenched in the day to day business development. Very strong on safety and staff training.
good,I enjoyed my time here and with the people that work there I also got to be part of something that bettered the area I lived in. It was a fast paced and challenging position and I enjoyed it all
good,"Es una buena empresa, pero en Chile faltan oportunidades para hacer carrera.  Muy buena dirección y gerencia.  Aprendí mucho de procesos mineros trabajando con varios de los ingenieros de mi equipo.  Se compartía información lo que ayudó al trabajo en equipo y generó buen clima laboral.  La parte más difícil del trabajo fue aceptar y equilibrar la vida laboral con el ego de algunas personas."
good,"Good company to work for.  Allows for an excellent work-life balance.  With few exceptions, working overtime is not common. Compensation is higher than in other companies and industries."
good,"You are settled at your workstation with a bin of everything you will need in order to do your job. There are a lot of procedures and processes that needs to be followed. You are expected to keep track of your own progress. There are a lot of interaction within the team, with the engineering team, vendors and the main client. Lots of knowledge and new skills that can be acquired."
good,"good leadership excellent environment"
good,"Professional place to work, allowed you to be part of a team. Gives you opportunity to show your abilities on a daily basis.  Gives you the chance to progress in your career."
good,"the work is normal for maintenance work, the people are great to work with. working at a city is a real leaning experience.  they have no problem buying parts or equipment a lot different from property's I've worked for in the past."
good,"I found Jacobs to be an excellent place to work.  There were opportunities for advancement, and there rates were competitive.  There is a great team spirit at the discipline level.  The work share environment towards the end of my time there was a challenge."
good,I love my job at Jacob's. I would recommend this place to anyone. Great work and home balance. Pays better than most jobs in my area. The benefits are great.
good,"One of the good engineering company having a heritage. Has been improving procedures, work processes which help in day to day activities. A lot of good and knowledgeable team members with whom you would like to work and enjoy your work and be proud of."
good,"Work life balance was what you made of it, finish your work and you were good to go. Compensation was fair, just not for the amount of work ended up on your lap. The faster you worked, the more work load you received. Job advancement was there if you were willing to relocate. Management at this specific location was not ideal."
good,Jacobs China Ltd is a good engineering company. it emphasizes the safety working procedures and has organized different departments. It sometimes has online training lessons for us to learn in which we can know more about work safety.
good,"Focused on Safety and Project Management. "
good,"Very good place. We were laid off shipping our positions to Krakow, Poland. Now, because new tax law imposition they have to return the procurement positions but they do not want to hire us back. I was an employee before Jacob acquired CH2M HILL, great company but  believe the CEO did not took the right decision, performance poor."
good,"Te kort gewerkt om veel te hebben gezien, door he doorgaan van een aantal projecten was mijn baan niet meer nodig."
good,Its easy to get to know people and make friends. There are ton of employee events. Workload and stress level depends on the group you work for. Its a massive company but I think it really tries to make employees feel welcome. Now I just wish they paid better.
good,The team members come to work everyday to make a difference for their clients.  Strong collaboration and commitment to do the right thing for their clients.
good,Some down time at the start of the job but once we got going we where busy. But the jobs dont last long maybe 3 weeks at the most. The people where good to work with and it was always that way.
good,You make good money and work mostly four ten hour days so that is kind of nice but the work is repetitive and exhausting. If you like working with your hands and getting a good workout this job is for you.
good,"Good people let you learn and helping you to grow in the industry, give the employees good motivation for be there working. Have a good safe environment and technical"
good,"Enjoyed working for Jacobs. Work was done by me and reviewed"
good,Very good environment and learning opportunities. A typical day at work is busy with lots of emails. Management is friendly. Workplace culture is good. The hardest part of the job is the constant change in the systems and the integration process.
good,Stressful @uncertain working hours. Some working conditions were difficult due to the quality of company tools. There were many places inside the plant that was dangerous due to the chemicals involved.
good,First over the road work. First job of its size for employer so learning curves were in play. Choice of supervisors was not given the most thought in some cases.
good,"poor management, no company procedures across the board, lack of leadership, hours were great, good benefits and salary, no advancement, you have to know someone."
good,"Being a very large engineering firm, Jacobs is consistently expanding to take on the demands of growth.  For those that enjoy ""movement"" within their position, this offers some fun and challenging opportunities to get involved in and grow from."
good,worked for jacobs for 7 months they were good to work for.  they care about safety and getting the job done right the first time.  I would recommend jacobs to work for
good,"Jacobs provided a modern work atmosphere and quality mentoring programs, designed for career advancement.  Projects were assigned based on personnel qualifications and applicable job description."
good,"Professional Environment, Good Management attitude."
good,It had great people to work with. Very good pay. Good benefits. Very good safety. The former were understanding about life outside work. Former were easy to talk. The parking was horrible way to many people. Manger were not understanding about some things
good,"I see this company not only as a positive work environment, but also as a good opportunity to have my skills and qualifications make a difference."
good,"Jacobs was a good place to work, good employees and lots of work. I was able to use my skills and knowledge to help clients address their needs and provide them with an efficient solution."
good,"CH2M was s good place to work. I learned about corporate graphic design, the company gave me my start and I loved working there. Jacobs bought it out and I was laid off so I don’t care for Jacobs. But CH2M I loved working for."
good,"12 Hour rotating shifts. Work both days and nights, even on holidays. Work is not complex but need understanding of the working conditions and environment."
good,Overall good place to work. Work flow and quality management needs some improvement. Training for young people in the craft level and entry level technical is poor. The hardest part of the job is working around a difficult system to get work done. I enjoy being allowed to work on my own.
good,"Very unorganized project- new management monthly. No guidance for when promoted, or raise. Very hard to work for on this particular project but I’m sure the company it’self is a great company to be a part of."
good,"Buwn ambiente de trabajo, excelente clima laboral,"
good,"Markets last for 6 months to 1 year. After that, you are required to move. Not a lot of room for advancement. Organization is departmentalized by location. Each region is ran differently."
good,"Jacobs Engineering Group was, mostly, good to me.  I describe the management as a ""little Washington DC"". The right hand did not know what the left hand was doing, but overall I liked it."
good,Great Safty culture work environment wasn’t bad. Could not keep enough good quiified people because of the pay.working projects and getting maintenance pay
good,You need to establish your own career path or find a mentor. The company does not define one.
good,"Job was okay. Decent pay and benefits. Regular working hours. Minimal career development though. Where you come in, is where you can expect to stay unfortunately."
good,Good safety culture. good work life balance. management was really good. id work for them again in the future if it was available to me! I was treated pretty good!
good,"At Jacobs, the main job there was designing of a SAGDI project. I enjoyed the design work for each areas I were responsible for, such as dynamic anaylsis for pump and conpressor foundations, blast resistance design for a building foundation."
good,"Learned a lot on the job and also in classroom. As an apprentice I was taught and trained in the fields of carpentry and electrical and gained a lot of knowledge in both trades"
good,"Unless you further your education there is no possibility for advancement. You simply get more seniority."
good,"Was an ""on site"" employee in Memphis, Tennessee area. Good people to work with. Had interaction with Louisville office. Only worker for Jacobs for 6 months. They lost contract to KBR."
good,"Good company, great benefits. "
good,"I spend about 2 years working at Jacobs and enjoyed working there. The work was very good and the people was really easy to work with, I would like to work there again."
good,"I worked a construction job through Jacobs, my first one. I was a Pipe Fitter Helper and it was in Louisiana. So in my case, it was hot and humid. They were good about keeping water around the job site, and they very heavily followed safety standards from OSHA. The one thing I didn't enjoy was the hard headed crew members all around. Real ""Man's Man"" type people who would disregard some safety guidelines so they could do things their way."
good,May not be the place you'll stay forever - but this company will introduce you to many aspects of your discipline. You will be expected to embrace a culture that is built on caring and being observant of risk to yourself and others.
good,"I would like to work with them again, I have worked with Jacobs 3 times, got very good reviews and pay raises but too many layoffs when the market turns down,."
good,"Relaxed, Good co-workers, a lot of support help. Provided tools and equipment to work with. Pay was a little bit low. Supervisor was good to work with."
good,"Veel geleerd voor offshore werkzaamheden"
good,A typical EPCM company with different projects (both India and abroad) hence get to know the engineering practices for different places. A  good place to work with.
good,"As I worked for this private contractor in the water treatment field or almost 5 yrs,  I began to notice that I had a career I enjoyed, one that if you did your job, unfortunate situations were mitigated for sure."
good,"Great people to work with; enjoyed the MEP engineers and many of the projects we designed were interesting. For some time, Management was not as I expected...but did improve just before I left."
good,An acceptable employer.  Great background in contract and project management.  Workplace culture--inclusive.  Great benefits. Company is constantly evolving.
good,Few people based in main office as the rest are spreadout to project sites. There are always activities related to safety and implementation of it. There is a sense of a second home.
good,Different experience working with people from other states. Good warm hearted people. I enjoyed working with them even though it was a contract job. I learned a lot from this job.
good,"Jacobs was a good place to work.  The work culture and reviews were fair, competency was high.  There was  stratification in the internal structure that made movement between internal silos difficult."
good,The complex is very large and many many employees.  It may be very difficult for advancement. Not sure if I would like to return to Jacobs.  Location not to great either.
good,"Great passion and pride in the projects employees are working on. Great coworkers, caring and respectful. Recognition programs in place for those that go above and beyond. Very modern as they have a social media presence. Diverse staff and very inclusive."
good,One of the lead project management firms in Houston.  Great to work for when large institutions have expansion or bond programs.  Mainly commercial/industrial projects.
good,"If you land a job as a contractor with Jacobs you know that you may or not be with them if and when they lose the bid whenever that gets competed again.  Depending on the project you're in you might end up doing much of nothing but pretending to be busy or working your butt off.  It's the luck of the draw.  Overall the benefits and pay are very good...save money, you may need it later!"
good,It was the companies first stab at Telecommunications in the Eastern PA area and myself and 8 others got the project off the ground and it grew to over 4 markets and 250 employees
good,"On the whole, Jacobs is a great place to work. There is access to just about any field of endeavor out there. "
good,This company hires a lot of engineering disciplines.  There are a lot of very talented individuals working there.  A fair amount of travel is expected.
good,Overall a good job with good people but of course nothing is perfect as we all know. In some cases there could be more tools and access to parts in a moretimely manner.
good,"Onsite with customer, a typical day involved frequent interface with customer to determine/prioritize activities.  I learned how to juggle responsibilities for multiple hardware platforms under the greater Future Combat Systems umbrella.  Corporate tasks and interfacing are always challenging when working onsite due to separation from the routine activities, especially when separated by hundreds of miles.  Working onsite is especially rewarding due to being included in the customer culture."
good,"Working directly with our Client was enjoyable.  Challenges were following Jacobs & Client's procedure.  "
good,"The company is very well respected and has a employee based culture. As with any company that contracts it's employees to another company, the profit margin can supersede providing a salary that is appropriate to position and performance."
good,"This company, and this project in particular provided professional challenges in a rewarding and productive atmosphere. The opportunity to learn new skills and techniques abounded."
good,This was the best job I ever had. Worked with some great people and did quality work.  The money was great and time off to do whatever you want. Its not good for people with young children because you will be gone for several weeks at a time but if you are empty nesters or single it is great.
good,"on the two projects sites that I worked on  the first one at the coors brewery was very stable environment a great friendly facilities and work place personal out standing. the Coors Brewery offered its own set of safe guards with all its indurstrial hazards in the work,grain dust anhydrous ammonia,along with all the hvac issues.                                                     the other location with Ch2mhill was on the north slope of Alaska on the point Thomson project subbed out to Exxon Mobile a supper great environment with all the positive attitude on safety .No one gets hurt. on site work out facilities.safe living quarters .the flights to and from Anchorage were done very well ,time schedule's great detail.Based on weather and safety of the passengers.Check in time,correct PPE for the harsh Alaskan life style.Attention to personal well being on the north slope."
good,"La empresa estaba bien organizada, estaban bien definidos los cargos y los alcances de cada uno."
good,"Days went in fast due to the busy nature of the job trying to meet deadlines."
good,"I've been at Jacobs for 1 yr. working with a great PM Team. I've enjoyed the company culture and their flex hours. However since the work is strictly contract based, it's a headache once the contract ends and the only option to remain an employee is to relocate."
good,"There was a culture of caring in the workplace, wherein employers and employees built a personal relationship with safety, and to take responsibility for safety not only for their own selves but for others as well. Respect for people and environment was greatly emphasized and courage to demonstrate care."
good,"great teams to work in, make you feel like a family member. colleagues really take care of each other in terms of work load and personal support."
good,I have work with and for a very good group of people while at Jacobs. I have accomplished a lot during my time there. Jacobs always provide the tools to do the job and the tools to do your job safely.
good,Jacobs is a company with a highly experienced and knowledgeable workforce within their Engineering and Design personnel. Unfortunately they have chosen to Offshore 80+% of engineering and design.
good,At the corporate office the schedule is Mon-Thur 9 hours and Fri 4 hour work days. It was also very flexible with making up time. The benefits are not that great as compared to other companies but they aren't terrible either.
good,"management is only interested in moving up though, that means blaming you for their mistakes to make them look good even though you did all their work for them anyways...."
good,"Working with jacobs was overall a very positive experience.  I worked with a group of helpful, intelligent, friendly people.  Jacobs allowed its employees to flex their schedules to a certain extent so that we could work our forty hours easier.  We were treated as adults who knew our responsiblities and were given enough freedom to act accordingly.  The hardest part of the day was lining up the resources to work the larger jobs."
good,"Good, knowledgeable people around. Always learning new things and working as a team. Economy went down and layoffs went up."
good,A typical day would be 4 hours of field inspection and the rest would be spent in the office writing reports. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team which supports and complement each others' effort in getting the job done and that makes working easy and productive at the end of the day.
good,"They treat you nice, safety oriented, clean, but do not pay or advance people very well or frequently if at all. The Ford facility and staff are great coworkers.  Often felt forgotten by Jacobs they talk a lot about their other branches but not very much is said about their Technology group (automotive)."
good,"the work environment was always safe and secure, the bosses and management explained the safety rules and job duties great, the only bad thing is that there are alot of layoffs"
good,Allows professional growth and set hours. This position also allows travel.  Overall a good organization with good management when they are available.
good,"Jacobs tries to have a culture of caring, but are bound by a lot of Government red tape, since they are a Government Contractor.  "
good,Company profile is better than  other companies. Working environment is very comfortable. Company giving special training on safety and quality.
good,"Jacobs is a productive company where what you do on a daily basis is predictable for the most part. The management is good, they want to get things done. The engineers do a good job of staying focused on their job. The most enjoyable part of the job are the periodic 4 day weekends we get."
good,"This company is great if contracts are won. Work depends on how many contracts are won by Jacobs. If no contracts, layoffs are soon to follow."
good,Worked through the cold months and the office is nice and easy. I enjoyed my co workers. Very complicated daily input for payroll.
good,"Ten hour work day, Seven days a week. Plenty of overtime, management was fair and accessible with open door policies. Co-workers willing to help in any way possible."
good,It was a hot/muggy job but the management made sure everyone was safe. The pay was good and so were the benefits. I liked my co-workers.
good,"Company is low on work load"
good,"I have worked here for ten years, and made some good friends. It is unfortunate that our facility was not able to make money."
good,"A nice place to work but training is not that good."
good,Good large corporation.  Reasonable benefits package. Competitive Salaries.  High level technical work. Excellent support staff to provide employees with their benefits.
good,Interesting work and I was able to travel that is important to me.  I was able to use my knowledge base to make a difference in my work load.  I was able to me new people and go new and interesting places.  I enjoyed the team concept and the way CH 2 M Hill treated the employee.
good,Very good place to work. A profesional environment. It was a very good experience that I had working for Jacobs.
good,"Great benefits, work environment and colleagues; CH2M HILL has one of the best basis for work environments and places to work."
good,"Jacobs has great people to work with.  With the variety of disciplines there is always room to learn new things.  Deadlines let you work at a self pace. It is a multicultural environment and makes people feel comfortable, regardless or origin."
good,It was fun to work with the cadets and coaches at USAFA but it was for a contract period with no guarantee of keeping the job when contract went to another contractor.  Consequently I was terminated when new contractor Aleut took over  as of end of Oct. 2014
good,"I do not have routine at work, because sometimes I have a lot of work to do and sometimes I do not."
good,"This is a contracting agency so there is little to no need to go to headquarters. The benefits are good, annual salary increases are nice, incentive programs. The only negative is the company is very large and corporate feeling."
good,"A vast, International, engineering consultancy. I work in highways and transport and get to work on a range of projects; residential, commercial and leisure projects for private and public sector clients."
good,"I learned how to multi-task under a lot of pressure."
good,"It was a Good Experience to Work with Jacobs Singapore."
good,"Not much to say, it is a contract position so other direct hires treat you different."
good,"Daily construction monitoring on contractors daily progress"
good,"Since working here ive learned how to install and modify cable tray, bend and run conduit, terminate, and pull cable. The hardest part of this job would be the language barrier between myself and many employees as many of them only speek spanish. Lately we have been installing the lighting and that has been very enjoyable. Most of all I enjoy staying busy."
good,Working as a contract engineer and was treated no different than a direct employee.
good,"Good place to work. Safety is considered as one of the most important aspect here and is inculcated thoroughly."
good,"No complaints, great place to work, interesting assignments, great culture, but not very stable long term unless you don't mind world travel to stay employed."
good,Enjoy working here but reached maximum growth. Hours fluctuated from days/swing/nights/weekend. Military testing/training
good,"Provide site level coordination and supervision of work crews,"
good,"É uma empresa desafiadora, com ótimos projetos e equipe qualificada."
good,"We work for overseas clients such as Shell, BP, Exon etc. Quality is main criteria for providing deliverables. we provide design optimization & value plus to clients."
good,"Simple down and dirty review.  This place as a contractor is nice, you learn that the gov't employees run the place generally but need contractors to actually make things happen.  The pay and co-workers make this place hard to leave.  But there was very little to no room for advancement in my position.  I had two positions in the same area under the same company and I felt I learned a lot from both.  One was menial labor that required time management, strength and dexterity.  The second and last job required thinking out of the box, analysis and learning the art of technical writing.  I succeeded in both because I kept my mind open to ideas and kept trying to be the individual people come to."
good,"A great place to work. Most of shift is spent watching the drums fill to the desired level. working with a good crew makes it easy. The hardest part is finding more to do, but at the same time making sure you're preforming as expected. And then when your shift end there is no reports of incidents."
good,100% billability is required. When there's work everything is good. Flexible hours 6:00am thru 7:00pm. In the right team support is provided to learn and succeed.
good,Worked at Jacobs as part of the ETASS contract at Hanscom AFB. Work was enjoyable but no career progression or advancement seemed likely.
good,"Project Engineering at ESCG consists of a large amount of coordinating between various organizations within the company, with the outside suppliers, and other NASA organizations."
good,work in the arctic where it can go from nice to getting stuck in the truck for a few hrs.
good,"My career at Jacobs Technology was quite enjoyable in many aspects. Most notably they hire quality people, both in skill set and character. Another aspect of Jacobs Technology that I found appealing was their style of management. There is a low scale of micromanagement. As a manager myself I find this to be more professional. As a team member I believe there should exist, a sense of accountability but not babysitting."
good,This was a great environment to work in. I found it to be an excellent place to learn the field of architecture while going to school for my masters.
good,"Lab work was fun taking a schematic and making hardware interfaces into a world class computer system for the follow on spacecraft to Space Shuttle, called the Orion spacecraft."
good,"Working as a contractor for the US Army on the DoD network, much of the day-to-day challenges and frustrations (which are significant) are not due to Jacobs but the customer (Army). The ratings provided are based on Jacobs the company and are not an assessment of the army as a consumer of contract labor."
good,"I worked in turn for two Hanscom AFB program offices while employed by Jacobs Technology, and the program offices set the daily tone of the work. Both program offices were meeting-heavy with a substantial amount of never-ending internal and external review. When combined with the Jacobs Technology review requirements, it sometimes made it hard to ""do your work."" Juggling these responsibilities often became very demanding and at times not at all enjoyable."
good,"Jacobs Engineering is a great company to work for, however the management is not the best. Management lacks the proper education to lead a team."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of document control and data entry, filing and records management."
good,"1. Responding to the Request for Proposals (RFP) from Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology industry, R&D Firms, Authorities and Universities."
good,"Since this is an engineering design company, the work is technically intensive. This provides for opportunities to learn and I have found senior colleagues to be very helpful in explaining and teaching concepts. Co-workers are generally great and the company fosters a respectful work environments. Wages are generally competitive."
good,They offered me 30% less than I was making with the same job before they took over the contract and offered 0 days paternity leave for fathers.They did however allow a woman work 100% remote/telecommute indefinitely once she had her baby.
good,It was a 7 day a week construction project so we did not have a good Job Work/ Life Balance.  Turn over was very high and retaining empoyees was rough.
good,"Jacob is a very large company, and an individual is just a number. on numerous occasions I raised advanced warnings regarding the project I was working on, I discussed it with my superiors but nothing was done, two years later the problems surfaced which I had identified to my superiors those problems could have been averted if action would have been taken.."
good,"Not applicable as we are Working for a client, so this review can not be provided, but at Jacobs Offices we heard that they are having a good working environment with a good  work life balance."
good,Great working environment and working culture. I have gained a lot of experience on both professional and management levels from my team members. Flexible hours work schedule released a lot of pressure  in driving and taking car of personal issues..
good,"productive work place, quite place, busy, helpfull. Uasslly open at 6:30 and at weekend. mostly no work on weekend especislly need overtime based on project scheduel."
good,"I learned a lot for almost 5 years of working in Jacobs, the management was very cooperative and supportive, working atmosphere is good and productive"
good,Had a great manager that would bend over backwards to help out. Had a great group of coworkers. Workplace was going downhill before I got let go. No communication between disciplines. Upper management did not seem up the task that needed to be done.
good,Working environment is good but pay is less for pget. Have 20 paid leave. 7 Casual and sick leave. Good team of technicals. Very keen in quality deliverables on time
good,"I got to work on some interesting projects with some smart people. It did seem like it was easy to get pigeonholed into one role or market (though I can see the benefit for this from an executive standpoint.) Pay and benefits seemed about average. It felt like you were on your own to find billable work, and towards the end of my tenure there they were not letting people use overhead, and you would instead have to use PTO balance if you didn't have project work which was lousy."
good,Personally i am not paid as much as i feel i should be getting but its not far off from my desired rate. The company has done very well as far as keeping me employed and providing me with training. I have learned a lot and gained much experience over the years
good,"Overall Jacobs is a fast moving company. Enjoyed working with the very talented staff. Because we were a consultant, flexibility wasnt great, but ok. A few bad actors come on board and really ruined it all. Kind of tough to network within Jacobs surprisingly."
good,"As a flagman, you need to be alert at all times for trains passing through your work area. You're in charge of all workers safety by making sure everyone and all heavy equipment is in the clear of passing trains."
good,If you need a job in a hurry and this is a place to go.They always have openings and if you have the cerendtials they are willing to give you a chance.
good,I enjoyed making friends and learning quite a bit over at Jacobsen they were pretty flexible with my schedule and it was always a good place to open up about salary and they knew how to help move up in the company.
good,"Great opportunities and experience with a leading EPC company. A company that takes its responsibilities to its clients, employees, and the community seriously."
good,"The whole team were great individuals that worked really well together, the only down fall of the job was the rate of pay. Safety was a primary concerns at the company, if there was anything we needed they allowed us to buy it with company cards or they ordered it for us."
good,Very professional environment with nice benefits and pay. Intense pre-screening for position as well as drug test and background checks.  Company requires a very high caliber of professionals.
good,Secure company to work for but has limited room for growth on the staff side.  Compensation and Benefits were below industry average.  My work group was committed to providing a quality product and were a great group of people to work with.
good,"Flexible friendly workplace contributing to willingness to go to work at Jacobs each and every day"
good,Able to provide input and recommendations. Implement new strategies to support workforce while developing skills. Provided continuing education relevant to job.
good,Jacobs Engineering has survived well in difficult times as the management changed the business strategies from time to time keeping the core values.  Management has encouraged the employees to speak up and give freedoms to do their works.
good,"Es una gran empresa, en la que a pesar del poco tiempo en que estuve aprendí mucho. Grato ambiente laboral."
good,Overall the workplace is not bad. Changes have been occurring causing some concerns but even through this the work environment is not bad. Gym on site is a bonus.
good,"Enjoyed the independent work culture."
good,"Jacobs was nice place to work with occasional overtime. the people I worked with were nice, professional, and worked well together. As a team we worked well the client."
good,"Remove faulty equipment and reinstate."
good,"Good company to work for. Staff and QA/QC department have a very ""can do"" attitude. Staff CM management are knowledgeable about their job and are willing to listen to the QA Department."
good,"Pay is very good! You get good benefits and PTO according to how long you have been with company. You can choose your hours (6-2, 7-3, etc)"
good,Was laid off due to inability to use 3D programs. At age 64 3/4 I had difficulties with memory and was unable to become proficient with these programs.
good,I worked a 40 hour week. We could work 4 10's or 5 8's. I preferred the 4 10's. Jacobs is a very large company. They are all over the world. They have a great benefits and salary was very comparable to what other companies were paying. I worked with Jacobs 3/02 to 12/06 and again 10/12 to 8/14. Construction can be a hard field when it comes to job employment. Once you have finished a project you wait for the next project to start.
good,": No comment."
good,"The management group I worked for was very supportive of the employees. Everybody was part of the family at the project, even contractors. When there was a need they were there to provide the assistance needed."
good,"CH2M Hill Academy Services, LLC was good to work for, however, when they lost the BOS contract for the United States Air Force Academy they ceased to exist as an LLC."
good,"I've rated Jacobs based on my observations in Kolkata office, but it could be different among other offices varies with perspectives of individual. As far as I concern Jacobs House in Mumbai is way good than Kolkata."
good,Job expectations were clear and understandable. Skill advancement was limited only by the employee. The days and schedule were fairly predictable and the pay was high for the industry.
good,"This company is overall a great place to work. It offers a great work life balance and the employees are great to work with. The workload, however, is inconsistent, and varies based on the time of year and if clients have needs for improvement or upgrades to their facilities. For that reason, the job security of this industry is not as high as engineering is likely perceived to be in online articles. Half the jobs in engineering are in manufacturing, and the other half is consulting."
good,Company has given me opportunity to work on new job position from project administration to project  cost control.  The management treat women staff equally and we freely to voice our opinion and suggestion.  My job scope has given me experience to work  and  deal with many projects across Asia and working in diversity culture. I was happy on the empowerment given to me including guidelines to perform task which involve different countries (tax & billing) and i performed better.  The most i like as a working mother was the flexible working hours and empathy from my superior.
good,Good Place to work. They give you as many hours as you want and dont question them. I could work 80 hrs/week if i wanted to. the management was good and so were the people. building a methanol plant was very interesting.
good,"Have worked at other large engineering companies so I felt right at home, Some of my coworker were friends from other assignments."
good,"Great work environment and awesome management!"
good,"I worked there when VECO was bought out by CH2M-Hill, who was recently merged with Jacobs Engineering. I have no idea what the company is like now, as too many changes have occurred."
good,The company was a bit more organized then the previous ones. Pay was great with possibility of OT. Good safety standards and good management and workers.
good,A great place to work and learn. Safety and quality before schedule emphasized. I met a lot of great people who took pride in their work. The facilities were clean and equipment up to date.
good,"Trabajé 26 años en esa empresa que pasó por diversos dueños, la última administración correspondiente a Jacobs ha sido una de las peores administraciones ya que no se ha incorporado a la participación del ""core team"" de aquellos profesionales con mayor experiencia profesional para la presentación de ofertas técnicas dentro del área de especialidad de la empresa que es la minería del Cobre y Oro."
good,"Excellent open door policy, good planning,no advance ment, training program needs working on ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,..,......,........,........"
good,"decent pay, good hours, good co workers to work with. had a good experience with the company. would go back if they were hiring again. learned quite a bit with them"
good,"My boss encouraged my eagerness for self-advancement.  I learned team leadership, project scheduling, structural design, public speaking via toastmasters. I will forever be greatfull for my time there."
good,"I enjoy working for Jacobs but I would like to find a more permanent position within the company. There are a few people who I do not enjoy working with but for the most part, everyone works hard and we get the job done and have fun too."
good,I loved to show up every day was a great atmosphere. Learned something everyday worked safe and tried to demonstrate leadership skills the shifts were long and days but something that could handle
good,"I was stationed at a new Ford breadboard lab. Since it was new, there were quite a few things that need to still be worked out, like the specific tasks delegated."
good,I am not qualified to comment on the company at large as I was there for temporary assignments.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Jacobs.  it was fast paced at times, but the office atmosphere was always pleasant.  Management could have been a little better."
good,"Didn't work there long."
good,It was just a summer job but I did enjoy working there. The job where doing was Haz-Mat clean up. They provided all the equipment and safety material we needed.
good,Excellent place to work and learn different trades. Safety is top notch and very productive. Great company to work together as a team and get things done I a timely manner.
good,Been here for 2.5 years and have grown into a higher position. Company considers their employees one of their highest assets and promote training opportunities.
good,This job was fun as long as your contract is viable.  When that was no longer the case welcome to the unemployment line.  Contracts are year to year.  Good luck.
good,"You work with another company at their location. They make you feel like you're not a contract employee or work for a different company than the guy next to you, but the lower pay makes you feel like you're just cheap labor sometimes."
good,Jacob is a good place to work  long  days  lots of  lifting  and manual labor always outside work so dress warm in winter  there is 4 supervisor and only one Labour so your always busy and responsible for solo income and outgoing merchandis.
good,I enjoyed working at Jacobs. I work for a month or maybe two months until testing has been completed. The days are Monday through Friday and usually 10 to 12 hour days working outside in the elements. Confidentiality is a must and I am currently going through a background investigation for a security clearance. I just need to work more hours and more days.
good,"Culture de l'entreprise ! top"
good,Ótimo empresa para se trabalhar no estrutura e ambiental favorável para execução dos trabalhos.
good,I worked for this boss more than once. I think he is a fine fellow and good engineer. Enjoyed the work very much. Was disappointed to see the company (Upstream Division) run out of work.
good,Excellent company to work for and great leadership. I enjoyed the position and the management. I learned skills there that I will use throughout my life.
good,Nothing stays the same in the Artic so each day brought new challenges to you work schedule. Seeing the northern lights and working with people that will become family is a great plus for any job.
good,Being a large construction company there are many ways to advance and relocate / travel to new places. Great place to learn and manage projects of all nature.
good,Star time on the morning  two hours driven check in take transportation to the site job bring a safety meeting fine side job pure barricade a round check machinery  and star working
good,Flexible time that is it is permissible to come in on job any time and and get off from office provided you complete prerequisite daily working hours-very positive aspects for free from work stress.
good,"Back when it was CH2M HILL in 96', just before the new corporate building was constructed, we had a great leader and a small team of talented individuals from PM's, proposal coordinators, editors, writers, marketing, graphic designers to production staff. With all these talents we created a Business Development Services department companywide. Being part of that great team of individual is what made going to work a pleasure."
good,"This was a great place and position to learn numerous skills. Many people willing to assist in the process plus work with government agencies.  "
good,"CH2M Hill employees are highly professional with sound technical knowledge, diverse backgrounds and good ethics. CH2M has good projects to work for. Also the management is not hierarchical."
good,"It is a great place to work and learn. People are friendly. Safety is always first. Since I am the Piping Engineering Lead for both Tesoro refinery and TRC refinery, the work loads have kept me very busy throughout the day. The Company provides many training courses and other activities to help employee for work and life enhancement."
good,At this time in the process I do not wish to write a review about my company.  It is a typical engineering firm. There is not much to say. Day at work - come to work and review emails and requests - process and manage information.
good,"As it was ran by my uncle, i felt very comfortable every work day. it was carpentry so it was hard work, but i was paid very well, all based on the job and what we made on it."
good,"It was very long days to spend in office."
good,A good place to work with many benefits.  There is little to no room for advancement when it boils down to it.  I would recommend Jacobs to any and everyone that think that they are qualified.
good,"easy, laid back place to work but don't expect to get any raises at all. hard to get even 20 cents out of them let alone an actual raise worth some merit."
good,Coordinate with all discipline managers for work need to be done and any requirements for not finishing on time etc. Also coordinate with International clients on works.
good,Jacobs is a good place to grow.  Jacobs provides a place where you can learn and grow into your role.  There are a lack of options for upward mobility so one would have to create a niche for oneself and use that to their advantage.
good,Excellent folks and honest work environment.  The supervisor has an energetic and professional appeal to all of the folks he works with.  Knowledgeable and willing to work extra hours to research and study tough work situations.
good,I spent all my working days at Shell Oil office working on offshore production FPSO and only visited Jacobs office for required company meeting and classes. The FPSO issue  were corrected and Shell Oil handled all warranty problems.
good,good place to work at. Easy to get along with people. Would work there again if the opportunity exists.I worked there 2 years and never had a problem.
good,"Many of the hitches were 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off.  The time off was great, though it was not paid. There were slow times when new contracts had yet to be started. The company is very safety conscious."
good,"Working @ Jacobs over the 16 year period for the most part was a pleasant experience. "
good,Good place to work good money. Worked here for very long time good company but managers need to learn better people skills. Company is good working around your needs which they did for me when I had my children
good,"Assist customers with technical layout of their programs, to make sure their program resides to the proper hosting location.  Coordinate technical meetings with PMO and Vendors to discuss any outstanding issues."
good,"I loved working here, amazing projects... not so good team leadership. They laid me off 2 months after coming back to work from a broken back. I do not believe they cared at all about me personally."
good,"I worked here for over seventeen years. Great group of coworkers, flexible and telecommuting is an option for some. Room for growth and advancement..."
good,"lots of good people, good work attitude. Flexible work schedule. Jacobs work assignments somewhat to employee's choice. high culture of safety. The effort to work-share with India office is sometimes difficult to deal with."
good,"safety is the top priority  which it should be and like the extra training to better myself nccer first company to offer advancement. i really "
good,It has a gym where you can workout during lunch break or whenever you are stressed from your work. The workplace culture is fantastic. They have Jacobs school on line where you can take trainings on line and they offer management and leadership training.
good,"This company takes care of its staff. The most difficult part is the temporary nature of the work. Once a job is finished, the staff member must be mobile, or willing to travel."
good,"Hardest part of the job is that I travel a lot up to United Utilities in Warrington. "
good,"Everyday begins with a safety meeting discussing the prior day and what's expected to take place on the current day. Safety is extremely well and taken very seriously. The lunch tents are always nice, the superiors listen and take in your suggestions. The schedules are always subjective to change, I would say that's the hardest part of the job at times."
good,"typical construction welding workplace. "
good,"Proffessionals here in Jacobs delhi are working in shadow. Inspite of having world class skill set with cheap man hour rates, this office has cribbed for jobs many times."
good,"The people at Jacobs are great. Everyone is always willing to help and give you a hand when you are working with something new. Consulting can be a stressful business, but everyone there handles it well for the most part."

good,"Attending meeting , inspecting materials ,testing and writing reports"
good,"Company is great to work for."
good,"1)Highly experienced team "
good,"Typically your days at work are straight forward. Very routine in what you do. Always new aspects of the job to learn every day as there are so many opportunities. Management were great to work with. Co workers: great team players. The hardest part of the job was being exposed to the weather conditions all year round, as is an outside job environment."
good,Great company but management doesn't back up it's employees. The client is always right.
good,At a typical day of work I shadowed various engineers and learned their responsibilities. I also learned basic communications skills that are necessary when working in a professional setting. The hardest part of my job was retaining all of the information that was being told to me but I found different ways to deal with this problem that proved to be successful. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with my coworkers and learning the responsiblilties of a mechanical engineer.
good,Management was good at providing feedback.  Coworkers were great.  Communication about state of contract could be better and compensation didn't line up with advancement.

good,Subject to federal budget constraints. Budget and positions vary year to year.
good,- Well managed and highly structured
good,I have enjoyed the time I have worked at Jacobs. The only downside I have found is the lack of upward movement for Administrative Assistants. The people are some of the best I have ever worked with. The management team takes care of their employees.
good,"I typically work 40-50 hours per week. Everyone I've worked with seems very competent at what they do. Being that the projects are very large, fast paced, and demanding, it requires good communication and cross-discipline coordination. If one is a fresh out of school grad, they should definitely team up with a mentor to show them around and coach them in the work processes, otherwise, they might feel lost for a while and not be too productive. Working on these type of large, fast paced projects requires one to have alot of initiative and not be afraid to ask questions when they don't know something."
good,"I'm on a project so the per diem is real nice and they let you travel home every two weeks, but of course this depends on the client, not Jacobs. If your not based out of a busy office then you just live project to project, but you can find real good pay in spots. They are trying hard to place me somewhere else in the company, but I'll have to move somewhere."
good,"Strong global firm with strong backlog and good people working for the firm. If you don't know the answer, there is enough structure, process, and support to help figure it out."

good,"I like everything about Jacobs.  Very Professional and friendly people and will work with others anytime."
good,"I have positive memories when recollecting the circumstances and harsh climate we endured. But the managements abilitity to interact and demonstrate its dedication towards its employees has no match. Till today I can admit, that my very own fundamentals came from the experience and expectations forged.on that cold hill"
good,"It’s a great company to work for, but as with all construction companies it’s not a permanent position. So you do find yourself looking for work quite often."
good,"Good benefits and lots of opportunities to grow and learn new skills.  I thoroughly enjoyed the travel perks, i.e. per diem rate, hotel, air and rental travel rewards."

good,"I love my job with Jacobs, and if this job was located by a city I would stay. Fort Huachuca is a hard pill to swallow. That is the nature of government contracting though. I personally have a great manager and a good team who works for me. I know that isn't the case for other areas of the facility I work at though."

Hardest part of job was not knowing if I would ever be hired.  They want people to keep a work/life balance, but sometimes give mixed messages by overloading work.  Enjoyed learning many new processes and working with people around the world."

good,"Since I was a contractor, the work environment etc all depended on what company you were contracted to.  But as far as the Jacobs personnel themselves they were good people who were helpful.  I would recommend working for them."

good,Good place to work for someone looking to get experience and start a career in a technical field or get a job at one of the companies they provide workers for. They will try to pay as little as possible though. Time off is accumulated at about 4.5 hours per pay. Paid vacation for most holidays.
good,"not a bad place to work "
good,My day consisted of first thing in the the morning getting permits signed to perform the job for the day. Once the permits would get signed we would began performing the job task for the day..
good,"Jacobs had a very detailed training course which helped out a lot when I started on the production floor. They were very safety oriented and very well organized. Jacobs had nice facilities, equipment and supplies to work with. All in all  give Jacobs a 4/5."
good,Overall a good place to start your career. A friendly and caring environment. You get all the perks of being in an MNC. Not much pressure work wise. Pick bus available on many routes. Only problem is very slow growth in terms of career development.
good,"It was a good place to work. Good safety culture."
good,Its a good environment but needs more communication within the company.  They were excellent at education and helping me get NCCER.   No reason for layoff as I just worked OT and they are still on OT
good,"Great company to work in good working atmosphere teams are coordinating with all disciplines.co-workers are very friendly."

good,"The company culture is great. I was not able to gain full time employment because there was not a full time position available in my field, but if I were offered a full time position I would take it. I am definitely a fan of Jacobs and how they treat their employees."
good,"Professional engineers and management, high knowledge in each professional discipline."

good,"I enjoyed my experience at Jacobs at Dow Plaquemine.  It was a very friendly place and safety was a major priority. Supervision did rush or push employees to make you feel hurried. From the site superintendent on down, they  made feel like you were part of the team."

good,Un ambiente de trabajo estupendo. Muchos proyectos importantes
good,"Busy workload which is great, but hardly any down time in between projects to archive files and do research to improve on practices due to a reluctance to use G&A(overhead)."
good,Seems that there is not much internal advancement and once your position is over they do not assist in helping you find other work. The management at my job site at the VA G=Hospital in Aurora was excellent and provided me with valuable experience in hopes of continuing my employment at Jacobs. Even though Jacobs has a regional office in Denver it seems they do not place a priority in obtaining work to keep the employees in the area.
good,It was a great starting point for my career.  I was able to expand and grow as an individual and as a contractor within the government thanks to the guidance of Jacobs.
good,"Jacobs recognizes your contribution and gets you groomed for the next challenging role.The work culture is good,it allows you to learn and take up difficult assignments with the support form the management."

good,"The job is a food way to get introduced to the plant life, and provides on the job training for switching and loading rail cars. It also has good supervision."
good,"I enjoyed the work at Jacobs, but my immediate supervisor, who is no longer in that position, was very difficult person to work for."
good,"My experience with Jacobs has been a great learning experience in terms of Planning/Scheduling. They have given me a chance to grow and prosper. However, I feel that the elevation in my career at ExxonMobil as a Planner/Scheduler has reached it's peak and there isn't any more room for advancement."
good,"10 hour work days working 4 x 10 for forty hours. Overtime was available. Schedule of work was easy going. Good opportunity to learn case management, report writing, and reports to client.

good,"Jacobs is a large engineering firm, involved with mostly Oil and Gas projects. Projects range from multi-billion to small projects. Jacobs has an organized system of coordinating documents that enables them to run projects through very quickly. "
good,"You could see traces of what used to be an excellent company to work for.  By the time I had started, corporate had become too concerned with protecting overhead costs, and were cutting back on the things that made it a good place.  My direct management was fine, but the high ups just had no idea, and were only concerned with the stock price.  You did get to work on some cool projects, but sometimes work was hard to come by and you were asked to take time off instead of charging to overhead."
good,A typical day at work here is to unload raw material into storage tanks. I learned a lot of thing working here especially to work safe and always wear the proper personal protective equipment. Management at this company is fair. Working outside is the workplace culture and working in extreme cold and extreme hot temperatures is the hardest part of the job.
good,"Lot's of opportunity for young engineers.  Unfortunately, I was unable to travel.  Good company.  Wouldn't hesitate to work for them again."
good,I loved working in this fast paced action filled construction project with Jacobs sorry that there was no new assignment for me once the project came to an end.
good,"I enjoyed working for Jacobs.  Management team members were committed to SAFETY, and were responsive to employees.  The primary issues during my employment resulted from the nature of the contract, and not with Jacobs as a Company."
good,"Too long hours, lot of heavy lifting of frozen product and specify route taken to all location  also need to stop at all cash and carry to buy the stock necessary for the order."

good,"Analysts in the lab work quickly, both individually and in a group, to analyze environmental samples. Each person is responsible for completing their work within a set deadline.

The first task of the day was to check for any outstanding computer support requests along with other member of the IT support team. These support requests pretty much determined the activities of the day. Other responsibilities also included deploying computers for new hire staff, lease replacement and special requests. CH2M HILL regularly upgraded computer hardware to provide their staff to better serve their clients. "
good,The company is great. My only problem is I worked for more than what I was making. Regardless of my years of experience as to which their policy feeds from.

good,"I do enjoy working while I was on duty. Once when a job is assigned to me. It is always a good challenge to me. To have a mission accomplished on time in a good order manner will bring me the most successful feeling. Every single day is a new lesson to me.

The hardest part of the job was being so green, but that didn't last long with the support I received.  The people I worked with were so helpful and supportive, never a negative experience.

The people I worked with were fun up beat and always easy to talk to. There had been opportunities at times for me to advance but my issue was where I felt I was at. I felt that I put myself in a situation where I couldn't leave or advance. We just recently sat down on performance reviews and talked about my advancement in the company. It was told to me that what I was trying to achieve was not where I am at now. I work every day to my fullest. I currently am a storm water technician. We manage and clean all storm drains around the plant. I clean and document storm drains around the facility. I manage over 197 drains in a year and maintain 8 BMP’s on site. It keeps me busy with also ordering and documenting information on a daily basis. I must say that on a daily basis my hardest part of my job is wondering what more could I have done. I work hard all the time. I have a great attitude and love what I do to the best that I can. The positive side to my job is that I do whatever is asked of me. I will try and get as much information and find a solution. I don’t mind getting my hands dirty. I feel there is always a solution to every problem.  In the past 5 years I have worked in industry maintenance. I have learned to get along and communicate with clients I have also worked on bettering my knowledge.

My co - workers are great. For this position, I also had to learn the legal system quick., I need to know what attorneys and judges were asking.

good,"Working as the lead DPA in Kandahar required daily operations reports to the key players in the USMC redeployment arena, to include conducting multiple site visits to inspect USMC assets. I became quite proficient at balancing the stresses of Kandahar with the learning the critical nuances of ground, aerial and shipboard loading plan operations. In addition, management, although fairly sound, would sometimes shift DPA assignments without the DPA finding out until 24-48 hours before he or she had to execute the move. This was critical because many people had little to no desire to go move to dangerous places like Kandahar and Leatherneck from nice areas like Dubai and Bahrain. There was also times when a member made arrangements to return home for rest and relaxation only to learn that the member had to make a last minute change to his or her agenda; thus creating family issues, although on a small scale."

good,Working with Jacobs at Syncrude was a very good experience. I was hired as a Nightshift piping superintendent but Syncrude decided not to have a nightshift. I looked after the Baghouse piping and pumps on the SERP project. I had worked on this type of piping before at Genese Power Plant with Jacobs. The Safety culture was excellent. We had no major incidents or accidents. That was probably the most enjoyable part of that job. The work force was very safety conscious. The hardest part of the job was the travel to and from town.

good,Worked for multiple people It's always fun helping others and feeling you have accomplished for the day. Worked with a close nit of employees. Learning from different areas of the company.
good,"Very relaxing work and great team to work with, but not much room for advancement either. Could potentially be a place to get ""stuck"" because the pay is decent, but there is no where to go but to stay stagnant."
good,"structured and safe work culture. They beleive in safety first and work second. Promoting relationships for a healthy work enviroenment. Daily and weekly safety meetings, and providing the right equipment for the job."
good,"My time at Jacob's was filled with new knowledge of processes and learning the ins and outs of daily activities. New software changes, new methods of calculations to achieve the ultimate goal of keeping the client happy."
good,Jacobs has been one of my most pleasant employers. The work was consistent and projects very well managed. The hardest part about the job was when a project was coming to a close and finding another project to be productive on.
good,"The workplace culture was very good. "
good,No better job in the world as one helping protect our soldiers that protect us every day. That's all I can say on this topic.Best benefits I ever had. I really miss working at this place and hope to get a job back soon.
good,"Great place to work. People friendly, well versed knowledge and military veterans throughout. Benefits are too expensive for most families and single individuals."
good,My day is fully filled with reviews of submittals/inspections due to the large size of the project and tight schedule of the completion date. The hardest part of this project is to handle the main contractor MEP representatives who does not have the practical knowledge of site execution.

good,"If I could move/travel for work, I would love to remain with Jacobs. Jacobs is an excellent company with great potential to advance with the right flexibility."
good,My experience at Jacobs for a Project Manager was unusual.  I work for clients as a seconded Project Manager for 70% of the time I was employed.   I was well compensated but was unable to establish significant relationships with other Jacobs Project managers.  My manager and other managers respected me and treated me with dignity and respect.
good,Although healthcare was probably my biggest gripe with them it was sufficient to meet my families needs. Other than that the culture was great low stress and fun environment. I loved working for them.
good,"I always enjoyed working for Jacobs.  I had the privilege to work in three offices and always enjoyed the work culture in each of them.  Jacobs will always find a way to retain their core competent employees.  However, it may involve moving to a new office."

good,"i liked to work for jacobs they were a good compagnie ,ive learn alot from good journeyman,i loved hard work like scaffolding ,i liked challange,good safety but i want jobs with flight and camp"
good,Great place to work for. But they have to work on compensating employees according to the market value and retaining them as the competition takes the assets
good,I had learnt a lot at this company. Everyone there was friendly and always ready to help. The manager is always available to sort out what ever problem you have (strictly professional).

good,Sistema de empresa te involucra a efectuar una labor entre límites muy definidos y claros.  Gran soporte tecnológico
good,"A typical day at work involves working in a fast paced environment with highly motivated and educated people."
good,"At CH2M Hill my average day consisted of looking over documents, editing programming, coordinating with the team, and doing work in programs such as AutoCAD. Periodically my job would include meetings, going out to the site to verify existing conditions, and resolving construction issues. I learned a great deal about contracting and government work.  I think the most enjoyable thing from my work was going home with a smile on my face knowing I had accomplished a lot that day. The most difficult thing about it was facing down almost 10,000 drawings and other contract documents that needed to be worked on and figuring out how to efficiently handle that work load. Management, colleagues and job culture were all quite enjoyable."
good,working in the exposed environment. Great people to work with. Great safety habits all around.
good,"My typical day at Stennis Space Center is filled with what some may call a demanding schedule. From overseeing regular scheduled work and maintenance on the test stands and their support systems, to  suddenly changing gears working around the clock to cover unforeseen test schedule delays."
good,"This company grows through acquisition. The work environment is great. However, layoffs come when there is no work to do."
good,"The company compensates their employees very well. They also value loyalty, and integrity. They take the time to recognize employees who have been with the company for a long time. Also, even though I have never interacted with Jacobs management, I can say the human resources department is extremely helpful, personal, and always happy to help an employee. It's a great company to work for."
good,"I worked primarily in accounts payable and learned quite a bit as it was my first time working in this type of position.  I also assisted procurement and document controls with filing and data entry and archiving documents upon project completion.  My coworkers were easy to work with and answered any questions I had to the best of their abilities. The hardest part of my job was getting used to starting so early in the morning, but once I got on to a schedule, it became second nature and I enjoyed working early in the morning.  The best part of my job was learning some new skills and meeting so many great people."
good,the team member is always first. people is our biggest asset
good,"I thought this position was a great opportunity, however, there seemed to be no room for improvement.  I felt like I had reached my ceiling very rapidly in this position.  The people I worked alongside were great."
good,Driving from the offices on one side of Exxon to the other for meetings and visiting the work sites somewhere in between could prove challenging. Exxon has a safety culture more than most plants. learning this was  challenging. The Jacobs management was involved almost continuously in meetings on a daily basis. My co-workers were very helpful in the work culture at Exxon. The work culture at Exxon was more than I have been involved in at any other plant for paperwork and safety. I appreciate  the safety culture at Exxon and learned a lot from it.
good,"Document control, input hours worked, scanning, copying, filing etc."
good,"I work for CH2MHILL and enjoy it, my direct supervisors are a breeze to work with and the freedom to manage my own schedule and work life is a great thing."
good,"No issues, well run organizations.. All companies are showing a profit."

good,I enjoyed all my co-workers.  The job was always interesting.  I learned several new softwares that I had never used before.
good,"Being a laborer you do many different types of jobs, I focused on scaffold work. The people I worked around were great and knew the trade very well. Doing any labor for 12 hours a day gets tiresome but other trades and co-workers were great in helping out."
good,"Before that the Electrical on a power Plant in Nakiski Alaska, "
good,"Jacobs management is very personnel oriented, the managers care about the people working for them. There is a very positive, supportive culture that emphasizes work/home life balance. Good compensation and benefits but, since this division is service oriented to the military, job security is highly dependent upon budgetary issues beyond Jacobs' control and upon the company's ability to win contracts in a fiscally constrained, bid/re-bid environment. Overall, a good place to work."
good,i am working as a lead designer and learn lot of things and software in various projects and got opportunity to visit sites and client interaction. Over all culture and management is good.
good,The mechanical department at the team level was wonderful to work with. Really enjoyed my time with the company
good,"Jacobs really works to assist their employees in the workplace.  Defense Contracts are a fickle business, yet they make every effort to find work for their employees in the event of a loss of a contract."
good,Management is great to work for. Management will take care of you as long as you show that your a hard worker and dedicated. Co-workers are friendly and everyone is willing to help out. Company does not offer much for training.
good,"Excellent safety culture and very responsive to improvement.  However, HSE staff is spread thin and compensation is mediocre."
good,"A typical day begins with a safety meeting to ensure that you are able to get home to your family in the same manner that you left them in that morning. You then are tasked with your daily tasks and you perform them as required. Communication is not always effective between co-workers, but most of the time points are made to be understandable."
good,"Typical day was reviewing my project in box and processing documents. Running reports and training other employees. Co-workers all very friendly and easy to work with. Hardest part of my job was leaving for the day; I wanted to stay and clear out the project in box. "
good,"Great place to work but discipline managers are disconnected with their employees, I've learned so much while working for Jacobs. My project managers and project engineers are amazing but as for my discipline manager (document control manager) was very disconnected with the employees, doesn't know what going on with the employees till its too late. I have no complaints about my coworkers for the most part, some could use most system training but that falls back on the discipline manager. Hardest part of the job was getting training classes setup and scheduled, most enjoyable has to be our blood drives, united way event and the safety events."
good,For CH2MHILL we started work at 7 am and finished at 6:30 pm. Every morning before work we had a morning safety meeting then we were given our task and told who we were working with. Before starting work we had to go to the area we were working in and look around for hazards and then fill out a FLHA. Everyday was different. Some days at work I was doing hydro tests all day and other days I was prepping lines for hydro tests. When prepping the line we had to follow through the line with the ISO to make sure all the pipe was in place. We had to install pancakes and/or blinds for the high point and low point limits. I worked with a good crew that taught me a lot about different things in the oilfield.
good,I have worked in HSE for over 10 years and I had the chance to improve the safety system through implementing the Culture and Values of Jacobs Company and their sincere care for every worker and their families.
good,"As an intern, I was offered many opportunities to work on a vairiety of projects. I felt like I learned a lot and am prepared to enter a career in the environmental sector. I was also exposed to projects and programs that I had never used before. Generally, my mentors took time to teach me and were willing to answer my questions. It was sometimes hard to coordinate my responsibilities when working piecemeal for many project managers, but that is not the company's fault. Sometimes, my co-workers wouldn't have anything to pass off to me. This was frusteratingsince I was paid by the billable hour, especially since it could have been resolved by better communication between myself and other staff."
good,worked 12 hours a day 7 days a week for about 3 months .nice people in the high up
good,"I really have enjoyed working for Jacobs, Anderson, Potter and Chaplin LLP. It has been a wonderful part-time job for me while I finish my studies at California State University Chico. I have leaned a lot about a professional office setting, the legal field and so much more."
good,The company puts the health and welfare of its employees first but also expects the employee to fulfill their expected roles and complete their work in a timely manner. Most managers have open door policies and actively encourage employees to talk to them about good as well as bad.
good,"Worked in the office but had some travel to client sites, great experience. Worked on projects for clients, Shell ascot ford, Albian Sands and Enbridge."
good,"The company was a good one to work for. The management was great and people that you were directly working for were calm and ready to teach."
good,I worked at Jacobs for 8 years but left because we were working on site with a horrible customer.  I would work at Jacobs again if it was at a different site.
good,I was very pleased with the overall company and how employees are treated.  The flexibility and promotion growth was outstanding.  You will get lots of opportunities at this company.
good,"The work that I did for Jacob's was consistent, and enjoyable. The supervisor I had at the end was very helpful, kind, new his job. Eastman was a place that had to take your job serious."
good,This job was competitive.. they offered NCCER certification classes... safety was high in demand... and everybody got along and willing to help each other.. so the company will succeed
good,"Super place to work. "
good,I worked for Jacobs 31 years doing various job descriptions in those years.  I enjoyed my work with them. I would love to return to Jacobs but my position was eliminated when I went out on disability.  My time with Jacobs gave me great opportunities to travel to places that I would not have been able to do on my own (including Canada).  I will always consider the Jacobs co-workers as my family.
good,I have been with CH2mhill for almost 10 years.  I liked the company until they sold it then we were laid off. Makes me sad as I like the company as a whole.
good,good people and friendly management. client is a little harder to work for but Jacobs is pretty decent. Management does try to make their workers happy and that is all I can ask
good,"Jacobs is a large, competitive company with family roots.  One of the first things I noticed when I joined Jacobs Engineering was how many years people were with the company.  I joined near Christmas time and at the Christmas lunch there were pictures of employees, some information about them which included number of years with the company.  On average people were working at Jacobs for 7 years plus!  And many for more than 20 years!"
good,I like workibg 60+ hrs a week and at the time Jacobs had limited hrs except on Turnaounds. They have great benefits and always got along with everyone. Need to step up to competitive pay scale though.

good,CH2M Hill was a great place to work.  Management really took an interest in you and your advancement with in the company.  The people there worked together as a team to get things accomplished.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Jacobs, they treated me well and advanced me very quickly. The corporate culture was a little competitive and hardcore, however I like it!"

good,"The best and worst part of my job was the moving from project to project.  I love the traveling and moving, but it was always sad to connect with people and create great friendships and then leave.  I love the construction environment because it is very fast paced and always something new going on, yet it is very casual and relaxed in dealing with co-workers.  Since every project is a little different I am always learning something new, or a different way of handling tasks that i've done previously ."
good,A fully professional place to work that took the initiative to ensure employees had the proper tools to effectively complete all assignments.

No part of the job felt difficult because I enjoyed doing it."

good,"nice people, office, City."
good,Jacobs Engineering was a great place to work at. It gave me the experience and training; the company that was delegated to their of customer and employees.

good,The company itself was great to work for. Certain people got caught up micro managing too much. Let the workers who know what they’re doing do their job. We didn’t need big brother holding our hand every step of the way.
good,I didn’t work here very long. But I enjoyed being around the people I did work with. All around a good company. I hope this review will help someone looking into working for the company.
good,I worked as Foreman. Had an excellent crew. We were complimented for a job well done in a timely manner. I was a working Foreman and helped anyone that needed me. I was hired to get a job done and I feel I accomplished the goal.

good,Jacobs does a great job supporting and making sure their interns are active in the workplace. There was always work to do and many days I found myself learning something new.
good,Although I was only there compared to some people a short time I loved working for these people and would not hesitate in a heartbeat to go back the work was clean and overtime was shared very fairly not always the top guns getting the cream of the crop so to speak management and supervisors were really good don't have much to do with the higher management but found what I did see was good

good,"As an intern, I’ve provided my engineering colleagues with assistance on numerous design projects; including work on the I-17, SR Loop 202, and Gilbert-Road-Extension with a heavy emphasis on CAD skills and attention to details that resulted in error-free work. Overall, my experience at Jacobs was very positive."
good,I think it's a great place to work and the people are nice. I just don't agree that you need to have a degree to be promoted. I have been with the company for 10 years and I feel the experience and knowledge that I have in HR is better than a Degree.
good,"A typical day at work for me is pretty much receiving all material that comes to the warehouse, pull pick tickets for certain jobs in the plant, load/unload trucks and trailers. I have learned that team work is really important in this field. My co-workers are the greatest group of people I've ever worked with. The hardest part of the job is the long drive back and forth to work. the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to go home every day the same way I showed up at work which is un-injured. That's only because of Jacobs' great safety team."
good,"Great company to work for but can be a little risky if your on a contract. No more than any other contract, just know things come and go as needed. If your looking for stability look toward their water treatment projects."
good,I support military testing with the use of digital video and imagery.
good,"Never a dull moment, as my day was filled with exciting challenges & goals to achieve.

good,the compnay was not flexible with work ours which with family was non appreciated. and downside is not having holidays off or rotated to spend with family.
good,The project I worked for was challenging in a good way. There were a lot of learning opportunities and the people are amazing to work with. It was initially productive until the work has become redundant and I can't see myself growing anymore. The most enjoyable part of the job is to see the delight from the client and the people you meet and interact with and be able to build a good relationship with the people be it professional or personal.

good,Typical day consists of variety of tasks. Have learned a great deal about project design and construction. I've seen the management of this company take extreme measures to the benefit of the company over the benefit of it's stockholders. Couldn't ask for better coworkers. Hardest part of the job is meeting the deadlines. Most enjoyable part of the job is the variety of work/tasks and being part of an awesome team.

The managers i have worked directly for have all been excellent and have taught me a lot. Over all great company ,have core values,and have kept me busy ."

They were there to help in anyway they could, teaching us what we didnt know all along the way in this project."
good,"The company has a great work/life balance, allowing the employees to work flexible schedules - some schedules have off on Fridays, some have half days. There are lots of employee appreciation activities and events company-wide. the health care benefits are extremely high as well. my department in accounting has great people, compassionate managers. Unfortunately the pay is not the best when working from the bottom upwards. If you transfer from a different company the managers are more willing to offer a competitive salary, but do not reward its own employees. There are also not many opportunities to grow. There are very few managerial positions, but nothing else available in terms of diverse accounting positions being a very small group. if you are fine with having a ""job"" for the next 10 years then this would be perfect, but if looking for a place where you can grow and develop a career then consider somewhere else."

When workload was low, I accessed the training and development section online and learned 3 new software over the summer."
good,"One of the Jacobs core values is ""People are our greatest Asset"" and this was proved over and over again.

good,Exposure to many types of disciplines is great to learn from. I was able to learn management and people skills here along with technical skills specific to my job.
good,Micro-Management was the name of the game working my last job with Jacobs. The toxic leadership style caused me to bring it to the attention of the senior management. Nothing to my knowledge was ever solved. The Micro-Manager degraded people and told people how to do their jobs and he himself had no clue about those jobs. Very hostile work environment.

good,"O trabalho desenvolvido é muito interessante, por se tratar de uma empresa Multinacional, com enfoque em obras industriais de médio a grande portes. Dispõe de uma equipe de projeto multidisciplinar muito qualificada, porém, estava com seus equipamentos de trabalho (computadores) um pouco desgastados e ultrapassados pelo passar dos anos, que, para a realização de algumas tarefas, atrapalhava um pouco o bom desenvolvimento do trabalho. Empersa situada em uma excelente região de São Paulo, com fácil acesso e diversos serviços ao redor.

good,Everyday at work was a great experience. You consistently learn new things and everyone welcomes you with open hands and their own family.
good,Typically I worked on several projects as the only Jacobs employee with very little or no supervision. On several projects I was placed on the job as a trouble shooter to solve problems that hampered the job progress. Through interaction with the contractor my technical knowledge improved. Management provided 100 percent at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of successful completion of assignments that were initially very hard to solve.

Direct management is awesome, though most of us are worried upper management has changes in mind that may lead to lost jobs. Coworkers are fun, supportive, and help you strive for excellence. The most challenging part of the job can also be the most rewarding. At CH we have a couple of sayings; own the call and ask the right questions. This pushes us as analysts to be creative in finding solutions, new or revised, for both known and unique issues. Analysts have an extensive Knowledge Base at their disposal but are encouraged to improve it when and where possible."

good,"A typical day at work proceeds from catching up on emails, requests from fellow coworkers, and some new announcements from management concerning feedback from clients as well as new requirements on ongoing projects. It also involves reconciliation of your own documentation with feedback from clients as well as those of coworkers in your department. There is no time to feel alone in the push to get projects done on time and within budget. Every day there is another challenge and another opportunity to shine with positive effort. Management is of two types. Those closest to you are very supportive. Those further up the management path are further removed from your daily activities and requirements. The hardest part of the job is to go home at night on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid on time and having the camaraderie of your fellow workers coupled with the satisfaction of having done one's best."
