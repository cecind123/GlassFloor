bad,If you need a job to pay your bills that’s ok but it is very unsafe place to work and if looking for a growing company family is not it and it don’t do any training you have to learn on your own
bad,"The location I worked for was terrible. After my first manager left, it went completely downhill. Getting robbed every few nights is not how I wanna work. I would never go back."
bad,The company its self was ok the people i worked with were horrible from bottom to top. They never cared about what employees complained about to make the customer service better.
bad,Worst company I ever worked for they do not support there employees they expect you do come in on days off I was scared to go pick up my check on my day off because I always ended up having to unload the truck or if I did not they would leave it for me for next shift store was always really messed up.
bad,"Just a trash environment that doesn't work with your real life no matter how much they claim they will. YOU WILL GET YOUR HOURS CUT HEAVILY WITHOUT WARNING. They also love if you suck up to them.  So if you enjoy awful pay,no hours, management that wants you to kiss their egos. You'll love this  job."
bad,"I don’t like it at all they will try to over work you, and try to find a way to fire you. Poor management, they don’t know how to have a decent conversation, with out an attitude."
bad,Very Terrible and unsafe work environment. They don't care about there employees AT ALL it's all about money with this greedy company. Their company is your life and that's ridiculous
bad,"I was not trained - just put on the sales floor by a manager that’s been apart of the Family Dollar team for 11 years. She pit employees against each other, never did work, and always had her drama follow her to work. She flirted with vendors instead of putting out product, or changing schematics. It was fast pace and we always had something to do which I loved but there was never any support."
bad,I hated working there. Horrible company. They dont care about there employees. Work you like a dog. Would rather be under staff and work everyone like crazy but yet not give out good enough hours. Made only 3 people work Saturdays while everyone else had them off.
bad,"It is truly an experience. You have to do a lot. since they don't have security the cashiers have to keep a lookout on everything even stop people at the door if they beep going out. Ring people up at the register and stock shelves. I would even have to do a mangers job and check vendors in as well as defuse a bad situation going on in the store between customers. I have to make sure the front is clean and no one is standing around, put carts and baskets back and do a lot sweep or shovel if its snowing bad. I have to run the whole front of the store by myself. to top everything off we do not get a discount."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work for Family Dollar. It’s the worst company that I have ever been employed by. I was hired as an Assistant Manager and worked for three weeks 35+ hours a week & sometimes 40+ after assisting to get a store ready to open I was told that the store didn’t have the hours to give me the 30 hours that I was told I would get when I was hired. I was offered 5-10 hours a week.
bad,By far the worst company i have ever worked at have working off the clock law suit against them so be advised dont work for them the lie to u they dont train u can never reach hire up by far the worst place to work for.
bad,Run away from this job as fast as you can. They cut yours to 8 hours a week when winter comes as the tourist season slows down. They don’t care if you need hours to pay bills and keep a roof over your head. They only care about the company dollar not that their employee will be there for the next tourism season. No way to treat good employees.
bad,Family Dollar was a productive fast past job. Despite the fact that they had high turn over rate. Most people don't stay long at Family Dollar because of the theft. Its truly unbelievable how much people steal from Family Dollar. I don't see how the company makes a profit.
bad,"Management is shady, refuses to properly train employees, only badmouths their shortcomings. Also management is spineless, so if approached with ANY controversial input they will lie to absolve themselves of any responsibility. DO NOT APPLY!!"
bad,I was in management for 5 1/2yrs and only made 11.00hr I ever got a weekend off . The district managers are very hard to work with. I was fired when I found my dad dead and they fired me for no call no show because I forgot to call them. My dad was dead what more do they want
bad,I hate workin for family Dollar Miserable job with little pay Thieving horrible customers Corporate sucked they thought they was better than everybody
bad,"There is poor management in this company. They do not care for your health or what happens to you while you are clocked in, whether it's with customers, family or thieves. If things are not completely done they won't give you a chance and throw you out to be replaced like you never mattered. They will accuse you of things you've never done and make you sign papers you know nothing about to take you out of the company."
bad,Not a good company to work for. You can't bust your but and not get appreciated for it well family Dollar does. They don't care about there employee's.
bad,You work very hard and they don't care about you as an employee or customer.  You can talk with top management and things still dont get resolved. It's the honest ones that get smashed in the end.
bad,They want you to work for little to nothing manager give no encouragement support  makes the little guy do all the work for them to take the credit. No guidance no training
bad,"Garbage, bottom of the barrel retail work. No help, long hours, no work/life balance, and no support. Pass on it and find something more supportive of the workers and their morale."
bad,I have nothing nice to say about this company. They lie and get people fired they don't like to work with your family life. The manager I had was wonderful the asst managers were horrible
bad,"Poor management "
bad,They suck and I wouldn't not work there  they are racist and hypocritical. So they need to be put I  check. Have fun if you like to be a slave. Hahahahaha
bad,"if you want an entry level management position with little to no supervision, this is the job for you. hopefully you don't want to have a personal life!"
bad,"The management was terrible & very unfair. No one did what they were supposed to and when they did, it was mostly likely wrong and someone would have to go behind and pick up afterwards."
bad,The manager was never kind to me. She only hired me cause she needed at least 1 white person in her store and i was it. She never scheduled me more than 15 hrs a week. Even after i was in a houae fire and begged her for only 2 days off and then full weeks cause i needed to money for a place to live and food.  Instead she took me off the schedule for 2 weeks then only scheduled me 12 hours a week.
bad,Management is lazy. Rude. Spend time moving product around to see if you are putting back in correct spot. Talk on phone to ftiends. Have to clock them in and out when they are not. Or count their money because they left. Expects everyone to work on own time. Gives cashiers their employee number and password so they dont have to go up to register. They steal damaged product.
bad,Family dollar is the worst company to work for!! There are no advancements!! If you are trying to build your career in retail this is not the place .. you are unrecognized and overworked and underpaid
bad,"Overall never work there. Not enough staff, management sucks (at least mine did and the above management didnt care). Very few breaks. very unpleased!"
bad,I started out as part of the set up crew and over a 4 1/2 year period I moved up from cashier to store manager.  Once you become store manager though all help from upper management is gone and they expect you to work sun up to sun down with little to no compensation.
bad,"The management is atrocious. They have a board that tells you much freight gets moved off trucks in under certain amount of time, and they expect it done. They don't give enough help or enough time to work efficiently. They don't care if you worked to the late hours of the night, they put you back on for the very next morning. The customers are the absolute worst, low class, no manners, thieves and overall disgusting people."
bad,The company wants a lot of work and dont want to pay.They dont like giving raises . Am glad to longer be working for them. I did get to assistant manager
bad,There's alot I could say about the company so I will be brief. I was always in the store by myself for long periods of time without breaks. Need more workers to cover shifts. Employees need to be trained better. Management needs to be trained as well.
bad,"Long days, multiple open to close shifts weekly. Was expected to work 6 days per week, closer to 65-70 hours per week as opposed to the corporate mandated 52 hours that was originally stated."
bad,"Horrible environment, even worse co-workers and management. No breaks on 14 hr. Shifts. Selfish scheduling (no one could take off any of spring break because that was the ""managers time"" managers scheduled people right below full time requirements or cut them to 12hrs or less to ""make sure they (the manager) had their time in"")"
bad,"Worse company to work for. Too much work for Too little pay."
bad,The pay is trash I worked more hours than what I got paid so I quit and went to amazon family dollar had the worst work experience ever for me I hated it...
bad,The family dollar I was at had very poor management . The general manager who ran the store put her work on us . She wasn't ever at work on time and she never really answered her phone if you needed her.
bad,"Don't let your daughters grow up to be dollar store workers. Pay, benefits, hours, work life balance are all of no concern here. full time positions are under 35 hours a week. Always under staffed, you will always have to do 3 duties at once and help customers."
bad,You opened alone and worked alone. Do not get rest room breaks and or lunch breaks. If your release don’t show up you had to stay. Manager always felt intimidated.
bad,"This was the worst place I have ever worked. Trained at one store ,worked at another, manager closing process was totally opposite of training store, no heat in store."
bad,"Open the store alone with no cashier, only after going to the bank to drop off thousands of dollar with no form of security. I learn about strong will"
bad,I don't think retail is what I wanted to do. I didn't enjoy working there it was always hectic and we never could agree on anything as a whole. I recommend anybody if thats not something you want to do don't work in retail because you should love what you do.
bad,They value being open and having minimal staff at all times. Theft is less important than having more than 2 people to work at a time. Terrible place to work. There are better jobs.
bad,Mandatory overtime all the time if you switch departments they can move you back at any time and for the people it’s worst than being in high school with drama and pettiness and little chances of advancement
bad,"I was with the company for a few months. I decided after my first 2 weeks it wasn't the company I would want to grow with. Sometimes you would get a lot of hours due to short staffing and other times you wouldn't get enough hours due to other crazy reasons, i.e they're ""friend"" needed more hours for their vacation. Management was the worse. Store managers would talk to their employees like they were children, literally cursing them out. NO BREAKS! It was mandatory to take breaks but the breaks were never factored into the schedule. They wouldn't even allow you to close the store to take ""mandatory"" breaks. Forget the chain of command. Even when you report an incident, it'll get swept under the rug and they will retaliate against you for doing such. Robberies are a big deal as well."
bad,I hate them co-workers everybody felt like they had to try me. Overtime was pointless. Management was hateful. I was treated unfairly. I didn't like nothing about this job.
bad,"With one truck a week, keeping top selling items full on the shelf is tough.  However, with minimal labor for help puts the pressure on the manager to cashier, run load, and give customer service with no other associates in the store at times."
bad,They suck worked for them for a year with out a day off. Can't get no help from others when needed. Can't keep staff at all. You get blamed for all the things that are stolen out of there. I had to call HR to get a raise. I worked everyday got called in went to other stores when I could.
bad,Manager was never helping me. I had to try to learn things on my own. The manager only wanted me there so she could take her 2  weeks vacation before she quit.
bad,"This has been the worst job I've ever had... Digna the District manger has no respect what so over the over work you have you working while you are the clock as a manger I got treated with less respect then being a cashier they over look you for promotion digna has said an promoted people that even her self knew wasn't ready to be a store manger after only being there a month"
bad,Managers had a way of abusing their authority to make employers uncomfortable. Very dirty workspace and overwhelming hours. Unfair treatment towards temp workers.
bad,Don't like this company they need better management. No one contacts anyone. Everyone talks about each other. The manger is part of the problem. She should manage instead of trying to be friends.
bad,The manger is probably the worst manager I have ever worked under. She never answers her phone when you call her and if you get a response it is usually the next day she complains about anyone requesting days off and it only worries about her schedule. She talks about every employee behind their back. She actually threw a fit when two people requested to work day shift on Christmas Eve  . They give you ridiculous tasks to get done when you are the only person working in the store
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company they fire you for dumb reasons they have you working in the store by yourself with no help and expect you to get all of your work done the pay is lousy there is no team work
bad,"I usually work in the morning. I come in, clock in, count my till, and start ringing people up and during my downtime I stock inventory. In the evening its the same thing but instead of stocking I recover the store. There wasn't much to learn since i have been doing retail for a while, the only thing i learned was how their system works. Management is awful. They will make you miserable. Most of the ASMs (assistant store managers) are mild tempered but store managers and anyone above them are awful. Most of mine don't take me seriously, I was offered to move up to an ASM this past March and I am still waiting to move up even after transferring, constant schedule changes without notice or asking, constant gossip, lazy coworkers just to name the worst of it. The hardest part of my job is dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers because although my situation with my boss is negative, I stay positive towards my customers and they love me for it."
bad,"After the manager was fired, the assisants had to step up and take role. After several months of them doing a managers job, they finally asked for the pay and title. When they went to the DM, they were told they were not qualified enough but yet ran the store for several months."
bad,"Hours bad, Pay bad, management bad!!!!!  I will never work retail again bcause of my experience with Family dollar!  My cousin is going to die there at work because she’s in bad health under a drs care and theyre making her work!  Yup she’ll die there!!!!"
bad,"This company does not promote a good work environment and its policies only apply to certain individuals. They do not care about their workers which is why theres a high turnover rate. Management on all levels are not equipped to handle employee related issues and do not respond when you need them. Customer service, and safety should be a top priority it isn't even a factor. I do not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,If your looking for a company to have your back don't work at family dollar. They only care about making money and not any of their employees. You are expected to not have a life outside of the company.
bad,"No proper training for Management teams, High turn over. Only threaten to replace if you can't get the work done in the minimal amount of hours allotted."
bad,Management and higher-ups do not care about their employees. They estimate employees Lassen seven months and less. Turnover rate is very high due to how hard management pushes their employees and how shortstaffed they are all the time. Family Dollar is one of the most robbed businesses and they know that they are a high risk job But they don’t care they just replace you if you can’t handle it.
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone who would like a job long term. They do not respect you as a person, and I often had to deal with management because I couldn’t work certain a certain day because of my religious beliefs.  There are no breaks, no benefits . The only joy I got from working with this company were the customers . Managers are disrespectful and unprofessional."
bad,Every truck day I was scheduled to unload it supposedly with my manager but all she did was talk on her cell phone and smoke and tell me I wasn't going fast enough.Very poor manager she was finally fired but then they turned around and rehired her.
bad,"Being a manager at the stores in perth amboy is horrible, the store is always messy they pay you so little to do all of this work. They will bring people in from the outside instead of helping you grow and have stronger skills they will write you up and expect so much from you. Just me do me the favor and dont work for a slave company"
bad,Family Dollar isn't a job for anyone who has a family or attending school. You would have to give your all working at Family Dollar. I was a manager and when people
bad,"Coworkers were very unprofessional and rude to customers. No one took the job seriously the Assistant Managers weren't very good at training new employees more or less didnt train them at all. Assistant managers weren't very helpful to employees and constantly had attitudes. Store was also very unorganized. Team work was not a priority, lack of communication and just over all a mess."
bad,If the company owners new that the bad areas needed security they would provide the employees with that to make them feel safe at work but they don't. I think they should care for there employees more and the pay they give us.
bad,I truly care for any job I work on . The store manager I work for truly doesn't care for customers or community. So thing twice before working for family dollar. People come into the store and it's your fault for stolen items. To me that's wrong. You could lost your life and their still working.
bad,"If you're in Louisville, this review is for you. Don't waste your time. They keep known thieves and drug addicts on the payroll, they don't care about your safety, and they get jealous when you pick up too many hours. Seriously, they will do everything in their power to make you quit, including locking you out the building. In Louisville, this company is a poorly managed backstabbing dumpster fire. I won't even SHOP there anymore."
bad,"Horrible management who treat customers horribly, and let others rob the store blind. "
bad,Upper management has ridiculous goals that can't be achieved with the amount of payroll they give you unless the manager works like a dog 24/7 without any extra pay.
bad,"Do daily reports, Work a 10-15 hour shift with no breaks, & run the register, wait on Vendors, & work the back stock. While you run the shift alone . Because they don't give you enough hours to have double coverage. Except for the evening shifts. The upper management doesn't ever support their store managers. The hardest part about the job is not having support from the H.R. department, Or the R.V.P. because they're all buddies & unless you kiss a** they don't have time to help you. If you get sick you are told  "" everyone has problems"" Leave it outside the door. If you take FLMA they give you're store to someone else while you're out. The best part of the job is when you have a great team."
bad,This is a Company to clearly stay shy of be it management or Customer service. Family Dollar stores has NO RESPECT for their Employees or their Families. Their bottom line is the STORE !!!!
bad,Management overworked all associates asked them to work off the clock cut break times short what else can I say steer clear and keep looking it's not worth the aggravation
bad,"Bad company, was corporate, bad environment, poor management, just everything about the company around this way was terrible, need new management, new company"
bad,I hated this job the workload was extremely extensive and the location was terrible we were consistently robed and always I was always closing at the time it was a major stress on my relationship so I had to let it go.
bad,"Manager follows customers around as if they have already stolen something. Wages are minimum, and on top of that the manager accuses her employees of stealing themselves. Very dissatisfied with the company's judgement of character in the higher-ups of the their staff members."
bad,"Worst comany of all time very unfair they don't represent any if their own company values. Your just a body. No training , no chain of command nothing an no one to call for help when your treated unfairly."
bad,This is the worst company to work for .... They only care about money not emoloyees. They show no recognition for the good things but always telling you what u did wrong in their eyes
bad,"Absolutely no respect or aknowledgement of employees and their hard work, they overworked me without fair pay and management wanted me to do things that would be considered unethical, or in some cases, technically illegal. It was overall a horrible company to work for and an unpleasant experience."
bad,"Managers don’t care about their employees and even though someone does most of the work, they joke and play around with the people that hardly do anything but can’t make jokes with the people that actually work. Back breaking hours and getting called in early all the time. Hardly any days off. And if you hurt yourself on the job they don’t care and still expect you to work like you did before you got hurt"
bad,One of the worst places I've ever worked the managers there are horrible they don't train you they just expect you to know they talk to the older customers terrible just something I couldn't be part of no more after 8 months Duquesne
bad,"Very unprofessional can’t keep anyone "
bad,I had no life other than this store. Not nearly a living wage and no benefits.   I worked myself into the ground and was not treated well at all by my direct supervisor.
bad,Attacked by shoplifting customers had to fight them both out of the store.One shoplifter sprayed me in the face with furniture cleaner.Was made to work the whole shift w/o going to emergency room because I couldn't get permission to close the store! Up to now Im still fighting for them to pay the emergency bill! Bad bad company to work for...total disrespect!
bad,Worst company to work for and they don’t care about you. If you work here you’re going to regret every second of it. This company barley gives hours. Worst thing you’ll do is work here.
bad,"The district manager , and manager have no concerns for there employees , racists in several managers , including the Cedartown location , the manager lies to the district manager and I even have proof , I was promised a Christmas bonus but did not receive"
bad,"I have been with this company for 5 years. They change district manager like the weather, they are very unprofessional, unorganized, and under pay their workers. The district manager they have now is very rude and dysfunctional knows absolutely nothing. This job is not worth the head ache nor the risk."
bad,"They do not care about you are your family. If you have a family emergency you might as well look for another job. The Manager will have a fit if you have to leave they don't care. If you are sick they don't like for you to call in they expect you to be there no matter. They play favorites, they do not teat you as a team at all! They do not pay you enough for the work that you do they low ball you."
bad,"I worked 75 plus hours a week they didn’t care I was short staffed they didn’t care. The process for hiring assistance took a month or longer. The upper management was terrible district manager try to start fights with the other store manager.  Terrible place to work,"
bad,"Management is completely awful, work is stressful and unsafe, people in all the time robbing the store. The overall work is very easy and would be fun if management actually cared about their employees"
bad,The store I work at is horrible the store manager let’s customers threaten the safety of employees the manager gives one certain employee a great amount of Hours it’s unfair
bad,4 Años y nunca me subieron el sueldo. Y los maneger te tratan como basura.
bad,Poor management. No breaks or lunches . Low pay. Management didn’t want to give the raises we deserved. Store is Not clean. Lots of expired food. Messy manager/bully. Barely received hours.
bad,With this company u will never have weekend off. You work overtime and they don't pay you for the overtime. This company has a lot of red flags. I wouldn't recommend this company.
bad,I was happy to work there and I enjoyed my employee and I never had a problem with anyone and I will always go back and work there if they need me and I’m a phone call away
bad,"I was robbed while working at family dollar. Had to go back to work immediately. Wasnt offered help, no PTO, no counciling just two days off and back to working shifts myself."
bad,"Not enough employees working and very UNORGANIZED!!! Not trained properly, RUDE, not professional, not safe, no compassion for the workers or customers... ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!"
bad,They will not provide enough labor hours therefore Managers have to cover shifts 7 days a week. DM was not supportive at all! This sets the Store Manager up for failure from day 1!
bad,"They would have me work at 7am and not leave till if I'm lucky 8 or 9 that night if I wasn't I'd still be working come 12:30am to 1 am. No breaks, hardly any bathroom breaks and no lunch break. So I'd be starving when I got home. Management sucked and had to deal with constant shop lifters. I even had an assistant manager take money from my drawer. (She was caught on camera)"
bad,"I had a racist manager who was verbally abusive and probably scenile. Promoted a relationship with conflict of interest with subordinate. Only hired friends, even more conflict of interest. I was the odd one out as he was desperate for help at the time, I do not have a prior experience with him. Regional manager did not do anything about his behavior and ignored my email to explain why I resigned."
bad,"Is unpaid, extremely long hours, no family consideration, the least enjoyable place to work, they cant gave hours for team members work, so is manager need to accomplish what company required even if took 75 hours to complete the tasks per week for this store manager"
bad,This is not a family oriented company and management is poor. It’s very stressful and you don’t get any holidays off. No rewards programs really and no security for safety for employees.
bad,"They expect you to do everything for very little pay. You would have to act as stocker, cashier, security, and management all at once. If you question the Store management about something that is not right they will let you go saying that you don't have the companies interest at hand."
bad,"The store Manager didnt do anything made the assistant Managers do everything then took all the credit, always negative, went against company policy more then once."
bad,If your going to promise or say that you can or will work with someone and their schedule than do it. Don’t say one thing and do the complete opposite. I was told full time at first as hired on. Forgot that she gave it to someone else all ready. Said days was ok but moved me to nights. Couldn’t work nights. Struggled to do so. So I had to let go of the job.
bad,"Worked there 4 years. They want their employees to do the work of 3 people and pay for only one person."
bad,Everything from district manager all the way down to the trash I the bottom sucked. This was a horrible place to work for. Unless you were a brown noser. Or related to someone on top you were treated like dirt. Talked down to and everything. I wont even shop at a family dollar anymore.
bad,"I had a great boss my first experience working for family dollar, but after I moved away I had to transfer and the new boss was inappropriate and mean."
bad,"Your day there would start out by stalking stuff. Sometimes the cart was located near the cash registers, and other times it was in a spot where you couldn't see properly. This meant that you would have to constantly check and see if there were customers standing at your register. When that was all done with, you were required to front face the same two-3 aisles for the rest of your shift. Most of the time it was slow in there, so you would have to really take your time with this. It was only a part-timer and one manager on duty per shift, which was frustrating at times. This is because the manager would often sit in the back, and would take their time coming up to the front to help out. Sometimes they wouldn't even respond to the page you sent them. They gave you such long hours, and didn't like giving out breaks. I got along with my managers, but they acted unprofessional. The most enjoyable part of that job, was seeing some of the regulars that would put a smile on my face."
bad,Not a good place too work you'll never get recognized for your work your boss will get raises and benefits for your hard work. You won't get raises at all unless your manager gets the raises benefits and bonuses before you know then they keep it.i still have not received my W-2 forms from past year called HR and no response what so ever now I got to call IRS to get my taxes from last year.
bad,This job is very competitive.  They expect you to complete more tasks than time provided. They are not family oriented. They expect you to come to work even if your sick.
bad,High volume store in the worst neighborhood in cleveland ohio no security not even lights in the parking lot. The assistant manager does the exact same things as the store manager without the pay for it we even have to clean the parking lot on top of guarding the store merchandise employees as well as customers no regard for our safety at all the pay really sucks
bad,this job sucks I would not recommend this place to anyone everyone that worked there were so childish and its crazy because I was the youngest one there
bad,Horrible company to work your work too hard for pennies and they only offer full time positions if your an assignment manager or higher plus they make sure you never got your full hours they will cut your hours Short just to make sure they don't go over and have to pay overtime
bad,Not enough pay for the amount of stress. unsafe and unhealthy conditions. Management refusal to fix unsanitary and dangerous things about the store. No control in availability
bad,"Family Dollar Was The Worst place I've worked to date,manager was not compassionate"
bad,I worked there for 6 months and I had 3 different managers that did not know what they were doing and the newest manager did not like me so she cut my hours from 30 to 15 and she put me on night shift most of the  time so I called corporate and it did not get any better so I quit and filed UC benefits and I got it
bad,Family Dollar is not a family. They will work you to death and still say you have not done enough. If a customer doesn't spend enough you are accused of stealing.
bad,The job is easy but what makes it difficult to continue to do the job is the management is Hypocritical and they don't even know how to do the job they are over seeing they over work the few who want to do well and advance but do nothing about those who are lazy and do not care or want to try.
bad,Worst company to work for   They will change your hours just to be good on payroll. They make you work off the clock.   Money would be short and there was always an excuse
bad,This was simply a part-time job to get back into the workplace. There was bad management and micromanagement that was unnecessary. You are expected to somehow manage the flow of customers and keep the store clean without any help. The manager is always in the back of the store or in the office.
bad,"Worst company to work for. I used to be an assistant manager and I soon noticed the district manager all the way down to the store managers really could careless about the store nor the employees. The location I was at, they had Christmas backstock from two years ago still in the storage room. Tons of expired foods, at least two months of truck inventory piled in the back. Management would only work 7-3, never covered any shifts, location had been robbed twice, pricing was at least 1 year off. They literally hire anybody. No interview needed. I didn’t speak to not one person in person when I was hired. They called me and asked me what location was close to me and sent me to fill out my paperwork...not one interview. They play favorites as for pay. I was an assistant manager and new employees that just was hire was getting paid the same amount I was even though I was full time as well as had plenty of experience. Not to mention I didn’t receive a check for over a month and then when I got it, it was wrong and they had no paper trail for me to compare it to. I was fired due to closing the store down early due to an attempted robbery. Store manager would not answer calls, district manager was no where to be found. The next day was the store managers step child’s birthday and I was asked to cover her shift, I did and they same day I was fired for “job abandonment”. Filed for unemployment and the company literally tried to say I was fired because of attendance...of course I went to appeal it and told the actual story in which they found the company responsible. I would not recommend"
bad,Manager doesn't care if you are sick or in hospital. Not flexible/family friendly on schedules. Mgr creates a negative work environment. Discriminates
bad,"management sucks, they offer no incentive to be an employee there. they cut your hours for no reason and expect you to be open for anytime they need you to come in,  the management treats you like your second class and they are better then you. you have to start somewhere."
bad,"I was miserable going into work everyday. I would never recommend working there for anyone. The management staff encouraged staff to exercise vigilante justice against shoplifters. I was discouraged from taking outdated food off the shelf, offering great customer service or advancement. That is the only employment that I had left at the beginning of my shift and never returned."
bad,"The poorest managers I've experienced since working at 15 yrs old. I would never recommend anyone to work there. The new manager came in & two managers get fired & another asked for a transfer, she also was thee only manager to give those hard working truck drivers a bottle of warm bottle of water in 100 degrees hear, no ethics & she was for sure a poor worker."
bad,Would only work here in emergency situation of it was my only choice.not sure about new ownership with Dollar tree but they over work you and under pay you ‼️‼️
bad,"They will give you a number of tasks to complete but always understaffed because they are very cheap on labor costs. The main goal is to keep the store running..not to care about the workers. If you do well and get promoted to a manager, its only for pennies more ...dont fall into that trap..thats 100x more work. Work you do goes unrecognized and STRESSFUL ENVIORNMENT"
bad,Just overall horrible store was disgusting manager had favorites never gave hard working staff overtime only her favorites they were extremely lazy and messy it was like cleaning up being children. Done staff were hard workers but management were just overall DISGUSTING and lazy
bad,Horrible place to be you don't learn anything. Managers are bad at their jobs. All workers gossip constantly and try to get you fired. The managers talk about our District managers as well
bad,"I loved my team when I first started, then management changed and it went downhill from there. I started with a team of 5 solid people, and ended up being the last one. So happy I made a change."
bad,Company was ran poorly. It was managed by favorites and district managers friends. No one  got raises unless the brown nosed or kissed butt. There were no raises for your work ethic.
bad,It is not a place that I would recommend working. The hours and pay are terrible. No time for family and no set schedules. Privacy is a very big issue.
bad,"poor management, unskilled managers, "
bad,"I was promised a raise in march, never got it. I was promised work closer to henryetta, ok., never got it. They don't keep their word. They expect so much that no one can meet their expectations."
bad,"Family Dollar Stores, it's management and everyone from corporate are a complete joke. I worked for this company twice, was very skeptical about taking the job the second time around. A complete waste of time and energy! I have never been so miserable at a job like I was at Family Dollar, shame on you! Oh, and management likes to sleep with each other but that's a review for another time."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. The DM was very rude and seemed pretty racist. No one should be worked that much and payed that less. I think they need to consider their workers more
bad,"The typical Family Dollar is habitually and purposefully understaffed. This leads to a common theme of complaints by customers of long lines, and empty shelves."
bad,"Def not the job for me. Can't wait to find something else. It just wasnt the job for me, way to many ridiculous demands and wanting complete perfection. Yet this job had no incentives nor offered anything towards their employees. They are slave drivers. Working your body and gives no hours for actual help. Its left to 2 ppl to handle a huge store at all times. Its ridiculous. And they dont even offer you a discount."
bad,"We would work any where from normally scheduled hours to going over shift cause next shift wouldn't show or be late. While running a register you were also expected to empty U-boats up to 4 of them, even when we were busy. No discounts, if we were hungry we had to buy food from store with no discount on anything. No rewards for doing well. The managers were new almost every week. The higher-up management would come and basically tell us how awful of a job we were doing, even if the customers were happy."
bad,Never work for this company .  They don’t care about your safety nor do they care if u have a death in the family.  Dirty and disgusting.  I guess if you need a few dollars apply but don’t make it a career
bad,"District Managers are all drastically different in how they approach dealing with their stores. Some micromanage, some don't. Some have play favorites, others don't. However all of them have absolutely unrealistic expectations. They expect you to work 80+ hours without any sort of retaliation. They try to force a schedule upon your store that does NOT work. They offer you advice which is more like sabotage and attempts to force their views on how to tackle situations on you, even if it makes the situations worse. Just take my word for it when I say avoid this job, which every fiber of your being."
bad,"Family Dollar Is A Big Joke. Working For Them 7 Years As An Assistant Store Manager, No Raise Within The 3 years, The District Manager Laughs In Your Face When She Recognizes Loyalty & Dependability. Very Disrespectful. Reported Her To Human Resources, Nothing Was Done. Family Dollar Takes Advantage Of You. They Want You To Do So Much For Little."
bad,The pay is terrible you get paid every two weeks they promise you hours and lucky if you get 12 a week. The management is horrible all they care about is themselves no compassion for their workers !! You have to unload the 18 wheeler truck by hand out in the rain cold heat as manager does nothing
bad,"Store managers been around for years left unchecked leave without notice while still getting paid suppose to work 52 hours barely spend 35 expect you to keep store ran by yourself no lunches no beeaks, when district manager given proof and regional manager still nothing done take away hours you have worked, still nothing done run don't walk away run"
bad,Don’t waste your time if you have other options. Sign your life away! No work life balance. No peace! No break! No life! Demanding and stressful! Dangerous
bad,"I worked with the company for three years. I cleaned up multiple family dollar stores. I left as a store manager because I worked everyday, store was in the best condition, but did not keep the DM from complaining. She did not know how to communicate with me or my employees. It was just a really stressful job that kept me from my family with very low pay."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone! This company does not care about you or what is going on in your life. They only care about the store making money. I was working one night when the store I work at was robbed. Not one time did my district manager reach out and ask if I was ok or if I needed to talk to someone they only thing she cared about was how much was in my register!! Store manager they sent over to take the other managers place that was fired she was the laziest manager I’ve ever seen!! She would always use the DM as her reason to try and get you to do her job. She always would say “We” but it would end in “Me” doing her job while she runs around finding other things that she should be doing for you to do. And to top it off she would talk about you behind your back and tell other affairs that shouldn’t be discussed with cashiers. The District Manager is rude she talks to you any kind of way and tries to make petty threats. All in all Family Dollar is not a store I would recommend unless you like being treated like a dog!!
bad,If you want treated like dirt then work for this company! They will work you 60 to 90 hours a week! Never have stores with full management! The managers who never show up to work who cause you to work 60 to 90 hours a week never get punished. This explains why the always have management positions posted everyday
bad,"This job is stressful, overly demanding, turn over rate is ridiculous, demands from corporate are unrealistic, but expected to be carried out anyways. We've gone through 3 District Managers in 1 year."
bad,The only way I would recommend working for family dollar is if you were on your last leg and need an income badly other than that it's horrible do yourself a favor and run
bad,No team work and poor management staff. Type of job you put your life in danger everyday. Fast turnovers have to hire fast or risk not having any employees.
bad,"Can not trust them to do what they promised to do said one thing a d did not follow threw ,I would advise to get it in writing not a good work life balance"
bad,greet customer  cashier stock merchandise returns all transaction of the store and receive merchandise .count the money in same and close store .clean the store make sure everything was organize
bad,"Family dollar is not the best place to work.  No matter how well you do your job, how many hours you work, how many other stores you help out, how many open to closes you work. It is not appreciated and they just keep wanting more from you. The poor truck drivers I have seen a few pass out from heat exhaustion because the truck driver Is has to put one box at a time on a roller as the employees are taking the boxes off the rollers as they are coming into the store. Which most times is only 2 employees unloading a truck but then if the cashier needs help one has to go help the cashier which leaves 1 person. They don’t give you enough payroll to have enough people to run the store successfully and the overload you with unnecessary items because they are cleaning out there warehouse"
bad,watch undercover boss about family dollar and that will tell you everything you need to know. they'll fire you as fast as they will promote you. worst turnover i have ever seen in a company little to no labor to run a business that is why almost any family dollar you walk into looks trashed.
bad,Its a great first job but i wouldnt recommend trying to make a career out of it. I was there just about a year and got passed up for the assistant manager position and i dont think it was right for the fact that i had been there the longest and had shown the biggest improvement since day one
bad,"So unorganized "
bad,This company was not for me. A typical day was coming in and dealing with theft and managers that did not want to really be there but was there for a check and spent more time on their phones or talking to their boyfriends than helping out. Managers that would rather talk about people than help.
bad,"not a very well managed store, I do not recommend this company at all. I was injured at this place and was on light duty then fired because I could not do regular duty tasks."
bad,"Overworked, paid wasn’t good. Doesn’t care about your personal life they expect your job to come before anything even your own kids. Work pretty much every weekend. Open on all holidays expect Christmas."
bad,The place reeks of vomit and cigarettes. I was constantly harassed by the other workers. The manager never bathed and cussed incessantly. Everyone was rude and inconsiderate.
bad,The company is motivated by sales only! Their requirements to protect store assets takes president over employee safety. The company needs to provide stability within employees.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of customer very poor and unfair customer service, I cannot say that I learned much at all in this work place as a manager. There weren't any ""workplace culture"" at all, due to poor management/leadership. The hardest part of this job was seeing how unfairly customers were treated. The most enjoyable part of my job was putting a smile on my customer's faces, and meeting a wide variety of people."
bad,I want to let anyone that is thinking about becoming a store manager to not do it. You will be paid for 52 hours and work 80 to 90. And then when you say no they will turn on you. As long as your store is making money they will use you up. Dont let them lie to you. No help from uper management. They want your blood sweat and tears.
bad,"should have been found another job. the company was not to concerned about your safety, but found every reason to get rid of you. was good at first and slowly changed for the worst."
bad,Management sucks and they don’t give enough hours. It’s really a horrible company to work for. Store managers sit around while making everyone else do the work they should be helping with.
bad,No real training. You have to kiss up to move up the ladder. Not rewarded for hard work at all. Just about who you know and who you and what you will do for them. Most of the time.
bad,Very poor customer service and the store manager at Jennings LA Store 1902 is not friendly at all. She needs to smile more and interact with the customers more.
bad,I had a regional manager get in my associates face within one inch. Yelling and degrading him. She threatened to call the police on another for asking questions. She got in my face for asking what in the world had happened. When I open footed her disrespectful attitude I was suspended. Terrible company and hr is absolutely not on your side. I have video proof.
bad,"DM nicpicking at every thing even if the job was done correctly. No real hours at the maximum you were able to get 20- 25. There isn't any  incentives to make that job worth while. You don't get holiday pay when part time or overtime, which you still won't get if your management."
bad,"The hours are okay, but once you get into a management position they’re not. You’re constantly filling in for other people that don’t come to work because they don’t feel like it, you’re always bouncing from place to place, nothing is consistent."
bad,"A typical day at work would be busting my butt in the warehouse and on the floor of family dollar, I would do probably about 4 pallets by myself! I would always work hard and put out a lot of freight"
bad,they were most unprofessional work place i have ever worked fro they cut my hours for no reason at all after telling me they wanted for a assistant manager position.
bad,"Basically I’m a manager but won’t be promoted so they can save money. If you aren’t willing to work any shift at any time and being called in randomly and expected to show no matter what, I wouldn’t recommend working here."
bad,"I thought it would be a good place to work at but, after the first week no. It had very  bad management  it also needed organization,  scheduling was bad as well not to mention the bathrooms at 5 different buildings was not clean.  The training was bad no employee handbooks no structure not one leader in any of the building.Then the employees did not even get a discount not even on the items that was going in the trash thats crazy some one need to close all of them down i would never tell any one to work there"
bad,"I've gone to my manager probably 3 times if I had issues with some she never wanted to do anything just kept making excuses for the person I had issues with, but if I retaliated I'm the 1 who's wrong because I knew my manager wouldn't do nothing"
bad,"This was the worst place I have ever worded at. The management was horrible I would never recommend anyone to work at this place,until they get better management, and better pay for there employees. This is by far the worst work experience I have ever worked for."
bad,"Need a better training program and more flexible work environment..."
bad,I hate working there no hours I hate it people stealing items not enough workers management sucks DONT pay enough never close when it’s an state of emergency
bad,One of the worst company's to work for they give you no time off for holidays or holiday pay for the comparison i was all way one of the top .they need to take family out of there name
bad,if you want to be treated poorly and shown nothing but disrespect and be lied to apply here. this place will treat you badly no matter how hard you work
bad,"I left that job. My time there was horrible. The manager had an really bad attitude and would catch an attitude when you ask for assistance, even with customers. I didn't get a break and also there were favoritism. I felt under paid"
bad,"Working at Family Dollar, they have you work without breaks because they're low staffed, you're not going to get a lunch either so be prepared to be tired after working a 6-8 hour shift because you're expected to run back and forth between taking care of customers and pushing product out. You're also going to be the only one taking care of customers with long lines and angry customers. You're going to get hours that are never stable and a schedule that changes without you ever being told."
bad,It was very unprofessional and management was horrible. The environment was always hostile. We had no security and most of the time it would be one or two women at night.
bad,Having the store manager raise her voice and put you down at the register in front of customers in NOT ACCEPTABLE. 14 hours with NO BREAK AND NO LUNCH WORKING ENTIRELY BY YOURSELF IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
bad,Job isn't organized no supervisor is never available unfair work place work is never caught shift before me don't stick or clean we work 7 days all the time  no matter how hard you work it isn't appreciated they change your job and want pay the job salary they show favoritism
bad,I worked there 9 months and quit after DM hired a drunk for our store manager after she came to work still half drunk yelling at me because another employee quit the day before. Got tired of the new manager's friend coming saying that her friend was the one making the store better when in all reality she was worthless.
bad,"No set hours, always getting robbed everyone steals no correct pay  you work more hours than you get paid but overall an easy job 😃just get over workef"
bad,I was constantly harassed. I even had my life threatened by their crazy customers. It was a terrifying experience. All of that and the pay was low. There is nothing else to say.
bad,If you do not comply and work when you're not scheduled your hours will be cut at the stores manager's discretion.  If you are not satisfied with the store manager's decision all you have is a 1-800 number to pacify you.
bad,Work was stressful. Long and wasn't very rewarding. Management  was always gone and didnt care about employees. I had a rough time working here I was always called in to work and business and life was not seperate.
bad,They only care about them they will bully u and not  care and they make you  fo most of the work  I hated working they half do there work the smoke all the time weed and cigarettes
bad,The management was really bad. The store manager was not professional and assistant managers had to do his job. Also the district manager was not involved as he should had.
bad,"I was recommended to work at the Carnegie location, as an assistant manager. However day 1 has proved me different. They all gossip about one another conspire to get rid of coworkers/start rumors, take countless smoke breaks (when others cant step aside to go to the restroom), get called in on days off (after working 12 days in a row). Dont recommend FD Carnegie!"
bad,"very easy job but in a bad area, must watch out for people shoplifting because here is a lot of it. work place culture was okay. lots of old employees with attitudes"
bad,Worst place I ever worked at  and I would never work there again the manager told me to my face ahe would fire me  if she didn't like me personally and she did
bad,"Just trash. You gotta be a friend or relative they make their own rules and think they are all the ""kings"" or ""family dollar"". Just...dont lol run away"
bad,The management discriminates a person for there disability if they have one they say your no good to our company  they fire honest working people and the people that are stealing and doing the wrong thing they keep them working if you get sick andthey fire you
bad,"do NOT take an assistant manager job at this place.  You will be doing bank drops with no backup or protection in bad areas, you will be dinged if you sneeze wrong.  They do not care about you; you are nothing to them."
bad,My manager treated me very unfairly to the point where I was driven to quit I was very dissatisfied with working there he had me off 3 days a week it was just very disappointing and upsetting because that's not what was told to me when we had the interview.
bad,"the store mange rJackie is always mad and complaining about  her home life. she is very two faced. "
bad,"Would never recommend it. They didn’t give discounts to employees, they don’t have any benefits( medical, dental 401 k, any type of leave of absent) nothing."
bad,"It’s not worth your time, they don’t not care about your life or family and they want you to risk your life for petty stuff && the pay is horrible for all the work you have to do"
bad,"This is the WORST company I've ever worked for. If you like to be over worked, underpaid, cheated out of hours and travel pay then this is the job for you. Most of the management sucks too. I was fored for having a baby, called and got a lawyer involved. The DM that fired me no longer has a job because of it. Worked for the company for 5 years and it just got worse and worse."
bad,I worked at family Dollar in parkway the customer's are rude the supervisor don't Wana help you they only have 1 cashier on duty at a time so they wear you down n your only gonna make no more than 230  biweekly
bad,"This job would best suit someone in their twenties starting off in a Managerial Position, this job is very physical.....to physical for women and I say that because of off loading the freight, yes, you physical have to unload the freight and if your up in age or not physically fit this job is not for you.   Secondly, this is sad but true, managers will use their job titles to abuse the schedules to"
bad,The Manager will treat you well if you are a white employee. No benefits. You could work here for years and not get a raise. They will ask you for a lot but once you need one thing its a problem. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,Family dollar is a company that does not provide its employees with a safe working environment.  Family dollar has had several robberies.  I was personally a victim of an armed robbery.
bad,Not an inspiring or positive work environment. Minimal support from corporate but they expect the work to be done regardless. The only one making money enough to live on is the manager but he will have to work     many more hours than paid to make the store run correctly. No one else will make even 40 hours!!!
bad,The management was terrible. They cared little about your at home life. The pay does not match up with the job. Everyday you're on edge wondering if your store will be the next to close down. No room for advancement.
bad,"They hire rude and disrectful store managers that make you quit, nothings on point, they try to support policies that's not policy. It's just horrible"
bad,"If this is your first job it’s fine. Anything beyond that is a no go. Dead end. Prominent issues consist of you barely getting hours, getting randomly asked to come in in because there’s not enough employees to work the store, and also not being able to call off because of that. Those are just the surface problems of working at Family Dollar. The most obvious one is that you get paid very little."
bad,The company has no regards for your well being or your personal life. They will treat you like trash and expect for you to be grateful. They will run you dry and still expect for you to give 100%. They security there sucks because its a supposedly live feed but family dollar is constanstly getting robbed. Not to mention the constant stealing because there are never enough employees on a shift at one time.
bad,"Once had an incident with another coworker to which I never said a word to, I went straight to the supervisor, explained to him what happened plus it was all on CAMERA, as they say ""If you have an issue or any kind of problem, let your supervisor know""... I did the right thing and avoided a fight and the coworker was just yelling at me and cursing me out for no reason at all... I got fired and the other guy still there... you  riddle me that"
bad,A typical day at work I normally didn’t like it . The management is poor because they have you on the register without any breaks and the manager constantly leave you to the front by yourself even if your line is long.
bad,If I had to do it all over again I wouldn't. Management is too disrespectful to their employees. No breaks at all. They are always hiring. Working here would be great if you only needed a job for gas money
bad,"My job there was not worth the travel, etc. The people were friendly, most of them were. As far as work, the job was easy, but if you didn't work at the pace they wanted, not considering my pregnancy, then they would get rid of you. The district manager was not a good one, he gave more orders, than did his job as a boss. We worked long hours, no good or decent pay, no benefits (that I know of), no good ones anyway. We just didn't make enough to live, more like gas money pay. They beat around the bush of why I was separated, and made it seem, like they was going to call me back. No bashing, just literally the truth. Worse job ever."
bad,If you like working at a place that you don’t get help and they run you ragged expect you to do it all with nobody else to help you no overtime no customer assistance place is a total mess for shopping and nobody really cares the next place for you
bad,Working at family dollar was just temporary because I had just turned 18 and it was going to be my first job ever I working part-time $10.50 an hour I didn’t really enjoy working at family dollar because they had Poor management and my manager was really rude she would be so disrespectful towards me.
bad,"A bad manager can make your job horrible! Most family dollars are in bad neighborhoods so you would think they would invest in security. This company only cares about money, not the employees at all !"
bad,Terrible managment. Rude to employees rude to customers. Doesn't care about the needs of employees refused to give me off the day i asked for but gave me 3 days off after the day i requested (2 weeks in advance.) 10 out of 10 DO NOT RECOMMEND.
bad,My hours where never certain. And I always had to work weekend and couldn't get off for Dr appointments. I was a assistant manager and made less than $10 a hour and sometimes worked more than my store manager
bad,"Awful general manager. Gave them specific days I was unable to work due to working at another job part time. They said that was fine yet the first time that day came around, they called me in."
bad,"This is the worst company to work for. The store manager I had thought it was okay to talk to me any kind of way when I didn't follow his made up rules. I called HR and nothing was done. Glad I'm gone, you're just a number to this company."
bad,"The store manager, loss prevention manager and assist manager were all from India. They pushed their beliefs on me and when the store manager found out I was a Christian, the store manager accused me of stealing with no proof whatsoever. Even a head quarters in California had charges against me. I'll never go. back or reccomend them."
bad,I was treated very poorly by store manager. She forced me to switch days off with her for social functions and threatened me with termination when I wouldn’t.
bad,Not great environment schedule was different ever week. Pay was to low for the amount of work you did. Always low staff for the amount of customers on a daily basis.
bad,Management at my location was terrible. He has no consistency or a clue to what he was doing. He makes regular employees work off clock and he changes hours in the system so you don't get paid in full. He has employees doing tasks that does not meet the requirements for position hired.
bad,16 hour pay check is no money no way to live give u no hours to live off of by 4 hours a day 2 days a week no one can live off that. I have a family to care for. We had ro mve in with my sister. You work 4 hour shifts just to get maybe a 120 dollar check
bad,At first it was good till somebody new got hired an my hours got cut but the manager was saying my recovery wasn’t good so I started doing it slowly an making sure everything was good than the day I left an called an asked him what am I doing so wrong he came up with a nother  excuse
bad,"Poor, disrespectful management that required too much from one individual to do because they are always letting people  call off. Not a safe environment"
bad,I was written up for things i shouldnt have been written up for. I was under paid. Other employees got away with stealing and lying. Manager is lazy as well. Employees are treated unfairly.
bad,At the beginning I really liked this company but then it became a company based on treating their employees like they were thieves. It wasn't fair to be degraded and treated like that.
bad,"You get no benefits or discounts, management sucks and they over work staff, staff is unreliable and managers are lazy, they over work workers with not enough pay."
bad,poor management rude and unfair. the manager picked every day. the manager used to take extra long breaks leaving me in the store alone. the manager talked to me like a little child in front of customers
bad,"This is the worst company you could possibly work for.  As an assistant manager who has worked here for two years, I am paid less than fast food workers get starting out. They expect us to work our entire shift with no breaks and no lunch, often in the store alone. The store I work in has broken air conditioning, and temperatures routinely exceed ninety degrees inside the store. Last month one of our cashiers had a heat stroke and had to be hospitalized. Management still does nothing about the problem. They decided instead to purchase new overhead lights and a new point-of-sale system. The only way they can keep employees is by being such a stain on your resume that you have no hope of getting another job. Stay FAR away!"
bad,Family dollars is all for they self they do not pay you holidays management treat you like youe nothing is not a good place to work if you are friendly person they don't take your feelings into consideration there is they are not for families they make you stay over your scheduled shift even if you don't want to you don't get breaks
bad,Can’t get no hours over 30 and they mess up my pay and won’t fix it can’t nobody live off 8.00 a hours and there no benefits and the raise is small you get one every year and I don’t get breaks and the employees don’t nothing . I don’t recommend this job to nobody
bad,I would recommend anyone with retail management experience to stay away from any family dollar type retail model. As a salary manager you will work until you are dead and no one will care. The bottom line is they will fleece every dime from low income areas while doing absolutely nothing to prevent theft. Then they will turn aroind and blame the manager for the shrink. You are in a loose loose situation
bad,"Poor uper management from the V.P. , R.D. and D.M. verry little to no support to help S.M. to be successful. I was put in a broken store which was on the floor and wasn't making sales. Mind its a 1.6 million dollar annually. I turned the store around in 30 days with no extra payroll or outside help. Bottom line family dollar consumed me there was no work life balance."
bad,"I was the store manager, I would work 90 hr a week when I was short staff they wouldn't send me any help or allow me time of, family dollar is a very shellfish place to work at, they dont care about the employees safety, I was robbed 4 times and on the fourth time the robber shot the gun in the store, and family dollar didnt care or do anything,I had to return to work the next day, thank God no one got hurt,"
bad,"Their management is out of wack you call corporate an you get a automated answering machine.  Then you cant really never get a paystub on time or in advance sometimes your paycheck is delayed.."
bad,"Family Dollar overworks and underpays employees, lies and uses manipulative language about bonuses and raises.  Intrusive upselling of unwanted products to customers driving away business.  Stores are kept stiflingly warm and uncomfortable for employees and customers leading to complaints."
bad,Worked for this company for around 2 years. worked just about every holiday. I asked to not be placed on nights since I had to walk to and from work. I was place on just about every shift possible. The only way to advance in this company is if you knew someone who knew someone.
bad,This company is not a good company to work for. They only care about the business.  They dont care about their employees at all. If u get sick or your child gets sick u might as well quit!
bad,"You are expected to do more than what is actually possible with no help. They a lot each store a certain number of hours a week to divide between employees and it’s no5 enough and worse if they get made they will dock your store hours. I seen cashiers getting as low as 7 hours a week each. The management is required to do everything unload trucks stock shelves clean and find time to manage employees,work register,help customers,and on and on. When usually it’s only the one manager and sometimes a cashier for part of the 8 hr shift. The there’s the up sale where the company decides every couple of weeks to change it from either candy bar or a Pepsi or chips. And your required to make customers purchase these things at check out. If you don’t sell wat the consider enough they will write you up ,fire you or even dock hours from your store. Worse part is there is absolutely no justification for the up sale no charity no cause just greedy corporations."
bad,This is a company that tells you one thing to get you in the door and then turns face and sets you up to fail by taking hours from the staff and having the store manager do everything and expect you to go way over you recommend hours and give 1 day off a week and wind up not having that one day for a couple of weeks in a row
bad,This company has been well known for not caring for their lower rank employees. Your hours would be all over the place if you even got any at all unless you are a salaried member of management.
bad,"They were unprofessional,unorganized,nasty attitudes, no set schedule .there was always drama,the manager  was very unprofessional  she was rude in front of customers  and corporate DO NOT do Anything about it..."
bad,The manager was a thief.  Would work people of the clock and never pay them.  Borrow money from the safe.  And when I got hurt doing something she should have been doing she fired me.  I sued.  I won.  She got fired.  Now works for dollar General
bad,The managers are terrible. I worked 3 of of the 6 family dollar stores in Staten Island NewYork. And all 3 of them are just terrible. Would not recomm
bad,"My ""manager"" was fixing our hours taking off breaks we didn't take until the HR manager came down to inspect our store, then we were told to take our breaks. As a full-time employee I NEVER got close to 38 hours, the AC was broken for 2 months with several complaints to HR and Corporate, not a single thing was done. This company is terrible. Not a single manager cared about their employees. And you can forget about HR helping with any complaints filed. DO NOT WORK HERE."
bad,I would close the store one day and open the next. There was no consistency to the work schedule. It was hard to do my job with cooperate procedures that were not handled in a timely manner. The pay didnt compensate with the work load and raises were fairy tales. I loved working with the public and had many customers that loved coming to my store to see me.
bad,"One of the worst places I've ever worked at. Management does not care about anyone but themselves. I had to unload truck and stock by myself every week, as of I was the only person working there."
bad,"Some Managers get promoted for not doing their job well. "
bad,I was not impressed in any way by this franchise. They could have cornered this little area that I live in but they just could not manage to keep good employees.
bad,Not a great place to work. Over worked under staffed and almost always working alone. I worked with no heat in the winter months it was very bad. Very stressful.
bad,"Family Dollar does not care about you. The managers are not kind, do not train, and are not professional. I was harassed the whole time employed with the organization and there is no way of reporting or resolving issues because all the managers and some associates stick and hide together. "
bad,I work very hard and only to find out you only receive a raise as a team effort. But no one seems to care because management only worry about there bonus and them selves.
bad,"The worst experience of my working life. I am college educated and have worked abroad in three countries. I speak three languages. I have always been in management most of my life. The “old boy network” is alive and well in this company. The DM are the most abusive, misogynistic men I have ever encountered anywhere. They need to clean house. Nobody lasts in this company more than six months."
bad,"They disrespect their  employees."
bad,If I could give 0 stars I would this company  is a joke along with management!! I have never worked for a company that’s so greedy and does not care about there employees. They don’t care who’s sick or has problems as long as you show up to work. They over work there employees without a single thanks or appreciation.. they also told me and my co-workers to sell certain items and its being donated to cancer patients when really it was a lie cuz I could still go in back of the register and see those items back there
bad,It was very poor management in the store a lot of call offs and new hire because people were quitting do to store manager lack of management and not leading by example.
bad,The management was laid back and all but the store was old and smelt like something died in the back. The people there were friendly too. Customers were ok.
bad,They did not care about you. They said they would work the schedule around my second job. (They didn't) every time m manager ran my drawer it came up short.
bad,I like my position just not the company it changed to many store managers and lots of different employees they worried about wrong things customers should always come first
bad,"Family dollar is the worst company to work for, they have poor hours and the mangers are all suck ups. We had to work part time for $8 an hour with 30 hours or less and the managers was working 45-50 hours making $15-30 an hour. That company sucks bad."
bad,When you are salary they take advatage of you. They dont care how many hours you work. They come in and put you down. I would never wish working there on anyone. There is a whole facebook page on employees they have mistreated.
bad,as soon as I got hired my coworkers begin having issues with me because I didn't just want to stand around and gossip and on my two days off I guess they took it upon themselves to tell management I was quitting so when I went in to work they didn't even mention to call me to give me aheads up instead I went to being terminated and never received my last paycheck from that place.
bad,Absolutely no good management. Coworkers always undermining you. Store manager never does their job. District managers are even worse. Expect miracles out of under employees but never managers. Also you work often and get kicked off the clock. So your working for free.
bad,A typical day at family dollar is come in and clock in sometimes the computers weren't working so we had a hard time next get started on the task of the day. When it come to being a assistant manager every family dollar has a different way of doing things and a different way of opening and closing thesststorst.ttraintraaccordingly
bad,Got the job and worked an average of 10-12 hours per week unless I needed time off then she would give me hours. Backwards for no reason! The pay is an insult and manager has no training.
bad,It sucked the hours were bad managment was bad hours was ok i guess the staff there was ok but they were really bossy and mean i couldnt wait to get out of there
bad,"One day you are fine and the next you are gone."
bad,this place only pay 7.25. They dont give byou any hours and there are no benefits. The hours are long and stressful and you dont get a discount non anyhing.
bad,"You have to not be hypocritical as a manager or to be bias. Friends should NEVER get promoted into positions- it should be based on merit. "
bad,Do not apply to this place they are a joke the management sucks the pay sucks as a store manager you get paid for 52 and sometimes / most of the time. Have to work 80 pulse hours a weeks  it isn’t worth it and if you get sick one day they want to take your position so fast this place is. Crazy
bad,Most stores are located in bad areas. Not enough hours given. Takes forever to get a promotion and raises are only once a year. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone. You
bad,The higher management doesn't care about employees what so ever. They only care about themselves and making money. If you complained to HR if would be known to the person you were complaining about not follows the employee wishes.
bad,The store manager April treats staff like terrible and throws products on the floor and throws tantrums if you ask to use the restroom . She talks behind everyone's back and if you confront her everyone else is a liar.  She's unprofessional and speaks about your work ethics to customers and threatens to smack you . The pay is 8.00 an hour to be in high school drama all over again. She is also very racist and calls her assistant manager ( her Mexican). She will snatch stuff out of your hand and throw it on the floor.
bad,"The main location that I worked was very unprofessional, dirty as I don't know what, and part timers are treated like slaves while management made the big bucks while not doing anything. Out of the three managers there at the time of my employment there was only ONE who actually worked and stayed out on the sales floor. The store manager stayed going out back for a cigarette  leaving me all alone in the store to zone, check out customers, & basically just run the freaking store! The other lazy manager would close herself in the office & talk on the store phone so whenever I needed an override at the register, which happened a lot because customers would often wait until I had rung up an item to then tell me they don't want it & just my luck it was never the very last thing I scanned. So I'd have to leave the freaking register just to find the manager to give me an override. There was a lot of favoritism so if you didn't sell whatever candy of the month you weren't liked very well by the store manager which was fine by me. They put up a fake out of order sign on the women's bathroom door JUST so they didn't have to clean up after customers oh yeah unless me and the one other part timer cleaned the bathrooms THEY DIDN'T GET CLEANED. My location was just pure disgusting and it seemed to have gotten worse even after all the management that was there when I worked there left. There's not really any breaks for part timers, we were just worked like slaves. I know not all family dollars aren't like that thankfully, I don't even shop at the family dollar stores in my town it's just that"
bad,"I worked here for a year and it was the worst year of my life. Management is horrible and only care about themselves. The location I worked at wasn't ran the way It was supposed to be. The store manager always did stuff that was against corporate rules which also resulted in the store getting robbed. Store manager illegally changed my hours on my time card and I wasnt paid for 9 hours, which I STILL have not seen yet and it's been 2 months. This company is the worst."
bad,Bad place to work understaffing management does not care about you or the work you do they only want you to make the store money and not worry about if you are killing yourself doing it. No help
bad,"NEVER WORK THERE!!!! They do not care about their employees. Managers and district managers are trash and should be fired. If you report to HR, you will be retaliated against by your manager, which is against federal law"
bad,I started here in 2018 and the first few months as a cashier was fun but then I was forced into management. Upper management basically told me that I was the only one for the job. But I felt so intimidated that I felt like I had no choice. The SM I worked for is someone you definitely want to watch out for. If you’re a Guy trying to work here just know that you will be unloading a truck every week regardless of how you’re feeling (Sick or injured) I’ve unloaded trucks by myself with damage to my shoulder but SM chose to ignore. This sounds like Me retaliating but believe it’s not. It’s Just me  keeping things real with you. No one should be treated like this. And remember if you don’t come in on your day off watch for the retaliation from upper management.
bad,You are hired to work part time but you work full time hours and don’t get paid for overtime. You work off the clock and still don’t get paid. You don’t get a lunch break after working full time hours
bad,"a typical day is watch your back you never know who's going to reach over the counter at you over a coupon. I learned to be for self only, and never complain about hours you work or else you will find yourself getting 10 hrs a week. Management does not care about you or your life outside of FD."
bad,Lack of communication and a hot head. The manager always had an attitude and would horseplay with other employees around the store. Also very rude to customers at times.
bad,Family Dollar is one of the worst company's I ever worked. You work long shifts. The overall customer ate rude and they steal. The job is not safe at all. I had a knife pulled on me because the man was stealing. Management is a joke. They sit back and make you do all the work. While their on smoke breaks are out of store doing only God knows. Staff always calling out which leaves you to do a double. Their turn over rate for hires is ridiculously high.
bad,There is no security with this job family dollar does not care about your safety just the merchandise. Store managers have too many people work the shifts they work and other shifts end up short handed. You have to pay for the uniform they require you to wear and it never shows up and they do not refund your money! You either work a bunch of hours or very little hours or you don't work at all
bad,At first it started off great then I kept getting called in to the point that I worked 2 weeks straight after I told the manager she started getting petty and only scheduled me for two days out of the week. She has also written me up for no reason so I put in my two weeks after that she took me completely off the schedule and has done the same thing to other employees as “punishment”
bad,Been in retail for 25 years. Never have I seen a more disorganized and poorly managed company. The store was beyond disorganized. Under staffed always.
bad,"Don't work here. You are taking your life into your own hands. Unsafe, with an unrealistic expectation of store personnel. They give the store manager very little hours to work with from week to week."
bad,"The manager is  very unprofecional and a person hard to work with. Menacing if we couldn't sell a product will cut hours. Used inappropriate language and belittle the employees. You have to be  working as a cashier, stocking, cleaning and be a security person for minimum wage. Couldn't take breakes. Doesn't matter how hard you work, it wasn't never enough. A nightmare working there. I will not recomend to work there to anyone."
bad,"They do not pay enough at all to compensate for the over worked managers or cashiers. No lunch breaks, no appreciation. Managers are overworked and stressed and extremely underpaid. They offer all these bonuses and benefits but make it impossible for you to receive then. They give up to 3% raises which is nothing when u figure out hours worked. No over time pay at all. No hours to run a store effectively."
bad,I worked for Family Dollar for a year and a half. By the end of the first year there were days I would come home from work and literally bawl my eyes out. There is nothing professional about this company and nothing is ever good enough. They will make sure to tell you everything that's wrong abt you but there will NEVER come a time where you will be thanked or recognized for a job well done. I was an assistant manager and in all the time I worked here the longest a cashier stayed was 2 months. Everyday I worked I was soaking wet from sweat bc they expect way too much than anyone can keep up with. WORST JOB I'VE EVER HAD IN MY 18 YEARS OF WORKING!!!!!
bad,All day by myself and expected to do it all by yourself and stock run the register and keep theft down to a minimum. Luckily i was in a good neighborhood so that wasnt a bad problem but some of the other stores i dont see how they can do it.  A friend of mine was a manager at a different store and they would not let her go to chemotherapy treatments
bad,After the original store manager let I became an assistant store manager and the new manager became big headed and let the store go and work me extra hard. I had to work only the weekends every weekend day and night for weeks!
bad,I would not recommend anyone working here!! You get no breaks. No help until after 6 hours or more. They will tell you your pay is one thing and you get paid completely different. Then say they didn't say that.
bad,"First off, the pay they offer on here is a joke. I worked as an assistant manager getting paid $9.50 an hour to go above and beyond my pay grade and duties. I also still, after 2 months have not gotten paid my PTO that I accrued. "
bad,I was a cashier at Family Dollar in Barberton Ohio.I really enjoyed my first couple weeks but then I was cut off on hours a lot of favoritism gossip every day terrible horrible manager with no skills on training very stressful environment
bad,"From poor management, horrible scheduling and lack of work ethic from staff, my experience working for Family Dollar was the absolute worst. Apart from getting paid bi weekly, shifts wouldn't be posted till the night before the new week started and would vary from getting 25-30 hrs one week then only 10 the next. Tasks were majority of the time left undone by store manager and other staff. Nepotism and harassment were also apart of my work experience there. Even contacted HR and others in positions higher than the direct store positions. All claims were ignored and never looked into."
bad,If you die all they going to do is REPLACE YOU... I cleaned the whole store that I didn’t get credit for which the DM said she is the reason why the store was clean LIES!!
bad,The management is not willing to assis the crew members. There is not enough crew member to complete the daily requirements of stocking the shelves by the end of the day.
bad,The management above me was very unprofessional. He picked up more than he can handle therefore the business started to fall apart as well as the business. The manager made it seem like he wanted me there 24/7 knowing that i was in school. I used to have to leave class early just to drive there and make it on time.
bad,I learn never try do extra to help manger out because they will act like they did all the work . I would not recommand anybody to work at Family Dollar on Crockett road.
bad,controlling day to day operations by assigning task to team members. no real security. starting pay for assistant manager is very low. will never be given enough team members for store to run at its best.
bad,"Terrible corporate system, expensive insurance policies, low pay wages. Great internal management within the store but that is the only perk. Rude clientele."
bad,Scheduled me for 10 hours one day and I didn’t even get a 15 minute break or lunch they don’t want you to stand behind the counter but then u have to so you can ring up customers they change the schedule and don’t tell you then don’t even let you know. Management sucks they get 20 cigarette breaks while your busting you butt ringing customers up. Just a horrible place to work don’t care about their employees and so glad I don’t work there anymore
bad,"Most of the time just one cashier for the whole shift, line backed up people frustra3for long time on line to pay.  Management doesnt care.  The pay rate is the minimum.   No matter how hard you work the raise still minimum."
bad,No lunch breaks at all. You have to be the cashier and stock at the same time. Manager ruth martinez is ugly and rude with customers and employees. You never get help when you have a line at the register. Also you have to unload the truck every thursday and friday. If it comes in at 6am you have to be there! No exceptions.. The manager sends customer service reps to make deposits and get change and she counts how long you take. I have to mention that job is only done by the manager or the assistant managers. You do all that while You get paid minimum. 7.25 per hour. Also no employee discounts!!! Horrible place to work. No benefits at all. Good thing I had another job already before leaving this job!
bad,Dont NEVER WORK FOR FAMILY DOLLARS THE COMPANY ON CARE FOR THEMSELVES! Family dollars sucks you work to hard for the little money they gives! Also when u get a raise its like .25 every year or .30 they suck
bad,I worked at Family Dollar at a time when management was changing multiple times. The instability in addition to my school schedule made it very hard to continue a job here.
bad,"While the training program is extensive and well outlined, the reality of the job is anything but well outlined.  The store manager is expected to work alone most of the day.  My experience was I worked alone from open until about 5pm everyday.  I had zero work/life balance and was paid a very low salary."
bad,Hard work horrible boses that never want to take care of anything. Horrible schedual and no hours starting out. Just a very bad experience all together
bad,"I don't miss the stress of working there, some of the rude customers who treat you like you're stupid because you're just a cashier at family Dollar, the lack of financial and verbal appreciation for what you do, and the lack of quality for a place to work in general."
bad,The entire company can be ran better and safety is a very big concern for the workers and it seems like the company and their high up management needs to listen to the people who are actually running the stores.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend a job here to my worst enemy. The management doesn't really care about their staff, and they have no value for family or emergencies. Also they liked to switch up the schedule at the last second and not tell anyone!"
bad,I will not ever return to working in the retail field or Family Dollar ever again. The company only care about their money and not their employees. A typical day of work for me was me going above and beyond without being appreciated. I currently have a injury and the company and boss seem too not care about my well-being and make a big deal about having doctors appointments that are not able to be rescheduled and knew about.
bad,Even on my days off I was being called all day long with Problems. Currently the Store has went from a 5 to a -10 with shelves empty and stock room full to the ceiling.  It needs shut down it is ridiculous.
bad,Upper mgmt. only is interested in whether or not you sell enough for them to get bonuses. You are expected to work without breaks or clock out for breaks and not leave the premises in case you are needed.
bad,"General and District management, HR, unorganized , treats every employee as irreplaceable, ridiculous expectations, not one rule or policy enforced by even management, drama , highschool like environment, overworked, insensitive to family emergencies... etc. As an assistant Manager I was not allowed to work another job or exceed 36 hours, not worth it.  My experience working for Family Dollar was a disaster."
bad,"Absolutely terrible place to work..Management is terrible, they're always on their phones, the aisles are always blocked with pallets, boxes all over the place, shelves never recovered, always a stolen item box laying somewhere, etc."
bad,"I was lied to about pay from the beginning. If you are just a cashier you will not get very many hrs. If you are assistant manager 35-38 hrs, store manager 52 hrs. Work days can be from open to close with no breaks(13hrs). Job duties are you do everything! Very hard to stock , recove check in vendors, clean and wait on customers all by yourself or with another person. Lots of drama. Store manager was short on several occasions and would have other assistant manager(closing) to short deposit to make up for shortage. No benefits. If store manager gets upset with you they will not work with schedule request. Store manager was always on phone ."
bad,It sucked working there Store manager was very petty and not understanding I was there for a year and everytime she hire someone new she would cut my 25 hours down to 12 and give the new employees 25 hours If you called off she would give you 4 hours for the next week You never get a increase in pay No holidays off and you only get over time on Christmas Eve Christmas And Easter but here’s the kick all you over time gets taking out for taxes so you don’t even see your over time It sucks working there
bad,"Was employed as a Customer Service Representative and was then put into the position of Field Specialist just without the salary of one. As a Field Specialist I worked in multiple stores and witnessed how poorly run all the store were in Philly. Unorganized, unsanitary, and the associates were all for the most part miserable due to the stress managers and customers alike would put on them. Every store I went to would be cluttered with misplaced or destroyed items, the backrooms would be completely filled with items and boxes due to no one maintaining them. One store made me clean up dead mice after a massive mice infestation flooded it and they didn't provide the workers with the proper bio-hazardous material to clean it all up. The pay for associates was horrible and in no way a livable wage. The higher ups in that company were also abhorrent. I was promised to be promoted to ""Field Specialist"" during my time there but I was lied to and told to keep working while they figure it out. They pretty much used me to make sure I kept working with the full pay of a Field specialist. I will strongly advise anyone to NEVER work there."
bad,"Awesome at first, work your ""rearend"" off and prove yourself, store manager leaves, youre let go. Was only one left from when i started... meant nothing... bust your ""rearend"" for nothing they have no problem letting you go"
bad,would never encourage anyone to look for employment with that company.  The pay is not comprhensive. among other issues. Knowledge and experience is not the proceeding factor.
bad,Family dollar employee smoke weed while leaving new cashiers with lines of people the employee have no respect and one puts hands one customers when its suppose to be automatic termination they promote people that don't do there jobs that family dollar is the most lacking professional there is!!!
bad,If signing up for Management be prepared to work alone and with one cashier even if it's a large store. No security at all but you're responsible for preventing shoplifting. Just not worth it.
bad,"Minimal hours to go around, even at the ASM position. Almost all stores are under staffed and CSRs are not required to be the best of the best but just willing to work which creates a toxic work environment. You have cashiers and stockers being rude to customers with no consequence except the ever so often firing in which higher management will just replace them with a person just like the one they let go, and its not because the manager particularly likes them it's because they don't want to work the extra hours, neither did I."
bad,It was a terrible place to work.  As a store manager you normally were forced to work 80 to 90 hours per week with little or no help.  It was a very unsafe environment as you were forced to constantly work alone.
bad,Full of drama. Shtty hours and pay. Can lose your job even if you have a d r accuse.  .   . . . .   . .       . . . . . . . ..........................
bad,"would not recommend to work here at all. The pay was fine, yet the amount of hours was to laugh at. 19 or less hours a week is sad for anyone unless you have no bills to pay. No advancement at all."
bad,It was cool at first. I got all my hours but the manager wasn't a good person. He constantly stood over you and constantly threatened to fire me and eventually he did so.
bad,poor job to work for no raise was told i to be let go to get a raise meaning i to reapply to get raise goid luck calling corporate their hr sucks all do is tell you to call District manager which they go back and tell tge store who called cause they friends
bad,Bad place to work not enough hours and the pay is not great .Also the management is lazy and they push their job off on every one else and they are getting salary. So I think the place is not a good job.
bad,Worked there for two years trained a lot of cashiers and assistant managers and have closed the store. Started at 8.00 and hour weekly to bi-weekly and only got a .15 raise. While others were starting at 9.00 an hour and people who were only there a month got bumped up to manager not knowing anything or how to do their job over someone who's been there longer and knows how to do the job. Also has people go to other store to get trained to be assistant manager and come back still not know how to do anything but stock and have to train them as well and still see no advancement in position or pay.
bad,They dont care about employees.the manager steals more then the customers do..i work for the one in highland hills.DONT GO THERE. the lines or aways long it can be 50 people in line and the want let no other employee gonopen anther line.
bad,"Family dollar was an underpaid, unorganized company to work for. Their requirments for the management and the employees were unsafe and sometimes impossible to perform"
bad,none nothing to say about this job management does not care about what is going on in your life the only enjoyable part is the people getting to know new people everyday is a blessing
bad,The just don't care about their teams or management just about there money.they lie to you the district don't come to do his job to make sure your store is on track.take the good worker out of the store and leave the bad. Most stores have a good family team the one's that does very good they will break up. And that just hurt the store most of the time the store can't recover.
bad,the job at family dollar was ok. they worked with my schedule while I worked my other jobs. the hours are ok .cool part-time job if u are looking for this type of work
bad,"i worked there for a short time and it seemed like favoritism.I wasn't getting enough hours, even with me being in school, customers would be very rude"
bad,"Management needs to go. Hours you are given depends on the mood your manager had towards you. Should you need to use bathroom while on register you can just forget it; it’s not happening or under the slight chance you happen to catch someone willing and they have to be logged into register or they cannot operate it therefore should the other person on register if you can find them you can ask them to cover for your bathroom break and you’ll be met with eye rolling heavy sighs and if it happens to be the Manager—-kiss your hours for the following week goodbye and breaks never received ever. It’s not a happy work environment at all. The manager will straight up embarrass employed right in front of our customers. So much so that we have had customers call corporate and complain about the manager doing this as well as other unacceptable behaviors. Corporate doesn’t care as our store is one of the biggest Money makers and it is not due to the manager it is simply because this area has no other option for our customers to be able to shop. If you dare call in sick you will not be given any hours possibly 10 or less. If you disagree with manager, same exact scenario. Manager is constantly on phone doesn’t do anything except run her mouth and want to feel important. The entire staff dislikes her but will not stand up to her for fear of losing hours each week. I was not staying at a place where my paycheck depended on a manager mood and whether she liked me or not that week.  I’d never suggest this company/this location to anyone at all!"
bad,Some family dollars are easier to work at when the managers aren't spiteful. Often its creepy men that work there and your stuck with the decision on losing your job or speaking up on the harassment.
bad,My experience at Family dollar was at the least unpleasant.  The environment was highly unsafe at this particular location.  Hardest part of the job was preventing product lost
bad,"Little Pay,  Overwork you only good this is weekly pay. A job for someone in college that tryingto get by otherwise i wouldnt reccomend this job to anyone"
bad,"Very unorganized, manager was rude and never did any work. You was there most of the time by yourself until the next person came in in the evening. Store was never cleaned or organized. Very unprofessional"
bad,assist with opening store also assist with freight push through out the day also ranging customer purchases and returning items as need per the customer
bad,"Poor Management, and the lack to increase pay will have you looking for an other job. I worked there for 6years, we would only get a 30¢ raise once a year. They over send products so your back room is always full. It's not a Good place to work"
bad,"Too many shady ppl in the business trying to take advantage of others , never had a set schedule and never had time for my family my children started failing in school"
bad,It is very unsafe your life is always on the line I saw my manager get shot an family dollar did nothing about it.I will never shop nor work for family dollar ever again.
bad,"No lunch breaks "
bad,"Poor training, no support with hours.  Work load was impossible with recourses given mainly hours.  If someone called out you were expected to stay and cover shift.  Work over 75 hours a week"
bad,there is no staff that is willing to work for the pay or stress they may cause. always short of staff.they never hire new people. they want you to stop people from taken there items but if you get hurt on the job they dont help you .they will fire you no matter how good a worker you are.
bad,This store has no proper management cashiers are rude they have no manpower to keep up with the store there was nothing but favoritism no hours and poor management
bad,I would not recommend anybody to work at the family dollar on little rock rd in charlotte they store is dirty and the management stays outside smoking cigarettes!!!!
bad,"Store manager didn't want me. Transferred from another store. I got sick, but was able to return but with a minor limitations. But it wasn't workers comp. Store manager let me go. District manager kept saying she had to ask human resources and human resources kept saying it was up to my manager. Was not aloud to come back therefore was terminated"
bad,Not enough pay... The employees are lazy and doesn't stock correctly.. The district manager is a jerk and doesn't communicate.. No opportunity for career advancement ..I'm resigning soon
bad,Strange wishy washy rules. And terrible district managers. Internal theft is the reason for everything apparently. Even if half of us who work there haven't even thought of stealing a thing.
bad,How are you part-time when they have you working more than 50 hours a week. Everyone keeps quitting because the managers/supervisors don't want to give you a break. They make you work a 16-hour shift if you have to take a day off during the week. Supervisors spend the day talking on their phone relaxing while you do your job and part of their job. A co-worker had to spend the night at Family dollar because she couldn't lock the door because the manager had taken the keys with him and would not answer his phone when she tried to call him.
bad,"Horrible company to work for. Expected to do 100 tasks at once, put away stock and ring customers at same time. Not enough people on staff to cover shifts. Doesn't care about employees at all. Schedules are made literallt the night before, can't have a life outside work because you dont find out your schedule until night before the week."
bad,"The company itself have no regard towards their employees for example: unstable work schedule, unorganized in managing money, cleanness of the store and employee restrooms is not up to it par, no teamwork, a lot of blame game on each other on who doesn't get the job done due to district managers/company putting a 5 man job on one person, and the pay is seriously not worth it! Pay you pennies to do a 5 man job. The company give you all the rules and regulations on what the requirements are to work for them but don't even practice it themselves. Overall, it not worth applying for!"
bad,Nothing is followed by the book and people come and go as they please. Everything broke and too many co-worker issues. Management barely do anything and try to make cashiers do everything while they smoke cigarettes all day. Co-workers also seeing each other and the store manager encourage it. WE HAVE NO STORE MEETING EVER!
bad,"The manager only hired myself another cashier.  That meant we had to be at work nearly every day.  She would not hire a part time manager, so that we could have a couple of days off a week.  She had us stay over almost every day.  She would call us and even come to our house on our days off to ask us to work.  I worked for 22 days straight once and I could not take being away from my kids anymore, so I put in my resignation."
bad,They over look people for promotions that already should be in management. Store managers push all the hard work on the assistant managers. The pay is horrible they work everyone into the ground.
bad,"managers are overworked, associates are under paid. hours are long, rewards are non-existent. not a very good environment, and growth is hard. you are expected to put the company before your family"
bad,"What you do is clean, stock, recover , deal with customers. The hardest part about the job is sometimes putting everything away . because there is a lot of stuff to put away ."
bad,it was difficult to get time off when needed and the store manager was mean even trying to work it out and it just didnt happen. i was cussed once for being in the hospital and the back room being a mess and the last time was over a water leak
bad,"there were extremely long days and the manager would not give me breaks even working 8-10 hour shifts. I would not do it again, especially with that kind of management."
bad,No matter how hard you worked they never appreciated what you did for them..could never do anything right. Favored the young cashiers by letting them get away with everything
bad,"Being a cashier at Family Dollar, there was no structure. There was no store manager, I worked as a manager and did majority everything and didn't receive a raise nor bonus."
bad,"Each store embraces the characteristics of its manager.  Unfortunately if the manager ""allows"" the store to get rundown, everyone else learns to ""allow"" the store to BE rundown.  So much disinformation about future plans, store openings, promotions, pay, and discounts.  Some of the information given in the tutorials are simply ignored by management and the veteran staff.  The new associates coming in may attempt to ""follow the rules"" as provided by the online courses but often get ridiculed for doing so.  "
bad,"managers lie , Discriminate ,poor hours, low pay no breaks,no lunch breaks , expected to work through breaks and no lunch breaks, expected to do managers jobs"
bad,"I use to love to work at family dollars because i got a chance to help people.And helping people is a part of my lifestyle.i use to stock,cashier a bit,but the management was not professional."
bad,"Disorganized, full of rats, thieves and employees who don't not care about the job. Managers belittling employees. They was never enough workers and management would refuse to hire more people."
bad,Was very stressful working at family dollar co- workers would over work me and take credit for my work try and make me look bad when i needed a manager over ride the assistant would pretend to do an over rife and have customers uoset witb me
bad,"Some stores have unpotable water. Some managers are racists. They will use any reason to get rid of you especially if you stick up for yourself or your co workers. In company thefts, dont say anything because you will get fired"
bad,The particular store i worked at was falling apart and the district manager was not nice. It was in a sketchy part of town and kept getting robbed and the district managers apparently didnt care to do anything about improving the safety of their workers. Wouldnt recommend.
bad,I worked there as an assistant Manager and was treated poorly i was banned because they said they fired me when i put my two wk notice in and they didn't properly put in the system so when i didn't show up for a shift i shouldn't had been sch for because it was past my two wks they put they fired me and banned me from working for them a lot of the managers are stealing from the company and teaching other employees how to and they get away with it but if you bring it up to a higher manager they cut your hours and treat you like dirt they brought someone in to do the same job as me offered them alot more money then me after i had been there a yr and a half instead of giving me my raise like they said they would they are a shady company to work for in Dayton Ohio atleast wouldn't let me transfer or anything.
bad,Absolutely terrible company to work for. The way the store was run was a joke and the district manager did nothing to resolve it. It was basically like working at a high school
bad,"They under pay staff, and are never clear with corporate orders. Hours are constantly cut but extra work is still expected to be completed. Store managers are never available when problems occur"
bad,"They are low paid for the work you do. Management always changing, one went to jail and one was under investigation for $2000 they embezzeld and items stolen by them. A high turn over in employees"
bad,This was the worst job I’ve ever had. Benefits sucked ! Hours sucked. Barely had help! Very stressful and tiring ! If I had a chance to refer someone I wouldn’t.
bad,"Opened and closed the store. Point of sale trained. I trained staff. Put up truck orders. Price changes. Cleaning the store. Cash handling. Band deposits,"
bad,This job under paid me as well as took money out of my checks for breaks I never received I worked alot for a very little amount of pay and well as I would travel to other locations
bad,I worked there for almost a year and the whole time it was horrible I do not regret quitting the  managers expect ridriculous labor from one worker Whit only 2 people in the whole store  ridiculous long lines slow managers dirty store and the workers  are to personal dont take nything professional worst experience  there hands down made me look like the bad guy at the end for quitting and sticking up for myself ..its a save job
bad,"Out of all places I have worked, this one had the most poorest management I have ever seen. The boss was never there to take care of her own store and cared little for all employees unless they were her favorites."
bad,Okay place to work if you like working short staff. Management is not the best. If you like he say she say stuff drama this place is a good match for you. Good luck
bad,all of the Cincinnati and NKY stores are trash. no one in D102 reg 10 zone 8  has any clue on how to run a store. i would not shop or work at any FD. Check your food if you buy they dont rotate their product.
bad,the area was an unsafe zoom so there was alot of stealing and lot of other things going on so i wasnt surprised with the activities going on. but other then that it was okay.
bad,When our store manger quit our DM didnt try to get us help. She called and complained to us assistant managers about things that needed done. We told her about our situation and she still didn't do nothing. We had two cashiers that didn't listen and would call in a lot or come in late. I was working six days a week and some days I would have to work open to close. Family dollar has terrible management and are terrible with communication. All Management cares about is if the store is open other than that they dont care what is going on in your store.
bad,Due to the lack of hours I had to work two jobs while going to school just to be able to pay my bills. it began to be a hard task around the end of my semester in college.
bad,"I enjoyed working at this location. It was fun, but management caused a few problems later on. I wouldn't recommend it. I enjoyed easy access to food during my breaks."
bad,"no room for advance, the managers were always late to work. I was there 2 years only missed 4 days total came in on off days and picked up others slack. never given a raise or offers and assistant manager potion and learned it was given to a per\son who was there a month with no previous experience"
bad,"If you are able to work at any retail company then pick a different route than Family Dollar. I was there almost three years no raise, the manager would manually enter a lunch when I had to work through it. There is no way of contacting HR because they do not provide any phone numbers. This company really takes advantage of their employees."
bad,"very fast paced and hard work, not enough hours in the day to get work done, fixed budget that the manager is mostly doing the work because you cant keep people at minimum wage,"
bad,They told me to get a car and I would become asst manager and then didn't give me the position and cut my hours was long hours on feet wouldn't let take a break till 4 hours
bad,"If you want to be stressed out and aggravated, this is the job for you. Lazy employees, uneducated managers, and ghetto customers that will work your nerves over the smallest things. You are better off working at McDonalds!"
bad,"do not apply.......Poorly run company.Family Dollar will not be around in two years. Team members  are over loaded , customer service is poor and shrink is out of control."
bad,I dont have any positive feedback for this company. But I can say is the atmosphere outside of the New Orleans region is a totally different outlook. Thank You!
bad,Overall scummy company. Nasty people and they dont care about their employees. Only good thing is fast promotion other than that find somewhere else to work
bad,"N/A It was trash, inconsistency  the site was terrible the store was ran in an unprofessional way. The manger really didn’t mange the store the assistant manager did"
bad,I used to love this job been there almost 5 years but when most of the people left it went down hill so it’s like you are just there no more fun and no more excitement.
bad,Had no brakes work was poor to much work with no employee u had to do more that u can do others job like the store manager never was there on time she will talk to u like u are her kid there is no respect ppl do whatever they want it was a bad experance even dow i learn alot of retail on my own i just dont recommend no one to work for family dollar they dont treat u right.
bad,"Nothing was good experience outside of helping customers there was no positivity, no chance for advancement and the GM of the store sets the tone for the store and he was lazy and unorganized."
bad,"Well for starters they offer Benefits but at a super high cost, it was costing me more then half my pay. There is no to very little training, i was showed to close and open once and was expecting to be a expert. The stores you have to work in are in very poor conditions, the store on Yale had a leaking roof for years and black mold in the ceilings walls bathroom and back stockroom, other stores have non functioning back doors. If a employee has a family emergency, you will have too work double and triple shifts because no other store wants to help out. I was robbed at gun point and all that upper management offered was ""Good job"".  Evidently if you close the store you will have come right back and open the store on a regular basis. which only leaves 6 to 7 hours between shifts. you are on register all the time, and left alone for 6 to 7 hours at a time. No breaks are ever offered, and was told on many occasions you do not get one."
bad,"This was this most miserable and DANGEROUS location I have ever worked.  The ONLY reason I performed as well as I did was because of respect from my hiring manager.  When he left, I saw the company for what it was..garbage."
bad,"Not a job to solely rely on, its also very dangerous and staff will easily replace you. Unreliable hours and pay and over work of the associates depending on the area its high robbery neighborhoods that are short staff."
bad,I enjoyed my cumstors the work was easy you never get enough hours you only work two or one day maybe three the job was not enough to live off of you do not get benefits as a cashier you have to be a manger to get benefits
bad,"I don't know where to start. Long hours. Most of my shifts were from open to close. High turnover rate. Management doesn't care about employees at all. Had to work alone alot. High expectations and no hours. Was without a store manger for months. No one to push freight. I continued to ask for help and more training. My requests fell on deaf ears. My DM is a joke. Was told to find my own replacement when I was deathly ill. No compassion what so ever. I was an Assistant Manager. My pay was a joke. I was told by the powers that be that my store was ""ghetto"". I never felt safe working alone. Locks on front door are a joke. Was also told when working alone I'm not allowed to lock the doors to go to the restroom. Never had a break. Never. I've been there since July of last year. I'm actively looking for a new place to work. Whatever you do...don't work for Family Dollar. You will regret it."
bad,Worst job I've ever had would not recommend to anyone. Poor salaries. Poor management. Poor human resources. Poor company. Maybe not everywhere but in Florida the stores are horrible
bad,Its a nice place to shop for people especially when you can use food stamps and get some house products or for the car but some of the management us horrible
bad,Company pays you to work certain amount of hours but require you to get to much completed with minimal hours. I would recommend this position for anyone. Worst company I've ever worked for.
bad,Closing of many stores means not doing very well not sure how long they will last. It’s been a few years not sure of the culture now with them being acquired by dollar tree
bad,A typical day at work was focused on store recovery and inventory control. Hardly any room to move in the stock room. Employees hate their job and therefore don't want to work.  Very high turnover in upper management so getting questions answered was almost impossible. The hardest part of the job was probably the stock room. Most enjoyable part were customers.
bad,I hate working here. They make you do everything. One little thing you mess up on their down your neck. They expect to much out of you for 12$ an hour. They make you work off the clock. Which should be against the policy. You barely get breaks. You will get in trouble for every little thing you do in there.
bad,"I would never recommend this place to a single person. This is the worse company to work for. If you get sick you still have to show up. Miss one day, they will write you up."
bad,people are unhappy looking the company is horrible to work for so not worth it I left here an asstiant manger and went to dunkin donuts as an associate and I'm way happier and get paid just as much plus tips and I get to be home by 6 with my kid where I was 12 to close at family dollar 5 days a week not worth it
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job to nobody unless if they just working just work I don't know working at that job wasn't healthy for me so I quit and moved on to a better job
bad,WORST JOB EVER it was sooooo bad. I hated it so much it’s not even real. Family dollar is the last place I want anyone to work at. Please don’t work there
bad,Slow work place . Store was out of date no benfits was offered no healthcare was offered. No breaks only a lunch break and that was only 30 mintues...
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone working for this company. The upper management as far as the store managers and the district managers have no care for you safety or your well being.
bad,"just a good place to start not for long term ."
bad,I didnt like the vine or anything the stealing and the lack of security was a little to much any and everyone was a manager with no management skills.
bad,management do not know how to make schedule. one person unloading the truck. Lacking of personal to work. Log shifts. No overtime paid. Employees call off.
bad,They don’t value their people and we’ve been treated wrongfully and in a slavery situation where if you didn’t liked it you been kicked off at the spot.
bad,"Loved the people I worked with customers were great,management there was an issue....the job itself was great very busy store plenty to do working with cashiers and stock people very easy to work with.  Manager brought in a friend as another assistant they worked side by side so others lost hours or were scheduled hours they could not work."
bad,"Too many things to do at once and no time to focus on any of them"
bad,It was not a good place from my experience working at . I was only getting 7hrs a week I couldn’t do anything which then checks they only have one person working doing 2 different jobs at once
bad,Management wasn't truthful and cut corners. There was no positive feedback. A lot of back biting and hours were cut but demands were high. I can't recommend this job to anyone!
bad,"They treat all their employees as if they're stealing from them. They don't like to hire people so you're always short-staffed, there's no overtime or you get in trouble. As full time management I was still at hourly never had paid time off and you can't call in. I work every weekend as a single mother of three children. With no benefits and no Christmas bonus is no paid time and a half for holidays."
bad,"they will try and work you to death. they never close for any holiday and only give you holiday pay for Christmas.had to work thanksgiving and Christmas by myself in the store. they work the assistant managers like store managers without the pay, the assistant managers make .90 cent more than the cashiers THIS JOB IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!! DUCK THIS JOB AT ALL COST!!!!"
bad,Very poor management.  They don't know people or have the experience to hire the correct people.  They just fill the positions. Upper management doesn't fire store managers even if they are violating company policies. The worst company ive ever worked for.
bad,"The best part of the job was the customers.  The other employee's gossip, management was terrible and basically a cut-throat place to work.  No making friends at this job...."
bad,"If you don't fit into the ""click"" of managers, then you will not be around very long, they will drive you out. No room for advancement, no one listens to your ideas either."
bad,I would never recommend this company because the CEO is just for him in just for him only the HR department sucks so does lose prevention department sucks
bad,this job was a nice job and i enjoyed it a lot i shouldn't  have left. this was one of the best paying jobs that i have had and i would tell anyone to go to family dollar
bad,"I was only scheduled to unload trucks on the weekend at 4 or 5 a clock in the morning.was only ever scheduled for nomore then but not limited to 2 to 3 days on the schedule per week,at or around 8 hours a shift ."
bad,The mangers boyfriend has the the keys to the store and the safe and comes in the store whenever he likes in dont work there its not safe at all in not professional
bad,family dollar supports the company better than it supports the employees hired to help the businesses operate. family dollar treats their employees horrible and they are extremely under paid by weekly.
bad,"A Typical day at work, clocked in to start working. The day started when you count your register to make sure it is at $150. Then you start working on U-boat to stock and refill items on the shelves."
bad,Don't appreciate everything the employees do for the company they don't supply supplies security for the company or the employees the employees are not feel safe they get robbed every other day and they refused to pay for security to secure the customers and their employees of safety is the worst place to work for as far as the employees that lovely but the company and its management and everything about the corporation sucks
bad,I had the worse job ever they hassle u for everything not only that themanager was sexually harrassing me i would do what he would tell me to do exactly how he says to do and it stilll wasnt good enough
bad,"over work you with little to no help base off a small budget. store manager work anywhere from 10-15 hrs a day, and only have one day off and thats sunday,"
bad,family dollar was very irritating. the pay was low and the hours were low. no one wanted to show up for work and there had been quite a few times that i had been threatened by a customer.
bad,"no working phone on site for over 6 months"
bad,"Expect you to do the job of 3 people by yourself."
bad,Doesn't care anything about family and works employees to death and only cares about pulling numbers. Pays the bare minimum they can because they go off the surrounding areas pay. Shows favoritism to women and works men like slaves.
bad,"Family Dollar is a company that I feel needs to be restructured. Each store follows their own rules & does things differently. They do not care about their workers, the turn over is very high. There is Never enough help. Most of the employee are there for a paycheck & dont care about anything else. They take very little pride in what they do."
bad,"Run far. Run fast. Dont look back.Horrible place to work. They will use you for what your worth then throw you away and replace you without batting and eyelash.They do not care about your health, your family, you at all."
bad,"This place chew you up and spit you out. I was supposed to have  two weeks to train for assistant manager, they gave me one. and when Igot there the main manager didn't finish the training as promised and left on vacation. the store was wrecked when the manager left and was upset it was the same run down store when they came back. this place throws empty promises hoping you'll keep working for so little."
bad,The management is very poor. The store is very unorganized and there’s unopened boxes everywhere. The manager has no control over her employees and they can do whatever they want while at work.
bad,Lack of employee communication skills and uncomfortable with management team.. you can talk about a problem but it won’t be fixed very unfriendly... after a while you get more uncomfortable
bad,"They expect you to not only be the cashier, but to be the stocker as well. They want you to come in, clock in, and get started right on a ""u"" boat. Meanwhile, the manager is sitting in the make-shift breakroom which is just a microwave and a table in the corner of the backroom eating breakfast from the shelves. This is a horrible place to work, no room for advancement unless they like you, they want you to stock all the shelves assigned which are often times for than 4 or 5 separate isles in an hour all while still taking customers at the registers and getting them out in a timely fashion."
bad,"The management, including the district manager is poor. Assistant district manager played favorites and would often help get employees fired for no reason."
bad,"no words for this place.no team work, underpayed, just way too much to deal with no i in the word team. supervisors was unfair to the hard working worker"
bad,"Honestly, if I could rate Family Dollar with less than 1 star, I would. Many times throughout my employment with Family Dollar, I was asked to work 16-hour shifts alone in the store. I was asked to close the store alone at night on many occasions. I will quickly add that closing the store alone is against store policy. There were other manager and cashier's belittling eachother and being almost hostile towards eachother. It was a horrible job, and I wish that upon no one."
bad,Wrongfully terminated.  Manager didn’t like me for personal reason. Hours got cut from 34 to 28 or less a week with being full time.  Always had the night shifts. Had to work entire truck and overstock with just one csr with no help from the manager. Pay isn’t worth the work.
bad,"Hands down, one of the worst places to work!"
bad,The company's standards have decreased since being brought by Dollar Tree.  I used to work 90 a week fixing all the issues when I first took over the location.
bad,The people I worked with were always complaining and making derogatory comments about the opposite sex it became uncomfortable. Working the freight was the best part hated cash registers.
bad,"Worked long hours alone Manager never there to unload or put up freight When he was he was face timing or playing words with friends "
bad,Managers Are Rude . Treat Customers And Employees Very Badly ! The Managers Have No Respect For There Employess ! Would Never Work There Again.  Safety Is A Very Big issue.
bad,"Worst company ever, in every way. Low pay and not enough payroll hours; endless hours ALONE in the store while expected to service customers, stock the store and watch for theft. I cannot think of one positive thing to say except that the store manager was excellent. I just can't understand why he stays with this company."
bad,"When employed with Family Dollar I learned that there was very littlee professionalism practiced throughout the employees.  Alot of foul language was used in front of customers in conversations within employees freely.  Foul names were being hollered at shoplifters by employees as shoplifters exited the store.  Jokes and giggles were an everyday, all day thing and not too much was taken seriously.  Immaturity was indeed a problem.  Perhaps the age of the higher management was what was bringing this type of behavior in the work place.  Vendors and managers were very flirtatious towards each other making inappropriate remarks from time to time."
bad,"I would unload trucks, check in merchandise, place stock in appropriate location of the store, and provide customer service to customers, cashier, prepare store for closing."
bad,The company could use some team building classes so that there is a stronger work force people are coming to work just to work and not to service the public
bad,"You will have NO LIFE AT ALL... If you have a spouse, kids, school, anything outside you won't have time for. If you are a STORE MANAGER. Lack of training and NO COMMUNICATION."
bad,"Very dangerous locations. Lack of leadership or support. Very unorganized. Just merged with dollar tree and family dollar brand is slowly going away. I see brand going away, shift in regional and district staff. Soon will be renamed dollar tree or some other name by dollar tree."
bad,Love the work... awful company...always getting robbed...no cares from upper management or corporate... Worst place ever...great customers from the surrounding area an hard workers mostly came through my store
bad,Working here was the worst experience. They would not hire anyone over part time and I would average 20 hours or less a week. I was paid 6.25 per hour. The work environment was awful and employees were not treated well. It was not worth the gas I spent to drive the 5 miles to work and back. It is no surprise this store went out of business.
bad,"The store manager had favorites and even though they were not qualified they got promoted, all the good hours, the most hours and even raises. The none favorites did not receive these benefits but were required to do all the work. When I reported my injury the manager never took a report until the next day when I took the doctors note to her. I did report the injury when it happened and was told I had to finish my shift of be fired."
bad,the most stressful work environment ever. this company treats their employees horrible almost like slaves. They overwork their employees. Most family dollars are not safe to work in.
bad,jut not the best place to work unless you just need a job or somewhere to start. Not enough to pay any type of bills let alone take care of my son or myself. I would have loved to stay because the work environment was nice. I knew mot of the people working there but because of the pay and not knowing how much money I would be bringing in I had no choice but to find something different.
bad,Family Dollar is fast pace with limited breaks. unheated an no A/C. When mistakes are made you lose money. If unable to keep up you are let go before. The physical demands on the body are hard.
bad,Terrible customers and terrible bosses noi days off and extremely stressful  Rude customers and even ruder staff a lot off robbery and theft not a safe working environment
bad,Bad company  they do not care about there stores employees or customers mold old food selling broken and expired product I don’t know how this company hasn’t gone under yet
bad,"This place would be a good job for high school graduates, but not for anyone trying to make a living, there were not enough hours for regular employees"
bad,"Family Dollar is not a company to work for if you are a mature person that prefers a professional, structured and clean working environment. Store managers in my experience can be very unprofessional at times and will issue work and schedules based on their emotions. A typical day is going to work at your scheduled time or being called in on your days off to work because the same people call out over and over again. The work was not hard. However, some managers could make it difficult and uncomfortable for various reasons of their own even with reliable and hardworking professional employees. There is a lot of favoritism and unfairness distributed among coworkers. Not a good place to work unless you end up at a store where the manager actually cares and has a little compassion."
bad,Absolutly the worst job i ever had....Very unprofessional.....very rude....even the store managers are extremely rude...poor leadership..... i was able to add some knowledge to the skills i have already which is always a plus no matter how little u may learn . You can always apply it somewhere. I took my knowledge and moved on to assistant manager of Dollar General and they treat the employees very well. They are very professional and care about there customers where Family Dollar does not.
bad,"Frankly, this place is a living hellhole. Management is criminally incompetent, the work hours are brutal, calling the ""training"" half-assed would be generous, the pay is garbage, the work culture is awful, the equipment is all broken, and the employees are either lazy or incompetent. Off the top of my head, I can think of three practices which *I have been told* are illegal, though I have not verified this myself. The culture is one of mismanagement, favoritism, and incompetence. Some employees show up late literally every day, blatantly steal from the company, and fake injuries without getting fired, while others can get sacked for the slightest infraction. I've known of employees who actually *get high* while at work, with no repercussions, and another who was fired for failing to show up to work the day after he was *very* badly injured when he got hit by a truck. Anybody who makes the mistake of learning more than one position, will be made to regret it. Employees who try to do well must make up for the ones who simply play on their phones, and management doesn't even scold the ones who simply play on their phones. A coworker did the math, and claims that our total compensation- including benefits, pay, and vacation time, is less than 80% of the industry average."
bad,"Job is great, if you're a hard worker they will gladly lie to you and string you along with promises of promotions and raises that never happen. 2.5+ years of being an assistant at the top of the promotion chain to become a manager, and I watched more than half the stores in my district replace managers with outside applicants."
bad,Pray before you accept ANY position with Family Dollar. They DO NOT care about your safety. Google Family Dollar on YouTube from the show Undercover Boss.
bad,This Corporation should be sued for unsafe work environment for employees. They put up the store locations in rural areas and leave their management opening stores alone from 9:00am to about noon. Unbelievable its like they are staging the atmosphere for harm to occur.
bad,"family dollar is the worst company that I have worked for. The DM at the time had no structure for the store,did not help with any ideas and I worked by myself all day long until 5pm when the next mgr came in"
bad,was not fun to work there employees do as they please and do not do as they are told by management at all higher ups want more out of the people then they know how to do
bad,Was a very unpleasant experience. No help. Would not hire other employees when asked. The General Manager knee of problems we were having and didn’t care. I worked 6-8 alone with no break.
bad,Family Dollar will hire anybody and the managers will not care if your coworkers harass you. The pay is decent. The hours were never consistent and I was constantly schedule for times I had marked unavailable.
bad,All I can say if Family Dollar is the worse place I have ever worked and I would never recommend anyone to work for them. They tell you they won't work you every weekend and they lied about that the manager that does the schedules scheduled everyone to work every weekend and nights except herself
bad,Everything needs change. There is no room for advancement. Continuously money is missing. However I love my co workers and the customers. I believe there would be a better outcome if customers weren't treated as thieves during their shopping experience.
bad,"I worked really hard in there enjoyed the customers. The management sucked in the particular store I was in, Seems to be to much gossip and not enough working, They don't seem to value the people who actually do have good customer service and work hard."
bad,"Assisting customer, making weekly schedules, weekly cycle counts,"
bad,"Good management, but nonexistent payroll for productivity. manager worked 70+ hours every week just to keep store maintained. associates wanted hours but there were not many hours available due to a bonedry payroll..."
bad,I don't think this company encourages growth and allows it's workers to remain stagnant. The pay doesn't match the long list of duties expected of you. Its not worth working there.
bad,Horrible company horrible management customers are bums nd steal they try and fight you cause they got caught stealing hours are horrible and pay is trash
bad,upper management really don't have a clue how to treat people. the district manager has a bad attitude and should not be dealing with people. they are not good people
bad,It is not a well established business where you are able to thrive and achieve success at. The requirements are too little for the request that they are asking for the jobs
bad,Corporate in upper management is horrible store management and associates get paid very poorly no organization customers are very rude is just a very messy work atmosphere.Employees do not receive a discount employees are not appreciated by corporate managers or so worked 52 hours pay salary after that it’s always free laborAlso stockers in and cashiers are underpaid
bad,"Over worked and under paid. No hours, but will work you if you ask for specific days off for something. I missed my family's vacation and my nephew's brain surgery.  I always had to work holiday's.  Don't try to say anything to HR or to the hotline. It will get turned around to make you look bad. I finished my 2 week notice and found out later that I was put in as not rehired able. Why? I don't know. no one will talk to me. Very high turn over rate."
bad,"it was a good place to work because I liked helping people and meeting different people everyday, very face pace, hard work with unloading the delivery trucks and unloading pallets. all the employees were close and worked well together, but the robberies and break ins were to much to deal with."
bad,I worked here for over 3 years as an assistant manager and it is a nightmare. Don't work for family dollar unless your looking for stressful part time job.
bad,"Management is terrible, mangers were constantly changing and assistant managers did not care about the store and took many breaks, manager and assistant manager were not supposed to have breaks but took more than cashiers. Assistant managers had terrible time management. assistant managers had and talked to friends entire time they ""worked"" even with strict policy that you can only have friends at work for 5 minutes."
bad,I can not give my opinion or review it is not appropriate I was assistant manager but was over lorded by several other managers from different stores. The store was very disorganized and drama was a number one reason for not wanting to work there.Plus health was key factor
bad,"I was told by the manager that I would be given certain days off to turn my work in for college.  When it came time for me to register for school, he said he never told me that.  He refused to give me the days he had promised, therefore causing me to have to quit my job there so I could attend school.  I wouldn't recommend working there if you have plans to attend college.  They are not supportive, no matter how much they claim to be.  They are literally all about the store, that's it!!"
bad,Working at family dollar has been nothing but stressful. From the constant shifting of management to the unreliable team members and also i am still missing pay that was owed to me.
bad,"while i was working for Family Dollar it was great at first until the original manger came back and he is very unprofessional in the work place, he would disrespect you in front of other coworker basically nitpicking on people he thought was a weakling."
bad,working at family dollar was not a good experience for me I was extremely underpaid and the managers didn't seem to care about the employees at all. most of the time we only got 30-35 hours a week and were promised opportunities for 40.
bad,"I Feel sorry for Family Dollar employees and the Warner Truck Drivers that delivers their products. Employees are asked to do so much for such little pay. Locations are usually terrible, that’s why I feel for the truck drivers.."
bad,"The manager had her employees doing her job while she stole time from the company, I told the GM about this and they did nothing and as far as I know she is still working for the company."
bad,I loved doing all aspects of the cashier position. The hours however were inconsistent and difficult o do. Management was poor. I loved working there as close to home and loved working with the public. I also enjoyhed dpoing all other tasks they needed.
bad,"it was a horrible experience, met a lot of people even though the job is horrible. its a place you can go if you need something solid to just have a check coming in."
bad,"Great manager, but working for the company isn't a great choice! ASMs in the store for long periods of time because cashier isn't scheduled to come in 630 or 730 pm!  Work 8 to 10 hours  without Breaks & that's against the law! The Dm is not friendly at all!  He wanted so much done when but the ASMs is in the store alone majority of the time."
bad,"a lot of work, not very personal, "
bad,"Restocking shelves, cash/credit transactions, fast paced, customer service work, and pricing shelf items. Demographically diverse, so everyone is comfortable in the work place."
bad,"this job has poor management. the manager has a smart mouth and does not care about other people needs, nor does he want you to take breaks at all. I wouldn't work there never again."
bad,"I prefer being a telemarketer over working for family dollar. THAT says something. Your boss and co-workers change weekly. Everyone either quits or gets fired weekly."
bad,Everyday was something else . Things changed on a daily basis you never ne what to expect. Had to watch yourself cause manager is alwaya looking for a way to get rid of you if she didnt like you.
bad,"This particular job should no longer be listed on Indeed as the Aurora, NE store has been closed for years. "
bad,"At first I loved it, than after 5 weeks and countless hours I didn't get a paycheck and got told I was petty for being upset about it. Than the manager had a part in hour tampering, I was missing 25 hours off my paycheck. The manager refused to give me the DMs number they both said negative remarks about me."
bad,"pack out"
bad,"I don't remember much about this job, besides it had its ups and downs just as any job does. Certain locations was better to work in than others. But, I was grateful for the job."
bad,I loved working with customers but the management was bad. I did not get enough hours to live on and take care of my family. I do not recommend this company
bad,Hostile people and environment. Always crowded. Short lunches.There was a lot of disorganization. This was not the best position for me. Customers destroyed the store on several occasions making unnecessary work for employees...
bad,This company overworks its employees and does not give sufficient support for store level management.  Store managers are required to work 52 hours under poor conditions that sometimes risk their safety and well being.
bad,Within the first 2 weeks of starting the manager went on leave. Within the first month we had a remodel. Meanwhile i was improperly trained and had to get retrained. The Manager and one Assistant manger quit. We were left with only 2 people. Corporate didn’t help us one bit.
bad,I was the store manager and my distric manager was a jerk he would come in and verbally harasse you I worked 80+ hours a week and only got paid for 52 and went two and a half months with no days off and he did not care
bad,It was really a stressful place to work. The hours are sometimes ridiculous.
bad,The company cant run there stores at all. They want the store ran with one or two people at a time. They don't care if you have to work open to close 7 days a week.
bad,"I am a very hard worker and comitted to my job, however this store manager, is not very professional. I was offered an assistant store manager position for another store, and my current manager does not want me to leave. He has started cutting my hours, and treatened to fire me if I continue to pursue management opportunities."
bad,"Part time associates are worked 9 or 10 hour shifts while salaried management works 7-8 hour shifts. This saves money on labor for the company. Associates work non-stop in store juggling customers and stock. Bonuses are promised for monthly ""push inventory"" but although the associates actually do the selling, only management receives the bonuses. But they don't tell anyone. Long hard hours for very little money and termination for not pushing items."
bad,They where just heartless to my injuries and rude about it. Still to this day I have pains that put me in the bed. Not the place for me but it might work for others.
bad,"Worst place ever to work in my life.  They over order on the shipments. No good hours, paid time off , sick time off. Its just not a place you would want to work. Maybe in high school"
bad,"As far as being a csr, it is not bad, but if you are a manager or promoted to be one , then it is bad, they try to frame you for everything in that company. When I was a asm, I seen more of my bosses stealing than the workers"
bad,It was a horrible job the managers never did their job they always left it to the cashier's the store was never cleaned and inventory was never done correctly or put out they left all responsibilities to the cashier every manager I worked with only smoke cigarettes outside the store and set in the office they never actually help with any of the work
bad,"First working for this company, it started out great, but then management change and so did the direction or the store, I worked 15 hours days for weeks on end no help no concern from upper management"
bad,"Not a good company since dollar tree bought them ouy,managers and district mgrs are rude anf you can't  get through to coropate office and no one returns phone calls"
bad,In my experience at Family Dollar people were basically used until they were no good anymore. They didn't have any regard for your life outside of the company. They also paid no more than minimum wage and had very little room for advancement. It isn't a place I would recommend anyone to work for any extended period of time.
bad,"This place is terrible from A- Z . The Management sucks.  The hours and pay sucks. "
bad,They want what they can get out of you and then throw you to the waste side. They remind everyone that there expendable. When you go above and be on the call of duty and step up to the plate they never reconzie it there quick to tell you what you have done wrong never praise you for the good.its a very cut throat dramatic company. I would actually lover to speak to the CEO and tell him what goes on in his company
bad,The first day I started I’ve saw one of my friends work there and she told me it’s always something with family dollar. I didn’t believe her until I learned it for myself. We’re always out of grocery bags so we HAVE to hand out trash bags. The manager is never hardly working or really cares about the stores. The pay is not worth working. You don’t even get an employee discount.
bad,family dollar is a horrible company to work for they do not follow rules management sucks i was only getting 8 hours a week how can somebody live off of that
bad,The management at Yellowstone and Scott are terrible. I was working as Assistant Manager and I wasn't even trained. If you make mistakes they would get on you about it and say it's your fault. They expected me to ask questions if I didn't know something when I wasn't  taught it. Right now I'm still trying to get the money I was owe from my first check. They only gave me half of it I had to wait 4 weeks to get that. Now I have to wait another 4 weeks to get the other half. I didn't quit I got fired because I had a bad back. The Manager didn't even let me go to the doctor to check my back. My back is doing good now since I fixed it now I feel I was wrongfully fired.
bad,i was injured at work and had to work for 2 days before I called in and refused to come back until I seen a doctor. The new manager is very rude. Other than that I loved my job there and my co-workers
bad,"the company is bad to work for they have a high turn over fate because of low pay and benefits, upper management changes are rapid and with no help the employees are alone and have tight goals."
bad,"They work you extra hard and they never want to give you a raise after being there a year and 4 months.. Being an assistant manager they don't care about there employees. You work all holidays. The bathrooms was always out of order. Nobody to fix them. Don't work at Family Dollar in Camilla, Ga"
bad,"Working at family dollar was a good experience..laurie the manager at the time was so helpful and friendly..i learned a lot from her."
bad,"I went from 30+ hours a week to only 15, I can't help feed my parents and brother with this low wage. It gets really boring but oh no, you can't stand behind your register because if you aren't doing literally anything besides that, your district manager yells at you."
bad,Family dollar started off as a cool job but later on down the line payroll was being cut and hours was being token away now they just cutting people days now
bad,Managers take advantage of the hourly employees.  They hire too many people and then are only able to give you 10 hours a week.  Worst place ever to work.
bad,"They start you at lowest pay possible and over work you, Asking for extra things without a raise. Horibble place to work. More physicsl than pay rate."
bad,"worst place i ever work at! the managing is the worst they only care about them self and the store if you get hurt on the job they will tell you , you still have to work!"
bad,It was a horrible place to work for.  I never missed a day my first year but in my second year I had to do some dental work and missed a few days and they took away some of my vacation days.  They had an odd way of calculating vaction days.  I will never work for a company that does that.
bad,"The job it's self is pretty easy,  the management is what is the problem along with the other worker's not doing their job . I like my job I love working with the public but I need something that is fair"
bad,"Policies are corrupt and need review, more hands on corporate action needed, hours need to be highly addressed and so does fair pay. They expect a beautiful store and the entire store to be set and properly taken care of with one person working the whole floor and the register with no other employee until mid afternoon, which gives you a line to the back door and everyone highly unsatisfied. Stressful work place"
bad,I’m a great team sports people person and love to meet new people I pretty didn’t learn anything from the company I misty taught my self but I catch on fast if you show me once I have it for the rest of the time I’m working with the company
bad,It was my worst work place ever. The store was in a bad area of town and it was unsafe. We were short-handed at night with just females working alone after being robbed.
bad,always trying to figure out who was going to cover shifts
bad,"They tell you something is going to happen like a raise or vacation and it dose not, not enough hours always being treated bad. Working without days off. Then if everything is not what they want you get treated badly and ur job taken. Its not worth it run"
bad,Great if you are just starting out from high school or during. Would not stay stressful workplace will too many indecisive people in management. Great for someone in high school or just graduated.
bad,This is a get back on your feet kind of job. I don't recommend this job for anyone except someone desperate for funds. My manager was very nice but tough job none the less.
bad,they are bias work the  good workers hard and let their favorites do what they want. management pushes you hard while they slide thru the day.they do let you know the only way to make decent money is to become management or should i say store manager.
bad,"My typical work day was a 12hour shift containing  unloading the truck  dealing with the vendors and run a cash register, I have learned about these Dollar companies that underpay all  there employees ,My DM was a great person the hardest part of my job was being by myself most of the day"
bad,"You can never do enough for the store they want you  to work alone cut labor at any cost not a good place to work at "
bad,"I would never work for the same person I did the store manager work and was under paid. I did more than the store manager and work wasn't even recognized,."
bad,I have never worked for a company that has a manager that talks to their employees & even customers like they're trash. I would not recommend anyone!!
bad,The pace was great for me the only thing I would change is the fact that after you stock I believe you should be able to go home after unloading the truck
bad,"Family Dollar doesn't care about employees or any personal situation they're having. we're forced to sell Reese's cups to meet a quota for the DM to get a bonus... if quota is not met, a write up is issued and termination is done after 3 write ups. people have been fired for mere MINUTES of overtime. There is always only 2 employees in the store at a time and managers often run the store alone for hours at a time."
bad,Store manager mishandled day-to-day operation. She would put her manager role on to other team members an when she got in trouble with corrupt she would fire a team member for speeking up
bad,i was told i would have 40 hours a week and checked the scheduel after 3 weeks of being hired and i had two days a week because i was just a cashier and couldnt be guaranteed  40 hours a week
bad,"Managment is not consistant, and not enough help for the work load per day, staff is very poor, and most of the time you are working alone. Trainig is very poor to none."
bad,"Very little staff, no upper management support.  Store managers do everything including unloading trucks, stocking, scheduling, deposits, etc.  Employee call ins can cripple a store.  Many days I was alone in the store with no support from district manager.   Stress level very high with no time for family life."
bad,I would never recommend someone working for this company they don't care about the people in they're stores only about how much money they can make your safety means nothing etc...
bad,Family Dollars is a place where everyone worked when they wanna work there wasn't enough people to work to on either shift the lack of poor management was poor team members was harley around when you need them the mangers was always sitting in the office or on the phone talking or standing outside.
bad,When I started it was wonderful but as the time passed the workers drifted apart and there was no communication everybody had an attitude there was communication about scheduling
bad,"family dollar does not care about their employees. it's all about their profit. they work you to death for pennies. it's a first job for kids, not for anyone to actually earn a living. store manager are ebt card holders. so sad."
bad,"If you're not friends/related to the manager or know the big boss you wont be promoted. Cashier do a lot of work while managers do nothing. (Only at some locations) The pay is horrible for the cashier, again unless you know someone. The hours are all over the place and the managers and employees are not properly trained. I had to teach myself most of everything when I worked there."
bad,The culture is completely the same. The store Managers generally have to run the store all day by themselves because of the payroll guidelines. The possibility of helping customers and insuring inventory controls in a million dollar + store with 108 payroll hourly hours is nearly impossible. Just was not for me anymore. I love retail and helping people but how can you assist customers when being on the register in the store by yourself all day?
bad,My manager would sit in the back and watch the cameras all day while taking a smoke break every 30 minutes to a hour And I had to do all of the work mainly by myself because I rarely had another worker with me outside of my manager
bad,"Everything about working here is ****. 99% of the customers are apes who walk in expecting you to bend over backwards to help them spend U.S. tax payer dollars for them through their food stamps and other such idiocy-ridden government assistance programs that plague this society. The management gets triggered for no apparent reason when you follow incoherent or non-existent instructions that they will later contradict and command you to contradict yourself. The computers used for training are not half as advanced as my $14 smartphone. The higher ups are either unwilling or unable to provide cashiers with a reasonable amount of change, and the all knowing customers are going to take it out on you. All of this in the middle of downtown rockford, the worst location in the worst city in the worst state in this entire country."
bad,"Love the job but there no respect from higher roles. District Manager, PM. Have no help no training provided the right way. Had to work overtime but not getting paid for and there's no one to help with that problem."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work here. The district manager had little to no training or experience. No support no payroll to run a store.If a person did not show up for work a manager would end up working alone up to 12 hours alone in a dangerous neighborhood.
bad,"Being that this job was nearly two decades ago, I was young and the job was not as bad as I interpreted it to be. I was also trying to finish LVN school, raise three children, and maintain a full time job doing what the management was expected to do."
bad,Corporate needs to come to all the stores and interact with ALL managers. They need to pay more and take care of the people that make them money. Get out of your office and come unload a 900 box truck with your  team
bad,"Worst company i have ever worked for. They take you for granted, never give you raises and always leave you by yourself. The manger is never in store always at other stores and you always get yelled about not doing enough."
bad,Working at Family Dollar was a bad experience they always wanted you to work overtime but never want to pay you for working overtime and if you went over 40 hours a week they would fix your hours in the system to make sure you only get paid for 40 hours a week.
bad,"the job was great ,not hard at all.stayed busy met different people all the time.location was close to home walking distance for me I loved that the most"
bad,Working here wasn't my best experience. Regret coming back to company. Had many incidents where we were working in horrible conditions. They had a high turn over rate for all positions.
bad,Overall this is a terrible place to work they will over work you.  If you are short staffed they still expect you to get the same stuff you got done before you were short staffed in the same amount of hours you are absolutely not allowed to go into overtime if you are about to they will force the Manager to work it instead of letting you work.  They work the Managers like they are dogs. Over all just a terrible place to work.
bad,"One of the most messed up run retailer's I've worked for in Roanoke. "
bad,Terrible company would never work their again and I worked there for 3 years. Pay is not good Management is all about favoritism. Terrible terrible terrible horrible any bad would that could be said.
bad,"I would never recommend working for Family Dollar or any of their related businesses- Dollar General, Dollar Tree, etc. The store was ALWAYS filthy, NO ONE cleaned, all the employees ever did was stay on their phone."
bad,"Asking a transfer it's hard to get, cus6 threaten me to kill me I live I. The area I feel uncomfortable working here boss wants you to work hard but won't give a rise.cashier comes in and has more pay then I do ,I been there longer and I show up to work and also do my job I'm close to quitting but I really need a job."
bad,I started off liking the job as I continue working there it became something I dislike the most the people are rude for no reason and they run out with a large sum of merchandise m.
bad,the place needs to improve it's approach to it's employees. was treated like garbage and left without a sense of accomplishment. have already moved on to bigger and better things.
bad,Management is a joke. Employees are not any better. When I go into mont belvieiu one employee is outside smoking leaving the store empty. Employee cars are double parked so parking is a joke. That store needs new people.
bad,"Family Dollar, Dollar General, and Dollar tree are all the same and run the same way. You are always alone and not any staff, the pay is horrible. There is never any home time."
bad,If you want to be treated like you don’t matter this is the place for you as an assistant store manager they offer you 9 dollars an hour and expect you to put your life on hold god forbid if you have children or a spouse who has medical issues
bad,Worst place I’ve ever worked Because the management is very disrespectful they don’t treat their employees is equals lack of crew management sucks environment nasty everything was just horrible about that place nothing was organized they never had anything together you were basically on your own
bad,The store manager will sexually harass you. They will fire you even if your in a life or death situation. He has a tendency to favor certain team members. Dont Call off even if your in the hospital because he will fire you even if you get okay'ed to bring in a doctors note.
bad,this wasnt a very good job to work at. the manager wasnt very cooperative with the other workers. always played around and didnt do the work when it needed to be done.
bad,"This is the worst company to work for, they do not care anything about their employees or there well being. The main concern is the running of the business, and not the people helping run the business"
bad,"Manager willing to work with school schedule.  It is a good place for students who don't have bills because most of the time you work part time.  Easy to acquired responsibilities, but hard to get a wage increase."
bad,"employees and customers are treated as if everyone who works or shops there is a thief."
bad,This was the worse company i every work for. The insurance was too too high. Managements sucks! My boss hired his friends so i work mostly closing shift. Never know your schedule in advance! Don't waste your time!!!!
bad,the managers were very unprofessional. every day there was a new co-worker being picked on or talked about to other employees. managers did a poor job at assisting lower level reps.
bad,"horrible all around! go to any other retailer for work, or for food! we were overworked and underpaid and sold expired food daily! we never got any training, and were reprimanded about things that we never even knew existed!"
bad,"really didn't enjoy the location i was sent to, but didn't mind my job really liked it as a cashier at my old location. it all depends on where you work in this company"
bad,"I recommend no one to work here."
bad,"I am in upper management, and have been in middle management as well with this company. In my current position, I am mandated to work 6 days and MINIMUM of 52 hours a week. I there is not enough staff to run the store, I am required to do the work of the other staff, even if it means working 80 hours a week with no additional monetary compensation as I am set at salary. The stores are not allotted enough scheduling hours to schedule the appropriate amount of staff needed to profitably run the stores without undue stress on the store manager, assistant managers and support staff. If the sales numbers are not met, less hours for payroll are given. Less payroll hours means less work gets done and less merchandise makes it to the sales floor to increase the sales.  This is indicative of the majority of the Family Dollar Stores, not just the one I am currently at.  There is so much more wrong with the company, however, I will just state that this is the most unethical company that I have ever worked for."
bad,"helping each customer with clothing items, or house whole products, properly ringing up customer items and giving exact change, doing inventory, balancing books."
bad,The management has difficulty communicating with one another. Unless you are a store manager you don't receive pay equivalent to what you have to deal with on a day to day business. The location that I worked at simply had poor communication skills and treated anyone lower than store manager poorly.
bad,The managers are very unprofessional the workplace is very unsanitary not much benefits you almost never get the proper Breaktime deserved the scheduling is never consistent there isn't any security the environment is not safe.
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend his job to anyone "
bad,"I wouldn't have anyone work here, you work 80-90 hours a week traveling to store and fixing your own with no pay raises. you have to basically kill yourself to run your store. store manager was no help always gone."
bad,"The pay was higher than expected; however, the management was very poor and unprofessional. Hopefully, other stores don't have the same problems. I would have stayed with the job if not for the terrible hours and managers. They did not give me any breaks--no lunch breaks or 15-minute breaks."
bad,The manager I worked was extremely verbally abusive and wouldn't take responsibility for his actions.  it did prove to be a stressful work environment
bad,"Poor work environment, over worked, under paid. worked in a store infested with mice, customers were always rude and theft was high. District manager blamed theft on employees, laid off entire store for this."
bad,"I would never recommend anyone work for this company.  They treat their employees like dirt.  Many times I would be the only one in the store and then they wondered why theft was so high.  The assistant managers start at 9.25 per hour which is ridiculous.  I've been told the managers start at about $45,000 per year but they have to put in a minimum of 52 hours per week.  Many of them worked 70 hours per week, so the pay doesn't pan out.  I don't know how this company stays in business.  The aisles are always cluttered and most of the stores I've been in are dirty."
bad,"I would not recommend working here. Although it has been over 6 years since I worked there, things may have changed. I worked at a bad location with lots of theft. And after promoting me to assistant store manager, I only got a dollar raise (a dollar more than the cashiers)."
bad,I dont really like it as much as I thought it needs way more help Nd needs better training there is a lot of down falls in this company makes it not worth ih
bad,"Applied pricing expertise to define and recommend mark-up rates, mark-down rates and implemented"
bad,Family Dollar is a horrible company to work for. You will be set up to fail and left to your own devices to run your store. Management/Leadership will be very reactive to your needs and requests.
bad,to overall rate from 1 - 20 i would say a 3. i fell they should have a more orginized shift role for indivisual employies each shift position. ifeel family dallor should hire more peple and that the most prcentage of their location  emplyie are rude
bad,When I worked there it was like I could not get the training that I needed to be successful. I felt like I was doing everyone else's job. I left because I got my job back at the call center service center solutions.
bad,"this company is horrible. district managers are out of touch. pay is horrendous. customers are trashy and rude. truck weekly with no payroll to complete on time, and no hours for anyone. work store manager like slaves."
bad,"The company is a money maker, but they have no respect for the employees who are running the front line working the stock. There are never enough employees, They offer no discounts for employees, no incentives at all."
bad,I worked long hours and it was not fun the culture should be changed . There should be more opportunities available for employees as well as shoppers . More employees should be on the floor .
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job is my customers. They keep a smile on my face. It has taught me how to manage things and how to give projects to other employees.
bad,"This job at Family Dollar had very poor management, I learned nothing from the job and never enjoyed where I worked. The store manager would hire all of her family members and give them better opportunities."
bad,"FD was bought out by Dollar Tree and since then the management (especially in the call center or SPOC as you may know it) has been on a mission to take out anyone who even suggests anything that may make sense and challenges their authority. If you don't kiss rear, you are out of here is their policy. Tech support is garbage because the managers don't know the equipment and are so ignorant they can't comprehend what the tech savvy people are telling them. The ship is sinking...get out while you still can!"
bad,"I would never work there again. I wouldn't recommend anyone working there. The district manager expects everything to be done, and if it isn't, the manager is staying late. You have to unload the truck by hand. It's a good work out, but tiring."
bad,hardest part of the job is working that hard with no better outcomes. heavy lifting is included its a lot of wear and tear on your body if you cant handle hard work this is not the job for you.
bad,"I was excited to work for family dollar bit for everything that is required to be done is not worth the pay we where expected to finish all jobs even if off the clock, never allowed to take break or lunches"
bad,Don't waste your time here. This company has so many flaws and wrongs. NEVER got any breaks when working any hour shifts. Store is never properly cleaned. Managers expected too much done in not a lot of time. Never got a pay raise even though was promised. Couldn't even use restroom because I was only one with a register open. Assistant managers did nothing but sit in office and watch you through security cameras. Assistant managers where also lazy and did little to nothing to help out. Employees who where not managers barely got hours.
bad,Terrible stressful company to work for. Upper management has unreal expectations. They pile on to much work and provide no hours for you to hire people to help get the job done.
bad,The customers were so rude. They always smelled so bad. I never got my five minute breaks. I was blamed for things I didn't do. You're timed on registers so if you don't move fast enough it shows up and you're reprimanded for it. I was reprimanded by the manager constantly for not having a nametag but she wouldn't show me how to get one. The shift managers were horrible. One constantly complained to customers.
bad,"this place is a bad place to work no overtime, no advancement no pay raises worked the for over a year and think I got a whole 5 cent raise don't work here"
bad,the worst job
bad,The worst company to work for. From HR to DMs the worst to communicate with. To many hours to work and no compensation for the overtime thats being worked.
bad,"Worst company to work for period"
bad,I would recommend working at family dollar. They feel like there employee's have no value a person's well being is not something they even pay attention too.
bad,Family dollar had no idea about hiring. They would hire family members and there would be a lot of playing around and not working. I voiced my opinion about this and the store manager and myself did not get along because of this.
bad,"Store was fine but the employees were backstabbing and cut throat. Hours were good except no overtime, I filled in in different stores and they paid me for travel and paid my hotel."
bad,"When first moved here, a gunman came into the store held gun in my face for money, I couldn't open the register, so I got tranfer to a worst part of the state, people come in and they go out without paying for the item, so very unsafe environment."
bad,Family Dollar is the worst place of employment. Management Is very  poor. The company don't following they on policy. They work the employees like slaves. I will not recommend this company to my own enemy.
bad,"Don't work retail, it sill suck the life out of you. You will not have a good time working for family dollar. Over work under pay, is the family dollar way."
bad,worst job i have ever worked. the company seems to only care about the bottom line and doesnt give many tools to accomplish the tasks. would never work there again
bad,"Typical day I would have to stock the store, put away truck, complete the deposit, and manage employees. We were always under staffed and our manager sometimes didn’t show up."
bad,"The store manager was very unprofessional. She would often yell at customers, use curse words when yelling at employees or customers, and didn't like to give the state required breaks."
bad,I love family dollars but there store manager didnt follow store procedure.i was always under staff the money handle was not properly counted  the store manager was very unprofessional and was steali ng company time. I was under pay and under staff. And store policies or not being followed.
bad,"Corporate does not care for their employees, a lot of stores go without a/c in the summer time for months. They hire incompetents managers and throw you in the role with little to no training. Promise promotions but never give them to you. No benefits. No overtime. Hours are constantly inconsistent."
bad,The company is on a decline and most stores will be closed in 5 years   Not worth it the district manager for the huntsville area will not advise you on anything.
bad,it was my first real job as an adult. in the beginning it was okay but as time passed it was horrible. for a first job I guess it wasn't so bad but I would never go back
bad,management as well as district management are biased towards certain employees when it comes to progressing in the business. what i mean by that is basically they will fire you as soon as you advance in the company
bad,Worked at family dollar for about 4 years..went through 6 managers and each one was awful! The district manager didnt do anthlthingnto help the store. Just a bad company all around
bad,Will never work in retail again. Too many hours and not enough money along with people quitimg all the time. Not dealing with that anymore. Done with retail.
bad,"When I worked there as a ast. manager, I was left to open the store and close it, then drug addits kept taking copper out the a/c unit. When my mom died and I was at the funeral my manager called me to come into work after the funeral and proceded to threaten me with my job if I didnt."
bad,"Family dollar is a very unprofessional place to work. Depending on the location the store constantly gets something stolen from them and they do not have enough hours, fulll time is 25 hours a week. NOT ENOUGH TO PAY BILLS FOR ANYONE WITH 9.00 A HOUR."
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work there, lack of customer service, rudeness, lack of training, poor management, no fixed schedules. Lack of integrity"
bad,family dollar is a horrible horrible place to work they mangers were horrible the worst experience ever I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody at all
bad,I  wasn't comfortable working there. There was alot of unnecessary drama from head management.  I was used to come in for manger to leave for few hours. It wasn't a professional work place at all. Definitely my worse job ever.
bad,the company was going thru a merger with dollar tree if you look up dollar tree it is one of the worst places to work. The district mangers don't care about the stores
bad,"Not a good place to work. Corp. team only cares about money and not the safety of the employees. Poor management, Poor HR team that will not investigate reverse racism claims. If your not with the ""in Crowed"" and if your not a ""yes"" person that you won't have any success"
bad,Family Dollar is just like any small box retail store there are always payroll verses personnel issues but at Family Dollar they take it to the extreme.  When after you have scheduled the Manager (52 hours) and both your Assistant Managers (35 hours each so 70 hours) you now have 30 hours to make sure you have cashier coverage every night and get all your freight out within 28 hours.  They don't train any of the staff to do the job and then its on the Manager to pick up all the slack.  When you are working 72 hour weeks not including 12 hours of drive time each week it gets old quick when your working for pennies
bad,The worst company to work for you will never go into this store and see the same people after three months they have no loyalty to employees or customers
bad,Never would even want my worst enemies to work at a place like that...... They need a whole new system of how to treat the employees. So regret working there
bad,"I worked for family dollar for 2 weeks and they got robbed at gun point with me in it... the manager acted quick and no one was hurt. The company was only concerned with how much money was token.... didn't offer support for the employees that were involved, didn't check up on the employees and still do not have any type of security for that store. By the way that was the second time in a month that that particular store had gotten robbed. Horrible place to work!!!"
bad,"It doesn't exist. Stores are filthy and not maintained.  Not enough support from higher ups.  Met some awesome people, but not worth it at all.  No work life balance."
bad,The management is terrible. They offer you a position then change management and then they pretend they didn't know you were hired for that position and hire there friends. they also let there friend tell them how to make the schedule.
bad,"Don't really give a rats behind about their managers.No payroll.Constant turnover. By yourself for hours at your store. Unbelievable amount of theft from employees and customers. Guns and crime all over. Its a stressful environment. Don't know if you are going to leave at the end of the night and find your car gone or damaged. When you are alone, , which is often, people steal, piee on the floor because of not being allowed to use restroom, homeless and drugs all over. Homeless begging all the time. Addicts stealing vinegar...packages ripped open all over the store ...you have to tag practically every item in the store for theft...bottom line .....IT SUCKS"
bad,Family Dollar is very unorganized as a company and those who are in upper-level management positions did add to solutions only created more problems. Starting hourly wage is minimum wage so unless it is your last resort I would not work for this company.
bad,"I guess I cant tell the truth of how horrible this place is. It is considered bad language. If your looking for beginners work you would be better off any where but here, trust me."
bad,"The new store manager at Little rock rd Charlotte NC family dollar made assistant managers and crew do all the work while he was never at the store or he walked around ""encouraging"" employees to go faster on freight. We broke our back for no time off and minimum wage. Morning shifts were only given if convenient to store manager. Not to mention the Area manager covered his butt because they were coworkers and friends from way back."
bad,"poor management. most managers were young and thought they had it all. barely give any hours, call off once and end up giving you 4 hours a week. Store manager isn't straight up with you, but instead likes to gossip."
bad,I honestly hated working there. The manger was horrible and most of the assisting managers too. I have no clue how some of them got to that position. Some of co workers wouldn't do their work and depending on the manager that was there they would let them do whatever they wanted. Worst job I ever had.
bad,"It was a some what slow work place ,but there was always something to do which I liked because I like to stay busy it makes the work day go by faster , things like light cleaning stocking shelfs , removing items in that are no longer needed"
bad,Not a good job to many hours to work not enough time for family or sleep I will never refer this company to know one that has kids or planning on getting married
bad,"as a family dollar customer service representative in i help  out with loss prevention, stock in maintain a clean area at all times  help train new employee that comes to the store"
bad,there are no benefits no security very dangerous there is a lot of theft and no way of stopping it management does not receive vacation no bonus and no weekends off
bad,Store Supervisors get at least 50 hours every week but absolutely no other position in the store can garauntee you any amount of hours. Hours are given based on who is liked best by management and can change at any time without your consent or even your knowledge.
bad,Never worked at a job with so much confusion and drama. From the store manager to the assistant managers. The cashier had more professionalism than the managers. This is at store 6010 in Memphis TN. The cut your hours for no reason. Worst job EVER!
bad,Will work over at my job and will not be paid for it. even when i work 40hrs am not paid for it. Family dollar don't care about there empolyeer. but i love my job because of my family
bad,Not a good place to work for. The company does not  care about any of it's employees.  Sad. Definitely  not a career move. No way you can live off of this job.
bad,"hated every second i worked here, the DM i was under was very unprofessional and very disrespectful. the area i worked in was very high in theft. wasn't given the tools i needed to advance my career."
bad,"pretty stressful,the store it self wasn't in the best of neighborhoods."
bad,"family doesn't mean much in the title,not a fair place to work lots of favoritism no teamwork a lot of chiefs not enough Indians poor management to long of breaks"
bad,"couldve been better , there was alot of different problems with in the store itself and the comamy i must say. i didnt really enjoy my time that much while i was working there."
bad,The hours get cut every other week. The managers are rude and don't do their jobs. It is very unorganized and chaotic. Some weeks you get five hours the next you get twelve
bad,There was a lot of people steeling stuff out of the store and even if I would say something it was like well the others would look the ether way. The main manager went outside for a smoke brake and it would be almost  an hour an 1/2 - 2 hours before she would come back inside to work again.
bad,"staffing expectations and payroll not set up to be a place for people to work, many times the store manager was the only person in the store and could not take a restroom break"
bad,My manager expected way to much of me and the assistant manager i worked with was on her cell phone all the time and expected me to do everything and when i was on my cell i got the book thrown at me.
bad,"It was easy but there was no advancement. Not sure how management is now, but when i worked there she was lazy as can be. there is one girl there now and she is absolutely amazing."
bad,"this place was so chaotic to work for, manager flips all the time, district managers sucked, horrible pay no raises in a timely manner. no praise of good work done."
bad,It was a terrible experience. I worked literally by myself. There was one other person that always worked with me. Lines would be so long and nobody would ever back me up.
bad,"Family Dollar pays men managers way better than women. ""Manager"" basically means an employee who is getting paid a salary to work open until close and do everything in the store from paperwork, hiring, firing, bank deposits, schedules, unloading trucks, stocking shelves, mopping floors, cleaning the store, running the register. It was a waste of my life."
bad,"A few employees worked hard. All others were slackers, not fulfilling assigned duties, but receiving no reprimands. I was terminated for making too many mistakes on the cash register, but was not trained in as to what those mistakes were."
bad,"Very stressful. I want to say this is one of the worst ones out there. If you're new, they'll pick on the new person and make you do everything since management is never around."
bad,The job is to much work and very low pay. Only two people in the store at a time. Not enough time for the work load. Backroom over loaded with back stock and new items.
bad,"They make you throw heavy boxes all day. With no care to your health. Plenty of chances to get hurt. Stressed employees, stressed managers, just stress oozing from the very walls. It’s always, do more more MORE!!! I hated it. Got good pay compared to other jobs, but definitely not worth it."
bad,computer systems were so outdated and faulty that 90% of the issues were with restarts and shutdowns on all kiosks. Every shift I had included at least 1 technical fallback which made productivity impossible to uphold.
bad,"I would come count my register, greet customers, unload boxes and crates and stock merchandise on the shelves. Interact with customers and make transcactions."
bad,"short schedules no breaks over worked "
bad,Working for a company like Family Dollar you will have to remember that the hours are set in stone. They can and will cut them for no reason given. It wasn't terrible but i would never work there again
bad,"the specific location i worked was understaffed and the staff that were there are very rude and inconsiderate to customers. The manager did and allowed the staff to sit at the register with food, headphones, drinks and etc. while there were customers at the register"
bad,Awful management the store managers have no clue what they are doing and disrespectful as he'll to the point of quitting.disorganized too much freight not enough allotted hours to get the freight out
bad,"Morning schdule; open store and count drawer, get ready for customers. The store I was employed with was a very busy store. My manager was a really good manager to work with. The hardest part of this job was restocking the store and unloading the delivery truck. the one thing I like most about this job was the end of my shift. Closing was the worst part of this job. Not enough security.."
bad,Meeting new people and having a new experience in retail was appreciated. The job lack advancement but management was pleasant to work with. Thanks again
bad,"job is easy but no team work to keep the store running smoothly. some managers let the job go to their head and are disrespectful. and the hours don,t let me get the job don,t for the week."
bad,"We had a huge drama in the last month that I worked there. It was horrible. It ended with a change in management, who is a terrible manager. It is extremely unfortunate the way things ended up there. I have even heard bad things from people that are still regulars there voicing their disappointment since the change."
bad,"not a company i would care to work for again, they have their own clicks and treat people differently than others. My experience working for them was not great but I think it had to do with the managers."
bad,Overworked and under paid.  Mgmt say you will be paid a wage and then you are paid $1/hr less.  They always expected you to work ALL holidays and gave little to no benefits.  Run away!
bad,It was good nice place of business.. the things my store is put me through was not fair by far the hours were long form opening closing the store nd working All day and u closing
bad,very poor management very poor scheduling never gave promotions a lot of favoritism very horrible customer service location was very dangerous they didn't worry about the employees safety
bad,I was promised 50 plus hours as an assistant manager and got cut down to 9hours so I quit there and now I am looking for a fulltime job with a fast paced environment and productivity
bad,The manager was horrible always drunk at work always rude to all the customer was very lazy my raise was very unfair hours were unfair not a great place to wrk at all
bad,It's a bad job cause you don't get no break. There's no bathroom and it's stinks in there. The floor are never cleaned nor waxed. So all together it's just a terrible place to work the end.
bad,its a great company to work for. i was a key holder and loved what i did! things didn't work out due to the store manager i had at the time. he was sleeping with employees and taking money. i had to get out of there.
bad,"This was absolutely the worst job I've ever had. I took the job as something to hold me over until I got another, better paying job but I had to just go ahead and quit. I was an assistant manager and the store manager sucked. She had a horrible attitude. The last straw was when she called to curse me out. There is absolutely no excuse for this type of behavior. I was at 10956. Absolutely do not take this job unless it is a desperate need. The district manager isnt very professional either."
bad,it very busy there they don't give you enothen people to work there.i learned how a store is run on adaily basic.management had a hard job to do with the schedule.hardest part of the job would be trying to get freight out in time.most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
bad,Unreliable management. Very unprofessional. Lacking in customer service as well as employee moral. Over looks staff that are professional and has good customer service skills
bad,"Not a worth the minimum wage at all. Poor management and not enough surveillance. wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who is not in high school,,,,,"
bad,"just a horrible place. I was worked to death no breaks , as well as the only person working 18 hour days. the manager was like a cop, she made almost every customer feel like they were a shop lifter. I was embarrassed for a long time because of her unprofessional behavior. I would not recommend anyone work this this kind of pay for that kind of responsibility ."
bad,"cut throat industry"
bad,At the Mableton location the manangement was horrible. There were a lot of shoplifters in that area that consistently came into the store. My manager at the time fought one of the shoplifters while on the clock.
bad,"This was probably one of the worst experiences i have had throughout my working history. The lack of support and disregard for their employees was nothing short of heartbreaking. I was forced to work under low conditions and with a manager that got paid to do nothing because all responsibilities were dropped on the assistant managers and other employees. We tried to report this to the higher ups and nothing was ever done about it. Instead, I was personally told to do my job and deal with any and all conditions in the store."
bad,"The company makes it know the they don,t support or even care about their employees. If store store get robbed don't care about the employee at more concerned about how much, never once even cared. The District Manager treat the people badly that workes under her. Thank you"
bad,"A typical day at work was feeling over stressed and feeling like i did more work then anyone but got less hours and paid less then those other people.  "
bad,"i was hired at 16,00 only recieved 12,00"
bad,This company is a cut-throat place to work the are rude and inconsiderate.  They over work and under pay there supervisors.  They play favoritism. They gossip with customers.  Just an over all really bad experience.  You follow the chain of command and still nothing is done.
bad,"This place was horrible to work at, no overtime, no help had to work crazy hours. Upper management does not do a good job and have no understanding about employees"
bad,Awful manager. Never really had a schedule. Woild make schedule as she went. Always lied and said that you work certain days when she never did. So she would call and say you were late.
bad,"At first when I worked here it was fun very fast, always had somthing to do, the manager at that time was a team player always was on the floor with use, but once they let him go and the new manager came in that manager was nasty, was getting into your personal and family issues, and discussing it with others, did not help at all with anything in the store, just stayed on the phone and computer the whole time"
bad,"I would never want to go back to family dollar. I would b=never, ever recommend family dollar to no one else. They do not care about there employees at all. Nor do they care for there safety in any of there urban store locations,"
bad,"Family Dollar as a whole is a terrible company. They work you to death during the holidays, but the rest of the year it's impossible to get enough hours to make a living wage. Additionally, if the store gets robbed, which it did when I was working there, they will not give you time off to recover/reevaluate if you still want to work for them."
bad,"I have had many jobs in my life,"
bad,"If you are looking for a place to learn very basic Manager skills, this is a place to start at. Your wages will reflect their expectations and District Staff is usually unable or unwilling to assist with day to day tasks. Benefits are borderline horrible. You do get 2 weeks vacation as a Store Manager but have to work a minimum of 52 hours a week in six days for an average salary of 38k a year."
bad,"Job is not hard but one employee is expected to do the work of three people. The pay is okay but most employees are only part time employees with no chance to advance to full time employment no ,matter how hard you work."
bad,"I learned how to change scamatics, boost sales for the company and I was also a customer service represenitive for family dollar. Recieved awards for my tasks."
bad,"I did stocking delivery truck helped customers with there needs cleaned the store stock the shelfs  handle cash work the regester"
bad,"Family Dollar was enjoyable only because of the nice customers & the coworkers I had. Management was poor—particularly the store manager. He did many things to set people up to get fired & despite being reported, the managers over him did little to nothing. Family Dollar also doesn’t like to pay. The pay was the poorest I had ever had. Even assistant managers were paid poorly."
bad,"Family Dollar is not a good place to work. Upper management cares nothing about their employees, they only see people as dollar signs. The employees are overworked and underpaid."
bad,I was the general manager for this company and out of my own mouth i will NOT recommend this place the upper management above general manager is very rude.
bad,"Low pay, terrible DM's., always on call. never enough store hours for employees. Very stressfull. Higher management has no idea of how to run a store."
bad,"favoritism"
bad,"My experience at family dollar was terrible there was a lot of you do what ,I or quit .The management had no respect for associates and there was no security  for your protection."
bad,"Does not pay their employee's what they are worth, over works their employee's,  not enough hours to train new employee's, no employee discounts, does not promote within"
bad,Fast paced but not a very organized company.  Were expected to unload the truck with 2 people with out the proper protection so you didn't get hurt doing the job
bad,"The primary manager ran off with a few nightly deposits leaving me in charge by default. I self taught myself the company computer system, scheduling system, accounting as far as nightly deposits and cash reporting. I left due to no real training for the position and no increase in salary for the duties I was performing."
bad,"Unsafe Environment, Hazardous Conditions, No organization , C"
bad,"Over worked and under paid. Managers are rude and staff. Not considerate about personal life. Out dated systems, dirty stores. Higher up does not care about you either."
bad,Management overall is horrible. Lack of training and the store atmosphere is disgusting!  I Would never recommend this as a job to anyone. All managers should be trained well before given the responsibility to manage a store.
bad,Family dollar was the worse job i ever had the mangement was horrible and the environment was horrble everything about it was horrible i wouldn't go back there.
bad,Family dollar is not fair to their managers because they are salary working them 70 to 80 ours a week with no extra pay can not take your paid days off unless you are sick told by DM. They brought a new DM in and let her come in talking to you and yelling at you like a chid and will do nothing about it. Left me for 7 days with no one working but me forcing me to break policy and closing by myself.
bad,"No hrs But enjoy job.  only work 1 or 2 days a week. high thief stores"
bad,"A day at Family Dollar is very stressful and your job is not secured no matter how long you work for them. They even have a policy that if you try and stop theft once the product leaves the store, and you get hurt, Family Dollar will not pay for your medical expenses and will fire you on the spot. I would not recommend working for that company at all."
bad,"The manager at 12th and Dixie in Lake Worth was rude, and was never flexible with my hours, he told me ""If you can't get to work by 8 am, look for a new job"". It is a terrible place to work."
bad,They don't provide security from robbers and thieves. They blame the workers for shortage. Building are infested with mold and mice. Lack of professional Upper Management.
bad,There isn't really any way to progress with this job. They could use better management. You are able to work a lot of hours on the other hand. The work environment isn't friendly.
bad,It is just too much drama this top store manager is very conniving she plays people against each other even if you have a header all as myself I'm an assistant store manager she takes cashiers young ones whose naive and we'll talk about others to them and give the wrong attitude and give them the wrong impression of how to be at work very unprofessional
bad,management was a joke and corporate management was even worse than the store manager and they hate paying overtime and most def dont like to treat their employees properly
bad,This place is just childish kids that have no respect at all the new store manager is rude disrespectful and just don’t kno what she is doing they don’t pay you enough and want you to all the work while they sit down
bad,Family dollar is aweful to their employees and the management they hire is even worse. They are unfair and pushy. Not professional and the manager talks about employees with other employees on particular shifts.
bad,It is a productive but stressful place to work at in the evenings. I would work evenings and it would only be me and the manager and she would be most of the time in the office or hiding around while I was super busy in the cash register with a big line of people.
bad,"I would never tell anybody about that job."
bad,Upper management do not have proper manners and are very rude. Your constantly working in the store alone. No one really cares about the safety of the workers. Corporate and district managers walk in the store without speaking and make you feel very uncomfortable. We don't get paid much for all the things that the store requires the workers to do. We don't get discounts or rewarded for our work. We are not appreciated.
bad,Upper management is very difficult to work with. Very hostile work environment. They wont allow you to schedule enough people to cover the normal work day.
bad,I have nothing good to say bout this company. I was robbed at gunpoint and upper management and even my store manager never even contact me about the situation. HORRIBLRE
bad,While here I was overworked and underpaid. I ran a store by myself as a manager and was only paid as an assistant. I liked the customers but not the staff I worked for.
bad,"Company didn't care if you had a family, they expected you to be there even on the days requested off.  Unload trucks by yourself, by hand and in under 1 hour.  Don't care if you get hurt on the job, still expected to work and refused to let you go to doctor under workman comp, had to self pay when got hurt unloading truck."
bad,"cashier, stocking shelves, customer service, paperwork, ordering product, dealing with money, front end manager, supervising 5 cashiers, closing store,"
bad,"I had 4 cashiers that I supervised on a daily basis during work hours, made sure store was presentable to customers, stocked shelves, did price checks,"
bad,This Company work there employees like slaves but pay is so poor it make no sense. They diffently need to pay employees more but I doubt that very seriously
bad,Management do not listen. They do not care. You are over worked and under paid. They are not good with resolving conflict or and do not care about their employees.
bad,"Management is terrible and inconsistent."
bad,"Open store, count all drawers, petty, & safe, print out daily reports, check emails, scan vendor merchandise & stock it"
bad,"Stay away from this cheap and greedy company.  This has been the worst company I have ever worked at.  They go through people like toilet paper.  A very unprofessional company and the greediest company I have ever worked at."
bad,"Managed overall direction, execution, and evaluation of a retail store."
bad,Truck is a Mandatory work day. There is no way anyone gets off. Everyone works. Favoritism. They say there is no favorites but it’s obvious there is.   Expects you to know layout with store than a week. Expects you clear uboats in an unreasonable amount of time while also ringing up customers without managements help. Ask for a  specific day off and it’s as if you asked for the whole month off.
bad,Would not recommend. No recognition of what you do. Very heavy lifting and rearranging. People always talking about each other. Do t get paid for gas even though you have to go to bank everyday. Not paid for holidays except Christmas and Easter.
bad,"I've been working for this company for more than a year and and the hours have always varied, one week you could have 30 hours the next week you could have 20. No matter how many hours you worked you never got a break or they would act like you shouldn't get one. I worked a straight 12 hours without a break"
bad,"Family Dollar in Danville WV chose to get rid of the men that worked there and keep women only.  So therefore, I will not recommend Family Dollar to anyone"
bad,"Don't work here unless this is your only option' inconsistent work schedule, low pay, horrible health care coverage, and the managers don't care about you."
bad,"Had very little hours.  Had to run register, clean store and stock with very little help from store manager. Didn't get paid very much an hour.  Would get held at for stuff that happens on my days off."
bad,they refuse to pay you even if you have experience then they want you to be a slave everything about this job sucks i wouldn't recommend this job to a homeless person
bad,"Bad job and its not worth working at. The pay is terrible , store always messed, and it has poor management. They need to increase the wages for sure because 8.50 an hour is not any money."
bad,Holiday pay would be great. Being allowed to get paid  overtime would also be great. Management also needs lots of improvement. Working conditions also need a lot of work.
bad,"Typical work day, getting slammed with stock. If its not done you don't leave. management is unreasonable along with cutting certain employees down. The culture of work is horrible. Hardest part of the job is getting yelled at in front of customers and when an employee tries to call cooperate nothing gets done. There is no enjoyable part of this job, due to the store manager"
bad,"just do not do it to yourself its a bad company all around. they take advantage of workers, poor management, stressful, not a fun place to be working,"
bad,good place for teenagers looking for a job not meant for adults with responsibilities.  a lot of work cashier stock crew cleaning manager and floor worker
bad,Family Dollars is an okay place to work if you don't have any bills to pay or if you are a single. The hours sucked and the pay is ridiculous. I did not enjoy the pay at all.
bad,Employees at Family Dollar are expected to do everything in the store for minimum wage and not enough hours. They have you unload a truck and stock the shelves and expect you to do it within your 6 hour shift. The truck comes once a week and carries everything in the store.
bad,"i did not enjoy my employment with the company felt over worked and under paid. No lunch breaks, very rude co workers . The district mgr was hardly ever in the store and when one would call him for anything he would never answer his phone."
bad,"The shift start with you counting your drawer, loaning in, while out on the floor with customers waiting to be checked out, then you have to stock, clean and assist customers.  You are also responsible to sell items, manager specials, and be mindful of you cash in your drawer for the customers requesting cash back."
bad,I had the worst experience at family dollar...The management was the compltee worst...Very unprofessional! I honestly have nothing good to say about the one I was at I wish I couldve got my transfer but I couldnt.
bad,"Very stressful place to work, our store manager walked out on us. Everything was very unorganized, management went down hill after the store manager walked out."
bad,some Management does not know how to speak to their employees. does not do paperwork went weeks without a schedule. Calling people to work an hour before their shift just very unprofessional at times. threatening people job it was crazy I love and will miss my customers but I am extremely grateful that it is over and I thank them for the opportunity. I was warned before I took the job but did not listen
bad,Dangerous in very bad neigborhoods no security very high thief. unstable management team three store managers in 5 months low pay no enough hour for csr's
bad,Bad place to work. Very stressful. Over worked and under paid.Poor management and managers did not schedule properly. Never worked a full 40 hour week.
bad,"Only work here if your desperate, for work. Because the employees are over worked and under payed"
bad,Horrible unsupportive management and accuse you of every cash loss there is no support and lack of resources they expect you to work over 52 hours with no help often times by yourself
bad,This is not a very organized company to work for. Hours are constantly cut and there is no stability. It was impossible to stock inventory and run a cash resister.
bad,Not the best place turnover of employees is daily. No help when needed. Machines were always breaking down and not repaired correctly. Management would change monthly.
bad,I would never work for this company again. I did not like the store manager she was rude. The job itself wasn't bad but I would never want to work for a family dollar store again.
bad,This job is horrible. They are very incosiderate and very nepotist.  They always pick favorites and did not abide with equal opportunities. I will never work there again
bad,horrible  place to work. the management is horrible as well and very in professional schedule you for work then when you show up they tell you you wasn't suppose to be there
bad,"Employees are over worked and underpaid,no room for advancement they prefer to hire outside the company even if you've been there for years, the raises are very scarce and vacation time is also even after your year is out in"
bad,Fast paced stocking and lifting learned reponsiblity in management  most enjoyjable part of the store being in charge of the store hardest part was unloading truck
bad,having to deal with nasty customers all day. the culture always changed due to the fact of changing store managers. hardest part of the job was being robbed twice at gun point
bad,I wasn't satisfied with the management and with how the manager handle situations. I tried to fix the situation by asking if i could get transfered to avoid having to quit due to poor management and never got a response from the manager and the district manager. I would of still been working for the company if things would of been better handdled.
bad,The worst job I've ever had they are disrespectful as ever the manager was horrible I was very disappointed when I started working here I will never work here again
bad,They leave you by yourself  they don't try to help you and they don't give you a break. They'll try to accuse you of stealing $0.24 just because your sales are lower then the rest
bad,"Low pay for the experience that I had. Would not work there again,didnt enjoy working there at all. Job is for a person in high school or just graduated."
bad,"Long hours, little pay, no recognition for anything done correctly or a better way that helps save time and money. "
bad,Family dollar  likes to put on a good show but they will work you to death and your work never gets appreciated or acknowledged and the pay sucks I wouldn't do it again
bad,"Balance cash drawer, environment of fast paced customers, the management/supervising staff very reasonable but a little unorganized, area was very questionable and store was not reasonably cleaned, daily theft occurred."
bad,This place was not a good job. They have unrealistic ideas of what someone is able to do in a 5 to 7 hour day. They do not pay for what they want. They under pay and over work you.
bad,I don't like to be micromanaged and that's exactly what they did. They didn't pay enough. The job was too stressful and the management was very poor. It felt like a slave ship
bad,"The air condition did not work and weren't willing to fix "
bad,The management sucks The hardest part of the job was closing and keeping people from stealing needs more job security needs a better pay rate for management
bad,"This company is very horrible to work for. The district managers look down on the employees, discriminate, and yells on the sales floor in front of customers. Many managers has dropped keys and walked out without looking back. Would never recommend anyone to work there."
bad,I hate working for this company they were rude and only liked spanish people it annoyed me alot. They wasnt giving hours and was the worse at being nice
bad,They still owe checks they will mess up checks there no security for works and they are ver unorganized and never on time or proper paper work and inventory
bad,Hated working here wouldn't recommend to anyone management is back stabbers and they will blame everything on the associates that are newer to the store.
bad,"At family dollar and places like family dollar, they thrive off squeezing every last drop of labor out of desperate people who cant afford to be in between jobs and need the meager paychecks to keep a roof over their familys head. The store manager would crush single working mothers, having them work 14 hour shifts 3+ days a week, no days off, no empathy for anyone's situation. The average employee lasted about a month."
bad,Family dollar is a terrible place to work. You are underpaid despite all the work you do. I was assistant manager and only paid $9 an hour? The manager was petty and would find reasons to write me up and the work load is unbearable for the pay.
bad,"family dollar will consume your entire life, even as a good manager you will still have to be at your store every waking  moment. with the budget you are given be prepared to not only have to work your minimum required hours but spend majority of your morning and afternoons alone. the pay can be decent but of course the will try and get you to agree to the least amount of pay as possible. budget has gotten ridiculously tight to the point that its not possible to run your store the ""right way"" . district managers do not care about excuses all that matters is numbers. high shrink? oh well your fault even though people are running out of the store with hundreds of dollars of merchandise. all of this hurts the managers end of year bonus. so once again think twice if you don't have a life and don't mind spending all your time at work then this job might be ok for you."
bad,"Do not work here, this place is physically and emotionally draining. It was a mistake to ever apply to this place. I repeat, DO NOT work here, you will regret it."
bad,They were very unorganized. Changed schedule without informing employees. Manager would call out a lot. First day I had to unload 1600 pieces of freight by myself because our manager had to leave.
bad,Was pretty nice at first but than they fired Hector for no reason at all and it all went bad with new management they only care for themselves and theyll be quick to fireing people after a minor accident or a small mistake not a good company to work for a career never know when they'll let u go for some stupid reasos with
bad,I was fired for my drawer being short after working there over a year and a half and never being written up once. I worked with 4 other women who were extremely jealous of me and kept drama started. They constantly gossiped with the customers about employees and made the schedule according to what specific employees wanted that were friends with the store mamager
bad,Was always put in the bad areas. Stores get robbed because there is not enough people working. District manager is rude and talks down to everyone. Good prices on products.
bad,"Company was horrible, expected 55+ hours and half the time you were in the store alone, so there was no way to focus on customer service and get your daily tasks accomplished let alone your safety in the surroundings."
bad,Constantly changing staff. Workers are blamed by corporate  for everything in the stores. Constantly changing rules. Every store is ran differently as per management.
bad,"This company degrades employees, constantly threatens employees with write ups.  Not enough hours to run the store properly, Freight delivery over 2000 cases per week including over 50 totes filled with small product to be put in it's home.  You can't put all up in 2 days and the company does not care, so the stores become a mess."
bad,Managers are very unprofessional and only care bout they selfs and their accomplishments.they don't care about they workers and they family's and the things we go threw at home.
bad,"This was one of the worst part time jobs I had. Management is a bunch of dramatic teenagers and refuses to work with you if you need help with your schedule. They pay you minimum wage and expect you to work like slaves. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who has a family or health issues because they don't care about your problems, you show up regardless if you are deathly ill or can't find a sitter."
bad,"I would only suggest working for family dollar if you have a backbone of steel, and you are single with no friends. If you have a family and enjoy spending time with them, DO NOT get this job."
bad,dealing with the different characters was a hassle because not everyone is patient. management is not good. staff moral wasn't the greatest. dealing with the occasional thief
bad,Poor company to work for. Focus solely on financial gain without regard to employees well being or concerns. Longest year of my life working for them.
bad,One of the worst places to work. You are under paid for all the work that you do on top of they get robbed so many times and still don't put an armed guard in the store.
bad,"This company is professional but the folks they hire are not so . these store pose a safety risk and frequectly get robbed and theft is rampant and be prepared to deal with ghetto customers. most stores service urban areas, the pay is such a joke. Run for the hills"
bad,Not a good job. Very unprofessional. Very little hours are given to employees. No one communicated good and certain things could never get done. Just wasn't a good place to work
bad,"Did not enjoy my experince there. Not enough budget. Had to work from open to 5 pm by myself. Had to stock, ring up customers and still do manager duties. Never even a chance to use the restroom."
bad,Manager was the worst. The environment is hot during summer and cold during winter. Manager had no respect for my personal life and kept making me work long hours.
bad,Family Dollar was the worst job I have ever worked. The store manager at the time was verbally and mentally abusive towards me and unprofessional. Typically my day at Family Dollar I spent stocking freight and unloading truck along with assisting customers at the register and making sure the store was clean and organized.
bad,"This job sucks and they treat there employees like garbage."
bad,The company itself is okay it's just that the way that they throw you in it's like they feed you to the wolves with barely any training they basically sit you in front of a computer for 4 to 5 hours you tead through everything this basically how you figure everything out from there there's no hands on the company really don't care about the employees because none of the stores have security and they're mainly ran by woman
bad,This turned into a short term temporary job.  The store shut down and they did not give me the chance to move to another store.  The whole company is not that great.
bad,"The pay is not great for all you have to do for your position as CSR. I have never worked in a place that did not work as a Team to get the work done. Some days management is friendly and other days they hardly want to speak with you. Not very clean boxes in the way for customers to shop. Back room, restroom, and break room always have garbage sitting around."
bad,Manger were very disrespectful never helpout in line work without getting a break or a lunch dont get a raise as they say you do to much favortism going in the store
bad,Never allow the employee to tell the manager what to do...I did not enjoy working their favoritism and I was never trained in a register until I transfer to anther store...
bad,"Very productive but an unsafe store to work for. A typical day at the Family Dollar was always shocking to me. High rate of theft. Location of the store was located in a poor neighborhood. Because of the location of store there was a lot of criminal activity outside the store. Because of the environment, most of the employees were always rude to customers which always led to an altercation. I had to learn to have more patience. Lets just say I've never worked in an environment like this and I would not ever work there again."
bad,"The family dollar i work at did not have good customer service, nor did they have workers that wanted to do their jobs, and it was not clean, nor safe."
bad,"working at family dollar it is unorganized. employees are disrespectful to each other and to customers . "
bad,There was always short staff and Store Manager always on the phone. and worried about her personal life. and never there for her  staff. loved the customer wish they had better managers.
bad,Need  security make it better work place for there employee need to give more payroll let employee take time off after being rob it very stressful work place
bad,"Do not make a career out of this Managers will not stay to close store, low security, low staff and lots of boxes with 0 help. all has to be done asap"
bad,family dollar is really not a good out look for anybody they lack of communication and direction. They do not have manners for there customers or there employees
bad,Worst place to ever work at. Upper management thinks they are entitled to take all holidays off. Talk bad about employees to other employees. Promote street/ghetto people into management. Play favoritism and bribes certain employees.
bad,Manager physically drank on the job.. As assistant manager I was left to pick up the slack my general manager provided. ALL the responsibility and the company refusing to compensate lead me to quit.
bad,I did like working at family dollar for the most part but the manager wasn't very understanding when you called in sick you still had to show up worked there for over a year were no benefits
bad,I was expected to run the register and stock the shelves at the same time but its impossible to do both at one time and the management staff weren't sympathetic
bad,"The manager would changed your schedule with no warning and punish you."
bad,management does not look for best interest of employees. low pay for too many job duties. no security for unruly customers. not enough hours. but will put your customer skillks to work.
bad,"Only hires people known to employees. Poor communication, they dont drug test (supposed to).Manager is horrible person to work for very unprofessional"
bad,"I learned so much from this company. I felt honored to give my customers my undivided attention. Going the extra mile to make sure their needs are met. This is more like a teen job for the summer. Do not expect full time. I was reallllllly given 39 hours every week to keep me just below the qualification limit for benefits. No security, store has been robbed several times."
bad,family dollar does little to respect your home life and never offers competitive pay or benefits. the workload is alot considering what they pay you and you ar often the blame if shrink occcurs.
bad,"low energy , not alot of smiles "
bad,"family dollar is a bvery stressful work place, they have run outs everyday all day and we are always short staff due to cut hours. it is also very unsafe"
bad,"Family Dollar treats its people even worse than Walmart does. Theyd rather overload current employees, especially salaried ones than hire new staff. Save yourself the stress and pass this company by."
bad,"Upper Management only concerned with making money...They do not care about the people they hire, including store managers. The manager I last worked with went on 5 weeks without getting a day off. The District Manager is a witch. The stores are filthy and the majority of customers who shop there are low-income and homeless individuals. Be prepared for customers who drop tons of nickels and dimes on the counter to purchase their cigarettes! I hated every minute of this low paying job. I will never ever work for Family Dollar or any Dollar company ever again."
bad,i hated working here they were very unorganized and it was an overall bad experiance and i hate that i have to put  it on my resume but it was worth the job experience thouugh
bad,"my day would start by opening the store and register. I would check the petty cash and deliver the deposit at the bank. the only thing that would be a little heavy for me was the unloading of the trailer of the merchandise but, that didn't stop me from managing the store."
bad,Manager is very rude and unprofessional. Curses and yells at you in front of customers. Talks about her employees to customers. Would not recommend it anyone.
bad,it brings moral down once u walk in the door no set time to get off rude managers unfair judgments and playful co workers worst place worst place i fr
bad,This could be a great place to work but your store manager and district manager can not both suck.  If so leave as soon as you figure it out.  The pay is OK if the store manager is honest and does what she is suppose to.  But if she is a lier just for get it.  I was assistant there making 10.50 hourly and was only give 24 hrs a week.  and the manager was premitted to do it with no problem.
bad,"This is a place where criminals target. To work for them you must love to be stressed out and ok with knowing that at any moment you could be robbed, and  witness a horrible fight ."
bad,This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. the employees are overworked and underpaid. Be prepared to work holidays and weekends. I did not like this company.
bad,Bad company and even worse managers. Working truck is horrible and they wouldn't give you any breaks even when working truck all day long. Managers are careless and don't help as much as they should.
bad,Fast and busy and I learned how to manage employees but there was no organization you had lazy workers and the hardest part of the job was dealing with lazy co workers
bad,I worked here for a year and six months only get a 25 cent rise very cheap company assistant managers make $11 dollars an hour i did stock and register and much more and only made $8.63 an hour not fair had me go to the bank to pick up change that was not part of my job picking up change should be the assistant managers job thats what they get paid for first store manager i worked with was very nice
bad,"I worked for Family Dollar for two years they sent me to 12-15 stores that all needed help.  Racism within the company, definitely.  I was finally placed with a Manager who had no Assistant Manager so I stayed there for awhile, I took all of my Management Assessment Tests and passed them all, continued to go to bad stores.  I was working at a store where they pulled the Manager to take over another store and the other Assistant Manager who did not have the time with the company as I did was given the store over me...she didn't even want to be an Assistant..really okay so she ended up stealing a few days worth of bank deposits and she was riding a bike wow okay.  I hate to say but, I told you so."
bad,I worked for Family Dollar for a long time and got jipped on my pay for management I wouldn't never recommend anyone to work for that company I did not get paid for what I should have got paid when I turn into a manager
bad,"as an asst manager, i was expected to life heavy boxes off the uboat and stock all the shelves in a 6 hour time frame plus manage the front and keep my open for any discrepancies with a staff of two all night or whatever shift was being worked."
bad,"It was the worst job I ever had never gave enough hours and people was always stealing, the pay was good, but I never reviced enough hours to have a decent pay check"
bad,The company doesn't value the employees safety refuse to get security in the stores to stop theft and robbery the company don't hire the right people for the corporate office positions
bad,I did not like this job the management sucks. The store was a mess because of the management. You can barely get your job done because it was only two people working and you had two or three jobs at once.
bad,Family dollar expects you to the job of 2-3 people while working alone.  They are slave drivers and the compensation sucks.  I would not wish this job on my worst enemy.
bad,Employees work mamagment duties and only made teammember pay. Managment leave teammembers on registar during rush hour to work alone. Stocking over half product and unload alone.
bad,"Family Dollar is by far the worst company I've ever worked for!  They overwork, underpay, and they don't appreciate their employees! Corporate employees can sit back and watch the store employees struggle, ask and beg for help when they don't have enough workers.  They expect you to jump through flamed hoops, in the middle of the ocean, Hogtied, and blindfolded....AND STILL expect you to make it to shore alive!!  As long as they are getting their checks they do not care at all about store employees!"
bad,I was very unhappy with this job the company is very unorganized and they did not pay you for the job that you do. I was moved around to different stores and promised a general manager position and they kept putting it off.
bad,Little to no advancement opportunities. Managerial staff is not very welcoming to newcoming employees. The pay for most positions within this company is less than most other retail establishments.
bad,It is a part time job you really don't get many hours unless its Christmas time I love talking to the different customers that would come in but you also had your rude ones you have to over look
bad,"Its a place to work if you lose a job unexpectedly. Unless you're a store manager or above you get paid poorly. They have the worst hours, there's no work life balance. Constant turn over....truley some greedy p.o.s.'s running that circus. And no holiday pay to boot."
bad,"If you have a Social life or value Family time this is not the place to work, so working for the company means you give up your time for them, they will call you on your days off to cover for another Employee, and expect you not to say no..... But on the other hand if you are ok with all the previous then apply."
bad,This company has no concern for its employees safety and wellbeing the stores are located in bad areas of the city with no security other than a voice on the loud speaker
bad,"The job sucks worst pay, no benefits, the staff sucks, management sucks, and the company sucks would not work there again in my life and i'm for real."
bad,"The only thing good about the Family Dollar Store I worked at was the nice customers. Other than that, we got robbed at least twice a month. The employees was lazy and didn't do any work. They don't have benefits for part time employees."
bad,Do your job and keep to yourself. Dont let anyone but your supervisor and main bosses tell you what to do and how to do it. Others like to boss around but dont get into drama.
bad,Family Dollar set you up to fail.  There is no training at all you have to call around to try to figure out store policies.  The is little to no real security I was robbed at gun point while on the clock.  The store is always under staff so prepare to have customers just walk out of the store with stolen goods.
bad,Horrible company to work for the entire management team is corrupt and are embezzling thousands of dollars a month and no one is doing anything about it.
bad,I think this place is not worth working for the company don't care about their associates and will not help keep you safe. It's a job I would not recommend to no one.
bad,this job was a most unpleasant one for me. it was unsafe and every man for themselves.  I definitely dont recommend this job to anyone.  Very cut-throat business.
bad,"Come in open store, do paper work, make bank run, check email and complete task, cashier, stock, greet customers, and count monies end and close store."
bad,My co worker and our boss put me to do more for less money my co workers and boss was not fair with me I got ripped off one worker. My boss called me out of my name.
bad,"Not a great company to work for. I do not suggest anyone make this their career because its not guaranteed to be there day by day.           "
bad,"They pay very well, but it's honestly like being back in high school. Had 8 different store managers which each time had to learn how they wanted things done. The new district manager is a joke, plenty of people who should have been fired are just promoted to store manager no matter the drugs they sell or rules they bend. Oh and don't try to report it to the hotline it does no good. Basicly if you have no family or friends this is the job for you. And if you like being talked to like a dog, or accused of things left and right with no proof."
bad,Management. terrible. co workers. ok. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you are really desperate and in need of a job. management will sit there and tell you to do everything while they do absolutely nothing.
bad,"This job was ok but if your looking to have something in life, this should only be a temporary job. Particularly good for high school or college students."
bad,I had a rude inconsiderate store manager. The district managers did not care. The store manager changed the schedule last minute did not call to inform me she added me to the schedule while i was off which resulted in me getting in trouble. I am not sure if all stores are this bad.
bad,they cheat you out of your money they treat their employees horrible. I would not recommend anyone to them. Upper management will come in and criticize in the rudest and most unprofessional manor.
bad,The is a terrible place to work! had a great manager but the company its self needs to work on how they treat there employees. They do not pay well but want to work you overtime.
bad,Oh man dont remind me of this mistake. This job was just it a job I could never ever work under such poor conditions like that again. The store was nasty disorganized and full of employees that steal. The managers suck at what the do the employees are rude and lazy always half  on the truck unloading and maintain the store I grew my first grey hair in this store due to the stressful environment
bad,Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Company doesn't value it's hard working employees. Not a safe place to work. Needs to pay it's employees better. Low paying job
bad,"Its a job. Focus is  on the customer, must be customer service oriented, the management is Family Dollar driven. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers."
bad,"the job here was easy. "
bad,"I highly recommend you never work at such a horrible company such as Family Dollar. They have horrible pay, no room for advancement and no benefits at all i would say."
bad,No lunch breaks when you work an 8 hour shift. There is no lunch room. Managers are very rude to employees. Very unprofessional. First job and it was horrible
bad,They work you like dogs for minimum wage. going from regular store Associate to Assistant Store Manager they gave me a .25 Cent raise. they move people around from store to store to help all the other stores who are struggling with staff and theft. HIGH turn over rate.
bad,I would come in at 8 in the morning and I would leave about 4 or at close and I would be tired from straightening the same shelves day in and day out I would always have to straighten the store before it got busy and I was trained on how to put up inventory
bad,"Answer customers' questions about merchandise and advise customers on merchandise selection.	Itemize and total customer merchandise selection at checkout counter, using cash register, and accept cash or charge card for purchases"
bad,"Company is awful! Not only is the work slow and there is nothing to ever do, you actually get in trouble for not having anything to do. I would spend hours just walking around the store and fixing the same things over and over again because there were never any customers."
bad,This company is the worst that I have ever worked for. They do not care about their employees and you don't have any life outside of work. They are inconsistent consistently.
bad,You will never get anywhere with this job. You cannot further your education or anything because they constantly give you different shifts to work. Management sucks as well.
bad,"In its' relatively infant stage in California, they seem to wrestle with effective balancing of operating expenses and profitability. As such, they consistently place extremely incompetent managers in these stores that lack the abilities to infuse the working environments with innovative approaches to moral building and store presentation. They'll get better. But it'll take district managers who are secure enough to place in positions leaders who will make a difference, and not turn their heads to problems."
bad,"working at family dollar you'll experience shoplifters on a daily , you'll be underpaid for the amount of hours and work. On the Bright side the manager i had was great"
bad,It had seem like no matter how hard i had work it never was good enough for my Store Manger like she did not like me working for her act all! I had really wanted my manger position but she had stop my every move from getting it!
bad,I did not learn anything at family dollar. Management team does not know how to work together. need to be more productive
bad,"By far the worst company you can ever work for. They dont care about your family, health or just dont care about their employees. I have worked retail for 20 plus years and have never seen such abuse toward their employees. they work you till you break and show no type of care if you get sick from over working. all they care about is money not the employees nor the customer."
bad,"Enjoyed the customers and the retail experience.  Store manager was always rude, unprofessional and kept conflict going between team members. Reported all incidents to DM and corporate but nothing ever happened.  DM excuse was always she's a young manager."
bad,"Do not work at that one off Statesville Blvd, in Salisbury, NC. They will tell you what you need to do but then make you do their job, and if you don't you get yelled at for not doing their job."
bad,Could be friendlier not the best place to work they go through employees like every other week. Needs to get rid of some management
bad,Worst place to work boss think that they can do what ever they want whit you they don't give you benefits but they make you work as a fulltime this people are rude and onprofesional .
bad,"No training or development available or provided and no advancement even before layoffs."
bad,"I have worked for family dollar for a year. We have been robbed/almost robbed 6 times in one month. Management has women close, provides no security and refuses to close earlier. You will work holidays for no holiday. You will slave for minimum wage and your well-being will be disregarded.  Didnt take a background check, didnt take a drug test, didnt get any training.Good Luck!"
bad,"Ring people up."
bad,this store was crazy only 3 of us worked their and we worked 12 hour shifts you pretty much stand around because the store was so small you could only do so much they have u go at 6am to throw stock on truck days and they dont rotate who throws it
bad,I gave a few years to this company in a clean up store manager role. I was taken to  the hospital due to a heart attack and the company let me go for NOT OPENING THE STORE.... while i was in the er. It almost felt like there was no life other than work. Employees called in all the time and the store manager had to fill in the shifts. Hardly ever saw my family.
bad,I learned how to work as a team. It wasn't a great job but feel like my attitude changed in some ways. I didn't like the way they treated us workers. They were very pushy and demanding they worked you like slaves to be honest.
bad,"too much work, not enough pay! The requirements did not match the compensation. Area manager provided no assistance only unrealistic directives."
bad,"Worst company i have ever worked for. No support from management. Management is not trained to manage people and tend to treat people terribly, employees & customers. Employees are never recognized or rewarded. Management often blames employees for mistakes made by management."
bad,Worst job I ever had. They expected too much for too little pay. You are expected to stop thieves but u have no protection or security guards. The management team for not stick together or communicate with each other.
bad,I was a store manager in a bad neighborhood and an old building..You're required to work 52 hours +. DMs and PMs are unavailable and you're forced to work in the store alone if they're call outs. No support at all.
bad,"I would NOT recommend working for this company. As an assistant manager, the pay was not worth all of the work entailed. The district manager was a joke, no breaks, no raise, constant browbeating from said DM, unacceptable! Too much work to do, and ""BUDGET"" would not allow for proper staffing to fix issues.The whole, ""EMPLOYEES ALWAYS STEAL POLICY"" was so ridiculous... would NEVER work for this company ever again!"
bad,"Jean (or gene i dont know how its spelt nor do I care)one of the managers didn't even give me a chance. He knew that I walked there and was ready to send me out the door for that reason alone. I applied for manager and he told me ""well if I don't get back to you in 2 days that means you didn't get the job"" Then he asked me if I would take a cashier position. When I said I would he then said ""why?, you just said you wanted take he manager position then you say you'll take a cashier position do you know what you want?"" I was appalled. Don't apply here.  Especially if your struggling and need to walk to work. If I live close enough to get there in time it shouldn't matter if I have a car of not. Obviously you need to work and get miney before you can get a car. But people that are ignorant like jean don't see it that way. If you want to go to a interview where you will get riticuled and talked down to go to the family Dollar on 611 dundee ave. Jean will surely love to talk down to you. It's a small rink ink dollar store that everyone passes up to go to the real family Dollar by butera at clock tower plaza.  So don't even waste you time."
bad,"-can't move up"
bad,"working at family dollar for a couple months wasn't very pleasant, especially if the store had lots of burglaries or people where always trynna break in. Management was great"
bad,"Manager, don't have a personal life, can even take vacation due to turnover. "
bad,When I worked for this company there was no team effort at all and the managers were stealing money from the company and when I reported it they tried to cover it up.
bad,It's a job basically..nothing more nothing less. Don't expect to be treated with any amount of decency from upper management. Don't expect to be paid anything over 9 dollars for any job other than store manager
bad,"responsibilities depend greatly on the business; however, in all cases his or her primary duty is to provide good customer service and that was not always the case."
bad,"long hours , not family connserdate , no pay horriable corp. office and a hire you to fire you company.defintliy one of the top 5 Worst companys to work for"
bad,Dm and Rd don't do anything to help you they are only out for themselves. I was 9 months pregnant working 80 hours a week. throwing truck every week and management not helping at all.
bad,"There were several times I worked for over an hour, sometimes even my entire shift, by myself. Could never get help when I called other stores. Constantly missed breaks."
bad,"I was hired for a temporary position, and I was treated like a temp. I helped with the store set up and was treated horribly. The people who came in to do the set up were nice, but the store manager wasn't a nice lady, She was nasty to people, she came to work hungover, and left the job regularly without letting anyone know."
bad,I loved working with people everyday. I worked hard and did what I was asked. my boss loved me and wanted to be a manager some day but she started making it hard for me to stay working for family dollar. I would love to find a job that I can work hard but also have fun.
bad,i only worked there for 8 months and i enjoyed the atmosphere most of the time. The manager was great however i didn't make enough money for the work performance that was expected.
bad,Management was very poor did not accommodate for anyone's schedule and played favorites. Many security instances that has not been accomdated due to laziness.
bad,i was an assistant manager and the stores always had shop lifters and always been robbed and when the police was called always would come late after the case.
bad,"Working for family dollar for almost SIX YEARS I am happy to say I am in search of another job. I was an assistant manager making 10.25 an hour while my cashiers were making 9.80. When they'd been there   a matter of months. Higher management treats you as if you do not matter, that they're better than you, and on multiple occasions  have tendencies to talk down, and scream at you as if you were a child. Completely unprofessional in my experience since dollar tree took over management. They do not care about their employees, they want you to break your back for minimum pay and on top of that, treat you poorly while doing so. Do not work for this company"
bad,Just like everyone's first job this was a rough experience for me but you have to start from somewhere! It had its pros and cons. Met some pretty cool people who became good friends.
bad,"Family dollar will work you to death, won't let you go to the doctors, and when you do doctor said you have something wrong with you, they say no you don't, you can work under them conditions."
bad,Lack of security....District Management very rude and doesn't care about your well being.under paid you basically on your own when you walk thru the doors of family dollar but they want you too protect their goods
bad,"Fast passed work "
bad,"I did not like this job. I was good at it, and was very friendly to co-workers, employees, and customers. I felt as if I was seriously being taken advantage of by a stingy, uncaring and inhuman corporation and wasn't able to support myself, let alone my family, with a job such as this. I felt as if I were wasting my life for nothing."
bad,"very unprofessional job, wants you to work hard and not pay nothing and plus no hours. Rude customers talks to co workers very rude. The managers barely knew what they were doing when it came to making schedule for the workers."
bad,"As the assistant manager of the store, hours were given, then taken away, wasn't trained properly, then yelled at for not doing what I was never trained to do in the first place, was yelled at for not doing things that didn't even need to be done, has subordinates that would not listen, no air conditioning, no heat, unpaid holidays I could go on and on.  They treat their employees badly and expect to keep them. Female employees are paid less than their male counterparts."
bad,"So much out of place failed inspection always getting robbed.  People were rude, everything always out of place. Not a hard job just rude people."
bad,Manager used to make me work 6 days a week with horrible pay and used to leave me in control of store for up to a week at one point with no help.
bad,"no respect within management "
bad,"Required to work 52+ hours, pay is poor, little to no payroll so working alone 80% of the time. If there are call offs, manager is required to work regardless of what you have going on in home life."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to ever work for this employer. They abuse the work staff and do not give them time off. The managers work 70 to 80 hours a week.
bad,A very unsafe company to work for i have been robbed at gun point three times. No security poor management . A very unstable place for a career
bad,Assigned as an Assistant manager. Love I had responsibilty on audits and shipping. But dealing with thieves and rude customers. It's not worth the pay or position to deal with that kind of environment.
bad,As a former asm at this company. They don't give many hours to part time empoyees . They have a really bad turn over.. The pay is too low.. The managers are there all alone most of the time. You need 6 arms to complete daily task. The job is overwhelming because nothing is never good enough .
bad,"Family Dollar is ok for something to just bring in a few extra dollars, if you are a high school grad and just looking for a summer job then this is fair."
bad,everything about this family dollar location was terrible. i didnt feel safe at this location. i didnt pay well very over worked and tired.
bad,"The worse there is no communication what so ever. They treat the associates  like slaves. More times then none you wont get a break.They need to change there name from Family Dollar to Dollar Dollar because that is all they care about.  There were times where it was hotter in our store than it was outside. "
bad,I would not want to work at family dollar ever again. The hours was crazy and the pay was not worth it. The way they unload the truck is a mess too.
bad,"No one cares about you in this company. Managers tell you to do something then you do it and they get angry with you. Management is very rude to customers. An assistant manager was asked by a customer where the tape was located and said ""can't you see the bin right there"". Other staff would not help me when the register was over flowing with customers then get angry if you confronted them about it. Manger would be only stocking at the back and I was responsible for stocking up front and running the register. The manager had nerve enough to ask me why I hadn't finished stocking up front when she knew customers were coming in left and right. How are you supposed to stock when you have to run the register every 15 seconds. She even had the nerve to tell me she had finished her stocking and I should have finished mine. I simply told her all you're doing is stocking. I have to run the register AND stock shelves. I had to go to the bank one day to get some money and the assistant manager told me I took too long. The bank itself was close to a 10 minute drive from the store. What was I supposed to do? Run red lights, stop signs, disobey traffic law? I think not. Steer clear from this company. The pay is awful for what you are expected to do. Run the register, stock, sweep and clean. You can literally get paid more as a janitor. Upper management cares nothing about you. You are only there to make them money. They don't care about family or holidays. Actually you are expected to work even longer when holidays are approaching. They even extended the store hours!! When are the employees"
bad,At first I loved my job at family dollar. Went from cashier to assistant very quick. But being the assistant I seen all the dirty things that really went on. Managers changing your time in the computers and lying to the DM to keep their jobs. It was awful. They are always complaining about pay roll and cutting your hours.
bad,"Typical day at work is extremely stressful, worrisome, & NOT worth the time or day for minor situations that could be handled in an appropriate manner."
bad,"This is the worst job I've ever had. Changed many positions still not worth it. Don't bother just a major life set back unless you plan to be here a while. Stay away. You will be scheduled five days, and work seven. Your never covered because they don't allow the payroll."
bad,The work to life balance is non existent. Not enough payroll to do an effective job. Most of the work falls on the Store manager to pick up the slack.
bad,"Not very organized, schedule constantly changing, no accountability for associates at all. Pay is very low, and management doesn't care if stores are dirty"
bad,"As a salaried manager, you will be expected to get the job done even if it means working 70 or more hours. They don't care once you are salaried. "
bad,"long work day "
bad,"I hated working for family Dollar, The management was rude, fellow employees made you feel like you weren't an equal. When you ask for morning shifts because you need to be out by a certain time, they purposely schedule you to work the complete opposite of what you need to work."
bad,"they hired 25 of us, told us that it was a temporary job, but if we showed up everyday and did a good work ethic and getting the store up and running on time that they would hire us for that store or transfer us to another store that needed employees. they hired 10 of there employees and laid the rest of us off."
bad,"Understaffed, vacation not able to use it because there is no one available to cover your shifts, not much room for advancement, pay is not equal to the amount of work you are expected to do."
bad,"do not work here. mangers are rude, and the work is hard for the pay. not so much hard, but not worth working like a dog for the pay you get."
bad,Horrible place to work. No overtime. No benefits. No pay increases. Just all work and no appreciation. unable to maintain a life.
bad,Very poor pay with almost no benefits available to non-management personnel. Long hours of being on your feet constantly with few breaks.
bad,No respect for workers. No respect for managers. No respect for customers. No hours. No benefits. Low pay. Inadequate staffing. The negatives are endless.
bad,this job was good to learn and practice your customer service skills. I have worked on registers before but never did retail. I was here for a little over a year and I learned different things about retail which I am pretty sure would be similar to other stores in retail.
bad,"At first this was a great company, there's so much turnover for no reason. The way they treat customers is unbelievable sometimes."
bad,"No family/work life.  Unrealistic payroll for high volume stores.  Upper management turn over is horrible. Work conditions are low i.e. theft with no security in area of great need, not fixing air\heat, broken toilets, broken doors etc..  To much back stabbing and vindictiveness from  the top to bottom."
bad,Would get threating calls on my days off stating if I didn't come in  I wouldn't be transferred to a new location. No breaks!! Worked alone all day. Unload trucks alone. Unsafe working environment!!! Company don't care about their employees at all!!!
bad,I disagreed with the way management operated at this particular company. I did however take every opportuinty and advantage to utilitize for the better.
bad,"Working at Family Dollar was not difficult or tedious. However, due to a lack of reliable management most duties were placed upon lower ranking employees. With that being said, since so many duties were loaded upon one person they rarely were completely finished in one night. Therefore, the employees coming in to open the store were stuck with finishing the work and/or leading to pile further upon 2nd shift."
bad,"open and close the store did the report for the store put the tills in the draw so cashier could use it, take deposit to the bank when we close"
bad,"Well on a typical day of work at Family Dollar there's quite a bit that needs to be done. All tasks are to be completed before you clock out, unless there's an emergency. I learned how to be a team player and also self control. Management was cool people i liked them. My co-workers were fun and funny i miss them. The hardest part of this job i would say is nothing. My most enjoyable part of this job was being a cashier."
bad,"This is a bad company to work for. The company barely trains new employees and even the managers.  Asst. Managers are barely making over minimum wage.  They have policies that are not stated in the Employee Handbook, and there is no Manager's Handbook.  Benefits for Full-Time employees are at a bare minimum and will cost you an arm and a leg to afford."
bad,They dont care about employees at all. By far the worst company ive ever worked for. Poor pay amd working conditions. I worked in a store with a rodent infestation and they did thier best to hide it
bad,if the employees were more helpful and respecting of others and new employees they would have more help. No one didnt help nor clean.
bad,"Bridgeton NJ's family dollar is the worst place to work. They provide NO security and its a very dangerous place to work at. As well as the company it self is a joke, they allow unethical things go by like for example the inappropriate jokes, use of language, and racism even when its the management doing it. Their benefits are slim to none. and they are very selfish about giving raises and bonuses when promised."
bad,Everyday throughout the day stealing all day long in order for you to get ahead you had to do a lot of sucking up nothing good to say about the company at all
bad,"There is no formal training at family dollar."
bad,At first good After awhile the place is ridiculous. Holiday great hours after holiday not even able too make rent. Just if you want no money doing everyone's work an thats what your looking for go for it unless you are management period there are no health benefits for part timers so unless you management you are nothing to the company basically a fly
bad,I was never allowed time off even for children's doctors appointments or family functions.  the pay was ridiculous for the amount of production required.
bad,"productive, learned patients, loved communicating with customers, management was poor sometimes really rude even to customers, typical day at work customers never stopped coming and it keeps you moving and on your feet"
bad,"My manager did some shady stuff. So I called the Loss Prevention Line and they did not do anything about it. So, as I kept working there she would write me up for stupid stuff. Like I swept the floors like I always did, and she wrote me up for it. So after that I quit."
bad,"weekly pay , yet most stores are in low income communities witch cause unsafe work environments due to store robberies and theft"
bad,Job overall not worth it.. they dont pay good and they expect ASST.MG to work until there last breath...  Also they like to work regular team members at all times and work them out without getting inappropiates hours to sleep and in top of that no breaks at all..
bad,"I work for this company for one yr and in that one yr I was sent to 10 different stores. I left the company do to never having a secure place of employment. As well as because I was training a store manager that was stealing and when I reported the issue it got back to her and she started working me harder, writing me up, and putting me on all nights. I didn't feel like the company was of any benefit to me."
bad,they require managers to do all the work that normal business have stock people for. One has to unload truck by self. Stores understaffed for work required
bad,"7:30 am arrive at store, clock in, code in safe, open registers, run over short report, count safe, count registers, order change if needed, open store at 8 am, instruct cashier on what needs to be done during their shift. Venders arrive I check them in count merchandise. take out garbage M/W/F, weekly truck comes on Thursday unload truck and put up stock closing count cigarettes, safe, and registers, sweep and mop store Sunday morning cycle count day and give cashier break and cashier when needed"
bad,"Dealing with the public is what I enjoy the most and throughout the years I have gained more knowledge on how to mange time, multi-task, and properly deal with the many challenges that come with working with the public. Whether good or bad I greatly appreciate the many experiences that I am faced with each day I attend work; there is honestly nothing hard about my work because in any field of work I would have to deal with people whether its co-workers or the general public. Everyday I look forward to meeting new people and advancing my communication skills."
bad,"Family Dollar is one of the cheapest corporations I have ever worked for and I believe this is why they were bought out by Dollar Tree and are going to be out of business in the near future."
bad,"Little staff"
bad,this is the worst place to work for. the management was bias and they treat you with disrespect. I will never go back there nor will I send anyone there.
bad,It was alright until I got transferred all the way by Brookfield Zoo. Knowing that they were only giving me part time and a couple of days out the week. It wasn't worth the drive for the pay they were offering.
bad,I was there for less than a year. In that time I was promoted to a store manager and stepped back down to an assistant. They give zero support to their store managers who often work open to close. I had to work open to close 7 days a week because my supervisor would not find me an assistant or allow me to find one. Their management turnover is insane.
bad,they will cut your hours the managers steal there is no security so people steal and fight in the store the uniform is not enforced and many of the co workers look sloppy they are unprofessional and ghetto
bad,Management does not care about employees. The company only cares about money and the bottom line.There are no benefits for long hours. No regular breaks during the day day most days.
bad,"Hired for a local store, then sent 45 miles away for training."
bad,"This has to be the worst place I have ever worked. They will not do anything about the air conditioning in their stores for one. It is always hot, I even had a customer who said she was calling the home office because it was so hot that she didn't want to shop in there and we would probably pass out. Two there is never enough staffing because people are always quitting because of the environment and it is down right not safe to work at any dollar store. Three they do not pay you no where near enough to make a living."
bad,They will lie and cheat to get exactly what they want. This company is like working for the SS. They will stop at nothing to make you feel like the dirt your sweep off the floor. No respect. No love. Just misconduct.
bad,company sucks managers and and DM are rude they do not care about there employees they fire people for no reason they don't give you any time off you can be at the store most of the day by yourself until another employee comes into work not aloud to take any kind of break not a safe place to work
bad,"I've learned working here,that my coworkers were and are very unprofessional in This particular establishment. There's always the customer factor,but when your co-workers are being rude to the customers and Management knows,it's time to find a new employer"
bad,"I advanced rather quickly because no one wanted to stay in management positions too long, I think it was because of the bare minimum compensation. But it was a great first job and great experience to put on a resume when I became a manger 2 months into my first job."
bad,"Family Dollar was a badly managed store I stayed there so long because I couldn't quit without another job. Nothing was in order at the store that's why we went through about three managers, none of them could handle the workload that came with being a store manager"
bad,Currently working at family dollar in retail is a stressful job because of hard work and lack of hours due to poor management.
bad,"Family Dollar wasn't the best job for me if you're wondering why it just didn't have much of a work environment, it was co-workers that had it out for each other a lot of he say she say within the work place so I stayed to myself as much as possible. Once I clocked in find out what needed to be done that day complete my task to the best of my ability and clock out when the work is done for the day and get ready to do it all over again the next day and eventually I just didn't want to be apart of that team anymore so I took upon myself to resign from Family Dollar and try to find something better."
bad,I feel like it was a terrible place to work at. The staff was lazy and nobody would do they jobs. There was nothing that I learned there although I tried to give it my best.
bad,A typical workday is very long because too much hormones are in the air no one wants to listen to anyone a very large truck to unload and lifting too much merchandise to put up manager tries to be the friends of employees instead of leading them and directing them the hardest part of the job was to instruct an employee of doing one thing and going to the manager it gets changed
bad,"Very poor treatment, worse expectations, awful pay and incredibly low hours. Dishonest superiors. Horrible practices. Truly the worst place I have ever worked. And I have worked in sewer lines...."
bad,"This company is so far behind its unbelievable. The culture and structure of the business is still stuck in the 80's. Nothing is updated to perform the job effectively and efficiently. They don't give hours and when you work you are over worked and extremely underpaid. There are hardly any benefits , just the worst place to work in my opinion. If you are looking for a career this is not the company to work for."
bad,Never again will I work for a family dollar. They have favorites. If you are not a favorite you don't get treated properly. You get taken advantage of. Pay rate is junk for the amount of work that you are required to do. Never once received a pay raise after being full time assistant manager for a year. Never had call outs or no shows. Don't waste your time!
bad,the day would either start off with me unloading the truck or running the counter and stocking due to short staffing it would me just me and the manger for the night and the lack of help from the management the lines would crowd up badly and we never closed on time
bad,"The Leadership does not care about the people, especially those working in the stores.  Hopefully the merger with DT will help."
bad,"Family Dollar over works and under pays their employees. They have no care or concern for their employees or their safety. Benefits are horrible and the pay is terrible. The turnover is extremely high and I did not enjoy working for this employer from the first day. Consider applying else were, if you become and employee don't trust anyone."
bad,company wants to much from their managers and the hours and work isn't worth it.  The manger is there all the time and does everything because their is'nt enough payroll for them
bad,"Some good days and some bad. Very busy place to work,  different thinks to do in one shift, long hours, 7 days a week. Always open on Holidays with no holiday pay. Its very hard to get a decent raise. You have some helpful Informative managers."
bad,"This was a very stressful work environment. However, I did the best that I could with the management and other employees. This job was very fast paced and their was little room for advancement. I did enjoy meeting new people."
bad,"Operate the register until 2 PM, truck, seasonal merchandising, setting plan-o-grams, cash handling, bank deposits, recovery. The Managers salary is over half the weekly budget, which allows you minimal help. Managers work six days a week and average  twelve to fourteen. hours a day."
bad,"The workplace was not fun. Management was not supportive. No opportunity for advancement. Coworkers were alright to work with, but most of my customers were pretty cool."
bad,i enjoyed the public very busy store ..but i was nit getting any hours less than 16 a week .. could not survive or pay my bills
bad,"Work like a dog, and for sure get treated like a dog.   70+ hours on salary plus weekends. Working for Dollar General now and its a lot better, they appreciate your hard work and the pay is well."
bad,"This is a decent first time job. Other than that, everything from the the environment to the management is discombobulated."
bad,"If you decide to work for Family Dollar, you won't have a life. Be prepare to work 10 to12 hours a day and work between 66 to 80 hours a week.( Store managers)"
bad,"It was conveinent for me to be employed at the time there because i needed to get my foot in the door somewhere to get back into the workforce after being a student. Not enough hours and didnt even offer any employee perks... like discounts, etc. felt treated like a criminal there for their polocies on purchases for employees, when they could of at least gave some discount, even 5% to show appreciation to us employees and show us the empathy for the fact that family dollar is a minimum wage job, and that through the comapny as a whole, we can help eachother. There was no unity or employee appreciation at all in my opinion, so they probably lost out on having employees ready to give their all when they got very little in return."
bad,"they make you work 50 + hours a week jip u in pay jip u in vacation days horrible managers who sit on their behinds watching while all other employees bust their behinds and when it comes down to it they blame all their employees , plus wouldn't let me leave when my son was being born I had to go higher up in the company to leave just to see my son being born"
bad,You work long hours and you might get a break. I learned that just because you have a family doesn't matter to them. They'll hire anyone and when you try to fix something that a general manager messes up then you get blamed for it. Co-workers just want to move up and they will say anything that will make them ahead of you. The hardest part of the job was throwing freight on the opposite side of the store and also having to run the register. The most enjoyable part of the job was once in a while a very nice customer would come.
bad,don't bother applying unless you want to be angry and disappointed with almost every aspect of the company you work for. I have never worked in a worse place.
bad,"It was a fun place to work, but only receiving ten hours a week was way less than I was promised. Seeing customers that returned on a daily basis was the only plus side of working there."
bad,Typical day was providing services to customers. I learned to be patient. Management is not good. My coworkers were cutthroat. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency of management. The most enjoyable part of the job was servicing the customers.
bad,"I day at work entails irritate customers that I have not problems dealing with in a professional and happy manner. My manger keeps playing with my schedule by scheduling me for one shift and then bouncing me to a totally different day and time. My manger also gives people hours that do not even show up so I end up getting called in and the only issue that I am having with that is that I just started there and have proven that I want the job; willing to work on a flexible schedule yet they are not giving me enough hours for me to take care of my family. "
bad,"Family dollar was a horrible job, they had me working 5 hours a week. On top of the job being ratchet, I will never work for family dollar ever again"
bad,"On a typical day at work I'll unload a truck, stock merchandise, and greet and assist customers. The hardest part of my job is unloading the truck, lifting heavy boxes, and stocking the merchandise I unloaded."
bad,not a great place to work. No real room for advancement. No work/life balance. a manager can expect to work upwards 70 hours per week
bad,boring boring boring not much pay for alot of work and managers are lazy and want cashiers to do all the work. nothing else to say
bad,i was hurt that family dollar would throw me under the bus after so much work i did for them including having to watch my back in the streets.
bad,I didn't like this job.. I am a hard worker so I was still able to get the job done.. I had to much work to do in such a small amount of hours.. While working there we had 3 different Supervisor.. Plus I had to unload a 18 wheeler by myself ever Thursday..
bad,Is not safe theirs no security at all their not clean they be cursing at people and employess and their never organize they have a mess in that store they let people still and stuff
bad,Management sucks...they promise u something and don't keep it ! I am looking for new job that appreciates and values employees
bad,"Terrible store, could not work enough hours a day to clean up the mess left behind.  Meeting new people was always fun, but the store was just so dirty, and I did not like the safe being out in the open in such a run down part of town."
bad,"I was only part of the building crew that put together the Family Dollar here in Patterson, Ga.  I was no kept after the store had its grand opening.  I did not associate with any management, or any of the workers at the store."
bad,"My day would start off me ringing customers up at check out, cleaning my work area. I learned how to count down a cash register."
bad,"overworked, understaffed, left alone in store as manager until afternoon,  had to run register, customer service and put out freight being all alone, also checked  in vendors. My staff was good, the hardest part of job was being left in store alone, had to wait on customers could not get my work done. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers and stafff."
bad,Managers work 70 to 80 hours a week and are only paid for 52 hours.  They don't give you enough payroll budget to have a staffed store even in the busy seasons.  Most times during the day the Manager is by themselves.  Stay clear of this company
bad,its unprofessional they want you to do every thing in the blue moon but they don't want to pay you and they some want you to work off the clock.
bad,"Managers are rude and arrogant, they play favoritism amongst the employees, there's never enough employees scheduled to handle the crowds because they're quite stingy with the hours unless you're ""cool"" with the manager, the stores are often dirty with overcrowded shelves which not only make it hard for customers to shop but even harder for employees to face the products at the end of the night, if you have an issue with a manager or something of the sort don't bother wasting your time calling their so-called integrity line or even their corporate human resources department because nothing ever gets solved just more lies told until you eventually give up on the situation. Basically put, DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY"
bad,"District manager get bonuses by cutting hrs of part time employees. most of the time as a manager you are in the store by yourself. You will work every weekend. Depending on your store manager you may only get 30 hrs a week. You never have enough people to get they job done unless your store manager will work 90 hrs, which most won't."
bad,"As a manager you are required to work 52 hrs per week. And this would not be an issue if you actually were able to work those hours."
bad,not good company to work for they treat manager and assistants very poorly would not like to work for lehi district manager ever again yelled at me over phone for something i did not do
bad,"Had 3 DM's, 6 Store Mgr's, and numerous Asst's fired. Worked in 6 stores. Most days worked alone from 6-8 hours. Ran register, helped customers, checked in deliveries. Also worked on call and split shifts (opened, sent home early, called back later to close.) Store manager works 60-80 hours per week. Shoplifting was a nightmare with only one person scheduled. Chase them: get fired. Don't chase them: get fired. Depends on DM's view of store. Last one fired entire crew in 60 days. No warnings or write-ups. You can't make this up."
bad,"I not like working here. I was under paid, lack of hours. Disrespectful co-workers. On the bright side. I did get the chance to learn how to be an Assistant Manager. I did a lot of learning as I went."
bad,"the co workers are great, but when it comes to a family situation family dollar isn't ""FAMILY"" orientated. they do not allow time off to handle your medical needs of you or your family"
bad,There is a true lack in what they deem to be leaders. The turnover rate is abysmal. It is sad that people are treated as numbers.
bad,A typical day would be our truck deliver would be late. Learned how to do planograms and set up shippers. Managed store and six associates. Hardest was catching shoplifters. Was meeting new people.
bad,"A typical day at work was depending on the day in the mornings slow midday somewhat busy evening time very busy"
bad,"employees didn't show up, management was rude to customers and staff, the hardest part was going to work, best part was going home"
bad,"This experience wasn't a great one, the company was cheap, they over worked their employees and they skimped out on benefits. would I work for this company ever again?......no,...."
bad,First off there was a lack of communication. The store manager wanted me to guess what is on his mind. If you don't kiss his butt he treated you like scum. We got robbed often and they never fixed the outside lights and the store was not in the safest neighborhood.  I loved the customers but we was taught to treat them as animals and as if they all stole merchandise. The district manager was rude and talk down to you. Always understaffed or someone calling out. I bust my butt for my store and other locations because of course nobody wanted to work . I wasn't appreciated for my hard work.
bad,The store is very cluttered and the work among the staff is very aggressive because of the environment of non organization from corporate management to the local level of the managing staff of the stores
bad,"Disgrace of a company, was fired while pregnant (About a month) because i had to go to the emergency room because i was showing signs of miscarrying. I never called out, and always came in when they needed me to. I stayed late and came in early to help my coworkers. The lady who fired me stepped down 2 weeks later... it got up to 105 degrees in the store and they still wouldn't fix our air and we weren't allowed to open our doors for air...."
bad,"I am a people person so I really enjoyed helping people around the store. I also liked to see my customers come into the store with a smile on their face, knowing that the assist manager that was working that day was on their job..."
bad,if there is no good management here this place will just not work out. even if they are short handed you will be obligated to stay and work a 12- 15 hour shift
bad,"Working at Family Dollar I gained a lot of knowledge of working in retail. Always expect the unexpected, working with different people everyday can have it's issues. The management was very unorganized though, we had different managers in and out the store. I had some nice co workers, everybody was focused on getting the job done, the hardest part of the job was dealing with customers nasty attitudes but its retail, the most enjoyable part was meeting new people and being recognized for my accomplishments."
bad,work by yourself for up to 8 hours a day. Sometime unload a 1500 piece truck by your self. Says open door policy but it is not very very very unfair work place
bad,"This place was absolutely horrible to work at! The managers do not care about you and when you file complaints, corporate does not care about you. Thus the basis of why I only worked there for 3 months. I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"The upper management is rude, and a bully.  They do not appreciate anything you do, whether you do a great job or none at all they will still yell at you and tell you, you are a horrible employee."
bad,"End Rider position, cut throat, dangerous equipment, full speed at all times, dangerous working conditions, unstable hours, low pay, promise of higher pay, nothing enjoyable..."
bad,This would be a perfect place to start out at if you have no experience. Personally you can not create a career out of working for Family Dollar my experience was great when I first started but since i've been there for a while my time there has been terrible. My hours go up and down every week they never have a set schedule because they don't get enough pay to pay there employees and the management is really poor.
bad,They don't really care about their employees. For it to be family orientated they don't really allow you time with your own family. I wouldn't recommend this job even to my own worst enemy.
bad,"My working experience at Family Dollar wasn't pleasant. When I was first offered the job I was told that at the least I would receive 15 hours a week, during my time there that changed I slowly decreased in hours until I didn't receive any at all and when I called to question why that was I was told they didn't have any hours for me and that they needed to talk to someone and they will give me a call back but that never happened."
bad,na I have nothing to say about this company they use and abuse you as a manager and or associate. district manager fired my asst. I had to work 7 days a week 16 hours a day no family time lost custody of my son
bad,nothing good to say no hours for staff end up working 70+ hours per week. Corporate nit picks every aspect of store. stay away stay far away.
bad,"Awful place to work!! You never knew what your schedule was going to be, were left constantly, by yourself in the store worked 13 hour plus days without breaks."
bad,"Bad company to work for, and to much stealing from customers and no security at all. Puts all pressure on Management and cuts labor almost to the point to where you doing all the work yourself. If your looking to ruin your life go work for Family Dollar."
bad,preventing internal and external theft. ive learned to be patient with the public. My co workers was easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job is stopping a theft. the easiest part of the job was treating everyone with respect. I enjoyed working there because it was convenient.
bad,"I feel Bradley's was very hard on their in store managers, expecting them to work long hours without proper compensation and little to no time off. There were no benefits what so ever and I just felt they didn't treat their employees very well. I had an awesome supervisor who taught me a lot and I knew I could rely on."
bad,During my short time working for this company I was treated as a common criminal by the management. I hope to be provided an opportunity to succeed but unfortunately for Family Dollar they failed in every aspect of success.
bad,"I wouldnt recommend anyone to work for this company. They dont care about the employees. under pay u. Dont pay u for overtime, Treat u like a slave. At first i enjoyed working there until i became a manager they treat them so badly. You work about 54-75 hours a week only one day off and u dont get paid for the over time"
bad,"Worked 8-4p.m."
bad,Family dollar was not a safe place to work. I didn't like working at this place the pay wasn't so far and the store was very nasty
bad,no breaks no hours the manger was rude he picked the people he wanted to work with by how cute they are
bad,"Company wasn't helpful when stores fell short, couldn't run store according to what works for the store"
bad,"I was force to be trained as an assistant manager when the manager was unwilling to admit her wrong doing. My employment was ended with this company after I had finished the training, doing the work for about two months and demanded the raise that came with the work. The manager then gave an ultimatum of quieting collage and stay her assistant or be unemployed."
bad,"I wouldn't want to work for this company again.  They don't value their employees, and they overwork their managers."
bad,I worked for the company for 3 years. My store manager quite and I had to run the store while my District manager decided who would get the store. I asked if I was going to get manager in holding pay while I was running the store. I was told it would only take a week and a half and if it was that short I would not get manager in holding pay. If it went on longer I would. I ran the store for 2 months and never got paid manager in holding pay I asked about it and was told. WE NEVER DISCUSSED MANAGER IN HOLDING PAY. then later found out he told my new store manager to look for a way to fire me because he didn't like my attitude. Basicly trying to cover his tracks for making 1 assistant manager run the store for so long to help increase  his bonus and make him look better.
bad,"It sucked, and one manager was very disrespectful not only to her employees but to customers as well. They need people from corporate to come down to investigate"
bad,"Pretty bad experience there. Got my hours cut despite being there the longest and give nothing but good work. In the end, I did not receive certain benefits a full time employee usually has (eg. time off). I recently moved and basically had my transfer request denied."
bad,I managed the store that I was assigned to.  I was in charge of the store and one employee.
bad,Working hard everyday to satisfy customers that are ungrateful was not fun.
bad,I worked for a racist woman that was trying her hardest to either fire me or me quit. She would complain about stuff that was suppose to be done while i was off to me and I would get in trouble while everyone around me just did nothing. She refused to hire extra workers and work me like a dog and then get mad at me for when work wasnt done. Horrible company she fired me but put in paper that I quit so that they wouldn't have to give me unemployment.
bad,Loss Prevention and customer service. Merchandising and Inventory Control.
bad,Its an ok place to work and as part time college student. It long hours they dont hold everybody to carry their part. dont give you the proper training.
bad,i disliked this job the manager was very rude and treated his coworkers poorly
bad,"Honestly, the WORST year of my life, living under a bridge would make you a happier person."
bad,"Standing around or Stocking shelves"
bad,they ask to much for too little pay. manager does not have good customer relations or how to treat people
bad,Family dollars Management was unprofessional. Was required while disabled to unload a truck even though they knew I was disabled.
bad,nobody would help keep the store clean. armed robbed every week.
bad,One of the worst companies to work for. Doesn't really care about employees and DM are allowed to do so much and get away with it
bad,To cheap to place security in stores where loss is at its worst.  Management sees it as a workers responsibility to stop theft with super powers I guess.
bad,the only employees that are full time is management. they would give me 9-12 hours a week. the manager set me up and was fired weeks later. i was let go for something i didnt do.
bad,"no crew hours to maintain quality store, would not recommend to anyone. All management has to unload trucks by hand"
bad,"the ""zone"" i worked in had its little group. when i started i was informed that both the manager that hired me an the assitant manager who had been there over 7 years were quiting. they informed me to do the same only a week after working there. i saw why i was retaliated against by another store manager for giving a customer HR's number beacuse he mistreated her and her kid. he was not fired but i was written up for multiple fake things. this company is horrible to work for. if you have anywhere else offering you a job take it over this."
bad,"learn to recover and organize products"
bad,The managers were always late to open the store. The store was constantly getting robbed and we were expected to try and stop the thieves our self. We never got our breaks on time and I often had to pull double shifts because we were short staffed.
bad,"I enjoy working with people and completing tough tasks, but without clear expectations and without the man power to execute the tasks effectively, it simply can't be done. By becoming manager, I found it easier to delegate projects to fellow employees and provide the support that was needed."
bad,I worked there for a MONTH and was robbed at gunpoint. Not worth your time or your life!
bad,"I would come in and stock the shelves if there was a truck delievery that day or the day before, then I would front face products and return things back to their correct place. Also, help customers find items and cashier. I learned that team work is very important. Management wasn't good my manger wouldn't work around the days I when to school. Wasn't a safe working environment, because the store would get robbed several times a day."
bad,"Very Dry, the management would not let me take a lunch break. apparently did not understand labor laws because they made me stand outside for my full 8 hours without getting a break for the sidewalk sale"
bad,"Family dollar did not provide a safe work enviroment.  The coworkers that I had would make racial statements.  The store was robbed the week prior to starting there,"
bad,The actual workplace was stressful... The job wouldn't have been so bad if there was actually communication and a good team.
bad,"management of this family dollar is horrible"
bad,The only good thing I can say about the company is you get paid every week.
bad,The management wasn't friendly. The company and work was fun . The co-workers were easy to get along with
bad,"First off, everything in the store was so disorganized. You could have dog collars right next to candy or toys next to cleaning supplies. The manager knew I was going to school, but I was still given too many hours."
bad,"My typical day at work,"
bad,"long hours, stressful, time consuming. short staffed, low wages, no job security"
bad,"Rather not go into detail about my previous employers. This company inparticular. Well, the title speaks for itself."
bad,It's work but you would probably be better off trying to game the system Like the typical family dollar customer does. If entitlements ended tomorrow family dollar would likely end the day after.
bad,"A typical day for me is to come in early with only one other associate in the store with me. This associate is a manager. As an associate I'm expected to ring up customer orders, stock inventory, push freight, and clean up multiple stations in the store. I am used to not receiving breaks or lunches and it is frowned upon to ask. Many times I am forced to stay in longer than I can, or penalized for having to be absent for emergency/personnel situations and the pay is horrible. Our management is not grounded, and the other associates have poor work ethic and lack responsibility."
bad,"family dollar needs to work on their work habits, They need to remodel the whole building and fix the problems they have. They also need to give employees a raise according to their work ethics."
bad,Did not enjoy this job at all. Do not recommend this job for anybody
bad,"Not a very good company to work for , the pay rate doesn't meet the job requirement. Very disorganized no managerial structure upper management is completely lose. "
bad,"Horrible experience. Horrible Management ,District management.Very mean and unsupportive."
bad,Family Dollar is a horrible company to work for.  You can report stuff going on in your store to your district manager and they tell you it is all hearsay and they are not going to do anything about it.  So you report it to someone else and the district manager finds out and they fire you.
bad,"I operate a cash register, and I also managed to place inventory on the sales floor organized shelves and did some light housekeeping and stocking up my workspace area"
bad,They don't care about the conditions under which their employees work. They are practically slave drivers
bad,Typical day at work consists of customer service and stocking shelves from deliveries. The most enjoyable part of my job is enjoying the return of customers and being able to suggest new products and or sell them items they didn't even plan on getting...
bad,When i was first hired it was the best place to work..then with a snap  everything went down hill. They district manager was out of control talking to employees like we were pets. We would have so much overstock that it would spill onto store floor. At one point i would be the only employee working..Hell at Family Dollar..
bad,"customers are beyond rude and steal right in front of you and we are expected to stop them even if it may cause harm to us , employees steal, past manager attitude were poor every day. Majority of employers call off or wont show, then left to do overtime and then all hours were cut significantly."
bad,"The absolute worst place I have ever worked. Completely unprofessional, lacking in order and procedure, extreme poor management, and horrible pay."
bad,Typical retail. Were not fair with trying to work around your schedule if you had another job or school. Pay was very poor. Rarely let you have a life.
bad,"When I first started all seemed well. I got promoted to assistant manager in two weeks. Great right? No it was horrid. I still worked no matter what until it became unbearable. Soon I became the store whipping girl. Did all the managers work was never paid for it. No appreciation and nothing was ever enough. Manager consistently belittled me and co-workers in front of customers. District Manager is corrupt and biased as well as making it plain of her favorites. The pay is not worth the suffering. You work hours upon hours with no breaks. They don't care, I do not recommend this job or company to anyone."
bad,"A typical day at work: Our DM called the store around 4pm and told the employee not to leave the store until everything is complete. Thats wasnt the issue, the issue was how could you create a list of things for your team to do so late in the day, a list that you know takes at least two days to complete. Leaving us in the store after hours when there has been continous break-ins. Thats very unprofessional."
bad,it is an nice place to workif you are single with no kids. hours are ok.
bad,"Not enough coverage in the stores, no communication, lack of teamwork, robberies, no security and no raises. The hardest part of the job for me was teamwork. Not enough participation from management and not enough coverage in the stores. No safe at all. The best part was the customers and certain employees who just made your day."
bad,Working at family dollar is not the worst thing in the world. It pays and requires a moderate amount of work.
bad,they are unprofessional not friendly at all they need to take class and lean how to talk better to workers and customers
bad,"A typical day at work will include me assisting cutomers, cleaning, up the facility, and working as a team player"
bad,I was a store manager and sent to stores to clean them up after i asked not to be transfereed from a brand new store i put together and opened. over asll the upper management was the problem. the district manager is finally gone now but teh problem remains from the other district manager. corporate should pay more attention to the west coast and see the problems
bad,"was hired to build new store, we built the shelves and worked hard then we all where let go because there where 18 people and only 4 slots. those who lived more than a mile from the place where fired. I live 19 mils away was the only reason I was let go."
bad,I would say the hardest part about working at family dollar would be doing so much hard work and not being appreciated for it.
bad,No work life balance. Company just takes and takes and takes until you are used up then they toss out to to the curb. Worked 70+ hours a week often times 7 days a week and holidays because of no payroll for workers. No payroll to go around causes manager to be only worker and sometimes only person in store. It is near impossible to effectively manage a staff if you are the sole worker.
bad,this job was not for me. i did not enjoy the long hours and low pay. i felt like i was working for nothin
bad,This job is based for kids and high school kids no real money involved unless you have worked there forever.
bad,"Basicly a pay check not my best job experience and job security is issue because of shrink by bad neighborhood,truck loss not being counted,employees also steal,managers can be unfair, disrespectful customers,working less hrs than scheduled, hard to transfer for me, other things but ill stop there no need as i no longer work there."
bad,"A typical day at work is cashier, stock shelves, greet customers, unload truck on truck days, clean. Most enjoyable is the customers. The management sucks really don't care about employees work you hard for little money."
bad,The manager was extremely lazy and I only worked one day a week.
bad,"Work was hectic, and unprofessional"
bad,"Having worked for family dollar I can say that while store managers and DM's make a very decent wage Assistant store managers and cashiers make next to nothing. Its back breaking work being with this company. Lifting freight off of truck for nearly three hours twice a week. Then having to take that same freight and lift it several more times to get it to and from its location in the store. I was an assistant manger and did the same work as the store manager. ( If not more than the store manager ) When something went wrong it was my butt on the line. You are not allowed to express your self or enjoy the environment you are in because its a ""work"" environment. Cashiers do alot of the same work for minimum wage. In most store assistants get paid maybe a dollar or so more an hour to do the store managers job. Which isnt worth it when the store manager makes 44,000 a year. In short i would not recommend this as a place to work for any one."
bad,"I was working 10-13 hr shifts at least 3times a week , and only making 6.00, my first wk they never showed m the way to clock in they would just keep telling me that the system was ""working some glitches out"" and they would clock me in and out till it was fixed, well my first 2 checks were anout $100-$120 short!! and they claimed there was nothing they could do since I'm responsible for my own punches!!!"
bad,I had a really good manager at first but when he left and a new one came in she didn't want to continue what the other manager was doing. I was n training to be an assistant manager but the new manager did not want me to be one she brought in a new person who eventually got fired for stealing from the safe.
bad,This by far was the worst company i worked for. They are rude arrogant ignorant. races
bad,Very interesting place to work. You meet lots of new people.
bad,"Words cannot express my displeasure while working here.The pay is pitiful,managers are lazy,district managers only care abut sales and not about the associates.Family Dollar never gives anything to charity,they are extremely greedy."
bad,"As a store manager, you must dedicate your LIFE to the company. I couldn't even leave the store for a family medical emergency which is why I resigned. The amount of work required is ridiculous for the little bit of pay that employees receive & employees must have an open schedule, which means no 2nd job allowed. Horrible communication from upper management and nobody is on the same page."
bad,Witnessed many customer service issues; false open door policy; Stands behind people that go against policy;
bad,You were on register all the time you also had to find time to wait on customers take care of products and clean the store.Management was ok until she added me to schedule without my knowledge and got me for a no call no show.I loved my co workers no one I worked with is still there except manager.the hardest part of job was holidays.Most enjoyable was customers.
bad,"A typical day at work included running a register, facing shelves, and dealing with rude employees."
bad,"Typical day at work is fairly easy.Nothing that is challenging to oneself, not much thought that goes into stocking shelves and greeting customers. I learned that the only person that can really benefit from this minium wage job at $7.80 and hour is the store manager, who get's all the benefits and also bonuses. : ) "
bad,I would get cussed out and my life threated by customers who were caught stealing. Management was bad they did no work and did not know how to manage a stuff. My co workers were lazy and dishonest. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers stealing. The most enjoyable part there were none.
bad,Management was all over the place and very unprofessional.
bad,"Family Dollar in Veedersburg Area is not helpful in any circumstances with their employees. They are rude and very uncaring. While I was there the managers had a very high turn over rate, three different managers with in a nine month span is ridiculous, even they were not happy, and it is very unpleasant to work there. "
bad,"Family Dollar was by far the worst job experience ever. You get no breaks, they expect you to work incredibly long hours, and there is absolutely NO work/personal life balance. The worst part is they'll hire you as a part time team member but have you work 39.75 hours per week. So you're basically working full-time, just without the benefits. The district manager in my area is completely insensitive and writes you up for things that are out of your control (i.e. too many refunds, too many transactions under $10). Upper management seems to hold very similar beliefs as well. Overall, this company expects you to do a tremendous amount of work for very little pay. "
bad,"A typical day at work would include being on register alone for 5+ hours. It would then consist of doing store projects such as schematics or stocking the shelves and doing recovery, you would also have to close alone on certain occasions which is never really a safe thing.I was the first assistant manager, this is the lowest rank of management in the store, now I mention poor management not because of the job I was doing, but because of the job the two people above me were doing. For example, as a store manager, you would think that the manager of the store would know how to take in a truck. This was not the case, in fact...I had to show said person how to do this on more than one occasion. This is because of one simple fact...said person purposely scheduled themselves to not work when the truck came in! "
bad,"family dollar pays little, and expects way too much! we were constantly trying to get merchandise to the sales floor with very little payroll. most times mgmt. worked much of the day alone."
bad,They use you and try to find a way to fire you they are crooked people
bad,"DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY!  You will be working 70 hours plus, not the 52 you agree to.  You are not going to be a ""Manager"", as your every move is dictated by Corporate.  You will be required to clean the parking lot, bathrooms, floors and take out garbage.  If assigned a small store, you will be working TOTALLY alone, on the register for many hours.  They have cut payroll to the bone, so even in a big store you will be lucky to have just one cashier per shift.....then all you do is run up front to do returns, exchanges, voids, customer issues, checking in vendors..."
bad,Enjoyed working for the company until the management changed hands.
bad,"The work I did was extremely worth it, I learned to appreciated those in retail."
bad,Learn a lot about retail and working with people. Making sure things were done before the end of the shift.
bad,Work load and customers are wonderful.  Work is done by simple common sense and many thing can be accomplished by correct time managemant.  Customers are wonderful had a alot of customer come back to certain locations because they love the service i provided.  The most fufilling part of the job was the customer services.
bad,This was one of the worst places to work for.They don't care at all about their employees. I've worked 10hrs with no break and been told to come to work or be fired when I was sick.I've worked here just over a year and I've had 6 managers and 4 assistant mangers.Just run now don't apply here you will regret it.
bad,"Loved my team of cashiers"
bad,Lack of communication. poor organization skills. Never a balance in schedule.
bad,Not enough hours to support ones self. The job required eveniung shifts only til close. Customers were rude and very obxious.
bad,"The company expects for management to do the unthinkable. With only allowing 2 workers per shift, in a high volume store, you spend your day at the register. Not able to face or front shelves or even restock the shelves. The managers and asst managers are stressed over cutting hours, and restock of shelves. The lovely customers can brighten your day, but the owners only care about their money, not the customers- or even the employees. I found myself (as a hard worker) not even knowing how to get through some of the days. This turned in to the hardest job, due to the unreasonable requests from CEO's or upper management. With an EXTREMELY high turnover of employees."
bad,"Wasnt ran as a business. New Manager every 2 weeks. Low pay, Bad experiences."
bad,Family Dollar isn't the place to work. They are a compony that takes advantage of their employees. Upper management is abusive and treat their employees like their animals/
bad,poor management
bad,"A typical day for me at work is greeting customers, stocking merchandise, and at times running cash register. I learned how to unload the truck by the Family Dollar policy and how to run the register. The hardest part of the job is putting away all merchandise in the few hours I get a week. The most enjoyable part of the job is conversating with the valued customers. Dont have the best management she is unprofessional, rude, and very disrespectful but, I've learned to deal with it. I had no problem with my co-workers. I enjoyed working along side them."
bad,A poor place to work!!!!!!!!
bad,I like physical labor hand retail and customer service. These are things i'd usually be ecstatic about. But this place maintains such a low staff makes it difficult to complete tasks. I'm the most qualified in the area and have been told i'd advance then transferred to another store at the same pay and less hours after telling them I could not work with a lesser pay average. I am female and they tend to promote men and not woman ( in my district anyhow). There isn't an HR unless you wanna go by phone or online. Sooo many things to complain about. But its a paycheck. The only good thing.
bad,"I took the job at Family Dollar because I really needed it .It has been okay , but they do not pay much . I worked previously doing Data Entry and I loved that . I like working with computers ."
bad,"You cash, stock and zone, half the time co-workers are lazy and the day drags"
bad,While working at Family Dollor I was a cashier. I liked being a cashier it just was very unorganized and unprofessional. I learned how to deal with customers and the public while working there.
bad,want too much work for the pay. employees are cut throats towards each other.
bad,i really dislike this job. I didnt like the managers and i didnt like the fact how they let me go in the first.
bad,"I was a Cashier, i help stocks and unload the truck once a week,,clean the bathroom and help customers"
bad,the manager sucks and cant do anything on his own. shot the employees act like the manager instead and they run the store. he aint even there helping he is on his cell talking to his friends and family
bad,"Fake managers, short breaks,worst pay bottom line.never saw anyone who accuses everyone of stealing. Management never opens on time. They are very rude to customers"
bad,My typical day at work with family dollar was stressfull. I learned you have to read your application carefully before you fill it out. Management was very rude and disorderly. The hardest part of my job was recovering the entire store alone. I enjoyed the register the most of my time. Overall it was a descent place to be.
bad,"This job was the worst job that i have ever had.I was over worked, under paid, and under staffed.I loved the friendly customers and my co-workers. It was in a very bad neighborhood and we were robbed on several occassion. On each occasion it took thep0olice more than an hour or more just to arive."
bad,not a very good company to work for lots of politics and not enough respect towards the people working for them
bad,* small budget
bad,Worked 70 hrs a week-always short handed-good benefits though-constantly busy
bad,"All family dollar stores are located in bad neighborhoods. The company leaves the managers in the stores alone for endless hours, to be robbed or possibly worse. People come in and steal everything they can get through the door and then lp comes in and tells you they are sure its internal. Greedy company who has no regard for their employees."
bad,no core values more concerened on freight then customer service
bad,"Assistant managers paid $9.00 a hour . Employees paid minimum wage. Employee reviews do not come when they are supposed to according to the handbook , so the raises are nil. Bad place to work unless its a last resort . Upper management are usually out casts from other companies. Breaks are not given according to the law. Schedules are drawn out so that employees that are part time or full time have 4 hour days...hardly affordable to make more than a 15 minute drive one way trip , to make your money back for gas , making minimum wage. These people do not care."
bad,They have no consideration at all for their employees. Breacking every labor law regarding breaks and compensation and all just for profit.(See al the law suits filed against them).
bad,"Not a stable work place, too many stores were opening and the hours were cut tremendously"
bad,not a good employer. dose not care for employees. they will let you go with no reason.
bad,The hours were horrible and there was not any consistency. It was in a bad part of town which made me feel uncomfortable. I am not going to say anymore because I don't have anything positive to say.
bad,"With payroll cut to the bone, it becomes impossible to get the work done. No more than 2 people in a store at one time. Freight expected to be put out at an impossible rate. NEVER a ""thank you "" for effort. Treated like family only if you are an unwanted stepchild."
bad,I didn't get paid enough for doing all the things I had to do.. my general manager was lazy and made cashiers do everything.she was always mad and giving me and customers attitude. They get mad when u ask for a day off. Don't waste your time here. If you know ur worth u would look for a better job with good pay.
bad,Only work here if you can get an assistant manager position.
bad,"I have never worked at a place like this. In the 2 months I was there I saw somebody mop the store twice and that was spot mopping. Management comes in with stains on their shirts and smoke in front of the store. Dead bugs under the candy machines yeah I'd let my kids go near them. Management refuses to open a register when busy because they don't want to count down a drawer. If you voice your concerns you are told you left the drawer open to find a manager to get cigarettes for a customer, but your drawer isn't short and the mystery customer doesn't report this to the manager on duty but 5 days later and no cameras to prove it either way. If you get a job here and want to keep it keep your mouth shut."
bad,Rude and very unprofessional
bad,"management stunk, the had a crush on the boss, the boss hit on me everyday. the employees were crazy. the customers were crazy and ghetto"
bad,"Typical day at work was pretty interesting. Depended on how many customers Id serve. I learned some schematics, and some more fronting and facing techniques. I had a really nice boss, very understanding and very informative. The assistant manager was nice as well. I got along with both bosses very well. I never really met my other coworker bc our hours were so spread apart or hed call off so Id work his hours. The hardest part of the job was leaving when I moved down to Texas. The most enjoyabe part of the job was the job itself. I love working with a different variety of people and love working with my customer service skills."
bad,sucks non professional company. horrible job left in the building as a fresh assistant manger without a manger left to learn. all the ropes with little or no help.
bad,This place has lost their minds and are in need of UNDERCOVER BOSS...the supervisor is crazy he can't load trucks so how is he going to manage the dept. Three guys quit in 1 week because of this guy..............upper management really needs to step in not to mention the pay scale is a joke....they want to kill you for 11 dollars per hour....REAL JOB SEEKERS NEED NOT TO APPLY...
bad,The job in itself was ok and I loved the customers especially the regulars but the managment sucked(excuse my french). I had to work too many hours over time and the manager was very rude. The security was very poor as well.
bad,I love the people but the location was just the worst area. The store was always get rob and people was always stealing. I think this job is what taught me how deal with mostly difficult people. My Co-workers was cool and nothing was had about the job except for the Truck
bad,"I regrets working with them, no employee values, bad management"
bad,"In matters of porfessionalism, I wish to refrain from making any honest comments that could ruin my repuitation and potetial chances of being spotted for hiring by other companies"
bad,The most abusive retail in America.
bad,"I hated working here, management sucked, they expected way to much Id be lucky to get a break. It was horrible"
bad,"A typical day for the 15 people they hired, was to unload a truck full of about 500-600 boxes. The AC was ""not working"" the entire time we were assembling the store, but mysteriously began working as soon as the job was finished and we were all let go. Which I might add we were told we would be placed in a store as soon as we were finished buidling their new store. However, when the time came we were let go and given candy and noise putty!!! AFTER they had us purchase a red polo and black slacks. TERRIBLE ""FAMILY"" COMPANY! STAY AWAY!"
bad,"Provided experience for retail, cash handling and replenishing merchandise. Management was unpleasant."
bad,"Family Dollar is a perfect example of a nonprofessional workplace. Every store I've been to has a district manager that wont give the store managers what they need. Adleast two of the current employees are involved in drama that overflows occasionally to others, including customers and little to nothing besides a stern talking to is done. Store managers are run ragged and when they complain they are often punished in a round about way. Such as their budgets being cut to lessen employee hours acrossed the board, talked down to like they are in high school and in general treated very badly by the upper management."
bad,"Great hours but no flexibility unless you have rank, although the pay/work ratio isn't equal."
bad,"Management wasnt good,didint learn much,alsoalways came in early people never showed up for work."
bad,On a typical day at work...I stand at the register ringing up customers for 6-8 hours with no lunch or break...I decided some days it was best to work through...I gave this job more than a hundred percent...I learned patience! The management team could of been better...The co-workers lacked team work...I strongly believe in team work...Without comes the stress and fustration...When it came time to unpack boxes...And put merchandise...It all fell on me...I took the patience that I had learned to concentrate on getting the job done...Since the co-workers wouldnt attempt to work...That was the hardest part of the job...No team effort...The most enjoyable was working for my customers and assisting them when needed...
bad,"Very poor company to work for, management has no morales. Low pay long hours"
bad,This company needs some major help with work home balance and with thier upper management and treatment of store managers..
bad,the manager was mean and didnt care that u have a family or not. she had every wkend off and u had to work. the district manger didnt care about nothing but making the money
bad,"- Demonstrated ability to handle high volume of customers, while operating cash register system."
bad,management was ridiculous... wants to start stealing stuff and then wanting to blame it on me.
bad,"A typical day at work would be busy at first but nothing that I couldn't handle. I gained more experince working with the public. Management uesd their authority to not have to do little to no work. Co-workers were wonderful once they realized that even though we were the same age, I was still their boss. The hardest part of the job was unsatisfied customers because often times what they needed was not available. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy."
bad,It was a OK job wasn't enough hours but it was a good learning experience
bad,working 90 hours per week 6 days per week in 21st century due
bad,"The stores are dirty. There is no Employee breakroom. Ths store I worked in had no heat and you were not alowed to wear a seatshirt or sweater to keep warm. In the summer the is no air conditioning. Also, They had a rat problem but the district management did not want to pay for extermination."
bad,A typical day a work included opening store. My coworkers are good people. I enjoy customer service period. I am a people person and just enjoy making others day.
bad,The management in this company was the worst. They do not have no respect for their employees.
bad,Family Dollar is NOT recomended to any one as an employer. As part of the management team you are always threatened with your job and no matter what it is not good enough and the things that you are asked to do are unreasonable and for unfair wages. As an clerk the wages are not comparable to other retail companies.
bad,"Typical day of work is being called at 7pm, 3 hours before your shift begins and your boss asking you to bring her coffee. I was trained to be a Manager. The manager is really mean, I was verbally abused. Every insult you could be called, I have been called there. From my weight to my hair to my teeth to my clothes and make-up even my car. The most enjoyable moment was being able to quit."
bad,"They cut payroll so low that you can't run the store as effectively as possible, always shorthanded, having to do 3 people's job. I am not GOD!"
bad,the place is a JOKE.they treat you like a wet scurvy DOG.i learned that you are a piece of cattle. mangement infints.coworkers cant read.engjoyable part of the job QUITING.
bad,I was fired for nothing that had to do with me because someone was in with management. Poor management. I did more work than my manager and other assistant manager. I was the girl unloading the truck while the guy stood at the register.
bad,"This company sells Cheap Items to their customers, Would not go back to work for this company."
bad,My review on family dollar is that they said what they said and didn't stand beside it. I was looking for a company to understand and value family. I was involved in a company that wasn't trying to promote or hire new people within the company for new positions available. They refuse to do any type of transfer within the company. They would rather loose employees instead of letting the good ones transfer be let go and find other employment.
bad,"At family dollar,you put in hours over 40 and don't receive overtime pay, you don't receive holiday pay, and you are help responsible for shrink that can be possibly out of your hands."
bad,"For Family Dollar to be one of the largest retail chains, the pay they offer is very little to none, almost like minimum wage. They don't offer any benefits, no holiday pay, you are truly overworked and underpaid."
bad,it was a very unorganized place.No one knew what they were doing always trying to find someone to blame for there mess up.they were not trust worthy.
bad,They dont have a organize plan to run the stores and they dont value there employes....
bad,Manager was the worst person to work for. It didn’t matter how much work you did it was never good enough for her. She always talked about all the people that worked for her and started drama between employees. Their was no way you could let her know if something was wrong because she would say you weren’t a great worker either. Even the district manager was pretty much the same way.
bad,"This company has a lot to offer to management not so much the employees. They’re aren’t really any hours. They’re are 7 days in a week , you’re only scheduled for two days out of 7 it is hard to make ends meet with slow money. Over a course of two weeks a cashier will only average to $240.00 of of two days of work. Not the job for me."
bad,I don’t have anything to say at this time. I have voiced my feelings and opinion with this company and with management and how we as store managers were treated
bad,"Typical day at family dollar was stressful with no time at all for my family. I was working as a manager, and I my district manager at the time told me that I had to wait to hire another assistant manager until out payroll budget went back up, and I was working everyday from open to close almost."
bad,I dont regret working with this company because of the experience i gained for working there but the company could not care less about thier employees
bad,The pay was ok. The people I worked with where ok. But corporate made a lot of demands of us that where impossible to uphold with the low number of employees we had.
bad,"The store manager is disrespectful, rude and doesn't work a lot she smoke weed and go back and forth outside. She doesn't give breaks or lunch breaks. Doesn't help with the lines or nothing"
bad,Not a place to work you have to prevent theft and keep store next to no help no water mouse to you have to bring you own food you will never have to to eat
bad,"Very long hours, unpaid...  Sacrifices made go unseen.  A lot of Hostile Work Environments, and favoritism. Store Management is left not with a lot of hours or personnel to achieve set goals.  The Training and Development in old and very minimal."
bad,Easy tasks such as stocking and cleaning up the store. Depending on location it's not worth the check. They want u to work extra hard for a 25 cent raise
bad,"Due to the location, turn over rate was high.  Went through multiple mangers to the point I quit.  Stealing was an issue but accepted by the district manager.  Hardly no one would work, two people per shift.  Having to take breaks but ended up back on the register clocked out because no one was there to help."
bad,"I was a Store manager.  I worked 7 days a week,  12+ hours a day.  No payroll.  I did this for 6 months. My health  started to fail,  I was killing myself. VP showed up declared my  store rough, and that was it for me.  The place was a dump when I started."
bad,The store is constantly robbed at gunpoint and they refuse to hire security. NOPD patrols when they want and sit there for a little while. The security company they partner with (Interface) doesn't come when you call them. Either the video or sound or both are broken for their security cameras and hey take forever to come fix. The store manager steals money from the store and when brought to higher authority WITH ALL EVIDENCE (including security footage) nothing is done. Just so happens that everyone involved in the situation including the associates drawer that was stolen from gets fired. And anyone who catches him gets fired or transferred to another store. Then you are underpaid for all of the work that you do. And if you don't pay attention to your paychecks and whether you get hired as full time or part time they'll pay you the incorrect amount or have you working full time hours with part time pay and benefits.
bad,Don't care about employees or the problems they report. Dishonest managers. Not to flexible with schedule and only offer PT time unless promoted into management
bad,Company has room for improvement in sales as well as customer appreciation and should be better to their workers about their pay and compensation. Also should rotate holidays
bad,I hate it here.Management is horrible. The pay is horrible. Co workers are the only plus. Home office does not communicate with their  employees everything is done by voicemail
bad,"FD was much better to work for before Dollar Tree bought the company. The overall feeling for most employees now is be 100% or you’re fired (I had 15 years) was short handed for more than 30 days and was terminated for store conditions and our store looked better than half (15 stores) of the district. District manager gave no help but expected the store manager to work 60 plus hours per week, if you didn’t conform, you were gone."
bad,They only pay for two holidays Christmas and Easter and the store is open every holiday and they pay the men more than woman also over worked and under paid
bad,The Company has really bad culture. District Managers have to Manage down and do the Store Managers job because the majority of the managers their do not have the leadership nor the business acumen to run the Stores.
bad,"Family Dollar doesn't care about their employees or their safety!!! "
bad,"There is nothing good about working here use this job only as a pay check until you get a better offer.  Management could not care less about you.  You are seen only as  "
bad,Typical day was me coming in as the night closing assistance manager and the day crew had nothing done except write ME and my cashier a laundry list to do. MGt was always breaking company policy and laughing about it. I am pretty sure everyone in that store was a theif.... This was the most UNPROFESIONAL ASSISTANT MANAGER job I have ever had...
bad,The job was not good at all. Being a cashier was very hard and stressful when you have most of your customers stealing right in front of you. And dont get robbed at family dollar they treat you like your are a no one and dont offer any mental help. Do not recommend working or shopping at family dollar.
bad,"Working at Family Dollar taught me how to work on a computer, make sure the store was cleaned and items were placed in their right area, and how to count money."
bad,"I start off as an Cashier and worked up to Manager, very long and hard process. Long hours again upper management is terrible no good leadership at all. It"
bad,"If anything in your life changes they are more than quick to replace you. Also if you are not part of clicks then you are forced out through favoritism, cut back to no hours at all and not being honest. Its ashame, poor management makes a bad workplace."
bad,"Worse job ever. Poor management. No care or concern for their employees, under paid, etc  unprofessional work environment, cheated out all overtime hours worked, no hours for overtime, coached for overtime etc"
bad,"I would come in open the store, run the register, clean, put up merchandise, count the drawer, close the store, clean the parking lot, the worst part of the day was counting the drawer and the schedule was always awful and the manager and management was awful in general"
bad,Might depend on the area you live at or management but it can be pretty overwhelming all the extra stuff you need to do to fulfill people’s expectations at this job for minimum wage
bad,I Tiajah Blanche like the fast pace at family dollar and working as a cashier and Stocking but the pay was not reasonable the managers was not respectful or they didn't take care good employees.The customer service was not so good at all.
bad,At first it started out like every work place. It was ok. Then the level of stress was raised because of the time crunch you are on to get the tremendous amount of work done. Then they want you to perform high. On top of that your supposed to follow people around the store you think are stealing. I didnt have time to do that since I had a bunch of work. But the last straw was getting robbed at gun point and not getting a few days off to recover.
bad,I would recommend this job because you want make a lot of money and the hours are crazy open to close staying on your feet that long is crazy and management has their pick and choose
bad,Not a good place to work at. U can't  see your  customers  when they walk in because you have to stock the entire shift. Terrible management  as well.
bad,The people that own the company thinks that you're stealing even if you have thieves coming in stealing items. Rude customers. Manager's will not help you out. Assistant manager's are lazy and don't want to work. You have to be security guard as a cashier a stocker and a lot more with little pay. They also will overwork you without showing any appreciation
bad,I would only work here for a part-time job. Definitely wouldn't manage a store again. Customer Service Rep/Cashier only. Family Dollar needs to give its stores a bigger budget for employee hours. Family Dollar should also always have security in all store locations!
bad,But when I heard my manager tell a customer not to touch his women which he was talking about me made me uncomfortable to work around him anymore. When u look at your job and people u work with as family but find out your boss likes u more then u thought it's a stressful situation that I wanted no part of.
bad,The manager I had while working at family dollar she was and is very rude and disrespectful and always stayed on her phone & she don't do drug screens
bad,"Very disorganized and messy place to work. They have no benefits, the pay doesn’t add up for all of the work they want you to do, upper management does not care about the work conditions all they want is money."
bad,I had three police reports on a man who was stealing he pushed me the first time other times was threatening me I lost my job because I defended my self
bad,This store was actually a dollar tree store. Very poor management and this store is dirty. There is a very good reason that most of the people in the area call it ghetto tree and refuse to shop there even if they can save money.
bad,"Huge turnover.  3% yearly raises.  Demands OT work, off the clock.  Unloading 1200 piece trucks...alone.  Workmans comp - immediate denials.  Denied benefits after corporate postcard had wrong website address on it - no corporate apology, just an OH WELL statement given to me.  If.  Just run."
bad,"Could be a passable work environment but potential is negated by inexperienced non-interpersonal trained in-store and field leadership staff."
bad,"Unsafe environment, not enough employees to work such a large store, management is required to do too much for a minimum amount of pay. Not properly trained"
bad,"This is one company that creates the illusion that they care about their employees, by encouraging their employees to care about their customers, when actuality they don't care.  Which is why the employees are disgruntled and disrespectful most of the time.  Assistant store managers get knocked around by store managers and are blamed for their mistakes. While store staff is disrespectful.  But SM doesn't always reprimand because they're afraid to due to short staffing conditions. "
bad,"Store MGR is 500# lazy,gossips,liar,very bad body odor& has the DM blindfolded.MGR paid most&assistants do all the work!gets bonus& assistants don't!!"
bad,Managers stayed into it with assistant managers nobody like to work together and always in competition.... I informed manager I got a better paying job she didn’t speak to me my last two weeks working for family dollar... At least I finished my two weeks NEVER AGAIN
bad,"At first I really enjoyed working for the Family Dollar, but then I started having to work 12 hr shifts and sometimes split shifts and missed out on a lot with my family and kids."
bad,Regional managers and people off site rule over you. Cut your hours without telling you and put a stranglehold on how efficent you can be. There business model of trying to hire 3 or 4 people and work them all the part time minnimum while the store manager is worked to death it's a terrible way to try and save a few bucks. Never want to work at another one of these stores ever again.
bad,They hire people who have no manager background to come in and run the store into the ground. They stay getting robbed and they don't care about your life
bad,"management is a total joke. the managers are the ones who are leaving early every day, leaving their employees alone, or outside smoking cigarettes with customers. none of the staff is supported. employees who work the hardest for the company mean absolutely nothing compared to favoritism. all around unprofessional company."
bad,Don’t work here! They have bout they money! No breaks and if you do take one you can’t leave the building and you basically have to still work if the cashier need help because you Oney have 2 people on shift!
bad,Family dollar is for the birds. The pay and hours suck. They don't have any hours but are always hiring. Don't work there..They treat employees badly.
bad,Its been a long time since I worked there. But it can sometimes be understaffed and you sometimes receive truck by yourself.  It's a no tolerance place to work
bad,"Being a manager was great at first. I learned alot. But over the years of turnover it got so bad. My crew and I had a nice store. Looked good my numbers were good. But when we needed help from the Corp. Office it got bad.. they do not care one bit for their employees.  I got so stressed ,and almost had a stroke I quit on them. I loved my crew and I love my customers.  And my store. But like I said corp treats you so so bad."
bad,Typical greedy company that wants you to work yourself to death but doesn't want to pay you properly. The areas that these stores are in are some of the worst and the customers reflect that. Don't count on a raise or appreciation. Lots of robberies and no regard for employee safety.
bad,They are unproffesional. Management cussing on the floor no water or cups for employee there break room is a small table in backroom in corner all blicked off by freight. They have all there emergency exits blocked to the ceiling wirh totes. No one explains anything to you but the no water if you have yout own cup u have to get water frpm bathroom sink is disgusting. Its hot in there and they have me do stuff off the clock. They never fixed my time the other day worked off clock whole day tell me to do stuff off the clock.
bad,"If you lie, backstab, smell (physically), have a record for retail thief, you will be promoted in this company.  (Be sure to be unprofessional by running away from customers you don't like) "
bad,"Unfair, untrustworthy, no control and above all no consideration. "
bad,"Never fully staffed so expect to be overworked. "
bad,the company is ok just need to treat there peoples better and not try to use there peoples so much that they don't want to come in it also be a lot of call out
bad,This work environment wasn’t very professional. Very poor leadership and guidance. Working here was mostly a nightmare. My company failed me and fellow coworkers. My boss became lazy and very unprofessional! He has lost all motivation to work and participate in helping with the store. I worked here for almost two years and not once has anyone recognized me for my hard work or accomplishments.
bad,Good place to work if you don't have kids. They make sure you received your hours. Alot changed when they changed owners.  Need better management.  Overall it's an ok job.
bad,"Family Dollar as a whole is a horrible company to work for!  They are like slave drivers!  They expect way to much for the very low pay.  They’re constantly being robbed and people are running in the store , filling garbage cans or baskets full of merchandise and just ramming through the door with it!   Family Dollar will not provide security to make the employees feel safe and they’re consistently speaking to managers and assistant managers in the most disrespectful way!  It’s absolutely unnecessary and should not be tolerated... period!  I do not ever want to work for them again.  Its too stressful and just not worth the safety risks."
bad,The job is essentially four jobs in one. You are expected to do pretty much everything including being security for minimum wage. Management is dificult to work with and just all around questionable.
bad,"I worked for Family Dollar as a SM zero life outside work. Super low payroll,expect the impossible. Worst company I've worked for. Don't suggest working here."
bad,"While working at family dollar,I didn't have the best of times there. work load wasn't balanced enough for certain people. Management was lacking terribly. Almost as if they did not care about doing their jobs. I would not work here unless you have no other choice in the manner. McDonalds might actually be a better place."
bad,Employees were trained properly store manager doesn't show up for work puts all the burden on the assistant managers and cashiers not a job that would be recommended for someone looking to advance in a career
bad,"Tough place to work as a manager with strict payroll for scheduling. The company needs to invest in its security cameras, many stores had outdated systems."
bad,Don’t make this job your only resort there are better jobs the pay is really poor especially if you’re paying for rent then I don’t recommend this job
bad,Not really much to say about this particular location to be honest....it was not organized about a month on half of me being there the manager retired because some of the employees but that is nor here or there....then before i was gone the assignment manager was stealing
bad,"A typical day would be stressful, having endless freight to put away, not having enough help to get it done, usually working 60 to 90 hours a week to get things done. The people I worked with made the job fun and bearable to get through each day. The District Manager, Regional Manager were terrible leaders."
bad,I was not paid what i was promised and when i called higher up a week later i was accused and suspended about a rule i was never told at all. They work you so much with no help
bad,"I would never work there again, the boss was horrible, they got robbed entirely to much and the last time We got robbed the boss was only worried about the money."
bad,"As a FD manager, you are given no payroll hours an end up with only one person in the store 4-6 hours per day and still expected to get everything done. Working 80+ hours out of necessity to run the store, and get nothing in return but criticism."
bad,"When promoted to store manager, I was told that at most I would be working 48-50 hours per week with Sundays off, and the potential for another day off during the week. I was expected to work 70+ hours with no day off for weeks on end. When staffing falls short the district manager failed to come out for interviews, which left me severely short staffed and forced to work open to close for three weeks in a row. When other nearby stores required help with trucks and staffing, I was forced to help them despite my already 70+ hour work weeks, but other stores were not asked to help me when I was short staffed or needed assistance."
bad,"Very low pay. You often have to work without employee's which is nearly impossible when you have to put away truck, check in orders and check out customers at the register. Working here was terrible."
bad,Very rude management. Cannot keep cashiers. Managers have no idea what they’re doing. Really unorganized and messy. When busy they would yell at me when I tried helping other cashier. Lazy.
bad,Poor management. They don’t care about you or your well being they are very disrespectful. No professionalism at all... I’ve never worked for. Company this horrible in my life
bad,They constantly cut your hours and want you to do the same work they didn't care about the workers safety I was an ASM I worked by myself opening and closing only time I really got help was on truck day my store manager quit do the district manager bring his friend in to be the new store manager and asked me to train him  that was the last straw for me plus the store was so nasty in and outside
bad,Family Dollar need to be more passionate about there employees and give more incentive. Also the DM and HR Dept has to care about the employees when it comes to pay promise. And ensuring that everyone has a quality of life.
bad,"Corporate and management are very unprofessional and very disrespectful, store managers borrow money from the safe, corporate will frequently leave all family dollars in district with no bags, honestly worst job I ever had."
bad,"Family Dollar was a temporary job that got me through to my career education as an electrician. I did not enjoy working there, but it was better than being unemployed."
bad,Family Dollar could not appreciate the employee. They take advantage of you. Don't want to pay good but want to work you into the ground. Outrageously
bad,Do not care about their employees. Bad manager. Never get breaks. Never paid for over time. Rude customers. No public restrooms causing others to suffer which isn't right
bad,"I was one of the luck ones that were hired at a good (even higher than my district manager) but each store gets a payroll and the more you make the less everyone has to make or work. I worked on average 65-80 hours per week 7 days a week,"
bad,I wouldn't work there again. The pay is terrible and they expect you to practically kill yourself on the job but don't offer any type of pay raise even though they say they do after 6 months.
bad,The most enjoyable part of working for Family Dollar was helping the customers. I also enjoyed stocking the sales floor and even checking in my favorite vendors
bad,"Where do I begin... I spent almost 7 years with the company, slowly moving up the retail ladder. They'll keep you motivated with false promises of pay and store budget increases. Most stores have very few employees and lack the budget to hire more, or increase pay for current employees (Even though corporate will tell you that your budget will increase to accommodate such, it won't) Company handbook also states that any employee receiving 2 consecutive reviews of ""excellent"" or higher will receive a pay increase, but they won't. District managers and corporate spend the majority of their time hassling stores about their lack of sales, and extremely high losses; without actually doing anything to increase the store's security or taking any steps to fix the issues. Your hours may be sporadic; ASM's can vary from 30-40hrs on a weekly basis, with store managers averaging 60+."
bad,"Company demands that the managers work a minimum of 52 hours when they expect you to work 60-70 hours. Upper management, incompetent and out of touch."
bad,"Super stressful, the store manager always treating employees poorly, too much work, sacrifices and had no life while working there.. all for nothing,  they still treated you like you are nothing. The pressure, stress i felt like i was getting emotionally and mentally mistreated. 2 years being an employee of this company, I don’t know how i did it honestly."
bad,"The Ardmore,OK Family Dollar district is diffferent from any other district that I worked for. I started in Lawton, OK and relocated to the Ardmore, OK district. The Ardmore location has not had a consistent Store Manager since I began working there 8 months  ago. There has been three Store Managers which all have quit within a month's time. The District Manager does not interact with employees and therefore questions involving the store operations go unanswered. Also there has  been at least 7 regular employees, i.e.cashiers, Managers, stockers and Assistant Managers that quit due to mismanagement or mistreatment f rom the District Management. There were several complaints from employees and customer regarding the store's appearances and having only one employee per shift working. No solutions are in affect at this time."
bad,"Safety was not a priority associates often work alone, as well as taking deposits to bank in own vehicle with no compensation. Schedules are given out at the last minute and there are no benefits to associated unless you are at managers level. Communication between store manager and associates a bare minimum. We are not allowed to make decisions daily at the store I was employed at and opinions were no appreciated. Associates are underpaid and overworked."
bad,This job is under paid and over worked only a teenager or a very desperate person should work here even as management it's unorganized. This place is not a place someone should work that wants professional training .
bad,"Huge turn over rate, low wages for the work. Very long days & work is hard on your body. No family life time due to never knowing how late you work. Co-workers very rude, a lot of drama.. have to work every holiday. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you have no life!"
bad,I've never worked at a company that has little to no communication. The current manager is very rude and disrespectful causing our location to have a high turnover rate.
bad,They don't allow the managers to work the employees like they need because they give you a really low budget for payroll and expect everything to happen
bad,"Honestly, overtime I began to hate my job. Whenever I hurt my foot and got placed on medical leave because employees are not allowed to work in the workplace with medical boots on, a lot of things against me started happening even though I wasn't at work. Once an employee becomes a liability they do all that they can to push them out the door."
bad,This is one of the worst jobs I ever had in my life. Stores are not clean. Company does not care about their employees. Company will always have an high turnover rate due to low pay and unprofessionalism and lack of support from upper management.
bad,"I learned that the harder you worked and the more pride you took in your preformance in the meant to little to corporate, I was willing to cover any shift at any time with little or no notice, drove 80 miles on way to work everyday just to be terminated after being bullied n forced to sign statement that i was forced to write word for word as they dictated it by a higher level executive. After made to cry by being put down, belittled, discriminated against, n just bullied by this person."
bad,"Family dollar play favortism "
bad,"ok place to work , I was able to move up fairly quickly and pay was ok but the hours were long and the work load was over rated. Its a good place for a college student or high school student to work"
bad,They did not train me to be a proper assistant manager and they dont care about any issues you have with the problems inside their company. I wish they would have had better management.
bad,"It was very hard to work at dollar general, you are required to get the truck down within 2 days with very little help. Most days I was there by myself until 4-5 in the evening due to the lack of labor hours. we only had 4 employees the store manager, 2 assistant managers and 1 associate. The pay was not competitive among other businesses in the area and if you were part time you only got 12 - 15 hours a week. As a full time employee there were weeks where I was only scheduled 20 hours and then there were some I worked 60 hours."
bad,"Had a lot of expirience.good team work i was a assistant maneger and it was a good oportunity to learn new things and to know more about the store,i had a lot of experience."
bad,"A typical day is unloading and processing the truck, servicing the customers, opening and responding to emails.Very fast pace constantly moving around,little to no coverage and very little time to process the truck."
bad,Work the heck out of there managers without decent compensation. The manager does at least 60 to 70% of the work. The pay is not worth it. You have absolutely no personal life at at all
bad,"very disfuction , assistant manger running over the hiring manger .. they couldn't count draws right mangers was never on time to open in the morning . Only had 2 cashiers outta a whole crew team ."
bad,"i'd go in to do my job as well as my coworkers but when we had to communicate with the manager he wouldn't really care. we got robbed twice and the manager didn't bother showing up to see if we were okay, instead he blamed us for it happening. over all its poor management and its not a safe place to work at."
bad,"Store manager and assistant managers set you up to fail.  You can do more than is asked if you and the manager still won't be happy.  Most customers were rude.  Alot of times you would work 5-6 hours by yourself.  So you couldn't take a bathroom break, stop theft and it was unsafe.  Started out at 38 hours a week and it was cut down to 25 hours a week.  Manager treated you like dirt.  Yelled at employees in front of customers.  Managers train you one way.  When you work as they trained you to work, it wasn't the correct way to do the tasks."
bad,Family Dollar was poor to work for because the management was poor and the scheduling wasn’t prepared in a timely manner. The training online was rushed by management and learning the policy and procedures we’re rushed.
bad,The review summary description speaks for itself. Management insists on open availability for scheduling and then only schedules under 40 hours for full timers. 32-36 hours a week is full time.
bad,"Family Dollar is the worse company I ever had to work for and I haven't worked many places. They over work you and under pay you. I was a part-time assistant manager. I work full time hours or more. The store was always understaffed. No one wanted to stay. You have lots of people that get hired and do no call no shows. I never did that. I was always early. I worked earlier then I had to and longer then I had to all this company cares about is the bottom line. What can I do for them. I come in on my days off and it never mattered it never was enough. I admit I never got everything done I was told too. When you are on register and told to do other stuff it impossible to do. This company needs to learn that not all it stores run the same. Little stores can get stuff done but this is a bigger store and needs more people that it has and better pay. Lastly the one person that is to blame is Staurt Sivak. He is the worse District Manager I ever known. All he does is complain and complain. I can't count how many times this store been #1 in the district and not one word. He treats this district like it the army. It the chain of command. If he had a problem he reports it to the manager and then the manager tells you. They tried to fire me months ago because of low transaction. You can't force people to buy a certain amount if things to satisfy there bottom line. He a bully and a jerk. That store since I started there in December 22, 2016 has been through 3 managers. He was never satisfied with the first two I worked for and the new manager unless things change will not do any better."
bad,A company that don't care about it's employee's. Just care about making money and working their employee's as slaves to get it. A horrible company to work for.
bad,"No advancement, No paid time off, No vacations, Long  (more than 12) hour work days. Lack of management, No flexibility for anything, The one i worked at had been robbed alot."
bad,It's a ok job but when u have kids and bills you have to pay that job is not going to be worth your time. The everyday things where ok with me as long as everyone did there part be when they don't the hole store will be behind.
bad,"This company was not a good fit for me. I did not like the working environment, lack of needed associates on the floor. However, the stating pay and raises where higher than other average."
bad,I enjoyed working for family dollar until i transferred.then discovered at the new location i went to was about favortism and singling out employees. And being treated unfairly.
bad,"very busy non stop activity for mangers,1 day off work 60 to 70 hours a week so no work/life balance you have to be really into the job and not the family to work there"
bad,"Didn't like working there. Not enough pay, not enough hours. Thank God I don't have children. Poor management, ratchet customers. No room for advancement."
bad,the store manager didn't do anything they would give all work to an assistant manager to do and constantly would complain about costumers. we would have the pest control come in constantly to get rid of rats and roaches and half the time we would have to carry out dead rats in trash bags.
bad,"Recently purchased by Dollar Tree. No communications with employees. Low pay, tons of work, ridiculous deadlines. Company culture has changed. No longer pro-active very reactive everything is an emergency"
bad,A typical work day would include cleaning behind the cash register and around the store.The hardest part of the job would be it's little teamwork. Everybody feels for themselves at times.
bad,The job isn't for everyone. It is fast paced and was definitely a working experience. It requires a lot of time away from family.The best part of the job is getting to meet a lot of people.
bad,"The word Family should not be associated with this business! They will work employees until they are ready to drop.  Weeks with no days off , no help and running a store with no employees."
bad,"Not a nice place to work, many times there was no payroll and I had to work the store alone. The hours were long and the part about being alone in the store I worked at wasn't for me."
bad,Awful place to work. You are expected to do the work of 4 employees because Family Dollar will not give you the payroll to have more than one or two in the store at a time. Corporate and DM have unrealistic expectations on what you can get done in an average workday.
bad,pack out ring up customers make sure the store is neat clean up assist customers make sure work area is clean watch out for shop lifters communicate with staff
bad,Bosses Do not know how to manage the team they are rude and do not appricate hard workers and like to make you do other deparment when you are done with your work
bad,"I started working there because I needed a source of income. I don't know how I lasted as long as I did. My biggest issue with this company was that there were never enough people to work. If you worked more than 8 hrs, you did not get a break or a lunch. There is no room for growth at all. I was told on many occasions that I would be able to move up, but never did. It didn't matter how hard you worked or pushed yourself, it was never good enough. My suggestion would be to stay away unless you just need the money. Management was the worst. There is no communication and you got yelled at for things you didn't know about."
bad,"ASM''S get no respect, backbone of operations yet pay is below industry standard and hours fluctuate. High turnover rate not enough training being provided to new employees. Slow moving stores are usually single staffed by single manager 4-8 hours daily."
bad,"On truck days we get an excessive amount of freight with only two people to unload. This company wants their low ranked staff to unload their truck in a certain amount of time with only two people. For example, two people unloading 1800 boxes are should be done in 2-3 hours. It cannot be done in that amount of time if our stockroom is smaller than our shipment. Family Dollar doesn't want to give stores enough hours on payroll to have more staff so we can handle the unnecessary freight we get every week. It is unfair for District Managers, as well as their bosses, to come to stores on trucks or a day after to come complain about boxes on the sales floor when we can't put anything else in the stockroom. There are lots of people quitting this company for the same reasons that I am stating right now. This company needs to do a lot better."
bad,The people at this job were consumed by drama on a day to day basis. Management were unprofessional when it came to employees and customers and security was more concerned with other activities that were their job.
bad,"This company is the worse company thus far, i have ever worked for"
bad,Family dollar is a good starting out job. I don't recommend going into management with this company. They expect a lot out of you without giving you the proper tools to completely do your job completely and correctly in a timely manner.
bad,I had worked for this company for several years and have nothing to show with all of the work that was put in from myself and other employees. Its great for part time workers. Unfortunately if you plan on having a life and working here don't take any full time position.
bad,"The job was okay, wasn't very demanding. Poor upper management, left a lot of things out. Very poor training and hardly enough input. Was hired and ""trained"" for two days then left to figure the rest out on my own. Never enough hours or people to be scheduled to get the very basics of the job done. Was given an hour to get threes worth of work done."
bad,"I did not like working here at all, the customers were very rude in this location, in the 6 months i had work there I had 3 different managers, its a very unsteady place, we werent aloud certain days off, and we were open every holiday including christmas"
bad,"Fast paced work environment, continuously doing many tasks at a time, good customer service and accurate cash handling a priority, stocking products to the sales floor in between taking care of customers, cleaning and recovering the store at the end of the workshift,"
bad,If I had to do it again I wouldn't work for this company. Everything about the company is bad and the culture is horrible and very unprofessional.
bad,"under paid and not appreciated the managers talk to you and treat you badly. I was sexually harassed and when tried to make a complaint to upper management, but was never responded to."
bad,worst job i ever had very disorderly how they handle money to there polices i did not work here for long and would not again
bad,"Very inconsiderate work environment with very poor management and leadership. I went from 20 hours a week to 16 a week, only working the truck unloading between 1900-2400 pieces of material, which is not what I applied for. My co-worker are inconsistent but hold good conversation."
bad,"I love my Job ,I love working w people getting to know people, the manager is great the co workers are great, the hours are good,i have. No problems with my job"
bad,Worst place i have EVER worked. Management was racist and rude. The store manager would yell and kick out any black or mexican child that came into the store. This job showed me alot of restraint and keeping my mouth closed. Everyone they would hire would quit with in a month or so due to poor management. The hardest part of the job was having to apologize to customers on behalf of the managements rude remarks.
bad,"Upper management turns blind eye to obvious problems (mold in store,store burglarized and no proactive action taken to even repair broken doors,previous manager  creted atmosphere of favoritism ,good workers were ridiculed ineffective associates praised. I was pyt in a position to clean up past problems without support of upper management."
bad,"Management strategy is burn em and turn em. Burn out managers, assistants, and clerks and then hire new employees. Refuse to understand actual needs of individual stores to be successful and function at a high level, instead opting to provide as little resources and support as possible and then condemn staff for not being able to meet impossible goals."
bad,working at family dollar drained me they did not appreciate all the work we do for them. the hours are horrible and the compensation is a joke. if you are a high school student trying to work for  the summer this is the right but if you are a grown up this is not for you.
bad,Over worked and under paid for the work that a Store Manager does. 60+ hours a week and they expect you there that much for 900.00 a week.
bad,I worked at Familly Dollar for almost a year and I half was promoted to assistant within the first few months of being there. I was there long enough to realize my store manager did not care she never did a drug screen on anyone because for the most part she hired people that would leave in the middle of the day and go smoke weed with her leaving little to no people in the store for production which resulted in our store ALWAYS being behind. When upper management would come in and ask why the store was this way she would always claim that she couldn't get anyone to work. If you're not part of her little weed smoking getting drunk every night group then you were usually disrespected by them which is ultimately the reason I left the company. So in all you work tons of hours as an assistant with no lunch or breaks for a weak paycheck people under you are rude and disrespectful and your store manager doesn't care
bad,"The hardest part of family dollar is management. It is hard to work for a company that does not care about your safety. The job itself, as well as the customers, are bearable. The management of this company has a poor response timing when there are problems."
bad,I enjoyed dealing with the customers daily but to be completely honest I could not stand working for Family Dollar. I did 95% of the work and was given no recognition for any of it
bad,"They say when you leave a job it is because of the people not the company.  At Family Dollar, it will be because of the both.   The people are what make the company; and that is not a good thing.  It is not an advantageous place to work.  Management lacks the backbone to support its employees; the direction that is given is not well thought out or clear.  You will consistently be redoing projects that are assigned due to the lack of leadership’s ability to communicate effectively and think through what it is that is being asked.  There will be numerous occasions when you will be given direction that you will execute and then when questioned, you will not have the support of management even though what was completed was (a) at their direction and (b) reviewed with them leaving you to be out on your own.  There is a claim that experienced employees are desired but in reality every individual that has experience leaves very quickly as they are knowledgeable about how planning should be done and the relationship that should exist between the merchant and planning organizations.  There is a discord and disconnect between the merchant and planning organizations.  And do not expect support from your planning organization or management if there is the least about of push back by the merchant organization.  I look forward to the day that I can leave this company and find one that truly supports and engages its employees."
bad,"A typical day at work would be the back of trailer in the hot sun loading and unloading the trucks all day, management is very unprofessional."
bad,"As a Store Manager for this company you are hired in and told 50 hours weekly is your expected hours to work. However in a very short while of being there and observing the payroll you are handed to operate a location you discover that 75 hours will be around the average you will work per week if not more to maintain the payroll expectations you are given which are unrealistic to operate a location with. District Management pushes and pushes for more from there managers that try and the managers that don't try are somehow the manager's that enjoy their jobs most because whatever they do or not do more so not do is never reprimanded. Work, life balance is non existent as a store manager who cares you are expected to live so to speak in the location which on average equals 14 hours daily or sometimes more! Overall very exhausting and no matter what you do or how much you give it isn't enough."
bad,"Hard on employees, always have a minimal crew. hard to help customers and take care of the store at the same time."
bad,when i first started at family dollar i thought i was going to be a great company. boy was i wrong i got bounced around between three different stores with all horrible upper management who had there favorite employees that could get away with murder basically. i had a co manager with me that would steal product and money fro the company and would blame it on cashiers or other co management he was rude and would  try to come on to younger employed women at the company.
bad,They don't treat the employees right and walk all over them. No advancements unless you are a favorite. Never willing to cross train but certain people.
bad,"I have not been here long and will not return. This place is horrible. The managers send you out first at night to makes sure you don't get robbed before they leave. They treat all employees as though they are dishonest. You are expected to stock half the store, wait on customers at the register, stop thieves, clean, and work with no breaks. They pay very little and expect you to move the world. Work at other stores and get paid better for doing ONE person's job instead of 3. Management also complains when you do over 2k in sales in a 3 hour period but don't have time to stock the shelves that are located in the back of the store. there is no security at the stores and people steal a bunch of items but the company will not give you security cameras in order to help watch the store. You only have 1 or 2 people on a shift except truck day. You cannot even ring up a customer for a visa gift card with out management, this is because ALL employees are thieves and I guess we will activate the cards without having the money or because someone called on the phone. REALLY! They harass you on your days off to come in and work and when you don't answer the phone, on your day off, they yell at you because you didn't come in. You work 10+ hours without a break or if your lucky only 30 minutes. They want you to work 7 1/2 hours without a break at all and if you have to use the restroom, good luck getting management to cover the register so you can go. When they do they complain because you took so long. Find a job elsewhere. 7.25 an hour is not worth this job. They also want you to push sell"
bad,"Family Dollar is a terrible place to work! There is no such thing as a work / life balance with this company! Store managers work upwards of 70 hours per week & are paid for 52 because they're salary. If someone calls in, the SM is required to stay and cover that shift if no one else can be found to do so, and there is rarely someone else available to do so. I worked in a town with 3 stores on the same road only a few miles apart and one of them was a training store with a Store Manager and 3 assistant managers, and they rarely went to another store to help out. If they did, all they did was stand at the register and talk badly about the store they were ""helping"" out. Managers work open to close shifts all the time and a lot of the time they are alone for 6 or more hours a day but are still expected to process freight, provide excellent customer service, & keep the store neat and orderly. No one should work at Family Dollar, they appreciate nothing!"
bad,Too many managers coming and going.  The position asks quite a bit of one person for the short amount of time you were scheduled per shift.
bad,"I  was working for people who felt no who delt with the personal feelings of the younger men that was working for the company, I believe in doing what  the company has asked of me. I feel working for this company will be not only keep me in the real part of what the company want and not to please people I work with."
bad,"You work long hours no breaks, where you have three managers and only a total of four workers. The hardest part of the job was being treated like I was a lesser. One enjoyable thing was all the customers."
bad,"I've been a manager for Family Dollar for just under 3 months and now am looking for another job. The stores are built in ghettos and mine has a serious mouse problem that no one really cares about. the customers suck and are rude and you never catch up with anything. The real name is ""Family Bottom Dollar"" because that's all they care about."
bad,"It was a nice work place but the management in that district is horrible. I wouldn't work there again,but it was a nice learning experience."
bad,"Where do I start! Unorganized, Unprofessionalism...It's sad to say that this was the most uncanny job I've had and I've been employed since I was 16 years old....The customers were always right and always rude...The staff were sometimes outright disrespectful and rude when it came to the costumers and sometimes other staff. A lot of gossip and other things that I would like to forget about"
bad,As a Store manager you are the stock man and the cashier and everything that it takes to run a store. You unload the trucks and you stock the merchandise.
bad,"I had the displeasure of working in a ""new"" Family Dollar that was virtually trashed by customers and not taken care of by lazy staff within a month. The two-faced District Manager hired this slob of a manager with zero people skills to ""run"" the store, but mostly had a bad attitude. When the District Manager ""suddenly"" left, so did she. Good riddance to both of you! Customers were downright rude, aggressive, loud, and filthy. We had some good store staff, but mostly lazy, inept ones."
bad,"It was very unprofessional, unstable work environment."
bad,As a manager there they throw you at first is an good weekly salary; until you get there and break down your hourly pay. you will find you are making less then minimum wage. if you hit the glass ceiling they will start to take resources away to get you out and a cheaper manager in.
bad,Wasnt to bad but you dont get no breaks for tnothing in that sort even if you work 9 hours a day
bad,Upper management does not care about their employee's. They work you like a dog!!!! Store level management is fine because they are in the same boat.
bad,full of drama in the work place. no equal opportunities or fairness
bad,"My first week on the job while training I was left in the store completely alone for a prolonged period of time, so my manager could go buy cigarettes down the road."
bad,"Not recommended for anyone desiring healthy work life/home life balance. Acceptance of the position is consent to working long hours, several days in a row, few breaks, and little compensation. The sales team as a whole has low morale due to poor management beyond the store level. they are required to work way beyond their training level and pay grade. Opportunity for advancement is good although an advanced position places unrealistic demands on the employees physically, mentally, and emotionally."
bad,"You start at minimum wage, the only way you will receive a raise is if you're lucky or if you worked a full year AND received a great inventory score.  They generally try to promote the most desperate workers, so they can control them at will. (i.e people with children and need money). Honest promotions are a bit harder(I got lucky).  If they can't control you, they try to get rid of you."
bad,"I worked 101 hours a week, two weeks after having a child via c-section. Refused to have help to cover shifts, Not enough hours so I had to work triple to make it work and was still behind on duties. District managers are very unhelpful, making you a work horse."
bad,"assistant manager lies on other employees to make her self look good. She is also dating a cashier that is against company rules but nobody seems to care. I requested an harassment investigation with HR and have heard nothing. I have also taking out harassment papers on her with the Sheirf dept because she accused me of messing up the store. There is a lot of discrimination going on in this store and nobody seems to care!!!!!! Do not get a job in the Garland, NC location!"
bad,"As a Assistant Manager worked hard, with no breaks had to work crazy hours such as close a night and open the prior morning.Store Manager unreliable would come to work late or forget own schedule.Unload truck and put up stock and required to  unload truck at a rate, per pieces according to company policy.Bad Management overall, no employee discount, all employee's expected to be a thief, unsafe environment,no support,and pay is minimum wages,lot of turnovers."
bad,"If you have any management experience this is not the company for you!! They defey normal management rules , terrible to work with , unless you have no experience in this field then you can embrace the madness they call apple seed"
bad,it really is not a good company to work for they treat the staff like slaves the manager is lazy the asst. managers do all her work while she sits in the office and plays games on her phone or shes talking on the phone and its not work realated  and the DM is her best friend the company still owes me my vaca time that i earned
bad,You work all day long and it still looks like nothing was done. That is because you are the only one doing anything at all. Because you only have one other employee in the store with you. 
bad,"Typical day entails stocking shelves, greeting every customer that walks through the door, recovering the store every night, asset protection, and providing quality customer service for the most part."
bad,"A typical work day consissted of just myself and possibly one cashier. The store manager would come in and torment me until I cried several times a week. He often made comments such as "" I don't like to hire black people"" and ""I don't know why that deaf girl wasted my time applying here, what is she supposed to do stand and stare at customers."" Once he found out my boyfriend was black his tormenting became worse. He only hired women. My many complaints to upper level management were all ignored and treated as jokes. Training at this company is a joke. Assistant managers weren't alowed lunch breaks and barely have short breaks."
bad,"Loved working with the customers, who were mostly local, and visiting with them as I helped them or checked them out."
bad,the hours i worked where fine but the people that i worked including managers did not always do they job and they would leave the job for someone else to do. and there was no communication between managers and employees.
bad,Point Blank: Terrible company to work for. Didnt let us take breaks. Terrible pay. Benefits are horrible. Hours are terrible. Internal theft is so ridiculous that every employee is suspected
bad,"The stores are in horrible areas, always getting robbed. District Manager doesn't know what he is doing, and doesn't care about anyone but himself. The amount of work for managers is too much usally in the store by yourself for hours or just one other person."
bad,Ran a store. Inventory Control. Mgt. was nonexisitant. Employees caught stealing. Too much babysitting.
bad,To start the day off you have to deal with the store managers personal issues then do her responsibilites for her. Lies are told on you and drama is always in the store and you will be talked about. You also never get a break ever. I will never recommened the job or company to anyone.
bad,"At my location where i worked, it was expected that each employee do more than task - ie. i had to unloaded incoming inventory off truck, cashier, stock inventory and perform janitorial service. With in the 90 days of employment, i watch 7 people get terminate because the manager spoke to them as if they were a child and gave minimum respect. Taking no breaks were encourage but get the work done first."
bad,"The Family Dollar on Roswood in Columbia, SC is horrible... Managers have power trips... and scheduling is not consistent...."
bad,"I have only worked here for 6 months and they have been the worst 6 months of my life. I constantly have a headache, I dread going to work each day. Once I get there I feel completely out of place and get treated as much. You work your butt off for practically nothing and it's just not worth the time and effort you put into it."
bad,Employees are not valued at family dollar and the only thing that has ever been promoted is getting the job done in unreasonable amounts of time with low amount of resources and punishments for not completing the tasks.  They also do not value the hard work that employees put into their work and when certain circumstances arise to where you need time they are quick to push you to the side and move on to the next person.
bad,"By far the worst place I have ever had the misfortune to work at. You will be alone for most of the time you are the cashier, stocker, manager, cleaner, schematics reset the "
bad,You constantly get pulled to do other jobs than the job you were hired for. So you never really know what you are going to be doing for the day. They also make you work a lot of overtime with little notice.
bad,"Family dollar will work you as hard as they can, for as long as they can, as cheap as they can.  They have a very take it or leave it attitude towards both their customers and their employees."
bad,There is no support the budget is too low they never give you extra help or extra hours and they expect the store manager to do everything by themselves basically
bad,They work manager way over hours set.  District managers never helps out when needed.  There is no sense if order ir direction with this company.  I have never worked for a company that care Notre about the company than their workers health.
bad,"Family Dollar don't care about you as long as you work for them. Family Dollar is a shady workplace as if you have to work 2x hard to be on everybody's good side. They get over on people and will terminate or take you off the schedule because they don't like you without having a reason or you may say something you don't tolerate and they take it to the heart. They say 'It is never personal' but management need to do better. For instance, My assistant manager and I had a little disagreement knowing we can't get along but only can be cordial toward each others. The store manager could've confront each of us one by one instead all three in the room. Sometimes the third party don't always work out, especially when the store manager is taking their words against mine. Family Dollar isn't the place to be if you looking for a drama-free, easy-going and friendly workplace."
bad,"I was an assistant manager and usually worked 6 days a week morning until night.    On days when merchandise was to be delivered I would have to come in at 530 or 6am, prepare the store, prepare and drop off bank deposits/ receive change and be back in time to open the store by 8 am. At times I was the only employee in the store until 12 or 1pm. "
bad,The only good thing about the job is a change in pace from day to day however the bad out weighed the good. The upper management had no sense of family life and work life. If you couldn't drop everything and go running when they needed you to you were punished later on. If you are management your are expected to work off of the clock but still expected to take a lunch.  The upper management doesn't take the complaints about the store manager seriously and there is no sort of reprimanding for managers of stores Either over all a really bad company to work for
bad,"I loved my customers and my team, they made the lack of work/life balance tolerable.  In a store that did 1.5 million annually,  I was allotted a payroll budget of 100 hours per week outside of myself.  I had two full time employees at 35 hours per week and two part time employees at 15 hours per week,  leaving me to work 70 plus hours per week,  mostly alone in the store.  The company philosophy seems to be to drain as much blood from the stone as possible,  then move on to the next. Thank God I didn't remove my resume from Indeed, as my new employer saw it and contacted me to work for them. Good riddance to Family Dollar."
bad,"Get in if you are desperate for a pay check, then get out as quick as you got in. There is no need to stay here. The work culture here is zero to none."
bad,they only have 2 to 3 employees on shift at a time. Unable to keep lines moving and store upkeep. Some of the employees are rude to customers. Flexible hours are none existent
bad,"Worst job experience I have ever had due to numerous reasons."
bad,"I think they should look more into what people do for company,but they hire and fire, the wrong people everyday. For instance they promoted a guy that I told them literally has been stealing and to look at the cameras And instead gave him a raise I can't, worst company ever. They will promote anyone to cover a shift. Don't matter if your stealing, bc in Brooksville, Florida Danny and Victor both take stuff everyday.both"
bad,"Overall, not a positive work experience.  working in the ballpark of seventy plus hours a week and only being paid for fifty-two, not having really enough hours to run your store and keep it up to par, constantly dealing with staffing issues which went beyond the normal business protocol."
bad,"The DM's are terrible, they force you into roles and positions that you do not want and when you refuse they cut your hours unless you take on the roles or positions they want filled. They do not listen to employee requests and will bring people in with little to no experience completely dismantling a smoothly operating team."
bad,"From the unusually unkempt work environment and stock rooms, to the unnecessary disregard of managing teams well being, just a horrible place to work."
bad,"Store manager is messy, shows favoritism, and gossip about employees (behind their back) to other employees/assistant managers. If she gets upset with an employee, she’ll cut their hours. She’ll change the schedule, and blame it on the district manager. She allows certain(her favorites) employees to come in to work when they want to. She takes advantage of the good hardworking employees by making them do most of the work while her favorites do whatever they want to."
bad,"Work very long hours, company gives little labor hours to complete very time consuming tasks. Company cares very little for employees at all levels.The company makes it very hard for even employees with very hard work ethics to stay."
bad,Management showed favoritism with employees. Management told you lies just to keep you in the loop.. Threatened to fire me when I lost my Mother.. And no matter how hard you worked you still didn't get a Raise or even complimented on the job you did
bad,I left the company abruptly due to poor working conditions.The amount of work did not match the salary.The position at Family Doller was both physically demanding and there was a high stress level working at this company.
bad,"Unattainable upper management expectation. They will not fix problems in store ( broken freezers, Uninsulated storage room, Bug Infestation). Constantly making management work 65+ hours pre week with a minim of 52 hours."
bad,The worst job I've ever had.  Way too many hours expected of the salaried manager.  Not enough hours offered to the other employees.  Unrealistic expectations from upper management who never backed up their word or their empty promises.
bad,I really don't have anything good to say because the manager at the Pine Knot store really wasn't a good manager. I would NEVER recommend anyone to work at that store as long as the store has that manger there still works there.
bad,Worse job ever they need to pay their employees more got can't live off off 8.50 an hour that's bad and when people would steal the manager would make you chase them down and fight them .
bad,Family Dollar does not care about the safety of their employees. Everyday is challenging and exhausting. I did not enjoy my time their as an employee.
bad,"I loved working with customers,  but not the head people. I felt like I was not treated equally. They didn't know how to talk to people, or talk to them"
bad,The worst part of the job was having to be at the store by yourself.  They don't pay you enough for all u have to do. The air conditioner didnt work well in the store I was at. And the building was old and falling apart also.
bad,Upper management has a life but store managers have no life or family in the eyes of family dollartoo many pet peeves.you go help other stores and other managers trying to be a team player but there is no team work between management therefor u can't instill teamwork with your associates.when I gave my notice I was bribed by dm to work extra week and I could get my vacation hours but because I didn't he took it from me
bad,I learned how to manage customers and become close with my regular customers learned how effectively work in a fast paced environment and learned how to over come obstacles and find a better way to to get a task done
bad,I went to the district manager because of issues with the store manager and he did absolutely nothing to solve the issues. Everybody that I started my job with has quit due to the poor management of the district and store manager. The do not care about their employees or how their managers treat their employees
bad,"Extream work load for such a little pay, very demanding job, just know that no matter what you are hired as you WILL DO EVERYONES JOB, even a cashier will have to unload trucks, stock shelves, check dates, sweep, mop, make minor repairs, clean parking lot, clean bathrooms, set ads, ect. Also know they rarely does this company offer raises and if you happen to get on it won't be more  then 10 cents"
bad,"Most of the customers there are so entitled it's absolutely disgusting. They don't keep the store clean nor put things back in their respective places. When they find an item in the wrong spot KNOWING everything is misplaced due to other customers, they blame it on us and say it's ""false advertising."" Not only that but if you look a certain race, they'll immediately judge you and think you can speak their language fluently then get upset when you tell them you don't understand them.They'll call you names in front of you or be childish and speak in their tongues as well. Overall bad experience. I'm only staying here because I need the money to afford a car to search for other jobs."
bad,"Management was horrible..there’s a lot of stuff people don’t know about Family Dollar..Management touching on employees, employees stealings, employees leaving during their shift, managers stealing and etc."
bad,Poor management. No in person communication between DM and ASM. Solely through GM who didn’t have my best interest at heart. Also when I was issued a garnishment family dollar wouldn’t accept payment arrangements from the garnishor so I ended up with two garnishments at 25% each therefore 50% of my check was garnished.
bad,it was an  ok work place I would not recommend it but if you need long hors and small pay this this is the place for you. I would definitely do my research first before applying here.
bad,"the manager is unprofessional. loves to gossip. slightly racist against black workers. unfair treatment to all employees, even the truck drivers. she thinks she is smarter than everyone and you wont notice the different treatment compared to others. will lie to your face"
bad,"Employee safety was a huge priority for me, but not so much the company.  I shared with my supervisor on several occasions safety issues (high theft, customers brandishing weapons, unsafe work conditions) and I was repeatedly told “You’re the store manager, address it.” Once I had a “customer” pull a gun on me to get away with stolen merchandise I knew that this job wasn’t for me"
bad,I was in the hospital called my supervisor to let her know that I was being admitted and she told me that I had to come in because she had no one to cover my shift. I assumed she thought I was not being honest so I took a picture and sent it and still the same response.
bad,"Poor management, Work was good.Supervisors were Lazy and found ways to utilize the system to make them look busy. Management never provided gratitude for making them look good."
bad,I worked with the company and a half years and they pushed me out due to new management this place is trash. Thats why dollar tree bought them out. New management means new crew wether your worth keeping or not
bad,"Being the store manager was stressful. I had to unload trucks, stock, price changes, cashier, paperwork, modular, do freight..I was suppose to have 2 ASM, and 2 pt cashiers. Still not enough time to get all projects done."
bad,I was store manager I often worked over 60 hours per week  I had a lazy DM who offered no support when needed. My inventory shrink was .07 I received a minimal raise. No OT compensation. Often had to fight with Corp.  for correct pay for my staff. Diagnosed with endstage renal disease DM said I was taking. Should change company name to Anti Family Dollar.
bad,This is the type of job that one would have if their parents take care of them and they don't have to fin for theirself. They give you hours In the beginning and when they get upset with you for not doing what they want when they want even after you compromise so much it's still never enough. Even if you speak to them with the up most respect they never show you the same respect. And their communication with the staff and management is terrible. I wouldn't ever refer family dollar to anyone as a place to work.
bad,"It was okay at first but as the days passed, you are treated with less and less respect from the managers and with almost no respect from corporate to begin with. "
bad,Family Dollar is THE WORST EMPLOYER ive ever worked for!!! I wouldn't recommend anyone work for them!! They do not care about there employee's! I worked 10 hours alone in the worst part of town on a weekly basis because of payroll..smh
bad,"Good place to get your feet wet if you can survive, you work 52 hours a week, with no breaks. You are required to run the store by yourself for at least 5 hours a day and to top it off no employee discounts."
bad,Spent many hours operating store alone due to payroll constraints had little care for your safety especially in the areas these stores were located. Store manager had every bit of responsibility of pretty much every task with amount of payroll allocated
bad,"I thought this was going to be a great work place but it wasnt the management was horrible and they treat you as you are replaceable. No matter how fast you are there, they will always tell you that you are not fast enough. I will say the only good thing about working there was the coworkers, we all help each other no matter what. They make you feel as if you are honestly a family together. If you ever had a dead battery in the parking lot they would help even if you needed a ride home they would help."
bad,This establishment expects so much out of you as a customer service representative. The pay isn’t worth the work the expect of you. They also will complain to you about how you aren’t doing enough. The turnover rate is extremely high.
bad,"This company will screw you out of PTO time. The DM never wants to help out no matter the situation, And will wait till freight is completely overwhelming before they bring help from other stores. Never dealt with so much drama even when I was in high school. Theft is completely ridiculous both internally, and externally. They do nothing extra to make their associates feel appreciated or to compensate for their horrible wages. Scheduling is never consistant and changes almost daily due to call off or people quitting. Stores are so disgusting basically because you have no one to help with the daly housekeeping because they cut the payroll budget so low you mostly have to schedule your cashier in the evenings. You work as cashier in the store by yourself majority of the day because of the horrible payroll budget. Even though it is called family Dollar this company has no regard for your family life. They basically tell you if you cant choose your job over your family than this job is not for you."
bad,If the management has a friend that needs a job they will do anything to try to set someone up so they can get that friend on. I was loving my job anf my task at hand until then.
bad,"Once Dollar Tree purchased Family Dollar the culture dissipated and turn over became an extreme issue.  Not to mention, the majority of the store were located in very low income areas creating an issue with not only external theft but internal theft as well.  Two or three million dollar stores would lose up to $200k annually due to theft.  Company did not know how to respond to the losses and created a difficult environment to work or be successful in."
bad,The store i worked at was so bad i had to leave or i probably would ended up in a mental hospital. never work here if you want poor pay and poor hours as a CSR
bad,"No work life balance! Upper management is terrible. The only company that has business partners within the organization that do not work together as partners!! Loss prevention is in control of our region, they call all the shots!! Hr and RZVP are worthless, don't ever need help, they're no where around!!"
bad,"I worked for Family Dollar for 3 and half years.  I did not have a good work life balance when I worked for Family Dollar.  My position was a store manager and I was salaried  I worked on average 60 hours per week, but some weeks I worked 70 to 75 if I wasn't staffed properly.  The company did not want any of the hourly employees to have overtime, not even the assistant managers.  The workload was demanding and the payroll budget was extremely low.  I got 2 weeks vacation every year, but was unable to use half of my vacation time due to staffing issues.  I only received holiday pay if I worked on Christmas Day.  Family Dollar is open on all holidays and you do not get holiday pay.  I was robbed once while working for Family Dollar.  Stores are not located in the best enviromental areas with no security."
bad,I was not trained on a lot of the paperwork.  Then there is the stuff you have to get done. You do not have enuff time to get everything done in the time given to do it while taking care of customers at the same time. They need more employee in the store in the store at all times to get everything done to get everything done. It is unsafe to have only employee at the store at a time.
bad,"Poor company,  they dont care about you as a person. The work life balance is poor.  Work here part time but never full time. Dont use this as a long term anything."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend having a job like family dollar if you have big bills and have children. This would be good if you’re in school and you want to make extra cash or for a second job. I don’t think the little bit of money you’re getting is worth working there because you have to do so much. As far as counting your money, stocking the front end, watching the register while greeting customers and from watching them from not stealing which 10/10 they will steal. You can’t really leave the front end but you can’t stand by the register."
bad,"sucks, drains the life right out of you....true definition of a fun sucker. minimum hours of 52, average 65 but your on call from 630a to 10p. DO THE MATH!!!"
bad,Bad place to work need to close down  they don’t worry bout your safety dm and rvp are always talking bout each other cycle counts get done wrong the cheat on inventories
bad,No No No No Stop Stop Stop Stop No Dont Just Dont  You Deserve better ! Just Dont waste your time here unless you enjoy Hot messes. This place sucks only thing ill miss are my customers
bad,"I dont like the pay, too much work for small pay every 2 weeks. Management could be better, it's not that great here. There's  bugs too, more then where I would work."
bad,Back stabbing.  Cut-throat.  Lies from the top.  Requires the impossible.  No corporate loyalty to its in-store workers.  Talks one thing but does another.
bad,i thought this job was going to be easy. it is in the long run just have to deal with so much stress and long hours. the schedule is iffy most days because of poor planning and low staffing. if you have a strict schedule to adhere to then this is not the job for you.
bad,"Unless you are a store manager, no benefits/low pay. Upper management is a joke. Too much work for very little pay. Stores need updating. Company is unwilling to invest in structures or personnel. It is unfortunate because these stores provide a convenient place to one stop shop and have low prices on basic items."
bad,"I worked for both Dollar Tree, 7.5 years and three time top gun, Family Dollar just over one year. Both companies lost it culture of ethics and share the wealth after the founder either retire or passed on. They are cruel and I remember a book given at the annual meeting, Lincoln on Leadership, what they wanted us to get from this book is that Lincoln would hire and fire his generals in a heart beat should they fail and that we must do the same to our store managers and district managers to drive the company. Now, I agree we need to push out people at times, but I’ve witnessed many great people with numerous success having s bad moment tossed out like trash. Now days stay away from retail store companies, they will all fall away just like the best wooden wheel maker did with the discovery of rubber."
bad,"I worked for this company in Homer, MI for almost two years and it has been horrible. My manager sleeps with his employees and gives them raises for doing so and let's them get away with anything. If you try and call corporate to inform them of something they never return your calls. This place is a joke."
bad,"Anyone can advance to management if you do your job right. The individual stores are disorganized. You are scheduled in advance for truck delivery sometimes as early as 5 or 6 am. There have been countless times when you arrive and there is no truck and you are sent home- no pay. If you have kids or transportation issues this was very frustrating. The ""unofficially official"" policy was that you can not be pregnant and a manager. You are demoted to cashier once they find out. It was stated over and over again by the District Manager that a manager is just ""an overpaid stocker"". Female managers are not treated like equals to male managers."
bad,"There was no structure, you came in worked a different schedule everyday, never knew what time  you were getting off, as a cashier you didn't get breaks, or lunches. There was only two people in the store at all times. You and the Store manager, which there job was to unload and stock all freight. The district managers, CEO, etc. didn't care about there employees or managers. Safety was not a concern"
bad,"You will enjoy overworking and UNDER- PAYMENT "
bad,"Within the first week of working there the assistant manager quit because the new manager was very rude. So i was forced to do more 40 hours or more, instead of the part time i had asked for. Soon enough on one the stokers quit as well more like just didn't show up. It was really boring i would spend each day doing about 13 hours a day and had no one to talk to. I tried keeping myself busy with keeping the store neat and well stoked. The customers were the hardest part. very rude and tried to take advantage of the situation. Worst job experience of my life so far. Pay was good for the hours that i was making."
bad,"The first awful thing is they often schedule managers & assistant managers to work alone for 6+ hours for many shifts. Why is this bad? One it is unsafe and encourages/enables thieves. Two, it is impossible to help customers, take returns, run a register, unload a truck, and put inventory on the shelves ALL BY YOURSELF. BUT....the upper managers still expect one person to do all these things by themselves taking in $1,000-$2,500 in sales. Need to go to the bathroom? Better lock the door and hurry up. Hungry? Better have some food in your pocket because there is no break policy. By far, the worst company I have ever worked for leadership wise. Lastly, they would rather pay one person and get their store cleaned out by burglars, robbers, and shoplifters, than randomly have days of "
bad,"Not a safe environment to work.  Need more staff working at the same time to cover shift and help customers. Manager has to cover all areas...unload truck, stock and restock shelves, keep restroom clean...customer service....checkout customers, check-in vendors while trying to keep thieves from robbing the store."
bad,It a ok job better manager more security discounts more stuff for big girls better shoes nicer customers better clothes prices need to go down get the family dollar app fix.
bad,"Unprofessionally loud, mouthy, and indiscreet manager, who always looks disheveled from head to feet and does not know answers to basic questions a store manager should know, does not take care of the hardest and best workers. Blunt is ok, but when it starts sounding like bullying, it's too much. Public humiliation of employees on any level is wrong, as is not actually handling large problems. "
bad,"Genuinely one of the worst experiences of my life. The job itself was fine, basic retail and customer service, but the upper management is an absolute disaster. The store manger is a generally mean and spiteful person, who berates and criticizes employees (most of them, anyway) in front of customers and vendors. They do pick their favorites, however, happily turning a blind eye to their wrongdoings such as stealing, and rude, hateful behavior towards customers. "
bad,"I really dislike working for Family Dollars the management team was hard to work under. The job was very stressful and not safe to work, the customers very rude unpleasant ."
bad,Not a great job working nightshifts is awful. They cut your work to save money for themselves and that comes from corporate. As well the Managment is not good always forgetting something or give you too much work and try to push you to get it done of you have to work on your days off.
bad,"Very good enviromental place to work in. assisting Customers on the floor, flexible work schedule,401k benefits,Getting along with Co-Workers.I learned that you should always come in to work with a positive attitude."
bad,"I absolutely loved working with all of my customers at family dollar. Unfortunately I was steered in the wrong direction by my store manager and was fired. I would like to fight this one day, although now I am just worried about finding a job to support my children and get back into the work flow. I recently became very ill and was fired. I believe and so does a lot of the employees there that my health was the main reason for my being fired. Although they can not fire me for that, so they dug deep and found some other reason. I am now 100% better. I have had my gallbladder removed and have never felt better in my life. I hope other family dollar stores are not like this, unfortunately I believe they all are."
bad,"They have 2 quick if a turn over rate"
bad,Poor management... Why is this a must aswer.. We dnot have a choice ...Not right at all... I have nothing else to say.. I hate that location everything about it I hate..
bad,"I worked at family Dollar for a year, as the Assistant manager. There were two other people there, not including the manager. The two other girls and myself, kept that store in order. The manager would schedule herself the weekends off, or she’d take three days out of the week to be off, and we’d have to work double shifts. She’d leave the store for two hours to go have lunch with her boyfriend, but we never got to go have lunch for two to three hours at a time. She’d lie to the District manager about the hours she was working and when she’d get a bonus for the store, she didn’t bother to split it with the ones who actually worked to get the bonus. She is disgusting, she leaves her trash and food laying around, causing nats, and I’ve occasionally seen a few roaches. She doesn’t check for expired food or any of the things a Store manager is supposed to do. She just has the manager title and pay, but she’s never there to do the work. I wouldn’t recommend my worst enemies to work here, they’d never have a life outside of family Dollar."
bad,All below negative review.  They expect you to be security in there and prevent if not hold the people if they were stealing and I was only paid 8.50 an hour. There is a lot more negative things i can say but not on here
bad,"Working at Family Dollar, you won't have advancement opportunities unless you stay with the company for YEARS. The upper management doesn't care about the employees in their stores, and the employees in the stores don't get the training or equipment they need to make their stores as presentable as they should be. If you are anything above the CSR/Cashier position, then you are simply there to be a keyholder and a scapegoat for the person directly above you."
bad,I would like to thank Family Dollar for the experience. It was not what I expected. No coverage no lunch breaks. Extremely unhealthy conditions to work under. Management has no control or life working for Family Dollar.
bad,It is a very high stress level not enough employs not enough hours to give out .Someone is always calling in I have learned a lot of paper work I am an assistant manager but they can not keep store managers I have only been there 7 months and I been through 5 already working with managers here that play middle school games my most enjoyable part is the customer service meeting new people and helping them leave the store with a smile on there face and everything they needed
bad,I started off as a cashier for Family Dollar and worked my way up to Store Manager. I was thrown into the store managers position with very little training because numerous people were quitting and there wasn't anyone to run the store. I liked the actual job as there was always something to do. Unfortunately as a Store Manager you are required to work no less then 52 hours weekly. Which you would usually end up working 60+ and were paid salary at 52 hours. Never were you compensated for anything over 52. They have an EXTREMELY high turnover rate because they offer very little hours for their ASM's and cashiers and OVER WORK their SM's. I hated leaving my job because I worked hard to get where I was and really enjoyed it when I was fully staffed. (Being fully staffed only lasts so long though when people are only given part time hours) I would be short staffed would ask for help and would be lucky to get anyone to help from another store. After going through multiple employees and no other stores sending help I ended up being the only employee left. You can't operate a store with only 1 employee so I had no other choice but to resign.
bad,I was an asst manager no security no help no breaks working 9 hour shifts people doing no call no shows no consequences no leadership too many jokes customers talking about workers and back and forth . shop lifters walking out with garbage cans full of items.
bad,"Very unprofessional, to much on one person.."
bad,The job requires to be very quick and solve issues on your own regardless of your position. Hours are not very stable shifts change with or without notice. Management is not very organized in general.
bad,I would not recommend working for Family Dollar.  It definitely is not the same place it was to work for when it was operated by the Levines.  The company is not transparent with their workers at all.
bad,"If you are looking for a first job, a temp job til you get somewhere else, a little extra money do not choose this place. They are only concerned about their money. When I was there I was made to feel I am always being watched, no matter what you do you will not be trusted, everyone is the enemy, My safety was never a concern, their security is a joke, people would come there and steal and disrespect you and then you would get blamed for the theft. On top of that the place has bed bugs running around, roaches and the MICE, oh my goodness. All of them should be shut down and fined for even subjecting poor neighborhoods to this type of shopping experience. Management was under a lot of pressure, would get the read on the floor in front of customers by upper management, it was one of the things that helped me decide to find another job."
bad,Working at family dollar was a great experience but the turn over rate was high due to letting people going over not selling candy bars the pay was not that great
bad,"Work 55 hours plus"
bad,I worked for this company for 186 days straight with no days off or extra compensation. The business was constantly understaffed and the high shrinkage volumes made it almost impossible to meet sales quotas. Management was terrible. The store I managed was recently bought out by Dollar General.
bad,"If you don't have a family it's a good job, the pay is not enough to really live on and most of their stores are not in very good neighborhoods so it tends to be shady"
bad,The manager at the store I worked at was rude and yelled at me in front of the customers on a regular basis. Other staff showed up late with my call..
bad,"employees are replaceable. Salaried managers are expected to work 60-80 hours per week.  salary is based on a 52 hour week. "
bad,"Just don't work here. I started as a cashier and was offered an assistant manager position. The entire time all the management did was point out anything they perceived as a flaw in performance. They literally never told you that you did a good job. You often are working as the only cashier and it's busy. You're expected to run register, unload stock from the truck and stock shelves all at once. Customers are always unhappy and rude. So many people steal from the store and you're not allowed to do anything about it unless you directly see them stealing. Even then all you can do is call the police. Once they're out the door there's nothing you are allowed to do. It gets to the point where you don't even care if they are stealing. "
bad,At first working there was great had great hours and was comfortable and felt like i was apart of a team but when the store manager left and we got another manager things changed for the wrost
bad,"I was a transfer from one store to another due to personal reasons. The Family Dollar in Abbeville, LA has the worse management possible. There us no type of order whatsoever. There are things that were done to me and other employees that have gotten totally looked over."
bad,this was the worst place to work I worked everyday for months with no days off I would be there by myself at nite but it was even harder when we would get a truck I did everyone of them they treated women very badly .
bad,"As a manager you are required to work 52 hours a week, if no one shows up to work all week guess who has to...Manager and you will still receive the same pay for working your tail off as if you just worked 52 hrs. 94 hours a week is ridiculous."
bad,Awful place to work for. Upper management has not a clue of whats going on at the store. They don't care about their employees. You don't get any help from your DM if you asked for it. Poor management overall
bad,"All the stores in the district I worked in are ridiculously understaffed and upper management knows that it is. It's run on a skeleton crew and the managers and assistant mangers are absolutely worked to death and they honestly wouldn't have it any other way. They literally have meetings constantly about how NOBODY is to get overtime. The best thing sadly, for this company to do is close down some of the stores and maybe try to combine employees on the ones left open. You cannot come down that hard on the managers and assistant mangers when the stores look like they do because it is not possible for one person to do all that is asked of them. Turnover rate is high for a reason."
bad,they dont care about employees  leaving in the store alone and expected way to much out of one person they are all dirty stores in some way and dont make sure employees eat
bad,"The interview and working for the manager was just awful, customers complain about the store manager all the time but yet nothing gets done about her because the district manager doesn't care nor does the company at all. She even treats her employees horribly, I've seen a few of them getting screamed at for issues unrelated to work."
bad,"Worked here for a while until I found something better. "
bad,"Since I have been in this position I have had nothing but bad experiences! There is absolutely no support from upper management, and no support from co workers. This job is very cut throat and anyone will rip you down in order for them to get in your place."
bad,There are employment options out there in our country that are better. Keep hopeful and search for more than this. This is a dying company with many unfair labor practices being conducted.
bad,"If you like to work, this is the place for you.  Family Dollar are usually located in tougher neighborhoods, and has a lot of questionable customers.  You're usually cleaning after the mess they make in the stores,and restocking everyday. Lost prevention control is the biggest issue for this company, and they should have Costco style security at the front doors.  By the way, there is no lunch break..in a way, it's good and bad."
bad,"No breaks, overworked, most of ASMs are lazy. not much to talk about organization is a big thing they should work on. and people should show a little more respect to the store manager"
bad,"all of the company pressure to be successful falls on the store manager , very high manager and district manager turnover ,low pay for assistant managers result in low quality candidates, they blame store manager for  high shrink rates without out any real plan or solutions to combat issue. half of the store open time is run with one employee ,"
bad,it was a great place to work an the people were well manner an we always worked as a team i stood long period of hours if the work got to slow we always take down time an find other things to do
bad,"Worked part-time for a few years and I was treated great by my manager but I didn't like the way the company disrespected and mishandled them by not giving them the tools necessary to provide the best quality experience for customers. I don't even know what the company could do to improve, stay far away."
bad,"Seldom enough hands to achieve goals, stressful and unproductive work environment, poor scheduling and overall management, decrease in performance and productivity "
bad,I was a cashier and I was doing my responsibilities and my assistant managers responsibilities as well while only getting paid for my duties. People steal from there all the time as well. My managers never got rid of things that are no good or what have you...very very rude management as well. Snide remarks under their breath. Under appreciated.
bad,"I endured a year and a half working in this a torture chamber.The management is terrible. The company demands way too much work for the paltry sum of money you get paid. That's why there is such a revolving door when it comes to employees. If the manager does not like you, you get treated like a dog. There is no appreciation for the work that you do from either the manager,the upper management or the company itself. l'd rather dance for nickels on the sidewalk than ever work for this horrible,lousy company ever again. In fact, I don't want to even be a customer."
bad,I would ring customers out stock shelves and recover the store as everyone else was diddy daddling on their cell phones they do not follow by the rules
bad,"I did not enjoy this job very much. Poor management. Was not a fun or joyful environment. My management played favorites. They did not care if you were sick or not feeling good, still had to come in."
bad,"All I know is I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. Hours are here and there (just depends on the orders)."
bad,"Store managers were spiteful and revengeful. Be careful if you call out, or you aren't kissing up to the store manager or she/he will get revenge and take away hours, find ways to get you fired. District manager doesn't see everything and usually always takes the Store managers side. No benefits were given to me and I was paid at a low wage. Yearly raises are way less than a dollar. I would never want to be anything over an assistant manager. I could go on."
bad,They want you to do everything for the worst pay. They have required truck days where items are shipped to your store unorganized and most of the time damaged. You receive NO employee discounts. No more than three people work a shift & only one is the morning so they get robbed a lot if your okay with that apply at your own risk.
bad,"Starting there I was excited because I would be making more money than I had at my previous company but their minimum for Store Managers is 52 hours but I have never worked less than 65 there. There is no work and life balance. They give you little payroll and expect you to get many things done in the time they give you (52 hours) but over half of my shifts I was in the store alone on register because I couldn't afford to have a cashier there with me due to the amount of payroll they gave. The pay wasn't worth the expectations or the time that was expected of you. Their insurance is awful, even when you pay the highest amount. It didnt cover any of my necessary medications and was very highly priced. I couldn't even get time off to go to the doctor or take time off for any occasion."
bad,This company expects you to give everything but refuses to pay you what you are worth. I can see why the turnover is so huge. You slave lots of hours while usually working with only 1 other employee. The likelihood of you getting robbed is very high. I wouldn't recommend this job to ANYONE.
bad,I really was not impress with the company and I had to work long hours and not get paid for anything over 50 hours and my employees were stealing for the company
bad,"Management is terrible they're disrespectful. Lack of pay,stores are messy and management doesn't care,I've seen managers steal and blame it on a CSR to get then fired"
bad,"good job for people to start if you did not have a job, or good to get learning skill to improve in you never had skills. but the job teaches  people and how to solve problems as customer service"
bad,Not good no one works together unprofessional and rude management no good no breaks shift lead unprofessional store unworkable limited hours of work with unfair pay
bad,"Management is horrible along with upper management hlurs get cut went from full time working 40 hours to being full time working only 10 hours a week, and the ones higher up dont help."
bad,This job was a very easy job to come across and succeed in. It didn't take me very long to become a assistant manager. I learned alot from this job and it also prepared me for my job I had after.
bad,"All employees are replicable. is what higher management goes by. "
bad,Working for family dollar was horrible to much drama and people that gossiped about everybody else's life. wouldn't recommend them to anybody looking for a job.
bad,Typical day at work is always 12+ hours if you want to even come close to getting job done and its a 6 day work week. upper management does not care about employees or lower level management at store level. culture of stores are set in low income areas with high crime rates including armed robberies. would not recommend to anybody. only plus is a higher salary in the highest crime area stores but then again the hourly rate after all hours worked equates to minimum wage.
bad,This was a very bad experience.  The company pushed so hard about shrink goals and the focus turned staff against them and poor service is what customers were being challenged with while trying to unload huge trucks along with trying to help get the customers thru register areas that are not wide enough because of all the junk that is in the way. When you get promoted they then would focus on finding fault until they came up with something to terminate.
bad,Do not show your skills. They do not care about customer service nor cleanliness of stores. Organization of stock is a low priority especially in the backrooms where much damage (shrink) occurs.
bad,There is no fun.They are always to serious.I learned how to work cashier.  I also learned that sometimes things are not fair.The hardest part about working their is dealing with angry customers.The best part for me is that i had one co-worker who made things fun.I recommend never getting on your phone even thought you may need it for a calculator.
bad,Store hours have been cut so low. that the store manager has to make up all they hours because she is salaried. They don't give you enough hours to complete your task.
bad,"Cheap company, no vacation pay, 20 hours or less worked here two years in a half years and went from making $8.00 to $8.43. No advancement. The work you put in does not match the pay"
bad,I really don't have any comments to share. My experience as a sales person was nothing to talk about or share at all.  The only thing I enjoyed was the weekly payroll and the customers.
bad,Family Dollar is not a great place to work the pay there is not so good there's no opportunity for real advancement and the management really doesn't care too much about who what are the what's going on at the location
bad,Wasnt enough hours so you never had a decent paycheck. Every week your hours were shorten . Overall i wouldnt go back there to work because of the poor management
bad,"-Short staffed."
bad,I honestly could not stand my specific store. My store manager was lazy and rude so it made the experience awful for me and the store was always dirty and a complete mess because no one is goal oriented
bad,Working at family fool really helped me to open up to different people I learned things I never knew I learned how to self pave myself n to focus family dollar honestly helped me succeed for my self the only thing about this job is that  they don't pay enough
bad,"Please don't even consider working for Family Dollar. I worked for this company as a Store Manager. I gave more than 100 percent daily . I recruited and trained my staff to do the same. I agree that Upper Management did not properly support the stores. The Leadership qualities were not there. Store Managers were treated with disrespect . Honesty and loyalty was not present. Our opinion was worthless. Compensation for the work performed was horrible. The support needed to effectively manage the stores on a daily basis was not present, and at the end of the day The Store Manager was responsible for Every mishap and therefore Terminated and not eligible for rehire. I pray that God intervene because He is the ONLY hope to turn this company around. Family Dollar has screwed too many GOOD people; Managers and CSRs"
bad,I worked for Family Dollar for 12 years and enjoyed it till my final years with the company. Upper management did not care if it was Christmas time and all you had was 4 people on staff and you being the store manager had no day off. I experienced 2 major losses in my life last year and all my district manager could ask me was when I was coming back to work or how many more people are going to die in  your family. I just had to leave because I felt like my Dm and PM could careless about how we the store managers felt or are going thru.
bad,It started out as a good job at first but it started to go down hill when I missed a day and try to call In for work but nobody answered the store phone so I still got in trouble for it and then a new manager came in and just fired on the spot of my next day to come into work.
bad,"This organization is not headed in the right direction. They overwork employees then cut them loose. I have seen several friend leaders that worked here lose their jobs for other people's mistakes. "
bad,Easy work flow. Have to deal with crazy people from time to time but other then that it's cool. Alot of shoplifting don't go out of your way to try to stop them you can get fired even though they encourage you to stop shoplifters.
bad,"It was my first job. Very horrible, lazy management. They would use every excuse in the book to not do their job, to put it on the cashiers.. I had to check out every customer while still stock through out the whole store, and also do truck.. just horrible work environment."
bad,"Open the store, count safe, count drawers, do opening paperwork on the computer, go to the bank before the store opens, come back unlock the doors, cashier, received vendors, answer the phone, on tues. conference call on the phone is added to your duties, in between customers and vendors you work freight and keep the store clean."
bad,They don't treat there employees with respect  it's a lot of pettiness especially since everyone there is 28+ so I'd expect more from them  I wouldn't want anyone who starts off at a job to go here unless u love to play the blame game and act like kids in a place of work
bad,you had some customers that where nice but then you had the other 90 percent who didn't care at all and always gave you a problem. the district manager isn't some one who gets along with people.
bad,"Job was very unprofessional, Management was unorganized. To much drama and no teamwork.  Customers were very rude, Managers went back and forth with customers."
bad,as a manager they pay you for 52 hours but they want you to work 70+ because they do not want to pay their part time employees to do the work. most part time employees get 17 hours a week and they manager is to work by themselves for long periods of time.
bad,"Unless you come in as a Store Manager don't even apply. They have some of the worse store managers in place. There are very few good managers there, I mean few."
bad,"I enjoy some customers, but the company does not care about safety They don't tell us that FD down the road got robbed or care that 7 others were hit. My SM had to wait on me before she could go to the hospital because she was having chest pains, and you could see that  something was wrong"
bad,"Since Dollar Tree Inc. bought out Family Dollar Inc. The store hours are managed in a manor that is inconsistent with the number of workers that the company wants the managers to hire. This creates a very high employee turnover rate. The store cannot keep help with little to no hours and pay that is locked in at 8.50 hr, with no opportunity for pay raises or healthcare for the cashiers that I had to manage."
bad,"not saying Family dollar is a bad company but my District is the worse bad management no experience, slavery, no life balance anything bad you know a company can have."
bad,There were never enough hours in the day to get the work done.  I learned that this is a company that I will never work for again.  The District Manager had was not involved in his/her assigned stores and not supportive of the challenges we faced on a day to day basis.  The hardest the part of the job was hiring good employees and  keeping employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working  with the customers.
bad,The training says not to chase after or touch shoplifters but if you do not they write you up. If you do Try to stop the shoplifter and you get injured you could be fired in most cases. Dm's put a lot of pressure on management of stores over thing they can not control or maybe could if provided a Peace Officer  at some locations.
bad,You have no home life when working as management. You can do your best with what you have to work with and it won't be good enough. Cashiers get very minimal hours.
bad,"This review is my direct opinion for working for Family Dollar Stores."
bad,I suggest if you work here be prepared to work two jobs. Family dollar does not provide enough hours and your paycheck is going to be disappointing. Working here is not enough to provide for one person. Family dollar expect you to work holidays and every hoilday. If you're not a manger or assist manager you don't get any holiday pay or vacation time if you are not full time. as a gift for Christmas they give you a family dollar gift card. This company does not care about thier employees at all. Working at family dollar is just being a victims. The pay so low I only recommend working here if you get a social security check and need an extra income.
bad,This was a terrible place to work . long hours and a lot of work. No breaks including lunch. I would never work for this company again.
bad,"Company business model is to have managers "
bad,"You most likely won't receive a work handbook because ""There are too many pages to print out."" You need to push whatever is on your register or risk having your average transaction go down. If your average transaction does go down prepare to be watched like a hawk by the higher ups to make sure you aren't stealing. If it happens 3 times you will be fired. If you get written up for the same thing 3 times, or completely fill out your write up sheet you will be fired as well. Your training will consist of sitting at the computer and going through lots of slideshows. Which won't cover most of your day to day stuff like how to put a tag back on clothing, or what to do with expired foods."
bad,"Good team, horrible management, the store was run poorly, and never really enjoyed working here. More like a high school playground. Not worth it if you're looking for a long term advancement guaranteed position. Good for making money quickly/"
bad,"Rather have day shift, better pay, more respect, pay could be better, benefits are good, managers need to get together and work out what team member works under what manager instead of pulling the member every few hours to different managers."
bad,"If you asked management for a night (not day) off 3 Weeks in advance for a family xmas together with family coming in from out of town and their response is ""I refuse to close on a sat night you need to talk to your co-workers""...good management? And while theft is going on under their nose yet their worried about mishap paperwork?. And alas, they want to preach teamwork, yet you shouldn't ask questions you should figure it out on your own or ""fiend for yourself""  cuz god forbid they have to answer your phone call concerning the store when they are at home (2 mins away) on their day off?? Who would want to work for this type management?"
bad,After 10 years of dedicated service this company terminated me for a very thin reason. Retaliation... Find another company of you're hoping for long term employment.
bad,"At first it was a joy to work there, but then all they required was almost impossible. Long hours for low pay."
bad,"This is by far the worst place I have ever worked at; the customers are rude, the employees are unreliable, and the work environment is horrible."
bad,I didn't like working with family Dollar they where a joke with there management system.. it was my first job not sure if I would ever work for this company
bad,"A typical day at Family Dollar involves having to multi-task more than any human is capable of. You're expected to run the register, clean the store, AND dissuade thieves (and the theft rate at Family Dollar is pretty bad)-- and if you're an assistant manager, which I was, you're also expected to merchandise, put out stock, and have everything in the store perfect before thirty minutes after closing. You almost always have to do this yourself, and there's only one other person in the store with you. You are always blamed for every theft, and every misstep or mistake in recovering the store is met with scorn and writeups, even though you only get half an hour after closing to finish everything up, including cash handling and paperwork."
bad,"Although I had my personal problems with this particular company, I would never bad mouth a company due to my personal experiences. Companies in this day and age can be destroyed by review boards such as this one. If anyone is pursuing a  job or career at this company, I'd say ""go for it!"" Never let anyone opinion stop anything you do in life."
bad,"Was pretty well left alone to work, which i liked. I ran register stocked and did freight. Cleaned for inventory, which we passed. I wouldnt have quit if the friendly atmosphere had stayed."
bad,They do not pay enough for the amount of work they want you to out in. At times you may work with great people and other times you just want the week to be over with.
bad,"I didn't have any family life "
bad,Place should be where a teenager first starts at. Pay rate sucks no benefits you only make 7.25 and its not enough to pay bills at all.
bad,"I've learned that the store I worked at was interesting. The store manager was biased and couldn't be trusted. The most enjoyable for me was going home after a days work. The coworkers were good to work with, 1 in particular I'm still friends with."
bad,"As i worked for around 7 months as an assistant manager i worked 60 hours a week with only 9.75 for my pay i didn't receive benefits, nor did i rarely get a day off. The management was a bit sketchy and they seem to push their workers a bit to far to a breaking point."
bad,"I have been with the company for many years, also have worked for different stores. In my experience it is not a company you would want to work for, nor can you live anywhere close to comfortable on the pay they provide, they slave the workers as they are completely under paid for the tasks that are expected, never enough hours to complete basic daily tasks. I personally continue to work for the company as a secondary income for gas through the months."
bad,A typical work day you are on the register or putting up stock.  And watching for shoplifters. Family Dollar is a good job for someone who has never worked.
bad,Work at family dollar was a training tool on what not to do in a retail environment. It was dangerous to work there and unethical.
bad,"they hiretoo many employess and dont have enough hours, deffinetly not a stable job at all. i didnt like it because the managers dont care about the employees hours."
bad,Was not a professional environment. Nice people but again some boundaries were crossed with workers and customers. Overall rating of this store because I can not speak for others is at 2 stars the most.
bad,"They fire long term employees for made up reasons. They no longer care about their employees. Horrible place to work. It use to be a good place to work, but not anymore."
bad,"Disorganized, over worked (70) hrs per week, bad turn around rate and under paid. One of the worst work experiences of my life."
bad,"A typical day at work is pretty fast paced, in which long lines form and the CSR or cashier has no help to bring down the line, but on their own. The safe is always short or over, never where it is supposed to be because managers do not know how to count money. Then, you have the managers who gossip against each other and do not come to an agreement on what it is to be done. Managers get it worse than the  CSRs' because they have to their job plus the job of others, which some managers try to leave it to the CSRs, whom get paid minimum wage. I've learned how there are companies who do not care about their employees, but about their money and reputation. I've learned that this is a company I will not recommend to anyone, regardless of their job history or background. It is modern SLAVERY. The most enjoyable part of my job is basically working together with my CSR co-workers. The hardest part of my job would be the managers who cannot keep up with the store overall, plus the rude, nasty customers. Think twice before you apply here. If I could do it over, I would never look to apply here.."
bad,there was lack of team work and communication skills also had poor customer service towards the customers at times they didn't do much when i was robbed at gun point i put in my 2 weeks notice and the store manager decided to not even bother to hand it to the district manager so it seemed as if i never put i any notice of quitting.
bad,Poor management no team work or lack boss it was a hostel work place the dm never one acted like he cared about his workers and we had no store manager
bad,I enjoyed working there cause I love meeting new people and helping people.i have learned a lot about different things throughout the company
bad,"I stocked shelves, cleaned the shelves and bathrooms. Put up displays, run the cash register. Co-workers are easy to work with and i use to help with unloading trucks."
bad,very large work load for little pay definitely taught me alot of patience  along with some new skills like schematics management was not very helpful with re leaving  some of the work of hiring so that it was fair coworkers were just as overwhelmed
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work here. I and my boyfriend worked there and we went crazy in just a couple months. They treat you terrible, they demand too much work, and the management will just sit in there office and joke around while yelling at everyone below them to work harder and faster. It's a sweat shop. Never work here."
bad,I had a great team. However I didn't feel safe working alone. After two years we were still working alone in a store that sold over 7000 items.
bad,"This place has become awful. It expects warehouse employees to work 10-14 hours a day 6-7 days a week. You give up any family life. They recently wrote up a long time warehouse manager who works circles around any upper-managerment person for ridiculous reasons. Hes'  a dedicated, caring manager and one of few like that left in this warehouse. This to me proves they no longer care about their people. Not a place I would ever recommend anyone to work. So sad! Glad I'll be gone soon."
bad,"My store was located in a very bad part of town and after being threaten by shoplifters that I caught stealing in the store they pulled weapons on me. There was one incendent where there was bullet holes in front of the building, I asked the company for protection and they said it is not in our budget."
bad,"unsafe place to work has no security to protect you and make you feel safe. Managers are unprofessional, stores have mice, roaches. Most scary aspect is that the safe is behind the registers putting employees at risk if opening safe is necessary.  Co workers are unprofessional, their panic button is located in the least safest area putting all employees at risk. Worst company I have ever worked for and I've worked for McDonalds. This is not a company were u are treated fairly, with respect and they literally just give anyone a management position, which explains their horrible customer service, messy stores, and extremely long lines every time you go in, Worst company ever, thankfully they are getting bought out they need to clear out all employees with superior titles for allowing this company to fall at such a low extent."
bad,"I really enjoy being a customer service representative. I like interacting with people. I liked stocking, putting product in order and having a nice looking display. The hardest part of the job was needing to be EVERYTHING for nothing. Management at the time was not focused. When an associate becomes dependable in all aspects of the store, management slacks and so does moral."
bad,"Three weeks before inventory, I take the lead to plan, organizes work for the team. My team work were very happy to follow my plan. We worked together and we had a great result."
bad,"I would have to say this is the only job in which I learned very little. There was little to no training and everything was rushed. I did not work here long because there are many demands of the employees and not enough time to meet them all. "
bad,"Started off a fun place to work, making the customers happy and first priority but changes in management were not good and employees stopped caring about their jobs. Customer service wasn't a priority anymore and the store manager wasn't helpful in gaining control of the situation."
bad,"Everything about this job is grade F, I mean it's retail so what do you expect? I only accepted being here at the time because I hit a bump in the road. I had a good team of people to work with and that was because it was 4 of us going from store to store doing projects. I was the only one that drove so most days the guys would ride along, ( no problem, they were great guys) they looked out with lunch and gas money from time to time because family dollar refused compensation most of the time after offering it. EX: You can drive 20 miles a day which is 100 for a 5 day work week. They try to say oh well let me look up the mileage and subtract who knows what and pay you for 26 miles total. Not making this up, I wouldn't be surprised if they stopped offering to pay milage. Like I said avoid this company at all cost working wise. But if you need to shop, go for it. To each its own."
bad,didn't enjoy my time there at all  no help the manager was mostly the cashier.
bad,"I left because I could not live off of the wages they were paying. I was promoted to assistant and they were still paying me the cashier wages and didn't compensate or retro pay. I was in school full time as well and was forced to work overtime (when there was no store manager at the time) 50 + hours even on days of the week I had to be off because of school. I was also expected to work and open and close the store when I had the Flu.  Most of the people that work there are stuck with no other career options and are so used to it they don't want to leave their comfort zone, and others are working there temporarily just to have a job. Upper management doesn't care. They don't care if you're working the store ALONE, but they do expect you to follow protocol to the T.. ALONE. You will make around 750 a wk as a store manager but you'll be working 72 hrs. No overtime. They make you sign a waiver now so you will not get paid that overtime due to countless lawsuits they have faced. Assistant managers are LUCKY if they get paid 11 an hr, and that's an overstatement. They do NOT turn the air conditioner on in the summer, actually.. They do but its so low you wouldn't even know. Even customers complain and have called corporate and they still don't care. I would leave work DRENCHED. CUSTOMERS would actually call and complain to corporate because they can visually see how Family Dollar ABUSES their employees and there has been NO changes for YEARS. Your co workers are the pest part of the job if your store happened to have hired decent people. Half of the people they have attracted to"
bad,"A typical day was busy with more work than could be done with the amount of employees available. I learned how to deal with difficult people with grace and a smile.The management was, for the most part, difficult. My co-workers were friendly but generally not very helpful. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the amount of physical work but the best part of the job was helping customers."
bad,"Recovering the store is the hardest part of the job, the places you would find items was shocking. I've learned how to use the register, developed communication skills with customers and maintain a clean work environment. My co-workers are helpful, we all pitch in to get the job done when there's a lot to be done."
bad,A typical day at family dollar with a female manager is horrible. nothing but drama.
bad,as a store manager they expect you to do everything on your own with very little help. they will throw you into a store do an inventory a month later and blame you if it goes bad. they expect you to work off the clock and not tell anyone. sorriest company i ever worked for. i put my 2 week notice in and the next day they fired me.
bad,"working hard"
bad,"I loved being assistant manager, but the pay wasn't worth the hassle I consumed while working there."
bad,Long hours. Had to unload the truck too many times and manage the store. I didn't enjoy working for this company at all.
bad,Managers ignorant and scream at you instead of telling you what to do
bad,"Open the store get job duties for myself and employees."
bad,"In the beginning the management consisted of people who had admirable work ethic and a devotion to customer service as well as ethical treatment of their workers. New management took over and the store went downhill. The new people mistreated customers to the point of them taking business elsewhere. Money began coming up short and cashiers where blamed despite being under surveillance by security cameras which proved our innocence but it seemed as if the new management needed someone to blame and constantly harassed workers which resulted in meaningless and undeserved firings. I quit due to the harassment and before anyone could frame me and ruin my clean work record that Ive put my heart and soul into. After I quit money continued coming up short. Two managers went to other stores where money began coming up short. This resulted and a district manager, two store managers as well as four assistant managers being wrote up and fired"
bad,"The management were not helpful,the paid was minimal. I loved my job for the first six months but then everything changed and the employers showed that they cared not about their employees."
bad,They work you to death then when your pay gets too high they get rid of you.
bad,"Open store, count safe , crew come in and we start the day!! Most enjoyable part was the truck and counting inventory. The hardest part was dealing with unfair store managers while you do all there work for them. My co works and teams members was awesome. I learned everything from opening, closing, inventory, and great customer service skills."
bad,"A typical day at work is usually a 7 to 10 hour shift with no breaks. Ringing customers, cleaning the whole store and recovering the whole store with you and 1 other person most of the time. Managament is ok at best. My store manager would sit in his office all shift and play on his phone. There is no job security, they like to go on firing sprees where they will fire everyone and start out with a whole new crew every 6 months or so. I learned not to trust any managment there. The best part of the job is having co workers (outside of the store manager) who are loyal and actually do some work."
bad,not at all about there workers more concerned about making money and getting the most out of workers for as little compensation as possible
bad,Work 70 to 80 hours a week. very high turnover with employees. lack of quality applicants for staffing. low pay for part time associates
bad,Family Dollar abuses their employees.. Primarily the managers.
bad,Wasn't pleasant at all. Higher management didn't care about employees only concerned was the customer. Store managers have to worked over 80 hours a week to get work done. They didn't have any concerns about day to day operation.
bad,"Handling money, setting displays, ect."
bad,"I was treated with no respect, only had a budget enough for 5-6 employees total to run the store 7 days a week from 9am to 9pm. Never was complimented for my hard work and long hours. I worked at least 65 to 72 hours a week doing everything from unloading the freight trucks to cleaning the toilets and floors and taking the trash out. They had no trust in the employees so management had to do it."
bad,I am not happy with this job because it is not at all what I was told it was going to be. This is not a good job to work at if you have a family because they don't care about that at all.
bad,This place is CRAZY. The 1st shift shipping manager came from Toys R US and has no clue how to load trailers or manage team members...don't think he has a green card. This guy is weird always touching people and talking spanish around english speaking people...afterall this AMERICA...wake up AMERICA & FAMILY DOLLAR
bad,"Store is always understaffed and most Family Dollar stores are. There's high turnover because these stores are also poorly managed. In my case, it was definitely the district manager to blame on that one. I never had the time to truly give the customer the time he/she deserved and that made me upset. There were just too many things that I was responsible for and it wasn't fair to the customer."
bad,"Every day there is just a skeleton crew and it sucks. Pay is VERY low and raises, if you even get one, are lame. They don't care about their employees at all any more and will get rid of you in order to hire cheaper labor. There is job security only because no one wants to work there."
bad,They were rude and disrespectful I didn't like there poor management.there were alot of people who have been talking bad about the workers.nothing was hard about the job.
bad,Working is difficult for to management. A lot of put downs. Hard to advance because higher management gets jealous and trys to hold you back for one reason or another
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked! Upper management treats the store employees like trash. They absolutely refuse to give overtime, they expect you to work off the clock to meet their deadlines. Family Dollar is hands down the worst job I've ever had."
bad,"No benefits unless a manager. No flexibility. If your sick or dying you’ll die behind the register or you’ll be fired. It’s constant bouncing between the register and stock. Pay sucks, 2 smoke breaks if your lucky. No discounts. Drug testing. Honestly if you can help it don’t work here. I was good at my job and my coworkers were okay but I was miserable here. I felt like a zombie, and took out my frustrations on my family. The pay is NOT worth  what they expect from you."
bad,"The upper management team does not care about ANY of their employees, ONLY about the bottom dollar. Your safety, well being is alllll on YOU. No breaks or lunches and no hours for cashier's, awful place to work."
bad,Do not work at the family Dollar in Smithfield VA. It's a bad work environment and bad management. I had co-workers that would do the bare minimum while only one person was working twice as hard..............................................................................................................
bad,The only place that I have worked and reported the things that an employer would want you to report like theft and i'm the one let go. I guess I was messing up the little hustle they had on the side.
bad,"rvp rick smith sucks!! no work balance at all!! stuck working up to 80 hours a week often very understaffed and worked many shifts alone, which is not safe"
bad,"There is a lot of preferences and if you don't go to work when the manager calls you(even if it's your day off) then you are going to receive bad faces. "
bad,Working at the family dollar is a joke unless it's just for a little extra cash. Don't expect much! Some of the part time workers only get 5 hours a week. Assistant Managers are not allowed over 36 - 40 hours a week. The pay is not worth it! This company doesn't care about the employees. Other employees don't do anything.
bad,"Lack of consistent leadership at corporate level. No access to people if you have questions, everything is automated. Dollar Tree changes are not compatible with multi-price point business model.  Labor is continually cut, while additioal responsibilities are being added. Training budgets cut."
bad,"I was hired as a Cashier and the only part of the job that I enjoyed was interacting with the customers..I found myself working every shift with the same Asst Manager and he was terrible..I rarely got my breaks and he constantly would decide to be the Cashier himself and stick me with stocking the shelves..You aren't trusted at all and I don't like that feeling.."
bad,"It was stressful and unprofessional. Management as far up as it goes only cared about keeping the store open through all conditions, even a robbery. Employees are under paid and overworked. You have to slave impossible work hours just for the smallest amount of vacation time. I never saw my family, it was one of those jobs u look back on and can laugh because you've come so far."
bad,I was literally in fear for my life working here there was multiple robberies and other mishaps upper management was not understanding too to the robberies
bad,My typical day was working alone for about 6 hours while running register alone and trying to work freight . I got no breaks and had to try and snack between customers so my sugar didnt drop too bad. No time for family life and was never able to use my PTO time or vacation time even though I earned 40 hrs of each.
bad,I worked there for two years and they fired me unfairly. They still havent paid me for my last week working there. That was three months ago. I would not recommend working there.
bad,"Company has no clue what they are doing. Long hours low pay bad benefits ridiculous expectations while giving no hours nor manpower to do it. No safety precautions for crew or customers. Store never have enough empoyees, cashiers generslly get no hours. Turnover is excedingly high. All around horrid company to work for."
bad,"Not worth the time. They make anyone of any worth a manager so there were 5 managers in my store, if you count the absentee store manager and yet, somehow there was always coverage issues. Too many problems to list but it's been 3 years since I quit and I refuse to even shop there because of the distaste I still have for the company."
bad,"They over work you and under pay you. Management is terrible and don’t care about their crew. They will promise advancement, but you never actually get the opportunity to advance. They will just hire in people off the street to fill the position before they give some one a promotion."
bad,"I wouldn't let my worst enemy work for this company. Never enough staffing or payroll. The starting pay is not competitive with a walmart or target. The stores are messy and dirty. When it comes to shoplifters,they ought to call Family Dollar,Free Dollar. Corporate doesnt care about external theft,more focused on if the employees steal.."
bad,"Upper management complains about labor being over and wants u to be a robot and get everything stocked from truck, and recover 100% of store with 2 people. You will be reprimanded if not done."
bad,Not enough staff and time to get things done. 75%of the time you'll be at the store by yourself. Corporate keeps the stores at such low staff levels that if someone calls out there is no one to call in and cover the shift so you'll be stuck by yourself closing which is dangerous since there is no security at all. Company doesn't care for their employees well being and security. Pay is not the greatest and the benefits are expensive. No.one gets full time except managers. Only way cashiers get over 30 hours a week is if they are the only cashier at the store then you won't get a day off either.  This company is only great if you are wanting to get some customer service or retail experience.
bad,"The location I worked at, everybody was stealing, corporate was blind. The manager never did much, was always outside smoking. The employees did most of the work in the store. It took him more than a day to even finish a schedule."
bad,Management stole an taught the crew how to steal on Hwy 171.. She the only 1 still got her job .. It was a nasty store full of rats the store manager was always on the phone at the register very rude. No customer service .. So glad that place is closed down . Now they stealing from the other stores.. Have at it theives
bad,I personally had a terrinle experience working for Family Dollar and I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for them . The management is terrible in my opinion.
bad,Not enough labor hours to get stuff done. Too much theft and not enough security. I would not recommend to anyone to work here. District Managers and higher need to work in one specific store for like three weeks straight so they can see what really happens and stop making stupid rules and regulations.
bad,"Family Dollar does not care about its employees one bit. You could be going through the worst crisis imaginable and they will write you up and threaten to fire you for just asking for a few days off to deal with whatever hardship you are going through. Management and other coworkers can be fine depending on who you’re working with however they will most likely slack the entire time which will force you to pick up for said slack. They will either give you so many hours you can’t handle your outside of work responsibilities or so few hours that you might as well not be working at all. The pay fluctuates from $7.25/ hour to $9.00/ hour for starting positions. The worst however are the customers. Obviously at any retail/ fast food job you are going to deal with people but the people that you will deal with at Family Dollar will make you give up what little hope in humanity you had. They are the most ignorant, rude, ghetto and arrogant people in the world. I don’t know what it is about Family Dollar that attracts such customers but no matter what Family Dollar you work at it will be the same."
bad,I would still be there but there was a problem with bing a sister in law to the supervise d even though she knew it before hiring me on it is a nice place and I liked the hours I worked
bad,"I didn't go into the job expecting benefits, but I was promised a promotion. What I got was rampant shoplifting, very little police presence, and a very fast burnout. Family Dollar purposely puts their stores in neighborhoods where there is very little police presence, so it wasn't uncommon to have scary encounters with customers, shoplifting, and even fights and drug deals happen right outside the door. This company frequently overworks and undercompensates it's employees, and violates company standards and procedures to try and make a profit. Equipment will stay broken for months, and corporate will turn a blind eye to the problems you face, but god forbid you don't upsell enough candy bars that month. Family Dollar does not care about its employees and would work you to death if they could."
bad,"We are always short staffed and it’s hard to find quality candidates in the application pool. Pay and benefits are okay in management, but the rest of it sucks at the store level"
bad,Would have stayed if the store manager actually did his/her job instead of always having his/her phone glued to their ears. Still not worth the headche if u ask me.
bad,"Stock the  merchandise, I learned how to handle cash. Management was poor the really did not care about nobody.The work culture sucked.The hardedt part about the job was going to work.I love going to work because the customers"
bad,"Not a good company weak values.  They dont care about associates"
bad,This is the worst company to work for you have to watch your back every 5 mins people running out people fighting this place is dangerous af ! They are strict to employees but does not give a care about them ! Management is rude af ! I could go on for days
bad,Being a store manager here was the most stress I have ever been under and because my health was affected. I work well around 100 hours a week and was only off on Sunday. I was thrown in a store with no training and even with that I got my shrink down considerably from the previous year when I was just assistant.
bad,"family dollar is a do it yourself company they do not provide you the help that you need and does not care about your personal life, they will leave you high and dry when it comes down to it when they want something done they want it done when they want it to be done and if its not done they will let you go no matter the circumstances"
bad,as long as you dont take a management position the job is fine. i only recommend this job as a starter job or second job part time. i feel they aslo need to do quarterly raises it would motivate their workers more.
bad,the absolute worst the management is terrible  the workers are treated like garbage and over worked with  zero compensation for the hours worked. unless you are in school and desperate to get by DO NOT PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THAT SUFFERING
bad,"They work you . When the truck comes in you are expected to move so many pieces an hour. They have these charts that say so many people should do this in so many hours. Your Area Manager says this. But he is so out of shape he cant do it.  For the record that hour per piece is if the truck is in perfect condition,  but it never is. "
bad,"Not somewhere that appreciates their employees. Stressful environment,hostile customers, some not all. Money problems always. Loved regular customers, employees barely work,and the attitude is worst"
bad,"I would only recommend this to a teen that needs a part time job or something to get them thru college. Don't waste your beautiful youth in a place like this! These people will work you like a dog, pay you like a slave, and appreciate nothing you do. They will how you for the cashier position but they also want you to stock and play security while you do it. The customer service position is easily three jobs stuffed in one. Oh and don't get robbed!! These people are more concerned about the financial lost than any employee emotional trauma or life for that matter!"
bad,"No growth opportunity."
bad,The manager is mean she has a lot of stress on her but she takes it out on her employees. Which is why we all quit. Other than that they're an okay company. The pay sucks for the amount of work you have to do as an ASM so I'd recommend walmart
bad,as a store manager you are required to work a minimum of 52 hours per week.  you are required to stay overnight and work to ensure everything is completed.  It wouldn't be so bad if upper management gave you the support and had your back when you needed help.  the best part of the job is the customers.  The worst part is being consistently told that everything you do is not good enough.
bad,"RUN!!!!! This place treats employees like gum stuck to the bottom of their shoe. RUN!!!!! They expect way too much out of people, including forget that you have a family.I was a manager, I was fired for allegedly failing to protect company assets by the new DM who never told me I could no longer do this, never wrote me up, just let me finish out the closing and then fired me. This company is famous for doing this practice to seasoned managers so they can bring someone else in at a lower wage."
bad,To much Favoritism and do as i say not what i do. the management does not do her job and makes other people do the stuff she dont want to do. they come and go as they want
bad,As a assistant manager in family dollar it was tuff dealing with customers. and workers that would never want to complit work tasks some times not even show up for work witch pretty much maid me stronger i would say and more capable of gaining more experience in such situations
bad,"Constantly getting robbed or stolen out of, very unfocused culture, lots of under the table things going on, dm manager very un-engaged with the team of store managers"
bad,"Needs better management,  more hours and benefits. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here unless it was a secondary job. Even then it's a bad place to work."
bad,Too much gossip managers having relationships with the workers just really messy nothing is never in order managers act like they care it’s just crazy and I was over it
bad,"Upper management was definately an issue. I was employed at the Kennett location for less than six months, but worked under 5 different Store Managers in that period if time."
bad,it was very horrible worst experience ever. bad superisors and managers. stores are unorganized. and the workers are lazy and they expect you to work for you and your coworkers
bad,"CVS is one of the most corrupt corporate companies that I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Our own store managers would tell us that we weren't allowed to get over part-time hours for more than so much time, or they had to give you full-time with benefits. I worked full-time hours for over a year, and was never actually promoted, just told that I would be. I was also trying to become a shift-supervisor, so I too could sit around in the office making personal phone calls or shopping on my phone, but I was told that due to my ""pre-existing condition"" (pregnancy), that I was unable to be promoted to that, either. CVS left an awful bitter taste in my mouth, and I would never recommend anyone getting a job here."
bad,"I really don't like that at all they are disorganized managers don't know how to talk to co-workers employees. When I ask for help, I was ignoring not once not twice but four times."
bad,"the job takes to much of your personal life, there are times when people walk off there are times when customers come in to fight the employees this is no help from corporate"
bad,"Low hrs to work it's a seasonal job , would have to go to other stores for decent hrs and went from weekly pay to bi-weekly pay. Opening new stores everywhere and not paying there employees a decent wage for all the work they have to do."
bad,if not up front for cashier then you would be put to clean and organize the store. Also you help unload the truck with the weekly orders.It was a decent job.
bad,"This is a awwful place to work. The work load is very heavy youre pretty much loss prevention, a manager, stocker, cashier, cart pusher, HR, armour car and maintnace all these titles for only 9-11 dollars and they also cut your hours to 35-38 but give cashier 40 because they ate watching over time but the want you to fix a damage store and make it pwrfect i know store managers thats been her 21 years and only make 15 dollars a hour and they hate giving a raise i cant work her for the penny pinch money the give people if gods will ill never work in this establishment ever again if i do t have too."
bad,family dollar is not a great job .it more then for 5 poeple and it need to be done in two day or u lose ur job .you have to worry to much about the people it the store mag never work at family dollar it sucks.
bad,"Overall I have 16 years experience in retail, I worked harder than the management. I was the only cashier and they always scheduled me at night. Didn't like the hours and the management didn't care enough to give you a break 90% of the time!! This job is for a younger person that likes to work nights..."
bad,"A typical day at work at Family Dollar was always stressful, degrading and difficult.  It was a fast paced place, which is fine with me but when you have a manager that won't stop gossiping and saying bad things about you, it becomes stressful."
bad,was out right told by the district manager that my life didn't matter and i must get to the store no matter what was happening... at that time 2 deaths in the family.  was hospitalized with pneumonia but ordered to leave the hospital to cover my store cause it wasn't a priority.  loved my team and how much praise i received for turning that store into a place customers actuality wanted to shop in  but the district manager made work and my life so stressful
bad,"With my team member we always find a way to make the place fun when we working i learn how to be fast when i got a project to do .customer service ,stock,merchandise ,clean and be loss prevention too"
bad,A typical work day is when you do above whats expected and your manager still complains about what you haven't done. Never a good day of work in Family Dollar.
bad,"Family Dollar is not a place that will work with you. It is a hard job that is very fast pace. They make sure that you know you may not have your job tomorrow if you don't get things done in a timely manner as well as making sure your customers are taken care of and that you stop all the shoplifters that may come in. You are the manger, cashier, security guard, bookkeeper, and the janitor."
bad,"I found management to be quick to pass blame on to subordinates. They berate employees to come in and help out, then ride employees hard about excessive hours. No respect for your off days. I worked every weekend i was there and when I requested days off management would somehow still not schedule them and not be in a rush to correct the issue. I would have to say I had to go to court to get off (but you can't do that on weekends, because there is no court on weekends). The days that i specified when hired as days i needed off, were totally ignored."
bad,"As an Assistant Manager at Family Dollar, you are constanly picking up the slack for the Store Manager and Cashiers. You are the back bone of the store. The Cashiers are lazy and the Store Manager is constantly absent. No one wants to show up for their shifts. There are thieving customers everyday and the company refuses to hire a security company to help protect the products. So every inventory we have a huge loss and every body who works there is blamed for it and they would send loss prevention out to interrogate us."
bad,"A typical day starts off with off loading Products for inventory and distribution, which I enjoyed. A lack of a cohesive TEAM was a challenge. The culture was chaotic often."
bad,"Because family dollar stores are located in small towns, there can be a high amount of drama between coworkers and customers alike.  This is stressful.  Very low wage job with low annual raises."
bad,"Straightening my area, Stocking the merchandise, Greeting the customers as they enter the store, ringing the customer up. Helping the customers when they aren't able to find what they are going for. Being available when the manager needs me. Training other employees."
bad,I have definately had worse jobs. The fact that management team is very friendly supportive and willing to work with you concerning the schedule if you have to take a second job is what has kept me there. I appreciate the flexibility. A typical work day consists of a steady stream of customers. Ther hardest part of the job occasionally having difficulty trying to find a menber of management when faced with a situation that requires a managers approval on the register with a growing line of customers The most enjoyabe part is recognizing most of the customers and forming bonds with them.
bad,Most days as an asst mg I was there by myself for a full shift doing everything. This job is stressful and I wouldn't recommend anyone working here. Pay could be better
bad,"other stores I hear good thing from employers but our manager does not show any compassion for emergencies. If you have a fever and are scheduled, you are required to go to work, no matter how sick you are but she doesn't have to be back if she doesn't want to be. she bends the rules for herself but expects others to pick up her slack and do their jobs without questions. she has no leadership skills and I hated every second of working under her control."
bad,When I started working for family dollar things were very good.But after a year they build another store and our store manager left to go to the new store.After that took place I was placed as the store manager because nobody else wanted the job.three months later I was replaced by a younger and more experienced store manger without any warning plus they never offered to train me to stay the store manager.While all this was going on they replaced the original district manager with another one that was absolutely horrible to work for and he was very disrespectful to me at least.
bad,I dealt with alot of petty managers and liars and thieves working here i didnt like it so i put my two weeks noticed and left to a more advanced and better pay elsewhere. i would not recommend this place for a job to anyone.
bad,I would actually go back to the company I had left to to manager support for the assistant managers I was with the company three years even had a baby
bad,"At first, this job was a lot of fun. You have an opportunity to meet new people in the town. I learned the responsibility of being an assistant manager of a Store. The Manager in the store is not a good person to work for. She had been reported several times by customers and employees but managed to lie her way out of the charges. She would require employees to lie for her with the threat of dismissal."
bad,"there is a serious lack of understanding between management and the employed. no training or lack of proper training. safety violations and lack of knowledge to their existence. not to mention the high level of favoritism shown throw out different levels of the company. If you're not holding everyone accountable, why hold anyone accountable? the pay is HIGHLY inadequate for the jobs employees are asked to preform, in most cases the moral of the teams is slim to non with no possibility of improvement left in the hands of management. If I were running this company, there would be a total over hall & restructuring immediately."
bad,"A typical work day is one employee stuck on the register for 7 hours while the manager is on their phone somewhere in the store. I learned how to work a register and the procedures you have to take to handle money. Management is always terrible. I had about 4 different managers in the 6 months I worked there, and they all were incredibly lazy and immature. There's not much of a work place culture. We were there for a check that's it. No two people are peers either, so making friends is a little harder. The hardest park of the job is standing on a concrete floor for the whole shift in one spot not moving. The most enjoyable was how conveniently located to my home it was."
bad,Very quite easy work not a lot to do really convenient in town good hours . you stock shelves hang stuff lunches you get to go home if you want. Not bad
bad,"Not a place to build a career, this company lacks in store budget hour fot the associates and us Manager don't have enough resting time in our private life to regenerate and bring to the table out Management skills. the company is just very poor in budget to keep the store up to their standards."
bad,"Too few workers and budget"
bad,I just want a job i really want to work i get along with everybody and i just want to get work i just need a chance to show you that thank you for reading it and giving me a chance to work for you
bad,"I was salaried for 55 hours a week, was routinely pulling 100. I did not enjoy my experience; had frequent instances of executive level staff showing contempt for my employees."
bad,"The family dollar I work for was very unorganized, and we did not have stable management in the store. The store was always getting robbed which in that case made me feel unsafe during my work shift. The store was also not good with working with my work schedule."
bad,A typical day at work was always very busy. I learned no matter how much I work so hard I would not get appriciated. Not only I had to manage a high volume store I would do everything else. I would hire really good co-workers. My hardest part of the job was off loading a truck I really did not mind it work is work to me. The most enjoyable part of my job was everyone knew who I was and respected me.
bad,Just say no unless you really need a job. At least don't stay there too long. Top to bottom the worse place to be if you are an actual hard worker.
bad,"fast paced work environment."
bad,"As an assistant manager I was limited in what I could do by myself, I was micro managed then would receive write ups when I did not complete a task that was my store manager's responsibility. "
bad,the only plus is they have excellent health insurance and the pay for store manager is good. This is a extremely hard job on the body and your mind.
bad,the schedules are inconsistent for mangers and not set schedules caused impediment to other life interests and goals.
bad,"You arrive to work clock in and get to work as either an Assist. Manager or Cashier, You handle customers and stock the shelve, put up displays and handle the money with the deposits daily."
bad,"They care nothing about there employees,work u every holiday with no holiday pay or compensation.They willput your life in grave danger to protect there products no matter the cost."
bad,"Family Dollar is not a horrible place to work.  The management style from District Managers and up needs to change.  They need to more involved at store level.  The payroll budgets are ridiculous!!!!  Therefore, the salaried managers are required to make up those hours.  There were multiple times I had to 90 hours a week due to payroll cuts.  The flow of the delivery trucks is also absurd."
bad,"Enjoy working with people and the general public ,working in management was not a good experience due to not being train properly and over work having to learn on my own due to store manger not doing her job properly"
bad,"I worked as a store manager in the Raleigh area for a little less than two years.  As a store manager you are required to work 6 days a week.  The compensation is salaried and I averaged 70 to 80 hours a week.  A full staff consists of around 5 to 7 other employees so if someone calls in, the fill-in list is small and you generally get stuck covering the shift.  As a manager, you are everything - you are a stocker, cashier, scan analyst, DSD receiver, reset team and deal with everything team.  The customers treat you like garbage because the target market is low-income, uneducated clients."
bad,"stressful no appreciation and no support for family issues or family at all.IT SUCKED  would not recommend to anybody"
bad,"My usual day consisted of opening the store, booting up registers, checking petty cash. Checking everything was done the night before according to store policies. Making sure customers have an enjoyable experience shopping at our store and maintaining safe and secure environment."
bad,"Overall I loved working there. Great customers and employees, It was a awesome experience. Most of the higher power makes it bad for everyone else. The hardest part was leaving."
bad,"Working at Family Dollar was a rewarding experience.  I loved my job and sometimes it got hectic, but I keep on smiling and got thru.  If anyone is looking for a rewarding career this business has it.  I don't regreat working there I just think that the new District Manager needed to be a little more Diverse. "
bad,A typical day I pined and hung up clothes and put others stock out and ran a register. I learned to stay strong no matter what. The main manager there wasn't nice to me at all and I pretended to like her just to get the job done. I was pregnant and she would through things in the floor and make me pick them up. Once there was something in the floor and I got yelled at for not picking it up. I couldn't pick it up because I was stuck at the register because we were busy. The only thing enjoyable about this job was working with the asst. Manager.
bad,Company and upper mgt practiced illegal work methods and unethical business decisions. Was not trained and was not given tools to succeed.
bad,not the company I thought it was. they will tell you anything to get you to help them out but doesn't follow up on their promises to the employees
bad,The managers were very unorganized. Did not communicate well. Were not straight forward about anything.
bad,unless you have a GREAT team this company set you up to fail. You work off of little payroll and most times 106 hrs per week
bad,very low pay for the amount of customer complaints you get.  i was robbed at gunpoint and my boss didnt care at all.  just wanted to make sure i would keep working
bad,What I learned at Family Dollar is the customer is always right.
bad,"I only worked there a couple months but the manager was always on the phone. I requested a day off for my sons first birthday and they was mad about it, and I was constantly being called into work."
bad,"hours of work were okay."
bad,Certain Members of management at the one i work at in brockton picks favorites and does not base hours on work performance as it should be
bad,"The store had no security personnel who also had to cover other stores.  So it was up to managemet to oversee security and prevent theft shoplifters.  Had a high rate of management turnover because of being robbed...even at gunpoint."
bad,I like working here but I don't like the management it a good plce to work but it nt for me 
bad,I love th customers that i helped daily but i think they really need to do better background checks when it comes to management and find more people with a postive attitude
bad,Failure by upper management to provide adequate support to be able to run the business and day to day smoothly
bad,"I worked at family dollar distribution in Rome for a while, I will say that if you want to work at a place where it's constant gossip and problem starting then this is the place for you. Also, if they don't like you they will any reason they can to fire you. In my own personal experience, you also won't get any help from their human resource department or corporate when you have an issue. I've tried to contact them multiple times for pay check issues and all of my attempts have been ignored. There are some good managers, but the company in general does not care for its employees needs or actually finding a solution to any problem an employee is having."
bad,A typical work day is unloading shipment and only having 24 hours to get doorself done. I learned how to be mulit-tasker while working at Family Dollar. Management is good if you have a good core team. The hard part of the job a is stopping the theft in the store due to no security in urban community.The most enjoyable is getting to know all the people in the neigbhorhood that shop at the establishment.
bad,You work like a slave for the little money.It's a very unsafe work environment.It's every man for themselves.The hardest part is working without what you need.The most enjoyable time is when it's time to go home.
bad,"This is the worst company to work for. Low pay, high thief, unprofessional management. I think the company hire anyone to be the store manager with a 9th grade education. One store manager couldn't even speak English let alone help customers if they had a problem. The company pay the asst. manager just a few cents more than the cashier, which isn't much. Upper management talk to the employees with no respect. No discount. Just terrible."
bad,"Good place to work if you want to meet people, however Salaried personal are asked to work more house then signed up for"
bad,Your work day always had more work then you could accomplish. You felt behind everyday. You never got caught up. You never had enough employees on. Your boss was never happy. Too much stress for the pay. Managers worked too many hours.
bad,The job had a great atmosphere whenever I came to work. Although I had decent work hours including the extra hours I was told there where open positions for advancement when there wasn't and then when I was told of another position with greater pay and more hours I took the position. When it was time for me to get paid I was never compensated for the new position even after I notified management they fired me with no reason.
bad,They don’t care for their employees if you get into management get the experience and transfer to another company. If you have little kids I wouldn’t recommend none of the stores in the west end .
bad,Management seems to act uneducated. I was told to work off the clock by one of the assistant managers several times or I’d lose my job. They make you take your unpaid lunch in the front of the store so you can watch for customers while they work in the back .
bad,This is a job I honestly don't see a future for a person of my background at this company. This particular company has it's best interest for their GM's while disrespecting and disregarding their other worker's issues.
bad,"I would not recommend this company at all. No matter how hard you work, or are always there to cover shifts it's not appreciated. Customer report for me was outstanding. I love ppl. But when someone feels threatened there they will make you quit. I was asked to resign  because on camera it looked like I angrily ripped off a receipt paper and threw it at a customer... How can you even do that? 🤔"
bad,I worked in the trailer shop. Management has it's favorites and if you're lucky enough to be one of them you're golden. Employees rat each other out for anything to gain favor with the bosses. They do have good benefits if you need them. Overtime is mandatory and depending on the time of year can be often. Pay is good for the area. I never worked in the warehouse.
bad,"They threw me in with no training because everyone quit after the store was robbed. No they treat us like trash because we're cleaning up the last crews mess. The computer has been known to glitch over night and theyre threatening to do a ""mass fire"" never mind the fact that most of us there put in 50 hr weeks+ when we started because they hadn't hired anyone. Don't think for a second youre anything but replaceable working here."
bad,"This company needs alot of help with upper management, while my immediate manager was a god send, any further up left slot to be desired, not supportive."
bad,"Being the store manager, cashier, stocker and loss prevention. Can't take lunch break. Just one day off per week and they usually call for money change."
bad,"The location I was at the manager would fire you because she didnt like you, have you work extra hours then remove them from your time card, and dont complain about it because that isnt any help."
bad,Trucks are always to big too much holiday items it’s always lots of overstock products that never goes out the higher management don’t never come around
bad,Family dollar pay is good when you become an assistant store manager. That is wishful thinking on its own because many people play favoritism on who they want to promote or even who they want to bless with hours. Company does NOT care about employees and does bare minimum to absolutely nothing to ensure their safety on the job. A fellow manager and I literally got threaten ten times on the clock. If you have any value for yourself DO NOT DO
bad,Its a decent first job but for people with experience I wouldn't recommend it. It's like once you become a manager if your trying to move up there's no moving back down. Essentially you are a manager until you quit or get fired. And they really call you in on almost all days off but hardly wanna pay the overtime
bad,Not a good place to work. No family work blance. Work almost 100 a week.. the compay dont care if u sick or not as long as the dyore opens. You get no help from the dm. You are on your own unless u kiss butt.
bad,It was a nice job for extra cash something to do I meet lots on people it was close to my neighborhood an I shop at family dollar all the time I'm big customer the time
bad,"Don't have one. District Manager trying to have sex with little boys for candy!"
bad,"We would have a start up meeting,discussing the daily work load. My job was to find missing pallets and counting inventory. I would blind count inventory to make sure the computer counts are the same as the physical counts."
bad,"They overwork you"
bad,"Do not work here. You will be asked to sacrifice everything. Lunches are not guaranteed, complaints are only handled through management. If you have an issue with your manager or district manager, tough luck. The store gets a lot of theft, a lot of mess, and little respect for its employees."
bad,I would work for this company again in a different district. The store manager and district manager are manipulative liars who tell you what you want to hear and don't go through with anything. The pay was great but a sorry work experience over all
bad,Not a job for married people. You will work 60+ hours a week for salary based store manager. Assistant manager is the best position to have. I had two full time assistants at $15 an hour but the DM is constantly pressuring AM's to move up because of high turnover. The Manager will work open-close when assistants walk out leaving you holding the bag.  Customers & employees rob you blind.
bad,Turn over is high they expect you to do too much for the hours that they give you.... this job is a waste of time and the pay really sucks.  They do not give you enough hours per week to have help in the store it's only you and a cashier you have to do the stocking and all the planograms and so forth and also relieved the cashier
bad,"I worked there all right."
bad,"It was a fun place to work until I transferred stores.  I love working with the customers, running frieght and being able to set end caps and skematics.  I learned alot until the transfer then it became over whelming to me. The store manager is very rude and mean. The store is mess.  She will not let me do anything as far as end caps and seasonal sections.  All I do is unload truck and run the whole truck while she sits outside smoking.  Money be short sometimes and I am scared it is goingt to fall back on me. Just not used to the working conditions since I transfered"
bad,"Horrible. As long as freight was worked in 24 hours and payroll was under u was good. Slave work. In the store most of time by yourself because the lack of payroll but wanted so much done. Dangerous. No breaks, couldnt go to bank for being in store by self. Got in trouble for locking the store during business hours to go to bank across street and get change. Dont recommend"
bad,Worked here for 4 years. First fulltime job.  Gave me a ton of experience. The environment there was not conducive to a well rounded work environment. Morale was extremely low.
bad,"Is the basic of retail. However the company expectations are unrealistic. Most stores get approximately 190 hours per week for all employees. 12 hour shift for seven days. Managers are required a 52 hour minimum weekly. So  in reality you get 138 hours divided by the rest of your employees. The shrink it’s crazy bad because most thieves knows the lack of personnel.  Most managers have to work at least one day a week eight hours by themselves in order to save payroll.  Since District Manager and Regional Manager‘s get really good bonuses for payroll they force you to cut hours making you work over 50 hours and sometimes making double shift by yourself in order to meet their unrealistic expectations.  They also expect you to maintain a clean store with no help. Their system is, one cashier for a few hours during the shift and assistant manager to do recovery, shipment and everything else.  It is mandatory to work six days as a manager, no lunch  and brakes usually last no more than 10 minutes.  The job is very physical for the most part with limited hours. If you are a professional do not take this job, if you are starting a new career and have no family perhaps this is a place to begin. Additionally, work balance is non existent.  And the only day that you are off, Sundays expect a lot of phone calls and no-shows. The turn over it’s insane. Don’t worry I have seen in my career. Most Store Managers don’t last more than a year nor cashiers because of the lack of hours, lack of work balance and how physical the job is."
bad,"As manager, work too many hours for not enough pay. work 6-7 days a week, 52-70 hours a week. Not enough payroll to get the help you need. VERY VERY high employee turnover."
bad,"Managment did nothing but complain about how i did thing before i was properly trained. I was only trained to open the store but was scheduled to close after being shown how to do it only once I was hired fulltime but rarely worked more than 25 -30 hours per week. Terminated at 90day mark for ""cell phone usuage"" (i was taking a picture of schedule for myself) and. Not stocking freight fast enough but always worked alone for most of my shift and my cashier was also new so slow on register and struggling as well. "
bad,"I was an asm for family dollar The place is a JOKE! They give you a title but you work harder than mule along with    stocking shelves, cashiering, you may or may not get a break or lunch,your left .alone in the store, no one wanted to come to work, the customers curse you out, steal and eat the food (sometimes while you watched) and tell you that there's nothing you can do about it NO  staffSECURITY the stores are a mess! "
bad,They care so little about hard workers and I worked all major holidays but instead of time 1/2 i was given a days paypay that screwed you out of paid time off
bad,"Overall, my experience at the Family Dollar DC was not good. The salary was great, but the benefits sucked for salaried employees. As for management, everyone was nice, but there was no team effort. Everyone wanted to work individually and not help anyone advance. They try to promote positivity, but no one's attitude is good that works there."
bad,"I really thought family Dollar would be a good place but it’s not. Management is poor.  I worked over 80 hours for this company and was not appreciated for my work. I was criticized about everything and when asked what is it I’m doing wrong or what’s not right, I didn’t get a answer."
bad,they are wicked people on every level you can think of .I thought this job was sent to me by God but it wasnt it was sent by the devil and because God still allowed it to work for my good wouldnt tell anyone that is a believer dont work for family dollar .i had been at gun point and the manager didnt care and left in store at night by myself horrible work place .
bad,Working for this company has changed since I came to work 9 years ago. There is not a lot of help from your superiors but a lot is expected. The company has been in transition and I think there are still a lot of problems to work out.
bad,"CEO doesn’t care about the employees only about the products, sales, and money. It’s to many stores(Family Dollar) around the world and they don’t care about their employees safety. I have gotten robbed at least 3 times and they bring in security for a week and let them go.Its horrible!"
bad,family dollar seemed like a good company at first so maybe it was just my management but I had an awful experience and I feel like I was harassed and discriminated against and I would not recommend this company for anyone that I loved or cared for.
bad,You go in and work like a slave for however many hours you're scheduled doing more than one job but you're only paid for doing one. I learned that I never want to work for this company ever again in this life or another. Managers do not help their team complete Truck they only want to complete minuscule tasks and take credit for completed work. The co-workers you meet working in the modern day slave environments are hard working underpaid employees who don't deserve to be treated poorly and unfairly so the top people in the company can sit back and collect money on the backs of these employees! The hardest part of the job is watching a fellow co-worker who doesn't have enough education or training in any other field have to stick that job that brings her self esteem and her family down and have to stay working for this company. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the day I found it in my heart to walk away from a job I knew I wasn't going to make it in as a future betterment of me and for my family.....it was the smartest most abundant decision I've made ever in my life! God blessed me to have the strength To walk away and stop subjecting myself to failure . I am glad to that I did not settle.....for he that is in me cause me to want more for myself and my family.
bad,"This company makes every job assigned to you much harder then it needs to be.  Setting schematics is a pain there is never actually enough space on the shelf.  Higher ups complain about overstock being in your back room but do not let you order your own merchandise.  Family dollar is probably the worst company I have worked for.  They also do not give holiday pay for any holidays except Easter and Christmas.  They also will not pay overtime.  Hours are awful, work every holiday."
bad,"Basically a horrible company to work for. Bad management from the store level on up. Antiquated computer system. They want all this work done, but don't want to pay any overtime, or hire enough people to get the jobs done. In my case, I had a great store manager, but once he left for greener pastures, I started looking for another job the next day. No other reason to stay there."
bad,"Family Dollar was not a good company to work for if you were a regular team member. Managment was awesome but the pay was not very good, no work-like balance, and no benefits unless you were the store manager. I can not even say that ASM glad any benefits. It is good for people who want a job just for the pay or have a goal to work toward as a store manager i guess, but even then advancement opportunities are almost non existing. It was tough for me to move up I was training but got overlooked."
bad,"Opening the store was the easiest part of the job.  The worse part are the hours given for your associates.  Which makes you have to work harder and more hours.  Unloading trucks, and the demand to get all merchandise out the same day, was nearly impossible with the hours given.   Higher management was no help."
bad,"So I won't say much. Horrible employee morale, same with security measures in most of the stores. This type of work culture seemed to be normal because from the time I started working there positive resolution or proper work practices seemed to shock other employees who had been there longer. . . ."
bad,It didn't matter how much you had worked or how long you worked that day they really take advantage of you because they made it clear that you are replaceable and getting a hold of HR was close to impossible they really try to intimidate you and scare you rather than make you feel like you are appreciated for what you do for them
bad,At my store we would get robbed a lot. There would be people threatening staff and all corporate would do is give us LP agent and rely on a person who isn't in the store to call for assistance. We had to beg them not to elongate the holiday hours for the store because at night is when it gets really bad. Our manage went against corporate and didnt stay open for our safety. Our manage was the most hard working and patient man. When we was stored assistant store manager because they sent them to another store he worked 2 open-close shifts worked 7 days a week to make sure his only assistant manager didnt get over worked.
bad,This company is not good to work for. You do not get breaks or lunch/dinner breaks. You have to work way too hard for the money they want to pay you. You can not hardly have a life while you work here as the schedule changes at a moments notice. They do not care about their employees safety as they make you work by yourself quite often. I would not recommend this company.
bad,"4 DMs in 4 months...expected work week was 52+, But often north of 65-70. One day off per week IF you were lucky. Very hard to hire help due to low pay. The biggest problem is the cliques. If you weren't in it, they threaten to fire you or do their best to make you quit by making your day horrible by setting impossible tasks and telling you you're fired if you don't do it. Hardest part was making your schedule and the DM telling you you can't go home until..."
bad,"This may be a company to work for if you are just starting out in retail but at my age and experience, I would not say it is a very good company to work for. My own personal experience,  I have worked back to back shifts with less than 8 hours in between,  10 hour shifts with no meal break and was scheduled several times to work the facility alone."
bad,I really enjoyed working at Family Dollar for the short time I was there. However if I could do it all over again I would've made sure my focus wasn't on having good relationships with my co-workers. The reason I say that is because it offended me whenever I would come on shift people would barely speak to me. It was extremely stressful; and I was also dealing with the passing of my girlfriend whom I was planning to marry in 2020.
bad,Always short handed. The store manager was great? Have to work different shifts and holidays. Computer system has errors. Store is not kept up to standards cause corporate does not allow enough hours for the store to hire enough people
bad,Every work day there sucked. The customers just don't stop coming no matter the day or the time. The workplace culture is awful. I would not work there ever again.
bad,"Poor Management, no work life balance and a lot of Executives who don't travel to stores and always just getting ready for Corporate visits to get stores cleaned up for a dog and pony show"
bad,"Not a safe environment, long work hours no work home life balance. With the work culture it hard to maintain staff work. Internal and external theft was a challenge."
bad,"The corporation sucks, they don't know what is going on in their stores and don't seem to care or take action when an employee has a valid complaint in any area."
bad,"Very stressful work environment, not enough staff to for. the daily tasks to be done efficiently.( The upper management  tells you what you want to hear and never follows through. They expect a lot from management very long work days and usually have to work seven days a week. No time for family at all! This job will burn you out fast and at the end of the day It’s not worth."
bad,this job started off okay the n it ended with me getting less hours. I did all the work that was asked of me and more but it never seem to be paid attention too.
bad,"overall a decent place to work ,However ; upper management was very abusive towards associates ! Store setup and displays were very haphazard , Prices were not accurate at times due to corporate mistakes."
bad,Company has a very high turnover rate because of non communication between upper management and employees. Pay is horrible also I was supposed to receive a raise after 90 day probation period but didn't. In the 5 months working there the store had 3 different store managers and two complete staff turnovers including district and regional managers. Most of the time the store was short staffed so there were either no breaks or they were short.
bad,I will never work for this company again. I hated how my manager treated me and I quit so i'm not allowed to work for the company ever again. I honestly don't like how the company is run.
bad,"The job like the city its located in, is rough and thankless since new management took over. A typical day is usually either being on cash register for several hours despite the store needing constant work and attention, or in the event an actual cashier is scheduled to work then and decides to show up, the tasks left by the manager seem nigh endless if not impossible. Most days are spent trying to make ends meet with stocking shelves or working schematics."
bad,"60 plus hrs a week"
bad,Great store good employees. Good location of store always busy makes tinne go by fast always see new faces great customer service lots of loyal customers
bad,"If management knew what they were doing. The store manager is single-handedly running this store into the ground. Stock is not rotated, defective items are sold. Expired food is sold. The store is a fire and safety hazard. Rules are made up and do not follow company policy. Management assumes no responsibility about anything. Schedules are not created and posted before the start of the new work week. You are expected to come in when called due to poor management skills. Hours are not given based on the demands of the store or sales. I don't know how corporate allows this to happen. The assistant managers actually care and are not being groomed for advancement. With a more efficient manager this could be a good gig."
bad,"i had no benefits and was not paid enough for me to drive to work for a  a few hours a week, spent more in gas than what i  was paid at the end of it all."
bad,Very little teamwork.  Management is lacking skills in most areas.  Expectations are low.  Store are unsafe as far as robberies.   Shrink numbers are unattainable.
bad,The best part of my experience with Family Dollar was with that of the other employees/ district managers. That was the only thing that was pleasant with this company. The corporation ask much from its employees without any seemingly benefits.
bad,"This company needs to learn the value of their employees. The company cannot run without the people at the bottom of the toddum pole. The specific store that I was at went thru employees continuously because of how they were treated, and the higher ups would over look camera evidence of the manager not doing their job. However I did make lifelong friendships with some employees at this company. But not many."
bad,I put my heart into this job and end up with the short end of the stick....  It does not matter what you do the head lady was never please always had something to disagree with.  They dont know how to thank you when you doing a great job too pushers for me. I feel like I was helping keeping there business above water and their appreciation was not good enough...
bad,The hardest part of the job is getting your crew to work as hard as you. Unloading truck is hard without help. The salary is not enough with the work that it cause for.
bad,"I was happy with me overall job at Family Dollar. It was not util we got a new manager, that things changed for the worse. I did not like the way she talked to people, (customers, & employees.) She was a terrible manager, and she lacked management skills. She had no management training and she did lacked leadership skill also."
bad,Store was very busy and not enough employee help when needed
bad,They dont care about their customers nor do they care about their employees and i mean upper management.  They xare more about money than anything else
bad,"I was hired by an excellent DM who left for another company a couple weeks after my hire. The experience with the temp DM, the ""training"" manager and eventually the new DM was aweful. 80 hour weeks, No payroll to efficiently run store. Unrealistic door to shelf expectations."
bad,"A typical day for me was paperwork, dealing with difficult customers, throwing freight, being security, dealing with very high theft, checking in vendors, interviewing new job candidates, training new hires."
bad,"Very negative environment to work in.  Employees ,in the Transportation Department, were berated and beaten down.  There was constant turnover in staff."
bad,"I've been working there for two years it has been alright. The district managers act like us employees don't have lies and just try to TELL you you're going to work at another store rather than asking.Having worked there for 2 years id expect more than a $2.50 raise. I do not enjoy working there and wouldn't recommend it , unless you want to be an underappreciated company slave with no life."
bad,"I was a manager for family dollar for a brief time. I should have been seen the red flags before accepting the position, but I worked 60+ hours a week at some points with no support from corporate. No hours for my employees, stocking shelves myself while also having to do managerial duties. I did not mind that I had to stock at all, but having to do 80% of it alone was ridiculous. Never 2 days off together. I could go on and on."
bad,No real consequences for associates who continuously call out sick. No raises for employees who had been with the company with an excellent work record for years. They were left to pick up the slack.
bad,"Will  not recommend any one to work in such hostile environment."
bad,When I contacted Corporate office to report the Store Manager. They did nothing. Making me have no respect for that company. For they don't respect hard workers. Just profits.
bad,"Cannot voice opinion. You will be reprimanded for voicing opinion."
bad,"Payroll is low, so as the only salary management person in a store you have to cover for any call out if unable to get someone. Require you to work a minimum of 52 hours. But very rarely do you work less than 55 plus. When different holidays come up, they require you to complete setups with little help, leaving you to work longer."
bad,"The job was in itself at first really fun and really easy for it to be my first job but then it just got worse or went down. They are never really fully staff there always short-staffed. No one really knows who's in charge when you're there, but I think it was just for my store. I'm not sure about the other stores but mine wasn't really a good experience for me. I didn't get paid enough for the things that I was supposed to do or the jobs they gave me to do and I was a cashier."
bad,The company as a whole does not care about their employees. They put cameras on the staff and not the store. The camera are pointed at the register and the safe.
bad,Just no. You work in lower income areas with high crime rate. They expect a truck to be put out in one day (even if the truck gets there at 12 you have to have it out by close) but never have enough hours to staff enough people to have it done by then.
bad,"They make it hard to have a life outide of work. Getting into work and seeing you're supposed to be done by 1, just for them to tell you you're staying until 4 is ridiculous. Some of us have families and a life outside of work. Pay isn't worth the backbreaking labor either."
bad,"Management can do whatever they want and get paid more for doing less work, terrible. Family Dollar is a greedy company overworks workers and then they don't even pay you enough foreal."
bad,Very unprofessional and very unorganized they don't care about their employees. There is no security we as workers have to stop the thieves ourselves. Hardly no hours to even pay bills and survive off the paychecks we receive.
bad,There definitely isnt any balance between work and home especially for store managers ... to this company you just a number i would never work for this company again
bad,For one Family Dollar doesn't give enough hours they give like 15 hours to cashier or customers Representatives which they call them and they give the store manager of $52 which don't make no sense when she or he is salary nobody can live off of less than 20 hours a week.
bad,Management doesn't care about its employees. Security sucks you can get robbed and they want you to play sherriff and catch a criminal. Expect a lot of time consuming hard work that is supposed to be performed in a short amount of time.  Its ok as a first little job if you live at home with your parents and have no real responsibility.
bad,Family dollar was a very good job. I started off my day by clocking in. Then I would go to the back stock room and I would roll what ever merchandise out to the floor that needed stocking. I placed all the merchandise on the shelf's in a timely manner.
bad,Horrible experience! Loss prevention treats you like a criminal. No balance between work and family.  Horrible customer and employee base.  Not much room for growth but does have job stability
bad,its been so long i don t remember what it was like .... you make money get paid every week learn about products and  meet people everyday all day its cool
bad,"Worked 3 years in  up in office. Women jealous, hateful, gossiping, trouble makers. They have been there 15 years plus and did not accept a new woman coming on board"
bad,The pay was great but it's not a safe place to work. The district manager was very negative about everything and also thought everything was a joke You work like almost everyday. The trucks are very huge. I wouldn't recommend anybody to work here!
bad,"Let's see constantly working by yourself, everything gets pushed on the workers. While other coworkers stand around on the phone and smoking, and or standing in the store making it look like there doing something but in reality you come in the next day to a mess."
bad,Don't work for this company. They don't care about their employees and they always think you are doing something wrong. Even the management doesn't respect you.
bad,The management works you to death and then lies on you. There is no support at the store level. The stores are under staffed and under appreciated. Customers are great depending on where you work. District and corporate staff will stab you in the back
bad,"Like working there, friendly customers. Learned to set symatics and displays, which products from one season to another"
bad,"Be prepared to sleep eat and breathe Family Dollar. They pay you peanuts, treat you poorly. No matter how hard you work it's never good enough. Expected to wear 5  different hats at once while completing 12 different tasks at the same time, only to be asked why you're not done yet. Must have a car although manager job description doesn't mention that at all, how the world can I buy a car at 8.29 an hour? This company should be reveled for what they are a sweat shop and abusive."
bad,"Management needs improvement, there is no training what so ever luckily I was I trained from my previous store, it was horrible the manager was rude"
bad,"greeted guess ,cashier duties, retail sales,stocking, inventory cash handling, packing unpacking tagging bank deposits cleaning, and some general office duties"
bad,There are several opportunities family dollar can improve on to become a more successful company. If you really want to retain good ppl  you have to have better working conditions & better payroll budget.
bad,"bad company all around."
bad,Family  Dollar did offer opportunity to grow although there was just not any room for you family.  You will work 15-16 hour days that is why I left i have small kids and it was just draining.
bad,The hardest part of this job was having the systems always shutting down. The stores systems were so out dated. The policies weren't implemented as they should have been. But the customer interaction is what i enjoyed the most and I feel like it was what I was best at. I was always having to help my co-workers and I constantly had to go behind them and make sure they did their part.
bad,Unable to continue working there due to unprofessional work environment and management.  Forced to quit and make a formal complaint because it was unable to be resolved at lower levels.
bad,"Great insurance, and benefits, but the hours were not good. They do not give managers, and assistant mangers breaks, I worked 14 hour days sometimes, with no break, barely even a bath room break. Employees work sometimes up to 6 or 7 hours alone in a store, not able to eat, drink or go to the restroom."
bad,need more security and more professional help i like the store manger but not so much other managers or district manger rmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
bad,Conflict of interest when dealing with my school. Other wise helping people is a great joy to me. Being able to assist with daily needs as consumers.
bad,"From the district manager's own words 18 of his 27 stores are not even close to his expectations.  Yet, the Family Dollar store where his own office is located (the store where he visits almost everyday) was the worst of all the stores in my opinion.  It was infested with mice, not just a few but hundreds, so many that when you walked into the back of the store all you heard was the crunching sound from all the feces on the floor.  You would randomly hear customers and employees scream as a mouse would run by their feet and this is during the middle of the day."
bad,Time consuming. Long hours. long work days. not enough hired help.love the customers. love assisting customers.
bad,"They change managers frequently, Make anyone a manager these days, Truck days are the worst because the store would be a mess, unfair business hours, once new manager comes they like to get rid of majority of employees that the former manager hired. Even if that person was up for a Promotion to become a manager, the new manager would pick someone with less experience, Unfair all around. Doesn't go by experience but word of mouth"
bad,"Never enough team members to get the job done. Upper management not supportive at all. They have a slave driver mentality and talk down to team members as well as store managers. Corporate support is poor. have been placed on hold for hours just trying to get simple answers to questions. A typical day at work is stressful and demanding. Trucks and vendors arrive with deliveries while you are there by yourself and trying to run the register and serve customers because they skimp so bad on payroll Managers role is a glorified stock person as you spend most of your time rebuilding and replenishing stock besides still having the responsibilities of hiring, when you can get through to corporate, firing, counseling, training, recruiting and trying to encourage and support your team members. No family/work balance. They state management must work a minimum of 52 hours a week but is really more like 72. Pay is good for managers but when averaged out you make less and work much harder than the cashiers. I have definitely learned to multitask. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers."
bad,poor management and very cold in building and not where t have a break very rude people i worked with
bad,Management isn't friendly. You don't get alot of hours. You don't a lunch or benefits.
bad,"I work at the Family Dollar on Twain and Swenson. Every other week or so there is always theft, physical assault of team members from the customers, and one of my former co-worker was shot for trying to stop a thief. I liked working with my co-workers but no one in management or in lost preventions are making a effort to make us feel safe at work."
bad,"As an IT Specialist at Family Dollar Corporate, I received inbound IT calls from stores, distribution centers, contracted vendors, field users, regional offices and corporate offices."
bad,"I'm a customer service something... basically a cashier. a typical day is clock in, count the draw, then put out my bell and start stocking. return to cashier to ring out customers."
bad,"I learned a lot through this position. I enjoyed serving my customers and working with my co-workers. However, no matter what I did it was never enough to please the higher management of the company"
bad,I was always on my feet cleaning and doing stock. Alot of times register work and money.
bad,in my opinion this place was not a good place to work at. our manager moved people up in the buisness without teaching them what they needed to know until they needed to know it.
bad,"I never want to work at another company like Family Dollar, the turnover was bad, I was the only worker at my store for 8 years, I think I saw at least 200 different workers in the 8 years I was there and some of my co-workers were excellent workers, everyone make mistakes, and I am not talking about those that were caught stealing. All the years I was there I was given comments about the good job I was doing and never received a raise. I decided to move back to Dayton and could not collect unemployment because I did not make enough money while employed at Family Dollar. I continue to Smile everyday, treat the customers(that were not stealing) with courtesy, and was at work on time everyday I was scheduled."
bad,"A typical work day consisted of come in clock in first count my drawer down to make sure it's at seventy five dollars even. Then make sure my area was clean, also make everything in eye view was put in the correct area make sure all shelves and racks are stovked neatly.What I learned as being a cashier was to make sure that I always provided great customer service. My Co-worker were great team members they slways helped and showed me new things.The hardest part of this job. The most enjoyable part about working at family dollar was always meeting new people."
bad,"No comment, The most enjoyable part of the Job was greeting the customers,and guiding them to to the items they were looking for. And most of them knew me and thought I slept on a cot, in the back room because I was there so much."
bad,"Each day you walk the store before opening to ensure recovery was done the night before.You always hear you never get enough hours to do what they expect to be done. This is true with this company. The Manager has to work way too many unreported hours over the 52 they expect you to work, because you can never hire anyone that wants to stay after they find out it is a ""real job"". District Manager (when they had a good one) let you run your store how it should be run. Guess thats why I turned 2 broken stores into million dollars store within 6months after gettinh them. Your co-workers are just as distraught as you are but they don't say anything because they need a job. Hardest part of the job is finding reliable people to stay with the wages they are given. Even if you find the expectional employee you can't offer them more money to stay. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your customers, getting to interact with other store Manager to know you are not in this NIGHTMARE alone."
bad,The people do not care about its employees. I wont recommend it.
bad,"Managers are expected to do more with less. Not enough hours allotted to properly and safely run these stores. Because of budgeted hours, most of the time only one Mgr or Assistant Mgr is there by themselves in the store for 8 hrs or more. And they expect you to run register, stock, clean and watch customers. Sad."
bad,"Every store is highly understaffed, underpaid and overworked. I worked a few 8 hour shifts and didn't get a break of any kind. It was typically only one manager and one CSR, sometimes the assistant manager. Coworkers were nice and I'll give the company one thing, I got paid 10 cents more than the minimum wage."
bad,I've been there almost two years and they haven't gave me a raise every since I've became a manager May of 2018. I live paycheck to paycheck and it's not fair at all.
bad,No values for family. No values for the customers. No values for employees. They throw untrained people into management and hold them accountable for not understanding their job.
bad,"Don't waste your time, this is a sucky company to work for.... Bad training, you get thrown in a role and it's basically sink or swim.... Most sink and find another company"
bad,"Family dollar expects too much from their store managers. Six day work weeks, low payroll to work with, so the majority of work falls on the store manager that is salary to deal with."
bad,The first initial month or so was great then i started to notice favoritism between certain employees and management after that became rocky due to short notice on schedule changes by the manager with myself being the only employee with children at the time my manager would switch my shifts and short notice doesn't work well with baby sitters
bad,"District Manager played favortism. The rules didn't apply to her favorite employee. Giving 3 raises to her in one year, and her assistant was allowed 10 + hours in overtime.  Making us do her job and when it was brought to her attention that it wasn't going to be allowed, the write ups started  coming in.  Making an employee pull a straight 24 hour shift with no breaks."
bad,The company was great the money and hours was great but I was wrongly fired.. wish I could go back my store manager was great my crew was great hours great just was wrongly fired it was so wrong on they part
bad,"Okay job , compensation is terrible for what we have to do ... but if you like multiple job duties and assignments given every day and a certain time stance it should be done at then go for it . Pay is bad ."
bad,"Only place I work where u get promoted all way to ""Holding Store Manager"" never miss a days work, work 7 days a week, No days off,Never Stole cash or merchandise ,And No Professional training, and all of a sudden when ask to step down and get into ASM Position fired on 1st day of stepping down,"
bad,"The demands exceed reality unless you have no life outside of work. As a Store Manager, plan on working up to 75 hours a week on salary. Payroll is constantly being cut, so only you can do everything. Paperwork is crazy. You do it on the computer but still have to do it on paper. A 1600 case truck has to be completed within 24 hours with 3 people."
bad,"Started working here as a cashier. I could tell my manager was excited just to have a reliable body in the store. At the time I was balancing school and work, so I just wanted part time hours. Eventually, due to lack of ability of others I had to take more shifts. I moved up to Assistant Store manager with an okay pay raise. Not every customer as bad, but the ones that were overshadowed the rest. We dealt with theft constantly, I was even held up one night only two weeks after starting. My manager was the only reason I stayed as long as I did. He would get dumped with way more work than he deserved just because people would call in or not show up. It definitely became way too stressful to balance work, life, and school."
bad,Run. Run as fast and as far as you can. Run run run run run run run run. Dont walk just keep running. Nope dont turn around. You didnt forget anything. Run forest run.
bad,"Coming from a previous employer that has high operational standards and efficient communication, teamwork, and organization, Family Dollar was not for me... Wanting to improve things was not feasible.. Climbing your way up to make change was a fruitless effort.."
bad,"I worked for Family Dollar for over three years. Good The first year I relatively loved The job. Customers were amazing. I enjoyed The fast pace and always having something to do.  The wages are terrible regardless of what position you hold. I received one raise of $.30 in a years time period. Assistant managers only make an estimated $1.00 more than a cashier despite far more responsibility. Benefits are only offered to management positions. The medical coverage is very pricey so you can not afford to purchase it because they do not pay you enough. A typical day is very fast paced. You are expected to put up stock at every opportunity between ringing up customers, checking in vendors, and tending to other responsibilities. Their expectations of one individual are a little unrealistic even if you are a hard worker. there is NEVER ANY DOWN TIME! Management is poor. There are no consequences for slacker employees so they continue to slack. Advancement is a joke. They pose like advancing is simple with dedication and hard work performance but it doesn't matter how hard you work or how much loyalty you have unless you are a choosen one you are staying right where you're at. They claim to hire within first but this is entirely not true. Hours are inconsistent. As a full time employee you should be working 35-40 hours per week. One week you will have 40 hours and the next you may only have 20. They rarely fire poor employees bc they are afraid of HR backlash so therefore the hard workers have to compensate for the things they are not accomplishing and are hardly, if at all, recognized"
bad,Upper management is the worst. The company as a whole is terrible. It’s an easy job. Not that complicated. Would be an enjoyable job if not for upper management. They do not care about their employees.
bad,Actually loved the nature of the nature of this job along with working with the public. However shortly after starting the job my store got new management. My new store manager became intolerable. She would do things strictly out of spite and i could not take the level of unprofessional-ism any longer.
bad,Too many problems with all the higher management no credit for anything too much made up as you go rules. Never any time to eat travelling to bank or another store not paid for.
bad,"To come out swinging on this review, if you value your sanity and well being, avoid Family Dollar at all costs. As someone who has worked here for almost five years, it is one of the most physically, mentally and emotionally draining places to work. Now, at the very least, the job DOES  give you benefits and there is opportunity to be promoted if you so desire like I did at one point, but it's at your own risk. It's somewhat inoffensive if you stay as a cashier or stock person, but if you move up to management then be prepared to get assaulted with overbearing tasks with little to no help from the higher ups, ESPECIALLY the District Managers. This is on top of the overwhelming verbal abuse from entitled customers and overbearing tasks and expectations set upon you by the company. If you become a Store Manager, you will be screwed the most, being overworked well into the 60-hour range and no overtime since they put you on salary, on purpose mind you. If you don't already have anxiety/depression, you will. If you do, expect it to get worse. I've only stayed so long because I've generally liked who I worked with, and well I could never find anything else, being forced to work here to get by 'till someone eventually saves me from this place. So please, do yourself a favour and avoid at all costs"
bad,"I work for a awesome store manager, I think she really cares about her employees, I recently quit because, they expect you to come in on your days off, not paying you for it, if the store isn't open for business, and you  are  schedule to work they will not call you,  to inform you to not come in,  the pay is terrible, family dollar doesn't provide any heat during the winter, your store manager will tell you that they have no way to control it, because its control from California, I found this to be very interested,  they don't care about their employees at all, don't waste your time, if you buy something as a employee, don't expect any employee discount, because their isn't any"
bad,"Better than not having a job.  Lots of stealing, even from by some of the assistant mangers.  Manager was good and honest though.  Very frustrating job"
bad,They don't give previous employees a second to work for the company. That's their on down fall. They need to look at work ethnic and the possibility that other employees will lie on someone just to get what they want or family members who work in the corporate office should never investigated when their family members are involved. The CEO needs to talk to previous employees to find out what really happens in the company
bad,"The worst job I've ever have. They have u work under false pretence to get what they want out of u then come time don't hold up their end. Only managers get full time hrs no matter how hard u work. My manager the main guy was a drunk & smelled of booze all day. My hrs got cut for no reason while a new hire got more hrs than I had. The more u show ur worth the more they'll try to push u out bc ur making them look bad. No joke. I've never been fired from a job & have always stayed as long as possible, this was the 1st"
bad,"I was a ASM in the Phoenix Area. They did not train me for the position my first day was a closing in which I had no idea what I was doing, the store manager was more in a rush to leave and go home rather than show me the proper procedure in closing the store. The company more concern with cleaning the store rather than getting new merchandise to the floor. The Whole experience was overwhelming. The thievery was unbelievable. I wouldn't recommend this employment to anyone"
bad,They are more worried about how much money they make at the expense of the eemployees .  They expect the managers to work extra hours while they cut payroll and expect the managers to work those hours so they can make more money
bad,if you have a family that you like spending time with family dollar management is not the job for you. the work life balance is pro work. store manager are supposed to work 52 hours a week but i have never met a manager that works less that 70 hours a week. the pay is competitive but all the hours one works make it seems like you are being pay less.
bad,"Weak place to word, wan you to do impossible tasks, upper management is a joke, every week theres new DMs they give promotions to friends not hard workers"
bad,Extremely stressful work environment. Management expects too much from their employees for the amount of work that needs to be done. Their door to shelf program is unreasonable given amount of time needed to move the stock from the back room to the floor
bad,"Family Dollar on Mack Road in Sacramento  ca. is not a good place to work IT IS VERY UNSAFE I would not refer no one to work there management was great but the type of customer that it brings is not very high thief rate ,run outs, very dangerous and the DM  didn't care about your safey"
bad,"The typical day at Family Dollar as an Assistant Manager is if you are opener you are expected to open store and do daily paperwork while checking any vendors in while working register while answering phone.  You work anywhere from 6 to 9 hours by yourself no help. You are also required to work any remaining freight and any other tasks the store manager may assign to you. This is expected and required by all Assistant Store Managers.  You need to have the ability to multi-task because it gets crazy and most days you dont get much accomplished.  I should mention you also get no lunch break. As far as bathroom breaks you go when you can and you eat when you can (even if it means you eat at the register) If you are closing you may or may not have to work 4 hours by yourself depending on the day. The cashier comes in between 5:30 and 6:30. During this time you are racing to get other jobs done you were unable to complete before cashier came in.  Truck days which in my store was Fridays everyone works.  I enjoy getting to know my repeat customers.  Not all Family Dollars are the same.  Some have great management and staff and others don't.  This job may seem easy but it isn't.  The Store Managers, Assistant Store Managers and cashiers all work freight, we all work register, we all off load truck (we did it on rotation) we all sweep and mop and clean bathrooms."
bad,Inside of the stores are GREAT! The management teams are usually over worked but are very efficient in what they do. The corporate aspect is very poor
bad,Very stressful when I worked there. Maybe things got better when I worked there budget was bad and it was very stressful.only having 2 employees in the store wasn't good either and being robbed.
bad,I worked there for a year and it was bad. There was no moving up. Manager never helped you. They only cared about money not the store customer. It's not a good place
bad,"not a good place to work , no chance of advancement, not good pay at all , i had an amazing manager, but she is gone now , they just honestly don't care about their employees at all  not even when you have a death in the family, all they worry about is when  your coming back to work"
bad,"The Family Dollar I worked at had very poor management, the store manager was not fit to run the store and the employees in it. She is an alcoholic and does not want team members to grow and advance within the store."
bad,"Asked to deal with underpaid, unhappy employees.  Given more work to do than can be achieved with payroll given, requiring manager to work more and longer to succeed."
bad,"Family dollar was a fun work place when I first started but it becomes stressful when the managers don’t do they role right and everything falls on the associates as long as you can handled the pressure you will be good , it’s easy to grow in."
bad,"my time with family dollar seem like a life time of misery... i was contently at work and if i wasn't there nothing got done.. i stress to my boss i need help his reply  ""you got this""... i don't feel family dollar  cares about there employee. everyone is replaceable"
bad,Family dollar stores expect their salaried paid employees to work 70-80- hours a week with no extra pay. when you was scheduled off you was on call and they would have you run 3 stores at a time with no extra pay. Never had time for your family
bad,"A lot of favoritism. Strong lack of managerial courage. Poor attendance due to poor planning from management. Certain standards are not applicable to all. Overall, company methodically eliminating benefits while increasing work load. Short-staffed management wise. Management pay bottom portion of industry."
bad,Not enough money for your labor and not enough hours. Horrible management she never knew what she was doing plus everything was always broken. However it is a fast paced environment and we have Lots of shoppers from different ethnicity's
bad,"The days were long with no breaks. The management team was not supportive. you were supposed to receive your schedule on Saturday but most of the time I didn't receive mine until after 6 pm on sundays. They pay people different depending on the person. Each manager makes a different amount.,"
bad,"Supervisors were unprofessional, would make security announcement and from inside of office, leaving the cashier alone with customer suspected of stealing"
bad,"Upper management looks down on everyone, Your fellow co-workers will backstab you for a raise that amounts to pennies, the amount of deceit that goes on to progress further their is worse then game of thrones. Also in the span of 4 months we had 5 managers because they all quit."
bad,Bad place to work for. Never got any help from District Manager. Store was in a bad area. No help from a coorpate level on control of stealing customers. inventory was messed up
bad,"They treat their employees like they're disposable and the pay is minimum wage and assistant managers only make $8.00 per hour, my store manager had to keep pushing for me to get $9.00 per hour."
bad,"I usually don't talk bad about a place that Iv worked before but this store was just terrible. The manager constantly talked about employees behind their backs to other employees. She changed your time and I worked off the clock many times after closing. This manager would tell you to do something and the next minute yells at you for doing it. Literally bitched constantly. She called employees lazy when that person worked harder than her. she picked on one certain person because they worked for the manager before her and tried to get rid of her all the time but couldn't because she had no reason. she would tell you to check out your own family then yell at you for doing it. She loved to jump all over you about stuff right in front of customers. She literally spent more time watching the employees on the cameras than she did anything else. She put stuff in the wrong place and marked it down, then yelled at you for selling it because it wasn't supposed to be marked down and actually accused you of stealing it. Blaming her mistakes on everyone else. The most unprofessional manager iv ever worked for. unbelievable. Forever shorthanded because no one can stand to work for her."
bad,"Honestly I don't really have much to say about my experience while working for this place. Since the new manager came in, it all went down hill fast. too much favoritism. Good prices though."
bad,This is a fast paced environment that provides great benefits. There is always something to do and something to keep you busy.
bad,"Hands down the WORST company I have ever worked for.  As a salaried manager I was forced to work far more than the 45 I signed on for.  Labor budget was ludicrous and usually meant there was only one person working in the store at any given time.  One person to be cashier, stocker, customer service, set plan-o-grams and take care of vendors.  District Manager is a low class joke."
bad,Expect to have no life as a Store Manager work is 6 days a week 52hours required normally worked 60+ hours. Very high turnover rate. hard to find good employees you are basically on call all day every day. make this job your last resort.
bad,Depending on what day it is you can expect a very long day. constant recovery of store. I have been in some very awkward positions as far as confronting customers that are stealing .The.hardest part of my job is to get everyone on the same page as far as work ethic. I'm a very hard worker and I expect the same. What I enjoy most is the people I work with and the fact that there is always something to do and the time goes by fast.
bad,"Didn't have a Life Balance"
bad,work all day long everyday no family time 80 hrs a week u have to train and teach each person which was the good thing training your own team was no help from your pms
bad,okay Job pretty good place to work. management needs to be better.
bad,Management was horrible! Job demanded to much for minimal pay.
bad,"Disjointed Management"
bad,I enjoyed working with the employees that I managed and that is about it. they work you like a dog and do not pay you the compensation for the correct job title. very stressfull work environment.
bad,"As a Assistant Mgr. I was responsible for unloading trucks, opening and closing the store, opening petting cash and loan at the beginning and the end of the day. Running register when needed, receiving merchandise from vendors via PDT DSD. I learned how to us the PDT gun and the procedures of Family Dollar. The manager's of the stores where not that great at a lot of locations that I worked in while doing resets. The hardest part of the job was having to clean up behind customers, what I did enjoy was the fact of meeting and helping out customers."
bad,I advanced to assistant manager but later quit due to being robbed at gunpoint
bad,"un loading trucks "
bad,I worked there for 8 years it was good until I went to Merchandising. There is alot of turn over in merchandising in every aspect. As soon as you learn something it will change by Monday. No official training you sink or swim. No advancement for Minorities.
bad,"this company works its salary paid people into the ground. good people are suspected of theft. the company's attitude is guilty until proven innocent. what they actually say is 'trust but verify'. but what they mean is the majority of our theft comes from inside and whether u are good or not...we will treat u as suspect. Employee performance ,longevity, attendance, store shrink reports that tell a different story and the word of management means nothing next to the almighty weekly printout sheet. Waste of your time and energy to invest effort and loyalty into this company."
bad,"This position I took on was out of desperation when little employment opportunities were available once I relocated. Retail is a difficult industry to work in with odd hours, hard labor stocking and processing truck and little compensation or benefit to make it worthwhile. Co Workers worked second jobs to meet ends meet due to poor compensation. The Store Manager was one of the best managers I've ever worked for. He manages his staff with respect and maintains professionalism that motivated me to stay employed longer than I had planned. Family Dollar is a stack 'em high Let 'em fly store."
bad,"You have to have thick skin to work in this environment. A typical day is stocking, cleaning up after messy customers, recovering a trashed store every night and meeting deadlines with a payroll budget getting cut every quarter except during xmas season. You will usually get a great and resilient staff because that's what it takes to work in this place. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the customer base. The stores are placed around little to no income areas. Lots of theft will occur in most stores you are at. Playing Manager, stocker, reseter, merchandiser, cashier, clean up crew, loss prevention and trainer will be your daily activities. Also not to forget the break-ins that occur regulary especially around xmas. The only enjoyable part of this job is if you didn't have to physically throw someone out on your shift. Have fun with this job. It only gets worse."
bad,"Management is very poor, company was very unorganized! Overall the job experience was great, the customers was great & the team members were the best. I've learned a lot, the hardest part of my job was working with my manager. But meeting the customers were the best!"
bad,"Typically, you'll earn 20-30% less than managers in other companies but are required to work 6 days and/or 52 hours/week minimum."
bad,"It needs some work on how they work with their employees on getting more people to work and stay working there, training is no existing at the work place"
bad,"I'm very grateful for the chance they have giving me and for the things I've learned and the people I learn them from.its a great place to work.but,you have to work!"
bad,"Glad I'm not there anymore. I thought it would be a great opportunity but that was a fassad, And they have a totally "
bad,The way I was treated after I was promoted to store manager was not ok and neither appreciated when I was promoted I never got store manager training and never had help
bad,"Not recommended for long-term. Stressful. Support from upper echelon of management is inconsistent; depending upon which region you're in. If you're not salaried, you're prettyuch a non-factor."
bad,"Very low compensation for the company I worked at family dollar for 4 years and I only make 12.10 a hour as an assistant manager and only received 2 raises during that time and still only make 12.10 a hour. The hours are horrible you do not have a set schedule and if you call off one time you are a bad person. I do not recommend this job to anyone unless your young and just looking for a first time job. Also you only get paid over time after 40 hours you dont get holiday pay, and you dont get paid time and a half after 10 hours."
bad,This company doesn’t care about their employees. PERIOD! Management at my store was AMAZING && she treated us like family but made sure we WORKED && was punished if expectations weren’t met but the company overall was/is SORRY. You’re started at minimum wage && even with raises don’t make much to LIVE.
bad,"When I first started everything was great at family dollar now I'm ready to leave this place its gone down hill with all the new rules and new people being brought in thinking they know what to do, the merge with dollar tree was the worst mistake ever."
bad,"Fun place to work, learned a lot about customer service and management skills. Human resources and higher up managers have trouble keeping good employees."
bad,It’s good money but you will have no life! They are very inconsiderate when it comes to having family time or time off.as store manager you will not get paid over time or for hours worked over your recommended hours
bad,Family dollar is poorly run. I only Enjoyed working there because of my manager. They have overly high expectations with no pay and not enough hours. I only Continued to work there because I was in College and needed a job. I would Not work there again.
bad,The pay is not good. You have to work every holiday. No family life unless you make one for yourself. They work you to hard for that little money. Upper management cares about there self. They will throw you under the bus
bad,In the beginning I enjoyed working with the company but as time went on I didn't and had a bad experience with the company!! I hoped that the company would have a better understanding of the what people go through and give chances.
bad,"It’s actually a good job but the pay is not enough ,too many tasks and the pay is just not too enough ,that’s the only thing I don’t like about family dollar"
bad,Not the place to work if you want to spend time with your family. There is no Family in Family Dollar. The pay is good though. If your a workaholic its the peerfect compay.
bad,"Upper management is very poor "
bad,Company is horrible unprofessional lack of communication always over working the workers don’t care about the workers no type of team work store managers are horrible
bad,"I have never worked for such an unorganized company. I was hired as an assistant manager and during my first three weeks of working with the company I traveled within my district  to work various stores because of lack of management. I would be dispatched to open a store and I ended up opening and closing the store all ALONE  in one of the roughest areas in the city. The stores don’t have security and expect management to be cashier, manager , janitor and security. The pay is laughable for the amount of work expected. How anyone survives here is beyond me. I quit without have another job because I was always in fear of my life."
bad,Love greeting customers as they enter the store. Assisting customers with purchases and pricing. The hardest part of the job is unloaded a truck by hand pieces by pieces.
bad,The enjoyable part of the job is the customers. I experienced a lot through them. customers help you balance out your day their always smiling and cheerful and that’s what get me through my day at work
bad,"The environment sucks, employees do whatever they want. They don’t acknowledge the good working employees. The hourly pay sucks it’s basically negotiable which is not fair to the ones who actually have experience but others from outside gets paid more. We could barely take any breaks."
bad,I am looking for another job because they don't give me enough hours or days to work there. Need more hours in order to be able to pay the bills and survive.
bad,Family Dollar doesn't care about there employees..I was there during Harvey going from store to store rebuilding they didn't care.I was robbed ..People I know died during that time of my employment...No safe for tbe employees or customers...
bad,I had no life outside of work. Worked 70+ hours a week and wasn’t able to give my crew overtime. It was a bad area and always had to fight off shoplifters. The cops knew our store which isn’t a good thing.
bad,You have a start time but no end time. I don't want to speak poorly about past employers so this is where I will end my evaluation. That is unprofessional.
bad,Worked for a great manager who was unfairly terminated. Not a safe work environment. No cameras and only one worker typically 8 am-1:30pm. Would not work for again.
bad,"This company will make promises of giving you help, or extra hours, or anything to get you hooked. Then after a week or so you will be thrown to the wolves and be required and held accountable for everything. I was working 7 days a week 90 plus hours per week and the district manager didn't see a problem with it and wouldn't ask other stores to send assistance and as the manager you don't have the time to stop and call stores for assistance."
bad,"Company refuses to employ enough people and pay people so the turn-over rate is high. There is no/minimal overtime. Very poor pay. There are no employee discounts. ""Christmas bonus"" is a Smart Coupon (Smart Coupons are available to all customers, with exception to the employee coupon) which is $5 off $25, which means you're still giving whatever money you just made back to Family Dollar anyway."
bad,Overworked and underpaid. Truck days were the worst but with a druggie as a manager I know why the store was the way it was and why it was ran the way it was...
bad,"There is no such thing as overtime. If you hit over time they make you put the extra hours on your next check and if you choose not to you will be terminated (This is illegal!). There is no such thing as a break. They took away travel pay so if you agree to work at another store you have to do it at your own expense. DM is very petty and unprofessional. They have it set up to where the associate can't call and complain to Corp. This company will get over on you and if you dont like it, you will be fired!"
bad,Family dollar isn't the worst company to work for but they do have a habit of thinking bad on their workers. They have no problem giving hours but you will be transferred to other stores in order to do so
bad,Management here is so awful. They do not care if your store is low staff. They still expect for everything to be done and to be done perfect on top of a million tasks to do.
bad,I had a terrible experience at Family Dollar.  The manager was a hack and the DM was mean and rude to EVERY ONE.  Not a nice word to say as soon as she walked in the door
bad,"If you have a good team things will go smooth, I love my store manager! The longer you work for the company the more you learn about the system and how they don't value their employees."
bad,Family Dollar would be a great work place if you dnt have to deal with the people stealing it's a shame that they dnt provide security also they need to hire more people for cashier
bad,this company is not for me there were no team players everyone was out to get everyone. the store was nice and clean but it was a magnet for shoplifters spent more time having to watch shoplifters than to concentrate at my duties on hand
bad,This is a good job for a student or someone just wanting some leisure money. I would not recommend someone with children to support to work at Family Dollar.
bad,"My particular store is always filled with drug addicts and ""ladies of the night"". They are always loud and belligerent and I have been called several racial slurs before. The work is not complicated at all but the pay could most definitely be higher for all the tasks they ask you to complete."
bad,"The pay for managers is GREAT! However, you will trade your soul for this great pay. You literally live at Family Dollar if you are a manager, slowly killing yourself."
bad,I was working with my fellow peers and it actually gave me an experience of working in a department store something I never did until that particular time and I enjoy working there
bad,"Was assured my job was safe for at least several years because my role keeps the store open & operational, however, almost exactly  the day, they laid off 370 people with the bulk being in the Finance dept."
bad,"A basic job looking for work go to FD, but expect management to be straight a** wipes. Make the job much more depressing than it already is."
bad,"One would like to think of typical days on the job however this didn't exist much. Poor management training and lack of upper managerial support. Regardless of what the day looked like my team was productive with stocking merchandise, decreasing shrinkage, and improving customer service. I improved my time management skills, the importance of delegating tasks and holding people accountable for the tasks, upper management does not support you,  and the importance of communication as well as documentation. Upper Management for the most part were unfair and not willing to follow through. Co-workers supported one another. I don't feel any part of the job was hard only training opportunities. Most enjoyable was working seeing the improvement of my store and discussing the appreciation with customers about the cleanliness and organization."
bad,"This is not the place to work. The manager isn't very professional, there is a lot of drama surrounding you, and the customers in that area are very rude!"
bad,this company has alot of changes to do im happy dollar tree brought them i hope a change is coming
bad,"Family Dollar managers are very much over worked and under paid. I acquired alot of skills from this company. Being a store manager for them is by far the hardest to do because you spend the majority of your time a work. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a happy, returning customers. One thing would make being a manager better for this company is how to manage for a manager to balance work and home."
bad,not a fun place to work they did not pay well for the work you had to do
bad,For the time i spent there my hard work was never acknowledged or appreciated
bad,Enjoyed every minute of having set my own schedule.Issues that occur would only be that the employees would not want to follow.
bad,"Terrible company to work for, as a store manager you work 6 days a week and upward of 75-80 hours. Leave little time to spend with family."
bad,"I learned how to work a cash register, and met alot of awesome people and had fun assisting them, i think the worse part was restocking repetitiously at a paste. My Manager was...well lets just say ""Bossy"" and not what i had hoped for. The best part of the job was assuring customer service, dealing with different people every, and being apart of society."
bad,"IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON PERSUING A JOB WITH FAMILY DOLLAR, READ THIS!!!"
bad,The manager did not know how to managea store. she was behind on schematics and would take it out on the workers. the schedule would change three or four times a week. my daughter got sick and had to go to the hospital so I had to call in. the manager cut my hours and was spreading rumors behind my back that i was lying. I did produce a doctors note but she still did not increase my hours. over all it is a horrible place to work.
bad,I got hired as an employee than got kicked once they use me to there advantage
bad,The upper management for family dollar is horrible. They do not care about you are your family. Let alone your personal life. They will work you to death!
bad,"A store manager is expected to do 90% physical work, including unloading a weekly delivery truck. They expect you to be available and willing to work 6am-10pm everyday, and do not respect even schduled days off, vacation or sick time."
bad,"Some of the employees showed up when they wanted to, I believe its hard to be someones friend and supervisor or manager. I was only there for 30 days and 2 mangers walked out in the middle of business hours."
bad,I liked working there. Got along with most of my coworkers. Was never late. However upper management (DM & Above) will fire you for the littlest of reasons. Avoid them if you can.
bad,Hours were minimum so was the pay. Like with most retail jobs you are expected to do everything for little pay. Not much training. Store manager was nice which made the job a little easier.
bad,"I was fired and not ever to work at another store in any other state. I was accursed of hitting a child. the video was watch by DM ,RM SM no signs of me hitting any one but the child brothers said I did and was fired. 3 years later I received a letter saying sorry from the SM at the time but I have not been rehired yet."
bad,Hard job. Exhausting and lots of drama. Poor management. Gotta be able to lift at least 50 lbs all day long. On your feet constantly. Need good shoes.
bad,"Great coworkers, but poor management and over pushing employees just because ""it's easy to replace you"". Pay is okay, but management and higher up make the environment very stressful and they show lack of care."
bad,Don't have anything to say about the company. its a chill environment but the managers suck. they will let us leave early during the week just to make us work on Saturdays. they try to be real slick with the overtime. did i mention that the managers suck. the work environment is cool but THE MANAGEMENT SUCKS !
bad,"They dont care about your family ,they put you on a line my was 77a there's 2 people in each line 1 on a the other one on c. If you finish you line first they send you to level b sometimes the person on c goes to b to help you but if you get a lazy guy on c you are screw . You have to hit i believe 95 % production a week just to get some extra dollars.  By the way if they need peop!e on another department they take you there and train you for 30 minutes n let you there by your self all day if you did good minus well just get used to it cause you may stay there . I did bulk for 2 yrs n shipping department that's where you load the trucks for a few weeks. Same pay different departments. You get sick days n vacation hrs, like 1 hr per month. On bulk you have to put the product on conveyor belts if for a reason one of them broke you are screw they stop everything until they fix it . Sometimes you wait 2 hrs to go back to work yes nice huh nope those 2 hrs waiting you don't get pay n you stay late that day or until the bash is done. 30 minutes lunch n two 15 minutes breaks. On our break just stay on your line cause of you 2 minutes late they are going to call you to see how come you haven't start yet."
bad,I enjoyed working there at first. I just wasn't getting enough hours to take care of my family. Everytime they called me in i came. It was a very clen & neat workplace.
bad,wasn't  able to keep employees long due the pay and hours they would get the work of unloading trucks and getting merchandise out in a timely manner.employees would have to stock shelves and run the register help customers find things they were looking for.For some employees it would be a bit much.making sure there register balanced.
bad,As a previous store manager I wouldn't recommend working for the company. Too much drama and communication is poor and way too much gossip within the company
bad,"I worked their, because I like to work and show and teach what I know, I learned some trades, but the salary is low, considering all you do, I worked there almost 6 yrs I got 2 certificates for 3 and 5 yrs dedications, but even though I helped bring much revenue, when time came for bonuses I received none."
bad,"This is a god first job for someone wanting to know the ins and outs of retail. However, the hours are not good, there is not a good chance for advancement, and there is not alot to do. Management is always overworked, while the one other person they have in the store, the cashier, has little to do because of the need to be near the cash register to help customers. The best day to work is when the truck comes in, as it gives the cashier something to do. Also, you are not usually dealing with the best people of society, so it is necessary to be able to keep a good attitude with customers."
bad,"The first 3 months I worked here were awesome. Then my manager relocated and the new manager had a not so pleasant attitude. She was allowed to hire a family member, which is against company policy."
bad,"This company is going down the tubes"
bad,"Not the best place to work. Stressful, no work-life balance, you can advance but the pay is not great. Now paid Bi-weekly. No over-time unless pre-approved by District Manager. in low-income areas, high theft rate, and very unruly customers."
bad,"long hours typically "
bad,"its an ok job to have, the corporate doesnt really care about the smaller business'es treats them like tax write offs, but if you have a manager that does their job its not a bad place to work if you can get enough hours."
bad,Family dollar is not a hard job its the fact they you can'T make ends meet and they seem to have lack in appreciation their team. Ive picked up great customer service skills and also learn to make strategy a problem solving methods. Im apart of the management team amd we lose so many people due to lack of caring about there staff.
bad,"District management is horrible!  If they want you gone, they will do whatever it takes to get you gone.  Sometimes they even involve the store manager because they know they can."
bad,"Treated employees very poorly, poor communication and no respect for the employees.very horrible. Very poor warehouse conditions and equipment. The list goes on.NV hm"
bad,Working at family dollar was ok. I got paid weekly the best part. That has changed recently. I was working full time hours but part time so no benefits. While the full time people worked less hours but got the benefits also no discounts to any employee
bad,area was terrible very dangerous putting your life at risk not enough security to make you feel sage. The store manger never closed the store. great company kust not enough security and alot of theft.
bad,can't really complain about this job it was very easy not much to do even tho at the time i was working there i was in school so for me it was more as a part time job.
bad,I have worked here for a while and it has its ups and downs. I like to let people judge for themselves their opinion. the hardest part is working alone
bad,"The management is unprofessional, the days are long. Customers are rude, and your always over worked. Your only get more hours if the store manager likes you. Management is corporate and will do anything to fire you, or take away your hours. The store manager will take all the credit from you, and working as an assistant Manager, I witness store manager deleting employees hours on payroll."
bad,This company will keep you on your toes but at the same time management structure and company culture could be much better.
bad,"Family Dolllar was voted one of the top 10 worst places to work. Such a long list of horrors.  In the store by yourself, work every hoilday, work load is to much for one person.  Store manager wants to be a friend not a boss. You are at the mercy of a manager who is threatened by your knowledge and makes up thing to make you look bad. No help what so ever when the company or manager makes a mistake. No support on all levels; co works, store manager, HR and the DM. Unpaid wages."
bad,"always changing, adaptation is key. patience is needed above all else."
bad,"I would open or close the store depending on my schedule, did inventory weekly, ordered product for the store, received the truck of 1200-1500 pieces weekly, i trained my associates, hired associates. I was supervisor of 8."
bad,"Due to the fact of poor management; minimum amount of employees, no breaks had to work 8-10 hour shifts without anytime to just rest and just have a breath of fresh air. Family Dollar would’ve been a good job just was at the wrong location."
bad,As far as moving up fast and opportunity to be promoted it's perfect management and higher ups are not good if they find a reason to get you out it's most likely personal and it
bad,Poor poor pay no break n overly worked the worst job ever they don’t stand up for their employees they work you long hrs for no money n they under pay
bad,I didn't not like it I got fired without even being notified of why I got fired and what went on . I feel like I was blackmailed and didn't give loss prevention enough information. I loved my job.
bad,"I loved the company, but the store manager was HORRIBLE so i quit. If they get rid of her it would be amazing. Aneisha shouldn't be running the store."
bad,you are required to come in if your associates call off.. no extra payroll to complete extra task sometimes. you have to dedicated your entire life to the job as store manager  no work life balance . the hours go to the managers not cashiers. If the store manager was not included in payroll . you could hire more people to hold the store down
bad,"They don't train everybody. They don't give you the  papers that you signed ,not enough hours , paid bi weekly no discounts , no info for where to go health wise no respect for workers! Not enough pay. Your days off (they still want you to come in ). No over time. You ask for a specific day dr's appointment n they are calling you to come in. Some customers are a handful language etc.."
bad,I Consider Dollar Tree Is For Someone Who Do Not Have Bills To Pay.They hire you then put you on the schedule for two days are less.You Get Minimum Wage.
bad,"If you aren't a yes man/woman, do not work here. If you can't deal with bs, don't apply here. I loved working here but hated the atmosphere with management and older staff memebers."
bad,"Management was not fair, hours were not flexible they did not work with you at all, the rules are very ridiculous and you will get treated like dirt. I was very unhappy there and they wrongfully fired me for something that i didn't even do"
bad,"Managers are paid only 1 dollar per hour more (11 dollars per hour). The workload for a manager, however, is easily triple that of associates. There is absolutely no good reason to accept a managerial position with this company other than resume padding. There is absolutely no good reason to work for this company long-term."
bad,".a typical day at work would be opening store. verifying petty cash balanced properly. Doing loss prevention paper work. Then preparing to open store.Making sure cashiers are ready to work before opening the store. Handling all csr issues from supplying change to price verifications and complaints."
bad,This company is probably one of the worst I've ever worked for I got very sick and they have still done nothing to improve our situation at the store we have pop chemicals and and toxic mold in the facility and they have not done anything me and two of my employees have gotten extremely sick from it. The other thing that happens is that we do not get proper brakes because they do not give us enough payroll put enough people on so they are also violating labor laws. I know this because I'm the man I was manager of the store.
bad,"I wasn't there for very long at all, but it sucks. A typical day was that we would go in at 6 AM, work for 2 hours and get a 15 minute break, come back to work for 3 hours, and get a 30 minute lunch, then back to work for another 2 hours and get a 15 minute break. The break room was nice, but everything else sucked. Most positions there are meant for robots. Run away from this place. I cant see how the people there can do what they do day in and day out, it's super crazy out there"
bad,"Run as fast as you can away from there,unless your in "" The Group"" The mangers and co workers will make your life a living nightmare  a lot of favoritism if they don't like you even if you get above rate you wont go far. I only found one manger in the 6 yrs i was there that was fair to everyone and after 6 months there he ran from the job to much stress not enough pay hours can be long. in the winter they are very short hours like 20 hrs a week"
bad,I would advise most people to never work there is possible. I adidnt like any of the management as they only looked out for each other and sabotage everyone else.
bad,"At Family Dollar you are replaceable and their locations have been robbed multiple times and they do the bare minimum the make their employees feel ""comfortable""."
bad,"you are paid very little for the amount of work you do. Store has odd ways of doing things that don't make a whole lot of since, like hand offloading your trucks, instead of them being palletized."
bad,"Lots of theft and addicts come in and out constantly, cops take long to respond to calls. Fights breakout between employers and customers. Many employees choose to quit rather than to continue working at this family dollar."
bad,"I worked for Family Dollar for a Year and a half since the store opened its door. I had great experience and the worst. I seen store managers, assistance managers, stock personal and cashier get fired or just quit. I still worked for the company.. New Dms came and went and I still stand with the company.. And here on July 10, 2017, I got fired due to being red flag on my register. still cant explain why because I wasnt working on register for 3 weeks. i week was sent home because i disagree with a manager on a store meet, 2nd week i worked on floor and third week i was on vacation, so how did i get red flag if i wasn't on register.. i came to conclusion that someone used my numbers.. But could'nt proof it because i was fired and taken off the system.."
bad,Poor management  I’ve worked here for a couple a months and within my time here the manager did nothing but ran other workers always. I actually went on vacation for a week and she the manager wanted me to come back in town on Sunday in which she wanted to conduct a meeting I told her I wouldn’t be in town that day so she stop putting me on the schedule.
bad,Company mamagemet sucks. Got hired as full time and hade less hours than partime. Some employees are lazy and dont know what there doing. Lots of problems due to company manangement. Good store manager though but some sucky assistant managers.
bad,"Quick advancement and quick raises. But they have unreal expectations, no help with learning how to do certain things. Not good management training, unorganized"
bad,"Managed my team, always did work in a orderly fashion on time , 30 minutes each uboat,friendly, and helpful to customers. Also smile at all times,always fixing problems or resolve it some type of way with out manager, Respect goes a long way"
bad,Had to open and close the store by myself everyday worked at max 7 days a week without a break and unloaded a 400 piece truck on Fridays by myself no help.
bad,"I liked about family dollar is that I had the opportunity to learn how to manage a cash register. It was my first job at the age of 18 and I learned responsibility fast, I also learned that having patience with the customers was a key to being a successful cashier .."
bad,"the job as nice but it was not safe for me, it kept being robbed every week."
bad,"I learned a lot while working at Family Dollar. I enjoyed working with co-workers, and customers. It is a great for a single person but not someone with a family."
bad,I hated working at this family dollar located in Riverdale Ga. the managers were rude every other week there was a new manager. they barely gave me any hours .
bad,I learned how to manage a team of people. I love my co-workers. Its not a hard job I know how to do everything. The most part I enjoy is satisfying my customer.
bad,This was my first managers position but I fell in love with my tenants it was a wonderful experience for me and I enjoyed ever minute of it 
bad,"Lack payroll, turnover high, no freedom, lot of loss, might have to open alone, always cutting payroll, high thelf all the time."
bad,"A typical day at work is fast paced and I deal with customers all day long. Customer service is one most essential components in running business successfully. What I have learned is that you have to stay professional no matter what the situation may be. As a manager, I have learned how to deal with customers and employees on a different level. You have to have more patience and look at growth and development on a different level as well. My co-workers love to work with me and many of them admire me both as a person and a manager. The hardest part of my job would be going behind others and cleaning up their mess. Other than that, I make my job easier for myself. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my customers leave happy and hear how much they love shopping in my store. It brings me so much joy and warms my heart when I know that I have made someone's day better!"
bad,"didnt like this postion any more, wasnt able to have time of when i needed it."
bad,"No job security, corporate is rude to employees, company's just out for money."
bad,"A typical day at work starts at 7 am, store opens at 8am and close it down at 10pm, in store by my self until 11am. Do sale reports from previous day of business, Ring up customer sales, put out stock, build displays, do mark downs for sales, tag clothes/shoes with security pins, recover store at 11, 5, 10, balance cashier til at end of their shift, assist with deposits. Balance and confirm petty cash. Resolve customer complaints, do assignments as instructed by District managers and put up signs in windows and sale signs. Sweep and mop every night. Learned to listen before speaking and give 100% to satifying the customer. Co-workers need to know you apreciate them say it and show it. The hardest part of the job is unloading the stock trailer with 1200 pieces sometimes more. the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers, making them laugh/smile and seeming the return and call out your name."
bad,"I Didn't Like Working It Was Unorganized, I Was Not They Way They Explained I Was Always Working By Myself Opening And Closing I Did So I Was Working Double Shifts"
bad,"They Human Resources Department is jacked up. Don't go on maternity leave, you just may not have a job. Especially if you reported them for fair treatment. Other than that the job itself is okay. Just stay to yourself, best advice."
bad,Personally my store manager wasn't ready for the promotion but due to the circumstances she was basically forced to take the position. In overall its a good company to get manager experience
bad,A typical day at work was nonstop busy. Always had to have something to do. The most difficult thing about working at family dollar was dealing with a lot of angry customers. Most enjoyable thing about this job was meeting a lot of new people and learning better communication skills.
bad,"Need to protect us more. Ask the workers what the customers want. Off early for holidays to be with family, Close a little earlier after dark. Have more than 2 people working at a time, that's not good at all or safe"
bad,"I worked for fd for 5 yrs I started as a cashier and within 6 months I was the store manager. there is no work personal life balance. the company doesn't care about you are a person, All the care about is that the doors are open and u are making them money."
bad,"Family Dollar is a pretty decent company, however, once it was bought it seems like so much changed... and not so much as for the better in my opinion."
bad,"I worked here for almost 4 years...started as a cashier worked my butt off ended up with a store of my own, it was great for a while, until I realized that being a salary manager who is required too work 52 hours a week, which isn't bad, until a new company opens up in town and pays more so of course all your help is going too go, they are paying way more, don't blame them. Needless to say I was left alone with one part time person, who could ONLY work 18 hours a week. I was expected too work open too closes alone, which is against company policy, but they didn't care. After a 80 plus hour work week two weeks in a row, I was mental emotionally and physically exhausted and begging for help from my DM was pointless. Ended up quitting, stinks cause I loved my store and my customers but company its self doesn't seem too care about their managers!! very sad."
bad,"This job was a challenge. I like it because it taught me about sails, and inventory. I also liked that job because it taught me organization, and how to keep my work place clean."
bad,As a sales associate/cashier I counted down the drawers and basically check out all the customers who shopped in the store even helped the customers who didn't shop in the store
bad,"Family Dollar would be a great place to work ONLY if upper management respected the hardwork and dedication that Store Managers put into the everyday tasks in seeing that the store is up to par on a daily basis. The budget given often times, isn't enough to schedule adequate help,leaving Management alone in stores for long periods throughout the day and leaving them prone to be robbed. "
bad,"A normal day starts at 7:am if I am opening on a weekday counting the safe and the register drawers before going to the bank. Start setting up to be ready for customers run the morning reports, check store the email open the store at 8:00. "
bad,had plently of work but samething everyday.  Data Entry and not learning anything else.
bad,ITS a job if you need money and dont mind suffering FD is for you
bad,This company care about no one but the faces on the dollars. They tell you the care and yet the backstab and plot to get good hard workers out the door. The district manager is just as uninformed as a person reading this. There are no pros all cons. They want blood sweat and tears for no appreciation or pay. Raise dont cone around enough ao some stores in bad neighborhoods never get a raise because of inventiories that go wrong. B
bad,"A typical day was very boring unless it was truck day. I love truck day! Any other day there wasn't much to do. Everyone, exspecially the manager, was extremely lazy and waited for everyone else to pull their weight. And when you tried to look out for the company and tell the district manager, he didnt listen. All he cared about were sales and loss prevention. I tried to tell him how his employee was running his store but he never did anything about it and I am not the only one. Many customers and a few other employees at family dollar called him and complained but he still never did anything."
bad,"all in all i had a terrible experience working for this company. it was very unprofessional, i worked with management that made me feel unsafe and uncomfortable."
bad,"Boss treats employees horribly and belittles them in front of customers  "
bad,Manager claimed he didn’t have to do anything because he was the manager. There was definitely favoritism and employees got annoyed if you asked for help
bad,I didn’t to much like this job we only had 3 employees the manger was never there we always had a lot of repacks because we only had 3 people to stock the sales floor and the pay wasn’t good at all
bad,Overworked and underpaid. Manager needs an attitude adjustment. Do not get a good raise. Don't pay enough. There is nothing else to say about this job. Family Dollar is not a Family Store
bad,Worked my butt off and was made promises that were never met. While I ran the store the assistant manager stayed in bathroom the whole shift and would only come out if he wanted to smoke or I have to hollar for him through the door with customers in line. Was promised a manager position and never got the title but was coming in everyday doing my job plus the managers job and I got tired of being treated that way so I quit
bad,Do not want to give you your sick time that you earned working. When you try to use sick time you can’t because they are always short staffed. And the when you quit and inquire about your sick time you don’t get it because you no longer work for the company
bad,"People constantly stealing and taking merchanside, no security, no safe secure place to do anything related to cash management or handling.customers informed of too much critical information regarding store policy, security, staff and private and personal affairs. Manager is a wonderful person but needs higher helphelo"
bad,"Family Dollar has lost git's way! After being bought out by Dollar Tree, we saw the financial noose tighten. Employees aren't compensated for their work was well as the competition, weekly hours allotted for payroll is as best poor therefore not all stock or projects get completed on time. There is a lot of stress behind the scenes. "
bad,"The worst place you could work, especially if you have a family. Management was horrible, and very very inconsiderate. They said they would fire me if I left for my daughter going to the hospital!!"
bad,"This place is a joke,  you work off the clock,  scheduling is a joke, no breaks, really hard to get time off unless they are cutting your hours then you get almost none even as an assistant manager. Most of the time you end up being the only one working in the store with no way to use the bathroom."
bad,it was great when i started than i got a new manger they were rude to customers to employees cut hours without telling me offfered the ASM position said they were going to give it to me but never did offered it to someone else talked about people behind backs was very unfair
bad,Do NOT go there! Its not a good place to work! They treat there employes like dirt and cant keep anyone for that reason! 8.00 an hour and trust me it should be more! No vacation days and no time off.
bad,This job was stressful. The security barely protected the team members from dangerous people that would try to harm the store and employees. The stores are in not so safe neighborhood and the company doesn’t pay their employees well.
bad,"not bad long hours"
bad,"Customers are rude and disrespectful and they take things.Customers are disrespectful ,and family dollar dont care about their employees the hardest parts about the job is the customers."
bad,"The customers are HORRIBLE, People steal at LEAST 6-7 times A DAY. Managers MAKE you chase after these people whether its a guy or female. You don't get lunch breaks or breaks at all. They only give managers numbers to void or do anything with registers, they suck at coming to help you. Creates huge lines & than customers get mad at you because they have to wait for manager to get there to help at least void an item. YOU DON'T GET ANY WEEKENDS. You get 1 day off every 2 weeks. Pay sucks as well."
bad,The Manager at the lindenwold NJ family Dollar fired me because I had a family emergency I called ahead of time but she didn't want to close alone and I told her I couldn't make it the next day I call she tells me know your fired I told you I needed you hear and all this other stuff fter I told her ahead of time I have a family emergency
bad,It's the WORST company to work for. They don't care about their Employees. They make you work of the clock so that they don't have to pay you. They make you work at all the stores
bad,It’s horrible and never will suggest someone to ever work there and it not much else to say they over work and under pay you there is nothing good about this company
bad,"I worked for family dollar almost a year and was pregnant the entire time I was working. My manager tried to over work me. My hours was being tampered with, and there was hundreds of other things going on. Complaints were made to corporate but nothing was done. I loved my customers but hated my job."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working at family dollar at all it’s a very stressful environment and the work you do doesn’t match the pay at all. Manager was never in the store to help out and there’s never any help when your the cashier.
bad,"Pay is very low, not good mgmt, stores are very cluttered and no security. Very high theft.  For what they expect from their employees and mgrs, not enough hours. The company doesn’t seem to care about its employees."
bad,"Most of the time it’s fun,  but it’s stressful at times not something I would do again. I personally don’t think it’s a great fix for everyone, but feel free to go for it"
bad,I would not recommend working at Family Dollar. They are not accommodating they are not caring they disrespect employees and customers they overcharge for the merchandise and they make you work over and not get paid
bad,The manager was very rude and hateful and she seemed to be a little bit racist and she plays favoritism towards other people the pay isn't worth the work that you have to do they don't have enough help so they make one person do everything while the manager is in the office hiding
bad,They don't care about their workers. They force you to work off the clock and long hours. No holiday pay and the hire ups treat you like slaves. The worst company to work for!!
bad,"I was here for four years, and for the first year or so it was great. The store had an awesome manager who really cared for her employees. The pay was low, but working for someone that you truly got along well with made the job tolerable."
bad,Need to pay more and work on management have clean store no over stock or orders learn to not always go by last yr stock over ordering. Get friendly workers
bad,This job was the worst I ran a store that was suppose to atleast have 3 managers running it plus I only had 5 employees they never got checks or pay right
bad,Work long hours for little pay. Pay rates are not competitive for the industry. Store Managers are given unrealistic goals with very few resources and expected to complete tasks with no excuses. Many times you are working alone for much of the day trying to do everything because there isn't enough payroll or staff to have another person working with you. Company does not appreciate the good people they have and many times good people are let go because someone does not like them
bad,It was a great place to work at first but then new management came in with no training and no people skills whatsoever. Corporate takes their time helping with HR complaints and concerns. We're overworked and under paid .
bad,"Family Dollar does not allow for their employees to have a life outside of work. They have no tolerance for sick children, or medical issues. They require store managers to drop everything for their job."
bad,Management is bad. Hourly wages is bad for all the stuff you have to deal with as a store manager. Corporate needs some major help to keep employees to stay with the company longer...
bad,Poor manager skills no team work no sense of manager skills at all play to much always trying to get friends in the door leaving people's out that really want to work
bad,"All that matters at the end of the day is whether you're turning a profit. Got promoted a week in and a year later I can notice the change in my disposition. Inspired me to chase my dreams, honestly."
bad,"I was physically, and orally threatened and I asked for tr.  Company told me they couldn't because the store would fall back into previous issues if I left, so I resigned for my own safety."
bad,I was there for you and there was never a chance for advancement or raises the highest Res I got on the year was there was only 50 cents I would work off the clock and not get paid
bad,"You know how you define ""SLAVE"", you're that person. Everything they put them on your shoulder. They'll take the life out of you. NO MERCY...Take a moment before making your moves."
bad,i started working at family dollar and was told to work under someone else name. after that they told me i could not come back without paying me my rightful amount that was due to me i have yet top be paid.
bad,"Family Dollar does not care that you have an actual family. “Flexible” in their terms means whenever they need you to work. If you request a day off, everyone complains including mangers. I was upfront about needing Sundays off and having open availability rest of week due to having to work different shifts everyday. This is a problem. They treat other employees very poorly. Do not work for this company unless it is temporary. Pay is terrible too."
bad,"I work there part time, I didn’t really like it ! I only worked on busy days! And I was a cashier/stock person! And I worked really hard for the company!"
bad,Good job for kids who is in highschool who wants to earn money and learn how to save money and be more independent . They’re willing to work around any school schedule whether it’s highschool or college.
bad,"The company pays you terribly, and you get treated terribly"
bad,Disrespectful environment. Use and overwork crew members. The workload does not match the paycheck. The management is not always willing to show respect to employees. unstable and insecure work environment.
bad,The customer Service is terrible from the manager have u working any type of hours. One week you might have 40 hours next week you have 20. The pay is terrible.
bad,This job is good for ppl that live close in areas and do not have children. This job is only suitable for older people and teens because you’re probably not going to get many hours unless you are a manager
bad,"Overall, it just was not a great experience. The co-workers and also the manager brought their problems to work. Some days were better then others but in the end, it was very draining."
bad,Horrible experience. Get worked like a slave for VERY LITTLE pay. No overtime EVER! Very unorganized and unprofessional. Management will lie and lead you on to do more work for their benefit. Promise you promotion and never give it to you. Very corrupt and dirty people
bad,I was unhappy working with this company. the manager I had at the time was never reachable. when it came time for us to have a new general manager I was overlooked for someone who had to travel.
bad,Management did not excel at improving store conditions or help with employees wanting to get ahead. No structure in store to improve customer base or working conditions.
bad,They expect a lot from their employees.  On truck day if the truck is late you have to wait to go to work.  The same staff of 5 have to run the store unload the truck and get all the merchandise on the floor in 24 hours.  It is a tough gig
bad,"Overall the management is the larger issue from what I have seen as a manager myself. It is way to hard for someone in a position of influence to be removed if there is an unquestionable problem that is shown. Security was an issue at all or most times due to the companies insistence on putting stores where no one else will, and they did not do so for good reason as the crime and robbery rates will surely clarify."
bad,it was better when i was a customer. training was horrible and i dont really care to reflect but they did give me the opportunity to gain a better position  than the job before
bad,"More work than one person could handle, mot enough hours to keep store clean and the store I went to was a mess with no help and getting in trouble for things not being done"
bad,A Busy Work Place So Keot The Workers Busy . I Was Cashier So It Made The Time Go By Interactting With The Customers.  Helping zthem Find What They Need.
bad,"Typical work day consisted of checking out customers, working on freight and overstock, making sure the store presentable for the public and my manager."
bad,"a typical day at work involves ringing customers, stocking , cleaning and taking care of customers needs on top of daily project for the district. I learned a lot in management . how do organized my work load and help customers with their needs. Handling their problems and finding a solution. management is challenging a lot falls on you. The hardest part of the job was working more hours that required because of lack of staff. The most enjoyable part was the pay."
bad,come in count your register log onto companies portal and make sure that the project for that day are closed out provide great customer service skills
bad,Its really bad you have to deal with rude customers on top of rude management that doesn't care about anything but numbers and sales not the workers!!!
bad,Was fun for just building the interior of the store with a potential promise of working in that store once it was all set up. Interesting people to work with.
bad,Everybody should be treated the same with respect no matter what the situation is especially when you're dealing with public and you're bringing people up and stocking shelves and changing labels and free sticker in and Orkin prices down sponsible for the drop off the deposits was assistant manager
bad,"good starter job but I would never go back. Not sure if the location was the reason why, but im sure it played a part of me not wanting to work and be productive"
bad,"open-close 4 days out of the week, see over cashiers, bank deposits on daily bases , unload weekly truck,  stock ,customer service , management would not provide help  turn over rate  is terrible ,the worst part of the job was opening-closing while working by yourself, safety didn't seem like it mattered to management."
bad,The turn over rate is very high so having a set schedule is very rare due to constant changes in management it was often hectic and overwhelming but with the right team you will enjoy working for the company
bad,"It was tremendously depressing working there. Days were long and corporate management provided no help with staffing concerns, store conditions, or work-life balance problems. We were only told to maintain unrealistic budgets which put unfair pressure on management to do their job and the job of an hourly employee simultaneously."
bad,When I worked at Family Dollar they were always short staffed and district manager was very disrespectful to store associates and assistant managers. There has been times where the District manager has made a scene in front of customers when speaking with store associates.
bad,Relaxed place to work meet new people be a part art of something.pay is good getting paid weekly is better.managemenr isn't to strict and knows how to treat workers.
bad,This particular location is in a really bad neighborhood. There has been multiple armed robbery attempts. Very fast paced and usually very understaffed.
bad,I would recommend working there because it was a very descent environment at family dollar. the managers and coworkers were also cool. And sometimes it would be fun
bad,The family dollar that I worked at was a terrible experience. The costumers weren't polite nor friendly and would often threaten if not fight the present staff due to a simple argument. Mangers were never round to help they continued to do drugs on there breaks. It was a awful job to have.
bad,I like working at family dollar I just had my baby early and the manger fired me so I really didn't have a chance to work there for long... for the time that I did work there the hours was good it's a early job n the pay was good I wanted to become a manger but it did not work out like that
bad,I enjoyed this type of work. It was just not the type ofvplaceci would recommend to anyone. The management put their work on the employees but tthey get paid.
bad,"Got promoted quick then learned why. Management just needed someone to throw under the bus. Would get blamed for stuff that happened even if I was off. One time store manager ""borrowed"" around $50 from change bag. when I closed that night I reported that $50 was missing. District manager called and I got in trouble for being honest. She said even if the money is missing report it like it wasn't. This is not a good place to work if you are an honest person. they expect you to open and close. days you open you are by yourself but are still expected to unload carts, clean store, be a cashier and help all customers"
bad,"Low pay for amount of responsibility given and work they require. No holiday pay. Not consistent on rules at every store. Full-time employees don't get a full 40 hrs. Don't agree with them destroying and trashing perfectly good items when they could be clearanced out or in the very least donated. Summertime the stores are hot and they expect you to work hard in those conditions.  No breaks or lunches alloted due to lack of employees they have on hand at every given shift. Mileage was not reimbursed on travel out of town to a required meeting. In general this is not a very good company to work for, they don't value and appreciate their employees."
bad,"poor working conditions in stores for hourly associates; often long term facilities issues such as no AC or Heat; bathrooms not functional, infestations, etc.   unsafe in some conditions"
bad,I really enjoyed working for the company. I learned a lot of things within the company. My experience at this company I can say a great learning experience for me.
bad,I actually enjoyed this job. I just don't like the fact that I worked there for almost a year and I didn't get a raise for being there that long. I felt like it is extremely hard to stay in customer service. I'm
bad,They need a lot of help they need to improve in a lot of things like recovery and cleaning and greeting there customers as they come thru the door
bad,"As the Assistant Manager I would have to open up the store and count my register drawer and wait for the cashier to get their so that he/she could count their drawer.  I would stock the shelves, assist in unloading the truck and restocking the shelves that were low on products, as well as close the store."
bad,"great very boss and co workers to work with, the boss was very, very, very nice so was my co workers. Liked facing shelves as well as stocking them. job,job, job"
bad,"its okay , its a job , fast paced on certain days , you have to know how to count money you have to count your drawer every night ."
bad,"very low pay roll, the building is kept warm, the rate of pay is awful."
bad,I was in need of work at the time so i applied and started working at family dollar. My mistake. the workload was crazy and the boss was crazier never again
bad,I have nothing to say at this time . this job was not satysfing . I had a very hard time working here . with them paying under min wage at the time
bad,The only good thing was I lived right around the corner. I worked every weekend and every holiday and didn't get holiday pay.I was only a cashier but I was going to the bank to making deposits and getting change. They had me pulling the truck and stocking.they took advantage of me.there's no organization or communication and its low paying job and they don't want to give you a break.no air in the summer no heat in the winter
bad,"The company did not give their employees any types of discounts, the outdated machines caused many problems and was an inconvenience to the employees and customers, no security."
bad,I loved this job the people where easy going and the atmosphere was laid back and friendly. the most enjoyable part of my job was too be busy and yet not crazy busy unless it was the holidays.
bad,"3rd worst company in the world to work for, pretty much explains it.My boss was very unappreciative of all the work i did daily."
bad,This is an okay job because manager is great but the dm family dollar has is not good.
bad,I was robbed at gun point twice when I got ill from working 12 hour shifts a week straight and given written orders to stay on bed rest I was terminated
bad,"Patrol outside premises for usually activity and behavior"
bad,"It was normally a busy and fast paced day at work which I enjoyed, everyday was a new learning experience; I learned how to price merchandise, stock shelves, front face shelves, and put security tags on items as needed, my co-workers is the main reason for my leaving everyone was so afraid to lose their job and not stand up and say something wrong and unacceptable was going on within the store so I left, the hardest part of the job was the days when the truck would show up and we would unload all the merchandise and put it on the shelves the most enjoyable was ringing out customers and putting security tags on items as  well as making friendly acquaintance's with the customers."
bad,no room to grow. managers got all the hours. was always busy though. not enough hours for hourly persons
bad,Very unprofessional! Work ethic is not a srtrong point of the company
bad,bad management no help no good customer service they had customers waiting to long
bad,"Busy and long days"
bad,"it would be a great company but its way too much work to put out for what they pay you, but i met good people along the way."
bad,"complicated call center for IT. Night shifts Seasonal assignment, manditory overtime."
bad,Family Dollar is not a place for struggling mothers to work because their head managers are full of it.
bad,There is no room for growth in this company unless you know people in high places that will look out for you. While working there i found that there was a lot of favoritism. The management was more concerned with what they can do to better themselves instead of what they can do to also benefit the employees. My co-workers where awesome to work with. Very nice people but very over worked and not compensated for their jobs well done.
bad,This company does not care about you or your life outside of work. They work you very hard for a very small amount of money.
bad,"Lack of care for associates upon any level"
bad,A lot of hard work and discipline is needed for this role!  It can be rewarding in the long run
bad,"Not satisfied,received good hours at first then loss many due to new manager, very low pay. "
bad,"the company is a hard place to work for. they expect a lot out of their employees. The company focuses on how to get each person to management, so there can be more stores. This seems to be the biggest thing for the entire company. Train new employees to become managers so they can open more stores, not a whole lot of steady employees. The fellow employees are very hard workers, and love to help you out to the best of their ability. The hardest part of the job was knowing that the owners really only cared about the next dollar, not the employees or the actual customer. The most enjoyable part was to know that there was loyal customers that would come in all the time, no matter what. The fellow employees were eager to learn more to make the store a more friendly place"
bad,A typical day was basic.learning the skills i learned there will continue to help me threw out life challenges.My co-workers  were great were easy to work with enjoyed my time working there with my co-workers.The hardest part of being there was pleasing unjustifiable customer.the most enjoyable part of the job was learning something new everyday.
bad,"Cashier"
bad,"A typical day at work consists of walking in and counting a till down to check out customers if the lines get backed up (four or more people in line).I have to count money in safe. Lately there has been an issue of unreliability from some CSR's (Customer Service Representatives). I prepare work for the CSR to work on while he/she does not have any customers to service. I communicate with the manager who was working earlier and see where he/she was and where I will pick up. I have to be very observant because external theft is a huge issue at my location. The CSR's know to communicate when they get low on money so I can replenish their till. I have to manually count cigarettes and enter then and recover the store (position items on shelves correctly, pick-up items off floor before dust mopping/mopping and put up re-shop). I have to log money totals and write down an explanation if there's an issue. We have some awesome customers who really deserve the best. The most enjoyable part is interacting with our guests."
bad,this company is not a good company to work for. one week you will work mandatory overtime and then 20 hrs  the following week. The managers are the worst. they hire people off the street that has no idea what they are doing. they sit in the office and eat and socialize and sleep while you work and never have the answers. You will never do the job you were hired for. they move you around like pieces of checkers
bad,"I would not recommend Family Dollar as the ""culture"" they say they are. If you're coming into this company as a new employee to a distribution center, store, or even into Corporate, be prepared to be ""lost"" for atleast the first month or so. There isn't a good training program put in place with this company what so ever! You will be told one thing from one person, then another by someone else and expected to know the ""right"" way. It's very stressful and an uncomfortable environment. I was in the clerical side of things, and the co-workers were horrible and the people I worked with at corporate were snotty and unfriendly. The RVP in my area was arrogant and very unhelpful. If you chose to work for this conpany, please remember the things you are reading here. "
bad,learned how to use a register and learn how stocking work in a big building .
bad,Day to day is a handful. Customers are nasty and the manager didn't know what he was doing . Most of the time had cashier in a crowed store. I learned how to work a computerized register . My co-workers were very helpful and productive. The hardest part of the job was being the only cashier in a crowed store. The most enjoyable part was leaving the store to go home .
bad,They work you like a dog and don't pay you anything. As assistant manager working 16 hour shifts I made 8.00 an hour.
bad,this company is sucks should go bankruptcy they fired me because i was short probably someone else took the money im sure because i have too much experience handling money but oh well i was working good first week did i start i was cashier second week i was assistant store manager at that time i was working hard to get to be store manager to manage my own store but cindy general manager and robert store manager fired me because the issue did i mention before
bad,"Family dollar is a very terrible place to work. Mangers work six days a week and over 52hrs a week. Payroll is always being cut, you can't enjoy a real break, there's no real security and most stores don't even have a real breakroom for employees to enjoy. I would never encourage anyone to work there. I think that the owners need to do the show under cover boss but, come at a store in the hood of chicago, I'm sure they wouldn't last."
bad,Cant say to much about this company. I've worked at other places that I enjoyed. And sad to say this is not one of them. I believe in customer service treating people with respect and the customers come first. And unfortunately the management team does not agree. From what I have experienced.
bad,"Management sucks. Manager is a micromanager. Can be a very demanding job but the pay very is good. Wide range of customers, lots of crazy strange, ghetto, transients."
bad,I start the day off before store opening time with store maintenance and ok cheek off list. cashier stock and theft tagging once the store is open. I also get a 1 min break
bad,"The district manager I had was a wild beast; he expected us to work 96 hours and 16+ hour shifts. The pay however is weekly, and very competitive, but you will literally work for EVERY penny."
bad,all i did was stocked shelves and clean the store it was always busy the customers were not so clean with there food and would get on the merchandise.
bad,"No comment just glad to have a life again. I worked average 60-70 hour weeks, 15 hours a day most times, no budget to give employees hours, a lot of freight pushed into the stores that overwhelms the store, the floor and the employees."
bad,This was an okay place to work. My boss was the best lady I’d ever worked for but when she moved away the store fell apart. We were not prepared to run the place without her and had little to no help from upper management.
bad,"It's a fun place to work but it's very unsafe. The location I worked at don't care about their employees lives.  But, if we stole from them they make sure that the employees are delt with."
bad,"The job is good for people who goes to college and looking for something part time but if you need to make a living this wouldnt be a job for that. "
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. "
bad,hello its was nice and wonderful and great working with your and i had some good times with everyone who ever work their with me in family dollar i wish i could work again.
bad,No communication from corporate or the DM.  Very low pay and the job description should be changed from manager to glorified stock person. would not recommend working here to anhyone.
bad,I really enjoy my time at family Dollar it’s was a great experience with them I wish they could had some benefits with there company and give you a lot of hour
bad,It was an awful place to work do to all of the robberies in that area and the neighborhood was not a good neighborhood to be near so it was a lot of drug activity.
bad,"Family Dollar was a very stressful environment to work in, do to store location and upper management issues. I did enjoy my team and loved what I did."
bad,"Manangment was fair,  stocking shelves and checking customers out, co workers did their job pretty good. Evevryone got treated equally"
bad,"My day sometimes started by me opening the store and getting ready so that my employees had a productive day."
bad,Assistant managers are basically doing the store managers job and not getting paid for it. I have to be a cashier lost and prevention stock guy store manager
bad,"•	Assisted the store manager in daily operation of the store (occasionally assuming store responsibility in his absence)"
bad,store manager wasn’t understanding about having a child(ren) when something happens or not having a baby sitter at the time you are scheduled to work due to the fact that she didn’t have a child(ren) herself and how kids does get sick and will get hurt. And that you need to make sure they are ok. Cause my son is my world
bad,This company doe not value its employees and extremely under paid for the amount of work required daily. I managed 10 locations and never acknowledged for the hard work we did
bad,You don't get paid fairly. Work either 14hr shift or 6 HR shifts. The employees are bully's. They work you till you break you only get 15min breaks unless you smoke.
bad,Nobody is on the same page. Management is focus on their selves and not what's important for the company. No team work what so ever. Disorganized all around from top to bottom.
bad,There are alot of things that needs alot of work. The higher management do not listen to issues and nor do they try to help. We need more managment that is wiling to listen and fix the issuses.
bad,"Unless you’re an assistant manager you won’t make any money, cashiers get less than 20 hours a week unless it’s christmas season. Management is not professional and corporate rarely picks up the phone."
bad,"I worked here for Almost a year, first off as part time the Pay sucks plus management does not do they entire job and certain Co workers Dont put in their full effort they take advantage of the system. clearly my point is if you want a good job working at family doller is not it."
bad,Customers are rude. Most of the time they think that because it is called family dollar everything should be a dollar. There’s also no opportunity to grow in this company. And no much of a difference when it comes to raises it is only by cents.
bad,There philosophy is about the bottom line money their really not interested in the employee the more you do the more they want and if you can't make the store your life your unwanted
bad,The have no hours to give works but want them to get everything done and will call you in and get mad and threaten  when you don't want to come in because you have a family. Full time is a joke they say you are full time but you end up giving your hours to someone else who is part time. you get no help putting out the truck.
bad,Family Dollar is a very messy and Dumb company. They won’t spend profits to hire security to keep theft low. Encourages theft indirectly by under staffing one person in building so its ideal and convenient  for a theft. Yet you alone to work the register unload freight and service customers. Have a nerve you set sales goal.
bad,After coming from the world of Walmart. Working at Family Dollar was often exhausting and so unorganized. They to run a store with very little people. Yet the trucks are huge and the stores are busy especially at the one I was at being it was in a rough neighborhood. As a manager I was on register more than I complete my tasks. All monies were counted by hand mulitple times a day often at the expense of the waiting customers. I aldo went and got a second job because pay was dreadful and when I did I was told I couldnt step down that it was against company policy. And was told not to return.
bad,Family Dollar runs their people like machines. 80+ hours a week and no days off was a typical week. Payroll and corporate are jokes. They do not care about their people or the well being of their staff. They push and push and no matter how much effort or energy you put in it is never enough. Salary is 52 hours and they work you 80 with no compensation or appreciation.
bad,My experience working there was under management that was verry unprofessional at times understanding that this is a place of work and business nothing was noted
bad,Not enough money ... Not enough hours .. cannot maintain a life working there you can't afford anything not even to pay a bill I feel like everyone should get at least 30 hrs a week
bad,"Upon accepting my position , i was excited & believed there would be many career advancements , the only thing i got from this company was disrespect & no understanding of family & children."
bad,The job was easy but you had to do everything. They called me to go in on my free days. They didnt pay for all my hours and the security there is not good. People always stealing stuff.
bad,The atmosphere was tense and hostile between employees. Management was not sufficiently trained. When taken to their human resources they swept it all away.
bad,"They expect more out of you then your paid for, they show partiality to individual in the click, you do bosses job and he gets bonus for you doing his work"
bad,The store managers and company all together are inconsiderate and has no compassion for their employees. The feel that the business is more important than your health.
bad,Very bad management when it comes to DM. Had a male DM that wont lift a finger. Put me in a store that had rat and bug infestation and wanted me to get the store together on my own without a team. He was s compulsive liar and did nothing til I requested for the Health Agricultural Dept to get involved.
bad,Family dollars is hard to work for. They dont aprove vacation time and open on all hollidays they need better managets to work with over all it is a oor work plave
bad,"Store closed, wasn't making enough money. Manager was rude and insulting. Cut hours if you didnt ""suck up to the boss"". Blamed cashiers for money he was stealing."
bad,Dont care for the egos and selfishness at the work place. If my schedule is made already then I'm only working those days and hours unless I agree otherwise.
bad,"Stressful,  you never know if someone will show up for there shifts, and sometimes you end up working in the store alone. So you end up trying to do other projects as wells as running back and forth to attend to customers."
bad,"no opportunity for growth, rude and lazy managemnt"
bad,Benefits aren't good loved the customer service I had no intention of leaving but there was tension after my injury they don't look out for their employees
bad,On an average day you are expected to go above and beyond you work duties with only two employees present. They have a terrible turnover rate and go through employees more than any other company I've noticed. You have one person throwing all the freight while the cashier is expected to throw freight and man the cash register. Usually no more than 6 employees at any given time. Stores  not given enough hours. You will be scheduled below a certain amount of hours daily so they wont have to give you a break through out your shift.
bad,"Horrible job wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know wants you to be a stocker, cashier, and play security guard all while being unpaid and under appreciated"
bad,"typical stressful day like working at an office, boring and depending on were u work depends on how much work you have to do...……………………………………………………..."
bad,It takes everything in me to do my job with being under paid and over work my life here is quite depressing i worked here for to long with nothing to show for it please don’t become trapped it’s a true wast of time and effort people definitely deserve better.
bad,"Family Dollar products are cheaper, they  target the area where people have low income."
bad,"You worked long hours. Had no lunch breaks.Worked 7 days a week."
bad,"Tha manager used her authority to manipulate her coworkers in to doing what she wanted, and also not following company policies. I do not recommend working at the Family Dollar in Greenmount, London Ky"
bad,"It was a job. They promote anyone marginally competent very quickly and then offer them very little support. Also, theft was high at the location I worked at, which has since been closed because of repeated thefts ""in house""."
bad,"On a typical day working at family dollar, all u do all day is stock shelves and check out customers. Also you have to make sure you’re watching the the store to make sure no one is stealing because people do steal from that store a lot. You never know what people are capable of because they want to steal items. That’s why I don’t recommend anyone to work at Family Dollar."
bad,I love the customers but hated the safety for the employees. I loved unloading the trucks putting up merchandise. But overall horrible company to work for because they dont value they employees
bad,If you are looking for a  first job I would advise you to apply. But if you are looking for a career do do it. Family Dollar is really good for a temporary job a carryover something to get a check and find something better.
bad,"We had poor store management"
bad,As long as u kissed butt to the Manager u were golden. Starts out fun and quickly turns cut throat. If the Manager likes u u will be ok I'd not watch out.
bad,"No lunch breaks "
bad,"There is a glass ceiling in this company. There seems to be great places to go, but the obstacles tarnish the reward. There are never enough hours to complete tasks at hand."
bad,Management is expected to do a great deal. I suppose it would be a good part time job for someone that is an hourly employee. The pay isnt that great.
bad,The company had no structure. There are times when you work open to close for several days at a time with no coverage. Security is a big issue. After being robbed their main concern is the loss and not your sanity
bad,Hard work not enough pay management is poor and so is the upper management when you have a complaint of any kind it is blown way out of place and taken as if you did something bad
bad,Worst Management I have ever worked for. No structure and bad employees that do what they want. If I where the head manager I would have a set schedule and work structure that will be under the store policy and give fair hours to all employees.
bad,The Manager at the Store was not professional. He had his favorite empolyees and they got all of the hours. The job was not what they said it was and the store was never fully staffed
bad,"I managed inventory, and dealt with customers. I also build relationship with customers and worked on inventory management. This job teaches you patience and responsibilities."
bad,"when u work at family dollar there is only 2 staff members at most. 2 in the day 2 at night. (low staff). one is most likely the manager and when i worked there i covered a lot of ""called out"" shifts. and over night to work on the store mostly bye my self. because of lazy management. the store is always messy because of boxes of truck laying around and not a enough staff to do them and focus on customers. witch led to long hours of bad moods then bad customer service.not going to lye, the friendly co-workers and the lad back environment is why i stayed there for so long. but i would never recommend it as a job to stay at for more then a year"
bad,The hardest part of my job was its location. the neighborhood was very high in crime and just dangerous. Low staffed and caused much stress so much to do and not enough time to finish. no overtime was allowed.
bad,"The management had unrealistic ideas on work ethic and how to have balance and empathy as a business. Very little pay yet they expect you to work all day even if it starts at noon, come 11pm you're still there closing up and counting money. You had to make a deposit every single night which was a security issue. All cameras were broke and we were robbed often."
bad,2 weeks into my job when manager quit. After that it was 60+ hours a week at 9.5/a hour... They did pay overtime but the store hours were cut. That meant the other employees were cut down to very little hours each week.
bad,The manager was not fair about working there she play favorite to different employees I worked a lot of overtime. And was not appraisered for any of my work
bad,"they are always willing to hire new people instead of giving an employee a chance to advance. they do not work well with people that have anything to do other than work for them. no paid sick days, no paid vacation. no motivation."
bad,Management at family Dollar is terrible. None of their priorities are straight. They don’t care about staff members at all no matter what you do for them. They just pick any body to be Manager
bad,extensive responsibilities with little or no compensation.  expectations were high with no gratitude.  the boss was great at first but after awhile of working there i found out that the management along with fellow employees were very clicky and secretive.
bad,"Never work with this company. They are very inconsistent,  the pay was horrible,  and the work atmosphere was very dangerous. No security and no benefits for the employees."
bad,The shifts are not that great and not alot of people work there so you barely get time off. Its been years since ive quit so things might be different
bad,Very stressful and not enough hours allowed in the budget to schedule adequately to complete a days work let alone receiving a truck . A minimum a of 55 hours and 6 days a week was no where near the compensation salary that was paid.
bad,The above was simply not for me. It was just a stepping stone or learning experience if you will. Great if you don't have children or  bills to tend!!
bad,Very short staffed sometimes with very low pay and really no advancement on top of rude customers and sometimes even more annoying managers it also depends on the environment.
bad,"Long hours, no family time and no assistance from upper management. Customers were usually friendly and helped the days go by better. Company did not seem to know how to balance life and work."
bad,"There is no advancement for all qualified employees, unsafe, no teamwork, unfair treatment to some employees, favoritism,  It had gotten hard to enjoy your job when their is no teamwork."
bad,Not satisfied with the job overall. Could have been much better. I enjoyed working with the customers they were very refreshing and I love making them happy.
bad,They didn't have any air and no security anywhere cameras nothing. and the workers never had anyone there with them at night. And put way to much up to employees that had not had the authority for it.
bad,The neighborhood was rough. There was a breakin or robbery going on in the store more often then i liked. The management was more focused in their phones then taking care of business leaving the assoicates to fend for themselves.
bad,"Long lines while coworkers sit on phones so most of the work was put on me."
bad,"I opened and closed the store. Ran the cash register, balanced the cash drawers, did deposits, did nightly reports, put up stock, clean the store, straightened the shelves, put the sale of the week on, took down old sale signs, assisted the manager in anything she may be working on like planograms. Working for a retail store is hard work and requires a great deal of self direction when you work in a managerial position. I learned the value of good customer service. The hardest part of the job was trying to run the store alone for several hours and trying to keep people from stealing. You just can not be everywhere when you have to do it all. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know the people in the community."
bad,Very easy but the pay and hours are not enough.  Mostly I stocked and zoned . Changed labels every Sunday. I ran the registered a lot sometimes I was by myself  also have to watch out for thief and some accounting.
bad,"It was a fun work place to work but not enough hours...I always went in  when called but still ended up with 16 hours at times. I did set up at this store when it was brand new and I Really LOVED it but only left because of not enough hours,"
bad,the company is shady and poor management. Was over worked and under paid. Wasn't taken serious and concerns weren't taken into consideration. Management only cared about the store instead of the employees.
bad,I worked there for only 6 months but i can see why they have a high turn over rate. Long hours sometime 7 plus hours at a time with any break not even to use the bathroom. Then don't even get me started about the amount of disrespect.
bad,"I don't know if its the same management, since I haven't worked there in a very long time. All I can say is that the old manager got fired for stealing money from the safe/deposits and he was friends with the old district manager."
bad,"Family Dollar expects it's associates to put Family Dollar first above all. Very little consideration to ""family dispite their name! They require their management to be available at any time even outside of business hours in case an ""emergency"" arises They change schedules shift without prior notice and require the associates to keep track of these change even if the change comes after the posted schedule Also Low pay as compared ti industry standard and little chance of advancement"
bad,Was an ok job not to professional also not a good work neighborhood co workers wasn't hard workers and didn't follow instructions to well. Hardest part of the job was always fixing others mistakes. Most enjoyably part was being the boss...
bad,"When I worked at the manteo location the store manager at the time would constantly go outside to smoke,and sit in his car. Cashier would be very busy and none to help."
bad,"The environment was terrible, as well as some of the management. They were unfair with my schedule, even though I am a single mom."
bad,"Work whatever shift/hours you are scheduled.  Do not stop, do not hesitate or you will be deemed non-productive.  If you are faced with a problem, you had better know the right solution.  If you don't, you may be terminated.  Even if you do, you may be terminated.  And the way you think things should be done is not the way that they want them done.  And you had better be able to squeeze 20 hours out of 8 because with all of the daily responsibilities, the destruction caused by customers and theft, that's about how many hours you need in a day to complete the work."
bad,a typical day is to meet up at the office and get in the work van then travel to our destination for that day. i learned that you have to be as fast as you can but make sure you do the job right. the most enjoyable part about working there was traveling.
bad,"Management has little or no training/ interpersonal skills."
bad,"WORST company I have ever been employed with! It's big me, little you type of treatment from management. What's ok for one is not ok for all! No matter how hard you work if you did not complete a task at the standards of the manager she would cut your hours drastically!"
bad,"Its horrible Unprofessional to work for, no security, horrible district an general manager, No direction. The do not treat their employee with courtesy or respect"
bad,"This is a company which uses threats and punishments to ""motivate"" it's Team members.  The last thing on their check list is how they treat their people."
bad,"My employment here was short lived as well,but only dure to the hazards and lack of security ,i was a victim of robbery while employed at this workplace,and i quit."
bad,Family dollar has really destroy my life. Coming from a person who tries to see the positive things in everything i do. Well started with Family dollar a year in a half. I have been work for 16 hours at a time. No break treated unfairly. And when i ask why i was treated unfairly. Gotten retaliate against.So i started going to school to better myself why still maintaining a professional attitude and providing great Customer Service. When they found about that i was in school made it even harder for me. Then later on got fired a day before my Vacation as well i was up for a raise.
bad,"Not a good place to make a career or money.and the hours of the schedule rotate week to week,i like a set schedule mon thru friday, weekends off,cant do that at this job,"
bad,"your required to do the work of three people and are paid horribly. you a required to be a cashier, shelf stocker, answer phones, unload trucks all by your self. management seems to just sit in office or go out for smoke breaks leaving to pick up there slack. the customers and co workers seem to make it bearable."
bad,"No breaks, no time to use the restrooms , no respect from co-workers ,running an entire store short handed every day. At times just myself and one other person. This I find is a disregard for ones safety and a no care for employees. What I enjoyed was the learning experience found at this company. And in short I did not enjoy a day working there. Customers were my fun. Helping everyone and even saving lives."
bad,For a manager not a good company to work for they are very associate friendly and need to have changed their attendance policy employees that have been their long time play the system.
bad,"Boring doesn't challenge you. Threatened with your job if you do not finish the required training,Not given time to do your training. I really dislike this job."
bad,"We were robbed not enough security and lazy managers.  Not enough sales people on the floor, impatient customers and had to pick up the slack for those who didnt complete their work."
bad,"the company is selfish  don't care about employ  or there safety , modern slavery and don't appreciate there employees for there hard work. management isn't train well. overall i work with the company over 7 years and learn a lot like customer service, cash handling and how to work well with others, witch i hope i can take my experience somewhere else that can appreciate me"
bad,Short on Payroll where you always short staffed which leaves a lot of pressure on the Management and low moral for the team
bad,"Family Dollar is inventory and merchandise focused. Projects need to executed daily."
bad,Unloading the trucks with so much random freight that never seemed to have a real home. The hours were much more than 40 a week as a manager.
bad,A typical day at work consisted of me spending y whole entire day at the store. Nothing enjoyable about this job. But that was just due to the fact that the store manager needed some better managing skills.
bad,I didnt enjoy working here. It was very low pay and I felt very unsafe. There was a lack of security and we got robbed alot.
bad,"Opening POS, assisting  customer to specific needs, arranging products on shelf for cleanliness of the store."
bad,"employees were thieves"
bad,"bad management, horrible pay, great co workers though, very sloppy managment"
bad,long backbreaking and stressful hours....everyone except mgmt is categorized as pt so there are no benefits.....from day one you are setup to fail
bad,Very busy
bad,"Well, the district Manager had no Idea what she was doing nor did she know how to run the District. A typical day for me would be a 1-9:30 shift on register/recovery/pushing out freight if not longer cause the Manager would take there slow time. with No breaks, Never took any vacations, and was never took take my vacation with pay, I worked for..I graduated High school and got a job through them ASAP. After a year and 5 months, I couldn't take it anymore, Co-workers would run there mouths about the customers.. seriously?? , I was promoted to a key holder then demoted for no reason.. was promised to be trained to become and asst manager..this company is a joke.."
bad,everyonce was great from employees down management was unsatifisfactory
bad,never will go back management didnt care workers didnt aswell
bad,"a typical day at family dollar is stocking, cashiering and tagging clothes."
bad,per fer not to say. but I would not recommend going back to this company
bad,I learned how to be an asstiant manager. I learned how to do employee scheduels. Its hard to be the manager of teenagers.
bad,The work place was a fun environment but the management team was poor in ethics and really didn't care about employees.
bad,the job would have been okay if the manager wouldnt be so hate to her employees and the customers
bad,Many of my co-workers have been great. A lot of high school drama with the rest. Store managers who don't work or are never in the store and you are required to do their job for them plus your daily duties and stay within labor. If you have any type of issue you best keep it to yourself because you are not allowed time off or to call in. You cannot leave until the next person shows up. And you receive little training as to standards and practices however you are quickly told you are doing things wrong. The upper management needs an overhaul.
bad,In my expierence. I worked with a team that was encouraged to pick out others to blame as individuals. Communication between all management didn't exsist
bad,"The job was pretty easy. Very tiring because you have to be on your feet all day . I liked the customers, they adored me. I even was offered a tip but I refused."
bad,"Work tasks too repetitive, no sense of a challenge or learning at all.  Company suffers from bad executive decisions as well.  Pay is awful for the time you put in."
bad,Something's need to chance and the people who work here don't want to do nothing and that good at all I try to tell them but it don't work so I stop and I just do it myself because if I don't the job won't get done at all so I stop ask then when I start cutting hours they get mad
bad,It’s a good job if you just want to sit there all day long. When I asked for help they took forever to even come and help me. There’s was only one person there that would help me. They got my pay messed up. And there in bankrupt right now anyways for not paying somebody somebody there money anyways!!!
bad,A lot of stress and drama working there could definitely have been a better experience. The work isn't hard but not everyone does their job and that makes it rough
bad,Poor management and they expect a lot and i mean ALOT for minimum wage! I 100% dont recommend working here if you have kids or go to school. Schedules are never right and they keep changing it ever 2 days.
bad,"an overall bad experience is what I had here. from being forced to work in the snow without proper snow attire, to being threatened by both customers and management, my experience was a singular poor one"
bad,"This company is a joke. You don’t get the pay you deserve nor the hours to run a store to their expectations. Can’t have a life outside of work. Sometimes if no coverage you have to close store alone. It’s all about $$$. Which I understand, however if you don’t take care of the people that are making you, your money. Then they will lose those good workers. Wish they would invest into the main people that are dealing with the customers face to face. And give more hours to maintain a good store. But when it’s time for inventory they always want to blame on the employees."
bad,Typical retailing and undermanned cashiering. Left with associate duties plus extra that are not. Unfulfilling in performing your duties and have to maintain professional appearance while others don't. And Isolating working conditions that leave alot on one's shoulders.
bad,I learned how to run the register and stock the shelves. I also learned to have good customer service. I know how to count the drawers before and after use.
bad,"The management treats the gelp like there better them "
bad,"Usually if someone steals the worker is just supposed to report that, at my family Dollar they had me confronting and stopping thieves. Very unsafe..."
bad,"Management isn't trained. I trained myself and knew more than the store manager when I was hired. My boss didn't think women should do any kind of labor, so on truck day I was stuck doing a CSR's job instead of fulfilling my assistant manager duties. Complaining got me nowhere. In WV, if you leave the job with paid-time-off banked you can just forget about that money. They still owe me over $600 of money that I earned. It's all about who you know, not what you know!"
bad,If the communication was better things could have been better. Wish they had better security options for the employees. Amor more employees for that matter.
bad,Fast pace environment but as far as management being an assistant manager was not that great yes you do paperwork or computer work but there is no reprimand for  not showing up for shifts it was too laid back.
bad,I was pregnant at the time I worked there and I was also the ONLY cashier but there were 5 managers. I almost never had any days off (even though I was only part time) and when I told my manager I couldn't come in on a certain day the next few days I had would only be 3 or 4 hours on my schedule.
bad,"They lie to you. Run. They don't care about your family life, some store managers are not management material. Run. They expect you to work doubles when you don't have to and they expect you to come in on your days off when they don't want to work. Run!!"
bad,"Will always call you multiple times on off days. Managers will not teach you what to do, or assist in helping you succeed. No pay raises or benefits. Will never get approved time off. Very rude environment."
bad,"It was a very unprofessional experience. The schedule was not flexible and you don’t get pay overtime, instead they take away from your hours. The store always lack the necessities like bags for the customers. It is so ridiculous that we have to give the customers garbage bags to carry their products."
bad,When I started working there the store manager was awesome he showed me the ropes around there but when they transferred him to some where else they brought in another manager and it was the worst I was working everyday and I was literally doing the hiring and the firing I was doing her job. I would never work there again
bad,"I’m the beginning when I started working at family dollar it was great!! I enjoyed the interaction with the customers, but I went through 4 managers in 1.5 years so I was constantly trying to learn how other manager work and it was very trying at times"
bad,"A typical day at family dollar consists of  counting the safe and the drawers and once that was done i would open the registers and then open the doors i would be by my self for an hour and a half, then an associate would come in and take over the main register and i would move to back up and move to stocking and depending on the day I would sign for the deliveries and i would deal with any customer questions or complaints."
bad,"I was trying to save money to move out but they only paid $7.50 an hour and only gave me 20 hours. Then the one male shift manager that worked there verbally abused me and instead of them taking action they reduced me to 15 hours. Everything I had, $90 a week, went to buying food to feed myself. When I finally quit and started college (since I couldn’t afford to live on my own I started college, lived in the dorms, and ended up amassing a good amount of debt) I had like $20 to my name."
bad,"Family is #1 in my life. This was a second job to just add a little more funds in pocket. Upon being hired I gave my exact a availability and time. That was overlooked as well as the fact that I have a 2y/o and a husband that just had back surgery 3wks ago. They don't care, all they want is for you to show up. Management doesn't clean OR pull trash on a regular. Would not recommend to a person with a family. No one else their had young kids or a family but me. If your single,no kids,this is for you."
bad,"in the beginning it was an Amazing place to work, I was one of the employees that opened the store on day 1!!! Things were great and then a turn for the not so good. management got bad , hours bad and always having to work alone one busy days. and bad judgement on their part.lost a great Assistant Manager."
bad,"manager doesnt back employees, was falsely told about benefits never received, poor management. unfortunate cooperate doesnt recognize the management is an issue,, huge turn over rate"
bad,As a high school student with no bills and financial responsibilities this may be a reasonable  job to get but as an adult with bill the pay is terrible. The starting salary is $9 and the employee an evaluation for raises come around every year what is sad is when they do decide to give you a raised it is barely 20 cents more than what you were previously making. The assistant managers barely get paid either this job is definitely not worth it.
bad,"The management was not up to standards, had 2 managers in less than a year. 3 District Manager in less than a year. No communication. Manager wanted to stay outside and smoke more than  help when needed."
bad,"As a store manager when you get hired the company should be handing you a paper stating you sign your personal life off. They overwork the store managers and ride them like yesterdays trash. They tell you that you will only work 55 hours a week but in fact, you work over 100 a week Would tell anyone thinking of taking this job just to look somewhere else"
bad,"I liked working for family Dollar but the people they put in position of manager is not idea.  They do not pay enough to live on, not enough hours, unless your the store manager."
bad,"I was the head cashier, I use to open every Monday - Thursday and rotated on the weekends. I basically thought myself everything that I needed to know to get my job done. My store manager was the worst, he never really helped any one out when they needed him, it was always go and ask this person and that person. We had basically all women working in our store, I never understood why they only had two women closing and/or opening the store. We didn't have any breaks, no discounts, no benefits and our store manager didn't protect his crew"
bad,It wasn't my favorite job the company needs to make better adjustments to things in the company and needs to have a better relationship with their empoloyees.
bad,Just ridiculous place nobody took the job seriously including the manager it would take three days to put up a truck with the hole crew being there ridiculous
bad,It had no security they didn’t provided conseling after been robbed several times we have to make sure we pushed out our item lack of employement due to no security
bad,"You can make any job fun with a positive attitude. At this job I really enjoyed the people that I worked with and it was very fast paced which makes the time go by fast. It's not easy throwing freight, but if you're a people person it's nice having regular customers who want to chat."
bad,If you are a higher up like a DM or PM is when you have job security you can be the best worker in the company and never get a rise until you are talking about quitting
bad,"Could say a lot, but... Workload demand for store manager combined with shifting personal life made for a toxic combination. Left to pursue a career that doesn't drain the life out of me"
bad,Famiky dollar is unorganized they hiring people for no reason. I only work in family dollar when they need me and i have bills to pay and I really need a job.
bad,"I worked for FD for over a year, and continually had a promotion dangled in front of my face with no sign of a follow-through. Despite being just an assistant store manager, I was given all of the store's tasks while my manager enjoyed having every weekend off (despite needing to be in the store at least one weekend day). I was left alone in a store with over 1000 dollars in its drawers/safe, leaving me susceptible to robbery."
bad,"I don't want to say negative things about an otherwise great company. The manager was not too good, and I'm not too sure how she even gotten the job. Appreciated the opportunity."
bad,"A typical day at work, is running around the store. It was very unorganized and understaffed. I learned how to work under pressure, and manage two things at once. The hardest part was all the customer with no to little help, and the management was horrible."
bad,You are over worked and nothing is confidential.  The manger leaves things all over the store. I work hard to keep the floors swept and countertop clean.
bad,Working at family dollar sucks because they don't care about the livelyhoods of their employees and they are all corrupt individuals who don't care who they have to step on to get to the top
bad,Pay is good benefits etc. Hours are long management is not about team work Discrimination against gender wages no security in the stores dangerous work setting
bad,"I worked hard and had comments from my boss's wife that made me cry and make work very stressful for me. I didn't enjoy my boss, yet work was easier with my assistant manager. I didn't feel comfortable around my boss sometimes. He made me uneasy."
bad,"As an employee at Family Dollar, you will have many responsibilities beyond what you're hired for.  This is normal for dollar stores.  Expect to provide customer service, handle cash and mop the floors.  Stocking shelves and resetting displays are the norm.  It is a retail position.  If you have a tough skin and can withstand the pressure from the people above you (probably only one person), go for it.  Personally, I knew it wasn't for me."
bad,the schedule only benefits the senior workers.  horrible stress and no room for advancement. Trucks come all times throughout the day sometimes its too busy to keep the store clean or the lines own.  management treats us like robots.
bad,Family Dollar isn't a good place to work they will hire someone that is on pills and can't keep their eyes open but they let the ones that worked go they need a new manager she just talks bad about everyone then smiles in there face
bad,"Family dollar is a rodeo. Not only is management terrible in certain stores. Some stores are never cleaned properly, some food products are expired on shelves and no one ever does anything about it. The one store I worked at we had no A/C for about 4 months. Family Dollar only cares about their money not their employee's."
bad,My managers were good and it was a fun place to work. I would have liked to have had a chance to make Management but they didn't treat their managers right. They overworked them and didn't give them good workers to work with. They should give better health benefits and better time off when needed.
bad,I have no review. It was a job. I did the job until an allergy kept me from doing the job. Not the best place to work but it helped pay the bills for the time I was there.
bad,Most of the time stores were under staffed.  Serving customer as well as keeping the store stocked and cleaned requires more than a 2 man staff during evenings hours.
bad,When working for th company y oubwill find yourself pulling everyone's weight. Stores are understaffed while managers behave like children. Not a great place to seek a career.
bad,They want you to run a store on little to no help still make a profit and watch for theft.  I worked many day from open to close most mornings by my self.
bad,"Middle management was fine, but upper management was completely disconnected from active retail work and directly intervened in the management of the store. Store managers and assistamt managers are expected to work fifty two and thirty six hour weeks respectively with little to no coverage from cashiers due to constant hour cuts, and assistant managers are threatened with termination if two many overtime hours are used."
bad,"Solid place to work, I just worked here twice and ready for something different."
bad,I enjoye helping the customers but the store managers and district managers suck. The company has no concern for its employees. Their main concerns are employee theft and trying to keep people from leaving the store without paying. I was robbed at gunpoint and was not provided any security at all. I have been left in the store by myself all day to perform the duties of myself and the missing employees. You are not allowed to cllose the store during even if you are the only one there. The store managers expect the assistant managers to cover shifts they are supposed to be covering especially on the weekends.
bad,Would be a great work environment if the management actually worked and if the employers hired people that work. The store I worked in everyone was friends so everyone called off when ever they wanted and the store manager would take the stores deposit home with her.  There was just to much drama and to unprofessional.
bad,"All I can say is thank god I had a sweet and nice store manager. There are no breaks or lunches for store management (key carriers)."
bad,"We never had a steady manager , We only had assistants, We never had a steady upper management , Never got my promotion I was suppose to get !  Horrible work place !"
bad,You did not have a set schedule which made it hard to plan things. the pay was lousy. And it did not offer any benefits. It was on the other had an easy job and it did not require any hard work really.
bad,"Unorganized management, daunting pay & benefits. I did not enjoy working for family dollar. It was a fun some days but overall not worth dealing with the unorganized management."
bad,Unless you kissed management behind you would not go anywhere in this company. You can bend over backwards  and it still is not good enough. Management would  pin employees against each other.
bad,Family dollar is a place where they want you to stock and run register by yourself cause they only allow so many hours per week between the employees. That being said the GM would get the most hours. I was the Assitant Manager and i never work over 30 hours a week if i was lucky. The pay is horrible
bad,i have never worked for a retail store that leaves you alone for up to 5 hours a day. and  the DM dose not care about his/her employment they treat us unfair. we bust our butts off for what they pay us i feel we should be paid more.
bad,The job was too easy to get. The management did not care at all. There were never enough people scheduled to get a job done. There were no scheduled breaks.
bad,If you aren't in a particular clique with some of the upper management then you can forget any advancement. Corporate doesn't care where they cut costs and they lie about their Holiday pay.
bad,"They make you work for a small amount of money if you get overtime they fix it so it doesn't show on your paycheck, only one register is open while the other register is closed until it's a line around the corner. And the managers steal supplies and money!!"
bad,"this workplace was not organized, the business was only about the people that worked in upper management and the rest of the employees were basically treated poorly and unfairly."
bad,"It plain sucks, management is so bad, lack of hours for the hard workers and so much drama in between the management. Usual day fast pace and time does fly when you are doing a lazy workers work"
bad,"They had way too many call offs, no security, every one in the neighborhood knew that was the store to steal from and nothing would happen to you. The manager was phony."
bad,"I loved the people I would encounter at this job. However, this place doesn't offer much advancement in careers. I was promised a higher position twice, to which they would throw someone from outside of the company into them, which ended up in a transfer so I had an actual opportunity to grow. Became an assistant manager and it began to get worse and worse. Was the only one wanting to work or had the drive to do so. Everyone else within my same job title or higher acted superior towards me and forced me into the worse possible shifts and doing the most outrageous things in order to pick up the slack from their laziness/entitlements."
bad,"A typical work day was open to close because i had half a staff."
bad,You have to be dedicated for this job. You have to be willing to give up your personal life. There is more labor than management. You have to thick skinned
bad,Crime and robberies occur a lot at these stores. Employees should be paid more because of the circumstances. I only worked here for a short period of time just because it was not safe.
bad,"Family Dollar was purchased a little more than a year ago. The culture, management and direction of the company are in transition which makes it a challenging and frustrating work environment. There are some really great people at FD and at Dollar Tree (the company that bought FD). But the management team is struggling to manage the integration and being on the FD side of the equation limits growth and advancement opportunities."
bad,This store was ran by thief's. My manager stole 20 sum thousand dollars worth of mechandis. I tried to report her and had proof but they didn't believe me. They was to give me the Manager position and gave it to some one that worked there a couple weeks. I still haven't been paid for three of my worked weeks. It's a shame cause it could be a great store.
bad,"Job is okay. They tell you to plan your life around the schedule but want to be upset if you make plans and they ask you to come to work on short notice. "
bad,Everyones business floats around family dollar like there is no tomorrow . there is no team within that company just pure cut throat and everyone for themselves.
bad,"Nothing to sayworst work experience I have ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They have lack in upper management...... The training program is the worst, you dont advance on the work you do but thepeople you know"
bad,While I was employed with family Dollar I was robbed at gunpoint. I enjoyed my job up until then because after the incident my manager refused to give me any time off to recover and forced me to continue to work night shifts.
bad,Managers don't care about staff and schedules awful. Most staff are treated unfairly and worked very hard while managers sit around and procrastinate on work loads.
bad,"Store Manager was more focused on gossip and favoritism than doing the job. Awful place to work. Low/inconsistent hours, low pay for the amount of work required."
bad,"There is room for you to move up quickly. If you are looking for a manger job this is the work place for you. There is always something to do, this job is never boring."
bad,Bad Mangment that is it just bad mangement and people are so rude and move so slow and the assistant manger jasmine is so rude and i will never shop or work there
bad,"Not enough hours or money to provide for myself and my family, Good job for high students needing part time work and just starting out. "
bad,I enjoyed working there most of the time. I was kept busy. The General manager ended up being corrupt and fired from stealing from the job and he always made me uncomfortable when working there.
bad,“It gave me a great introduction to customer service and taught me about the workings of a successful small business.better compensation  better management
bad,The company does not care about their employees or their well being. All this company is ever worried about is what the store is making. I was assaulted working in one of the stores and all they was worried about was when was I coming back to work. Not once did they ask was I OK  to come back to  work. They never higher enough people due to the fact of the availability of them trying to save company hours. Just one of the worst experiences ever in my life. Never again....
bad,very poor enviroment low pay many hours even open to close no life thats what they like been there 2 years and everytime i ask for vacation it gets turned down
bad,"Managers have too many hours with not enough help. "
bad,"Family Dollar is going thru some corporate changes.  These changes consist of location of corporate office, re structuring of departments and management.  It is not a good place to work right now."
bad,assisting and helping guest on a daily basis and kept store clean and fully stocked with all the niceties that the store required
bad,the job was okay. wake up 7am work 10 hours and I was paid every week. most enjoyable part of the job is the learning aspect and working with one other employees
bad,The job was by far my worse no support within the company staff. I had to lay security with no help as a female working in a store with all men mostly.
bad,While i enjoyed the job i found the corporate people to be invasive and highly inconvienient as well as pushy and rude. I enjoyed the staff and manager i worked with and the customers were fun and emtertaining to get to know.
bad,Manager yells at you constantly in front of customers. You are by yourself and at risk for robberies and you have to watch both register and stock shelves. You have to do the truck by yourself and wait on customers. you are timed on truck and stocking the shelves if you take long you are yelled at. Management does not work around your schedule appointments including doctors appointments. Have to schedule around your assigned days off. The pay is too low and the good work you do is unnoticeable.
bad,"I loved the challenges of working as an assistant manager, I loved the daily duties and the in and outs of how to run your own store. I didn't appreciate the promotion stance they took according to seniority instead of work ethic or how well the job is being done. I saw people being promoted that smoked on the job or never left the office and left everything to every one else instead of to those that deserved it."
bad,they have a lot of opportunity to grow.. how ever they do not want to pay for the work you put in. you can be an Assistant Store Manager and make 9.00hr.
bad,"I, personally found working at Family Dollar unpleasant and they expected you to split into 4 people because the turn around rate was too high."
bad,"To begin with, Family Dollar starts you off with $8.00 per hour.  However, you can only get 25 - 32 hours per week.  Not bad if you have another job. However, Family Dollar insists on being your one and only job, although working for them alone is not enough to pay the bills.  Furthermore, you must have an open schedule.  This means that Family Dollar can schedule you for any shift on any day and the schedule can change several times in a week."
bad,"On a good day, you can get through shift without any arguments from customers, any stupidity, and without having to run into the district manager. On a bad day, we get robbed, told off, and can't finish our work. I learned how to prefect my customer service and how to bite my tongue with any stupidity thrown at me by any customer. Management couldn't be flexible with my schedule even after repeating that I was going to school and what days/times and they were always changing my schedule (calling me to coming in early, staying later than usual, or not coming in at all). I've seen people get fired on their days off for not wanting to come in even if they had plans or had requested the day off."
bad,"I like my job for the coworkers...sad."
bad,"Basic job functions : organize and restock shelves, cashier"
bad,"Dislike I ever worked for the company, I wouldnt recommend the devil to work here. This is a modern form of slavery, they want to slave and not pay the appropriate pay. Team members calling my personal phone all day. Higher management wont speak up. THIS PLACE IS A ZOO"
bad,The associates werent professional. Neither was the manager. The hardest part of the job was taking orders from a boss who talked about your work to everyone.
bad,"A typical day at work will be mostly cashing out customers, while its slow i will unload U-boats and begin stocking while stocking i also have to keep eye out for thefts and customers ready to cash out . I enjoy team work hours go by fast and things get done faster. I also enjoy the majority of our costumers who come in and greet you back when greeted  . The most hardest part of the job will be when its really really busy and costumers will get inpatient and angry"
bad,productive and fun workplace co-workers are great to work with the management is very helpful and considerate wen you need help the hardest part of the job was ignorant customers but i held my composure and the most enjoyable part of the day was i got to go home
bad,Overall good experience for management but no room for growth and when growth is available the pay is awful for all of the responsibility
bad,"typical day at work would be my manager in the back room sleeping in the office,while I unloaded stock and wait on customers and cashiered. No air conditioning and breaks only if time allowed."
bad,"Honestly, this is one of the worst jobs anyone could ever have. The expectations are ridiculous and nothing is ever good enough."
bad,"the management is not the best, horriable hours, i was there for a whole year no bonus no higher pay, my coworkers were lazy not the best ones, no one worked as a team"
bad,"had to clean fridge & freezer and stock shelves, run the cash register and had to help customers. was made to clean rat droppings and hand scrub the floors because the management refused to do it, when they were told to do it from higher ups. they called you in on your day offs. over worked you on holidays and up coming holidays, and cut your hours back greatly after the holidays. did not promote with in. worked for over a year and was greatly appreciated by customers, and co-workers. they brought someone else in and promoted them to asst. manager with-in 3 weeks. Very Poor Management and poor higher management. Everything runs down to the lowest people because the manager and higher ups refused to do. The Asst. Managers were nice to the employees, and were worked a lot more than the manager."
bad,Working on a daily basis with a supervisor on duty everyday...Assisting customers and cashing them out while packing out items and maintaining a clean work space.
bad,"A typical day at work is to assist customers in the accurate application of their transactions."
bad,under staffed and managers are over worked.they did not provide security for customer or staff. the placement of safe was not safe for the store. closing the store was a hassle with i verify alarming the store. i worked 65 or more hours a week got paid for 48 hours.
bad,To be a fortune 500 company they are basically slave driving people not training them properly and peoples lives are jeopardy.
bad,"Managers work alone for over 4 hours per day with no other employee help.  Managers have to put in over 52+ hours per week."
bad,"My day included coming in, counting my drawer, and keeping the store fronted and clean while assisting customers. Some of my coworkers were fun and nice, but the manager was incredibly rude and seemed to almost be racially predjudiced against me. I learned to unload the truck, use a pallet jack, and how to operate a cash register. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck, while the most enjoyable was working with the assistant managers, who were kind and fair. However, while living in the next town, I was only being given 4 hours to work a week."
bad,"A typical day at work was decent , by being at this job and holding a management position for a year it tought me how to overcome adversity in the workplace. Higher management was poor , co workers were great people and  I enjoyed my time working and getting to know them. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with customers."
bad,"I learned a lot as a Manager at Family Dollar, but if you do not keep your inventory at the store correct, then you could lose you job."
bad,"Horrible Company to work for. Overly worked staff and awful benefits."
bad,My typical day at work was decent. The management was almost non-existent and lazy. The co-workers were unprofessional never stayed for more than a few days. The hardest part of the job was talking to my manager and his boss. The most enjoyable part was having a job and interacting with the customers.
bad,"I was responsible for unloading trucks, stocking and a little of everything within the store.  Management wasn't the best.  My co-workers were very unfriendly, as myself, I tried to get along with everyone.  The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks.  Sometimes there was a lot of heavy lifting.  This was not a very enjoyable job."
bad,"The scheduling was very unfair, and one of the assistant managers was giving out personal information about employees. Was not impressed with the leadership."
bad,"Family dollar is not a fun place to work at"
bad,"never had enough staff.  managers were incompetent.  expectations were unrealistic (even though I busted my hump every.single.day.) no gratitude, and the company does not care about employees."
bad,"normal work day some rude some nice customers"
bad,"Not challenging enough"
bad,"Overwork for pay"
bad,"This job wasn't good at all. It was a good summer job, but they don't try to work around your schedule, they try to take over your life. The manager I was under was very horrible and had poor customer service. She was over worked because they don't provide enough hours for everything to get done. With the work that i was doing I should have been paid 9 or 10 dollars and hour."
bad,"overall family dollar need to work on there management  and check people background more closer,"
bad,The store manager and the asst. manager were bumping heads and trying to put the crew memebers in the middle
bad,Went from a 3rd key personal to a store manager in 6 months. Loved the experince of being a store manger.
bad,Very unprofessional. They want you to work your self to death and give you nothing in return.
bad,They don't take care of their employees they pride in the business and that is all.
bad,"open or close store, stock, watch for thieves, paperwork, and manage employees, weekly audits, merchandising, truck, vender check-ins, and product ordering."
bad,"A typical day at work is really busy. I learned to remain patient. Managent was ok but, most of the time i was the only one on the register and they were busy most of the time. My co-workers were enjoyable but lacked teamwork skills. the hardest part was dealing with unruly customers, but i grinned and bared it. the most enjoyable part were also the customers. There were people who made working there worth while seeing their face on a regular basis."
bad,Not a good work place for long term something short term only.
bad,Suppose to come in at 4am to stock. The manager was late almost every time. The district manager cut the hours so I was only getting 10 hours a week. The stockroom would be a mess because we didn't have enough time to finish each week.
bad,"this employer expect the employees to eat, live and breathe the job. they also expect the employees to put thier lives on the line for merchandise, if it is stolen. you are promised a certain amount of hours, but the promise is not fullfilled. I enjoyed interacting with the customers, however management stereotypes all customers and expects the employees to follow the same path."
bad,"Management was not qualified enough to manage. Although the customers were friendly, safety was an issue."
bad,Working stock at various store and setting new schematic. Working for Family dollar I learn how to become knowledgeable of new procedure considering this company change by the day. The hardest part of this job is keep up with the amount of stock being sending to stores it can become overwhelming at times. The enjoyable part of this job is working on a team.
bad,"Typical day at work was boring and annoying. I learned to handle money. My manager was okay. My coworkers were okay, but nothing over the top. The hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was sharing nice conversations with usual customers."
bad,They dont like to pay you for all that you do. There is alot of advancement oppertunities.
bad,They were unprofessional and loud.
bad,It was all going good until a new manager took over the store. She change everything when she is never there. She has me working all nights.
bad,"It was a terrible job, no lunch breaks with bad job security and low pay"
bad,"I worked with Family Dollar for Two years as a ""Customer Service Representative"". In that two years the store went through 3 Store managers, 3 assistant managers, and 4 customer service representatives/cashiers. The job itself wasn't difficult, and some of the people I worked with were great. However it was a very stressful place to work, we were always being threatened with being written up or fired for the smallest things, such as forgetting to tuck in our shirt or not having time to get tasks done because we were busy. The district manager was very unprofessional and would frequently come in and yell at associates in front of customers, for things out of our control such as the system going down. The work/life balance was very bad, because the company wants you to put it before anything else in your life, meaning if you were taking classes, or had a second job, you could be fired."
bad,"A typical day in the life of a Family Dollar employee is not a difficult one. You provide top notch customer service, stock merchandise and keep your store neat, clean and orderly. Not hard right? Of course not! However, the store I work at seems to have a huge problem with work ethics and it starts right with the management. I'm not one who likes to complain about an employer but this can't go without being said. Nobody in this place likes to do ANYTHING and then they complain about OTHER people not doing THEIR job right! The manager would rather walk around the store with the telephone to her ear (and yes they are PERSONAL calls she is on NOT business!!!). Family Dollar as a whole is not a bad company to work for but this store is VERY poorly organized and run."
bad,They require to much work for the time limited . they are not as concern about there customers as they should be. There are time when there are lines back up almost to the middle of the store and there is only one person in the store. There not enought safety concers for the employee of the customers.
bad,Stressful. The hardest part of the job is getting all that needs to be done with the allocated payroll. The most enjoyable part of the job is hiring an employee and watching them grow with the company.
bad,Will not comment at the moment. Nothing to say will stay neutral and positive as possible.
bad,"Dont get payd what u deserve , as a manager . Sometimes we dont get a break if we have to work all day . Which means a 13 hour shift . And we have to do alot of work . Pay isnt good ."
bad,District manager not realistic
bad,The will force you out if they dont like how you do things. They are a bad company to work for. I was there 2 1/2 years and was fired for not doing my job. Which I did very well with no cash overages or shortages more than $5.00 .
bad,"they do not treat you like an employee, the managers dont know how to communicate with employees about issues that accur throughout the store"
bad,Find somewhere else to work  hours are cut regularly and the pay isn’t worth not being able to go to the bathroom for hours at a time. The only thing they care about is snickers sales
bad,"I don't have any good things to say about this company."
bad,"The management only cared about people working. Did not and was not understanding about home scheduling or emergencies."
bad,"Working for Family Dollar was nice at the start, until you being to stay long enough. Poor management, bad security, terrible scheduling, unfair work environment, high expectation, and overworked. The only good thing was helping and servicing customers because you get to learn about the community you live in, and some become regulars too! Overall, Family Dollar is good if your starting out or looking for a quick job but its not something I would recommend in the long run."
bad,My typucal work day at Family dollar was assisting customers and putting away merchandise. I learned alot at family dollar like how to be an assistance manager and open and close the store. Other things I learned was how to fill out deposit slips and make weekly schedules. The management here at family dollar treated you poorly no matter how hard you worked. The hardest part about this job was trying to put away a certain amount of merchandise while running back and foryh to the reguster. My favorite part about this job was being able to unload yhe truck or help sey up promotional endcaps.
bad,Manager was good but Assistant Manager was horrible.Using bad language.Always down me infront of customer.He was horrible.He attitude like he is the owner of the company.very bad experience for me
bad,"Management was not that great, since I worked a block away they expected me to pick up the shifts of call ins. Discipline was horrible, no actions were taken unless head bosses showed up..."
bad,Job was okay a lot of work for a little pay. There was no work life balance they want you to spend all your time working if some calls off you have to stay and work a double
bad,"I loved working as an assistant manager till they changed store managers, then it just went downhill from there showing how much the company does not care about its employees or if the employees steal from the store."
bad,They could do better in the whole company because some managers and employees are very disrespectful and don't really care how they treat other people.
bad,Working at Family Dollar was my worst experience by far. There is always too much work to do for too little staff. They are placed in dangerous neighborhoods with no protection for employees. Upper Management is impossible to get in contact with. Many of the employees lack the motivation to do their job correctly and so the store is always full of trash and overstock.
bad,Like l said the store a few blocks away was completely different. Excellent place to work. If I ever got that transfer. The other store manager would call me to help out in his store. The employees told me he loves the way I worked. I asked him to transfer there I was told it was up to my manager. After that I wasn't called back to his store. A month or more later wrongfully terminated!! 🤔
bad,Not paid fairly over worked under staffed always non responsive boss frequently worked far beyond required hours with no compensation for time worked do no recommend
bad,The location was dangerous. The DM didn’t care abut the condition of the store. Over worked. Store was unorganized just from the lack of teamwork from the other employees.
bad,"It Was An Okay Place , Management Wasn’t Always Following Conduct , Not Enough People On Staff , Face Paced , Not Enough Security , Pay Was Okay , Paid Every 2 Weeks"
bad,"it's a good start for young kids trying to make a little money while going to school. You can learn if you have the right manager, there is room to grow."
bad,"Working for Mountaire you'll learn something everyday, it'll be either scale, cutting, weighing, or even computer skills. Very nice management teams and everyone works together."
bad,Start as part time very little hours on minium pay they work your butt off and it's hard top advance then once you deserve to advance our deserve more money they let you go
bad,"NEVER and I mean NEVER work for this company. "
bad,"It is terrible. The customers are nasty and rude, and the employees are just the same way. Some of the work is pointless. Your opinion does not matter there if you are not at a higher position."
bad,"Family Dollar doesn't pay well for the work that has to be done, especially if you're part-time. You work to hard for nothing!!  Not rough hours for an adult with a family and bills. If you work there don't go part-time its useless!"
bad,"I had a terrible boss. She tries to work her employees like they are slaves. She's lowdown, talks to her employees any kind of way, and she tries to make the employees mad at each other. She tells lies, steals money, and gossips about the employees personal life- which has nothing to do with their ability to do work."
bad,"They have favorites down at the store, some people they just wont fire, and its not a good practice. Let me put it this way a fellow employee can hit you and not get in trouble."
bad,This place is a very stressful job! As a store manager it’s very difficult to have a life outside of work! Long hours poor management! Your over worked and underpaid
bad,"Dangerous, management lacking managing skills, low pay. And no paid holidays unless you worked day before of and after only for 3 holidays. Company believes work is your life."
bad,It was trashy and the district manager was stealing blaming employees for what happened. Cameras didnt work and had to pick up slack of other employees
bad,"It's a job, the particular one I worked at was fair. Management was not the best and the hours are non-existing. The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck. The best part of the job is the customers."
bad,Underpaid for what has to be done and cannot give excuses or reasons of any kind for any reason.Higher ups as DM-Regionals due as they want while store that need help dont get it and stores that go over payroll or staffing module dont get punished as the other stores that do need it.
bad,Ok to work at if you are fresh out of High School. Upper management and District management can be a head ache at times. Very fast paced and you have to be a jack of all trades.
bad,I was not able to advance past asst manager. I did not receive fair pay for long hours. Management was lazy. No time off. No lunch break. Can not live on salary are
bad,The company is not bad to work for. The employees for the most part are friendly. Could use better methods of ordering inventory. To much product all at once.
bad,"I enjoyed most of the other employees and meeting and talking to the customers. The manager Is rude, disrespectful towards employees and customer, She doesn't train properly, she shows favortisim towards certain employees.  myself and a few other employees complained about her to the district manager but nothing has been done to her."
bad,This is a good place to work for people that aren't looking to work a lot. You will never get to work 40 hrs a week at this job. The most I ever got was 30 hrs per week. It's a good job for students and for people that don't mind getting little hours. The work load isn't much either. You're either checking out customers or recovering aisles. If it's a busy store you'll only recover the front area and there will be other people working on the recovery. If it's a new store you'll most likely recover and check customers out and even stock. The pay is good and if you get lucky you'll get cool and fun assistant managers. I worked at 4 different locations and I always worked with great assistant managers. The hardest part of the job is when the district is doing contests between all the stores. We would have to try and sell the most candy so we would have to ask every customer to help us. If we didn't reach a certain goal our store manager would get mad at us.
bad,If you do this job make you get the right training because if you dont you will never learn. You would have to learn on your own and learn with a lot mistake and a few write up
bad,"This job has spiraled from management to outright slavery. It is entirely too demanding for the pay and the higher up in the management you go, the worse it is . You can't get any help or even report someone because they all tell each other. Wow just wow."
bad,"Low pay rate,unsafe neighborhoods an no security working alone most nights. Company policy changes a lot, understaffed usually with high turn over rate"
bad,"My typical day at family dollar consisted of cleaning and organizing the entire store, unloading and rotating stock, assisting cashiers on the registers, performing daily paperwork, and handling customer complaints."
bad,upper management is two demanding and does not understand what it is like to work in the conditions they put us in week after week they expect the world with nothing given in return leaving you working 69+ hrs a week with no family time
bad,Family Dollar does not care about the safety  of their employees. They expect you to protect their product but they don’t. Provide no type of security at all. The store was infested with mice  . Meet some good people though customers as well as fellow employees. All the DM’s worry about is getting their bonuses. Would not recommend working here.
bad,"Unrealistic work pace expectations with very little training.  Poor workplace culture, everyone is afraid to speak up to management about issues out of fear of retaliation or job loss.  Fear of missing work due to family obligations or illness, penalized for it, no exceptions.  Management is full of bullies with zero empathy.  Management talks down to employees in a demeaning manner."
bad,"Management would constantly bully and harass employees and trash talk employees in front of their very faces,  worked many hours of the clock and the company never truly cared for the wellbeing of their employees. Their only concern is money."
bad,"Greet customers, daily balance of accounts receivable. Daily bank deposits. Check in all incoming inventory. Verify the accuracy of product being delivered."
bad,"Overworked for low pay, tried to cut my hours multiple times. Explicitly said they didn't like that I was student and worked there because it was during the week working hours. Eventually I was forced to work 4 days to eventually just 2, and that is when I had to leave because a manager cutting back my hours is completely unacceptable."
bad,An OK place to work if you're a student or have free time and want to make some extra cash. Be expected to do the work of several employees for minimum wage.
bad,"It would be a nice place to work if the company would stop cutting so much hours and having to be forced to work with only 2 people a night when you need at least 4 people to close the store at night, and the manager would stop changing the employees hours so they don't get paid for all the hours they work."
bad,"Working at family dollars was okay "
bad,"The head manager expected the impossible, other people also complained about her also. Example 2 full buggies, a full U-Boat in 4 hours by myself on a busy day."
bad,My time at this store has been interesting. My most cringe-worthy positions I ever held. The district management staff promotes tension among the store employees by pressuring unrealistic sales goals.
bad,"This is a job for you if you don't have kids, or family. "
bad,I didn't get paid enough for what I had to do and deal with. I never got a set amount of hours. I had school to balance with work and I never got time off very much to get homework done.
bad,I currently don’t work there anymore but when I did they store was a wreck. Not much has changed from what I see but when I worked there it was worse. Theft was a constant and cashiers took on manager rolls. We were over worked each day and the managers were no help most of the time. Many issues with this job.
bad,"Workplace can be productive if you stay busy and find something to do. If you don't assert yourself, then the work day will be long and boring for you. As long as you has self motivation, then you'll be alright."
bad,"Corporate has no idea what they are doing. The DC never sends the trucks on time. The inventory system is a joke. They only like to dangle the carrot, that is the only thing they bare good at,"
bad,"I was a Training Store Manager for family dollar and if you are a csr or assistant manager you have good chances to advance due to high turnover but if you become store manager you will never advance to a DM position because although they promise that they hire internally, they almost exclusively lie and hire externals."
bad,Too many bad experiences to list. Manager quit on a Friday after unloading his truck and locked his doors as he had no help. No buggies in the store as they have all been stolen. Same for the baskets. Refrigerator has outdated food dating back 1 year and also had Black Mold.
bad,"A typical day at work is pretty much filled with recovering products, making sure the store is clean and presentable while also dealing with customers who may or may not give you the proper respect. What I've learned from this job is that some people can't help thinking that you are their maid meant to clean up after them when they make a mess or that their always in the right when there's actual proof that they aren't. I've also learned to rise above pettiness and anger in the workplace and to just kill it with kindness. The hardest part of the job is not getting any recognition for any of the hard work that any worker puts in, you can't just expect great work always without some type of recognition. The most enjoyable part of the job is laughing and joking around with fellow coworkers and getting paid."
bad,The manager is okay it's just the hours you need but can also be stressful the customes was the reason I stayed I loved to stock I loved to talk to people especially the ones who's day was bad when I would come to work he would say it's slow so we could go home or Yu would have people to not come in then call in and say there not coming to work.
bad,I was laid off because the company doesn’t like their employees telling the truth about how things are ran. The company doesn’t care for their employees or their safety and I wouldn’t recommend no one working there
bad,"Store management is usually great, district mgr in my area was horrible. He did not keep his word. Managers that had been with the company 20+ years have quit."
bad,Stores operate on a slip payroll budget.  Management sacrifices their home life to be at the store because there is not enough payroll to maintain staff. I personally worked over 80 hours a week because they can no longer hang on to good employees. Communication with upper management is non existent. I loved my job there when I first started but now it is mathematically impossible to complete job tasks when they give you no help.
bad,"This is a hard place to maintain a career over the long haul. It's very stressful, the demands that come down from management can sometimes be unreasonable when you account for a lack of payroll so no employees to get special projects done."
bad,"•It becomes the same thing everyday, you will become lazy. It’s tiring. "
bad,"This particular location was challenge. Theft was out of control. Children were physically threatening us, stealing, and tearing the place up. Management was not supportive. The hardest part was trying to be a cashier, stock, service some real jerks, play security all at the same time with very quick (5 minute break) to use the restroom or smoke a cigarette. The most enjoyable part of the job was punching out for the day."
bad,"After the purchase by Dollar Tree - Company lost their way.  No longer care about employees.  They only care about profit.  Management has lost their way.  Sales are bad, and it's always someone else's fault."
bad,"Ran with very little payroll, expected to run register and put away freight at same time while you are alone 80% of the time (even when store is busy). The business model is horrid, not sure how they stay in business. Training wise, it is nonexistent literally after you learn the register. I was hired in as an assistant manager, and that's all the training I received aside from how to receive in a truck/delivery."
bad,"Easy work as a CSR, be ready to run the cash register; stock, rotate, and recover merchandise; suggestive sell Family Dollar Brand Items and/or rotating merchandise (Cookies, Soft Beverages); general housekeeping (Sweep and Mop entire store in less than 30 minutes, clean restrooms); unload weekly trucks; and anything else your manager can come up with."
bad,I would go back if they had a different store manager and they cared about their employees.. It wasn't a safe environment at all. The stire had been robbed three times in one year and they took no precautiins to prevent it. I was in fear for my life and that's not a good feeling and I worked at night.
bad,Work independently be flexible jack of all trades. Duties include cashier stocking merchandising cleaning customer service.  Signing pricing facing ad sets recieve vendor product process vendor returns
bad,You might not approve of working at family dollar because of the location's that most of the store's are in family dollar is a faced paced company and can become irritable when you constantly have to watch for thieves inside the store.
bad,"If your in any kind of management don't expect to have a family life. Hours are long with a 1 in a year bonus, and nothing but uppers coming into the locations putting you down."
bad,"it is a place to get some experience but not one to stay unless you want to be over worked underpaid and have no life, always working alone no help and company wants managers to be in the store until 3 to 430 by them selves and still unload the truck check in vendors and run the whole front of the store all while being by your self"
bad,There were a lot of daily tasks that need to be completed daily and no payroll to make sure store was staffed to get these tasks completed. Store manager was not willing to work her hours and complained a lot. The company takes advantage of employees by either requiring them to work holidays or timetables issued to have a task completed was not reasonable with the payroll the stores are given. The company is not concerned about you as far as having a family life. It was only concerned with their stores being open and getting that almighty dollar.
bad,"It was ok for the most part expect for that I had to deal with rough customers,less hours and rude coworkers. it was physically demanding and hard and fast pace."
bad,My job was to restock and clean store whenever i closed. I left the job because they cut my hours short and wasn't making enough money for my family to support them.
bad,"I liked my job, co-workers. Manager was something to be desired. He was very cold hearted when my husband passed away. He looked at me smiled and said well this isn't much of a change for you. He cared about himself or someone that would bow down to him"
bad,Salary management required to work 52 hrs. I was putting in 65 to 80. N0 additional compensation. If you leave company you lose your vacation hrs. that you have accumulated. I would not recommend this company if you expect to advance. Not enough hrs. allotted to have enough associates to run the store. What I enjoyed about job was meeting customers.
bad,Some of the employees cared about the customers and the operation of the store but most were there just for a pay check. There was no true structure or open door policy.
bad,you may have good store managers but the District managers are the ones that's lacking the dont train or attempt to work with new store managers they just through you to the wolves and expect you to get it .
bad,"Management is a joke, promotions are based on who you know.  Health benefits are great if you are full time. Open door policy is a joke. If you complain to the higher ups they will say who said it and won’t take action when the manager retaliates."
bad,"There's a ridiculous amount of favoritism in all levels, and in my store, our management never improved after getting 3 different people to work with. The schedule is always used as a weapon, and promised promotions only result in them being given away to someone else. It seems like anyone who follows the policies are ridiculed."
bad,"Seems like the upper management has issues.  They pick and choose who the allow to take their vacation time, and they pick and choose who they want to slave."
bad,This is a very stessful job. You have to make sure everything at home is taking good care of because they will work like no tomorrow. It's only good if u don't have other responsibilities far as a family. This job will not work for you if you a family person
bad,"You basically deal with people that are down and out."
bad,Wouldn’t work there again. There’s lots of unfairness inside the company. They left me with a bad taste of mouth. You get zero benefits from working there and they put a lot of pressure for the pay.
bad,no comments i was just a number in the system to them they proved that when i got hurt on the job. You was exspected to do the work of ten people while you was there i liked my job until i got hurt and they didnt care about me
bad,District Manager was great but the system to involve corporate was pathetic. You were on hold for HOURS. They were not sympathetic to the needs of the employees and the hours you were allowed to operate your store was so low you were in your store alone more than you ever should have been.   This alone is not a smart move on a company standpoint. Shrink will rise because you are not able to monitor your store while running the register among all other duties you need to do. #2.  Safety... which should always.ALWAYS be their 1st concern!
bad,"Lots of stocking and cleaning"
bad,As I worked at Family Dollar I learned that management will take advantage. The hard part was that many of the employees wouldn't show up for work. Causing me to give up days off or coming in early or staying late. I had even been resorted to working off th clock which is illegal due to poor character of my co workers.
bad,The upper managements expectations are too high. The work hours we are expected to work are long & leave no balance or time for my family. no company contributions
bad,"When I first started working for Family Dollar in 2012 it was a fun, motivating, relaxed work environment. Since they have been acquired by another company the management style has become very micromanaged."
bad,"I was regularly belittled while working there, and then a new manager was transferred in. I was sexually harassed almost every single day by management as well as customers."
bad,"Family Dollar was competitive and fast paced. With the proper management I believe this establishment would be a great environment. I put away our truck every week, delegated tasks to other employees. I also worked with vendors to make sure product was full. Just a few things I was responsible for"
bad,I worked at family dollar in Detroit for a couple of months .At first I enjoyed the job and every thing about it but the place wasnt set up right such as dealing with pay and the environment .
bad,I had to work my way up ti be a manager but only to come and find out when it was time for promotion it was always everybody else. It was stressful at point
bad,The company doesn't care about its employees. They give you a lot to do and not enough hours for the employees to do it. They don't give you enough payroll to do anything and get upset when the store looks like a tornado hit it.
bad,"The work is not very hard, but the management of the company as a whole needs to be improved upon. Store managers and higher are not held as responsible for certain issues as they should be, leaving everyone under them at risk of blame."
bad,"Work long hours without compensation. Very high turnover. As Store Manager the expectation is to maintain a loyal and dependable workforce while not having the ability to retain good employees due to inability to remain competitive, a reality in retail."
bad,"In an environment that is completely unorganized, with no accountability by management, there's no job security.  Theft and laziness are often the primary characteristics of most employees there."
bad,This company was not professional at all to work for and the district manager was not a nice person at all to employees or to the customers. I would not advise anyone to work at any location.
bad,I learned what not to do or be like if I was a GM or DM. Your unable to trust anyone. The is job is  not enjoyable.You deal with rude people   Everyday
bad,I was never given enough hours. your expected to do the work of two or more people with a minimum wage paycheck. there's no organization. its very obvious that the employees don't care about their place of work.
bad,I learned a lot as a manager working for this company good and bad. My manager was very productive and seemed like she was always at work even on her days off. I feel like the company expects a little too much from it's employees and they don't give them enough credit for all the hard work they endure. Wish the pay was a little better and there were more people working at our location because it seemed like I was the only one doing most of the work. Corporate really needs to give reasonable store budgets.
bad,"A typical day included stocking shelves for customers, dealing with customers who cursed and stole all the time. Upper management was not great at helping lower theft. They would no provide us with security and expected us to prevent all theft."
bad,"My biggest complaint about working here is that there is basically no leadership.  The district manager seemed indifferent to store operations and concerns as long as money was made, which it always did because it's Family Dollar.  I worked under 3 store managers, only 1 was professional.  The managers are spiteful and temperamental, and felt threatened by people who could outshine them.  I would not recommend unless you are looking for something for less than 1 year or if you just need a job to get by."
bad,"Is good for people that is in school and people who want to work there is good to shop there for house, food, school and etc. people would like to work there"
bad,cleaning of the store and cash management i learned how fro handle money better in sales as well as how to log inventory hardest part of the job was the homeless people in the location and the most enjoyable part was the interactions with the customer
bad,It was fun working here but the manager had the pick of her favorite employees. A typical day at work was seeing your everyday customers always smiling.
bad,"It was an ok job to work at, but there wasn't enough safety of the workers that was there. It was something nice to do while being. Having the job by me being in school and having something to fall back on in life. And taking care of my needs and wants to manage my state of mind and family and myself."
bad,This place does not pay well. As an assistant manager I made $9 an hours. If you try to transfer they will find a way to take your hours even before you are gone.
bad,In the DC that I worked in. There was a big culture of favoritism. People are rewarded for not doing there job and having their work passed on to someone else to do. Those who did do above and beyond their job were expected to do extra and not appreciated for doing extra.
bad,"I feel I am wasting a lot of talent. I have years of experience that goes unnoticed. I originally took this job for it's convenience and willingness to work with my schedule, I wanted a part time job to get me out the house. My kids are a little bit older now. My schedule is open and I would like to use my work experience and education in more ways than to constantly be on guard for shoplifters and vandals that plagues the surrounding area of the store."
bad,"I had an excellent manager, but the company is horrible. Associates were hired after me with less experience, and given more money per hour than me! would not refer this company to anyone!"
bad,if you don't kiss the bosses butt then you get lots of work that you are unable to finish your already job load  in a timely manner. the cashiers are hard workers who are not appreciated under paid and over worked store managers get the higher pay for very little work done.
bad,"Unfair pay,not enough hours,short breaks,unfair hours to workout Co workers and managers,they have me doing slot for just skittle hours doesn't pay me right"
bad,There's not enough pay roll or hours for the assistants mangers and I'm in the store for 8 hours straight along most off the time without a break the store is very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. The hours are very late and I have small child and I'm never at home with my child  because of family dollar I work every weekend because the store manager does not work weekends at all I close most of the times and open up the store like one morning out of the week and I work doubles also.I just want something better so I can better myself for my child.
bad,I do not like the way the managers handle situations in the managers are very rude managers are not nice to workers or customers they are rude and me very disrespectful
bad,"This company sucks the life outta you. Always calling you in on your off days, as assistant manager,  if have to work 3 weeks straight because someone didn't wanna work. And didn't even make $10 an hour!!"
bad,The company policies aren't good at all. They are very wasteful. If something is damaged you have to trash it. if an employee wants to take home any damaged good you will get fired for stealing. The schedules are supposed to be only part time so they will not pay you any over time. With in the company there is a lot of favoritism. Employee safety isn't their first priority.
bad,treated very unfair and the pay was very low for the amount of work they made us do the managers put everything on employees and the hours were not good ethier
bad,Overworked and no time off district manager did not work with employees I was alone in store 7 to 10 hrs a day did not get vactions when i had time built up
bad,"Had more responsible than manager, no breaks, not a fun place to work. Was always short handed, not a good place to work, wouldn't recommend to anyone. Started out part time minimum wage, worked 30 and made me ASM with a 10.00 an hour position."
bad,"I enjoyed working for family dollar, my only complaint is the store i worked at never had more than 2 people on shift at once which made things a little hectic."
bad,The salary was not reasonable for what they required of an employee and the benefits were too costly to purchase Advancement did not happen even after being promised
bad,"Bad company to work for. Low pay, low hours, and the schedule prevented me from finding other work while i was there. The regional manager fired me for putting my two week notice in."
bad,"No security in store. Ever. Advancement made through favoritism, no true training.. Unprofessional management. Dangerous environment to work in. No breaks.horrible pay as well."
bad,Store management needs more professionalism management does not care for outside problems and concerns with family emergencies management can not take no days off are expected to be there for every shift
bad,"The pay was good, the employees were friendly, but Manager expected even on our sick days to come in. She stopped hiring after at least having 7 people, but only one cashier, and one assistant manager worked together and was expected to clean the whole store along with making sure to run back to the register to ring up an angry customer. (you'd be lucky if they were having a good day"
bad,Company was very out of date on a lot of things. Needs more management and better Loss prevention but overall depending on ur employees we typically had a great time helping our customers and trying to bring balance to the store.
bad,Family Dollar is a place for a first job and only that. Its usually a mess and you are rarely able to be efficient. Theres always new reason for you to finish someone elses work
bad,I worked quickly from assistant manager to manager. The customers were grwat for the most part. Within three months as manager I helped get our store out of the red and back into the black.  The upper management and district manager especially was a complete  joke.
bad,"Over all it's a job where you'll grow to love people, progress & extreme productivity. Working there over two years I've seen a lot of people go & come but yet in still I hang tough cause I know it's gonna get better! So I encourage, inspire & uplift those who come in after me & who was there before me! I love the learning experience I've gained!"
bad,Not a great company to work for wages are not good expect too much with little rewards in the end not direction they dont know what they are doing
bad,It had horrible management. I was talked down to very negatively. There is no room for advancement. It brought in very dangerous/low class customers that were very rude and irate.
bad,Job sucks I would not work there every again in life they don't care about empolyees  security  as long as you make their money
bad,"I loved my job, until I got a new store manager and she cut everyone's hours and talked about everyone in the store in a negative way."
bad,Promised multiple times that my promotion would advance and after months nothing happened. Worked by yourself multiple hours a day everyday. The GM had no respect. Co workers were great. Sadly we all were just treated poorly by the higher ups.
bad,"Work is work. It's a job to have. You come to work, do your job and go home. Leave the mess here for the messy people in management."
bad,"The main manager is very rude and unprofessional. She was rude to employees and to customers.."
bad,This was not my favorite place to work.  There was little appreciation  or concern for the employees. Long hours without enough help and low pay.
bad,the work was easy but management was very unprofessional. A typical day at work was very chaotic. Nothing was ever organized and that made my job very hard
bad,The company doesn't seem to care about their Store manager's and paying them well. Their was a lot of theft at the store an a overworked Store manager that didn't have time to be with her family.
bad,"I rarely had days off, and because there were only two females out of five employees that worked in the facility, extra labor was always performed without that extra compensation or recognition of hard work. Getting paid weekly was probably the only reason I remained working there."
bad,"Not an employee friendly company, worked their management employees an average of 90 hours a week, would not recommend."
bad,"A typical day at work was, greeting customers, providing great customer service. I learned how to manage the many different attitudes of people. Management was okay, however we worked understaffed everyday so we were required to do more than within our job description. The hardest part of the job was being main cashier, stocking, recovering and pricing all at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and getting to experience different people."
bad,"Working here really wasn't good, they had a massive problem with shoplifters. The managers were lazy and unhelpful, the customers were nice, but the pay / hours were abysmal."
bad,I unloaded truck put stock away.  It takes a toll on your body.  You have to work where you run yourself in the ground.  You unload the truck and they want it put away in 24 hours plus keep the store clean plus all the shoplifters.  You can't keep up.
bad,Management is horrible when it comes to concern for employees and the the few good managers are quickly replaced when they speak out about mistreatment. This company simply wants to work you as hard as they can while paying you next to nothing. if you take this job thinking you'll have any sort of flexiblility then think again because you will be scheduled to work what they want you to work regardless of how many times you tell them you can only work a specific schedule.
bad,"When I started working for the company, they presented this as family environment and acted like it was. Soon after my transfer I found out this was untrue. HR was very helpful, but the company that I was in currently, district manager included was not. They were unprofessional, uncaring, selfish, inaccurate, and just full of hogwash."
bad,"The staff was very rude, and the manager only hired people she was friends with. On a typical day the manager would bring in 2 people to work and then she would leave. In the few weeks I worked there before being laid off I saw the manager a hand full of times."
bad,no payroll to run a store off of. management unorganized. I had no home life. upper management doesn't have an open line of communication.
bad,"I reported my manager multiple times on multiple occasions for being very rude to customers, accepting counterfeit money, breaking OSHA rules, retaliating against co workers, and a few felonies she committed and they said that it was okay."
bad,"constant firings. manipulation of production numbers. onstant unnecessary pressure. no appreciation of mployees, 50+ hours a week"
bad,I loved this job because of all of the great customers that I interacted with on a daily basis. It was great to have such good customers to talk to on a daily basis.
bad,I do not have anything negative to say about the company. Its just come corruption going on in  the inside. The cashiers do not make any money and management steals from their drawers. God help them. I hope the corruption stop.
bad,"I felt that management wasnt there to help you, they just came in signed some papers told you what to do and that was that. If you had questions the answers you got were short and sometimes didnt help. They really need to work on making Family Dollar a more enjoyable workplace."
bad,"It can be challenging, but also has some fun moments. I enjoy getting to know the customers, maintaining inventory and performing price markdowns."
bad,"A typical day at work sometimes would be chaos, I felt I was under trained but I still performed at a high level. Upper Management didn't care about anything but results so you could be there one day tomorrow you could be fired. The hardest part of the job was being stuck under someone who was incompetent and their actions directly affected your work. the most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out to go home."
bad,"Money just enough to get by only if you are living with somebody, recommended for college."
bad,"co-workers are great."
bad,"After being with the company for over 4 years. Being an emerging leader and a district store trainer my Rvp and DM both told me that I was not going to move up. Neither have a reason why. My sales were up over 13%, payroll down, and inventory under .43 loss of $4000 for the year.  Numbers all great. Ever year. "
bad,The upper management is a complete joke (from the district manager level up). They make you devote your entire life to this low paying job.  They expect way too much from employees.  It's hard to keep employees for very long because of this. I loved my coworkers and customers.  It is what got me through the day.  It's the only reason I lasted 4 years there.
bad,"Fast-paced "
bad,They don't work with you if you have kids and they expect you to do more than expected
bad,"Working for Family Dollar taught me how to manage payroll, make work schedules and help others to advance. A typical day was fun and busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the guest, getting to know different people. The hardest part of the job was the fact that the there was not time for your family."
bad,I would start my day with a spreadsheet to go over products and productivity. Then I determine what items what was on sale and what items that you have to put back on the shelves and put them back. Afterwards I would get on the cash register and do customer service. The management was very poor but the co workers made the job productive and applied good team work skills to get the job done and keep the customers happy.
bad,"A Typical day at work consist of working in my store by myself or if I am lucky, I have ONE cashier in the store with me. I have learned how to set schematics, check in vendors, recieve and stock merchandise onto the sales floor, and not to have any type of personal life while working for Family Dollar, and that they do not believe in safety of employees by putting safes at the registers and front doors of most stores!"
bad,worked very hard money was ok  most co workers were nice hours were ok
bad,"hard to keep good people."
bad,"Required to unload a truck full of merchandise at four am, then put it on the shelves as close to eight am as possible. The job paid minimum wage and had no benefits."
bad,The turnover for managers and employees was horrendous. They did not honor or respect my commitment to my college--Family Dollar is located on campus.
bad,"For the work that they want you to do they don't pay you enough for it. And even if you have years of experience they barely pay you for it and if you want a raise you have to constantly be on them about it. The manager is rude disrespectful and a liar there was a incident that happened and he said that I was not fired just on suspension just to go home and wait on a phone call from him to let me know when I could come back but never got a phone call and seems every time I called he was never there or so called to busy to talk which I found very odd since just the week before I turned in my review on him which was less than anything satisfactory as a manager my fellow co workers that I thought where nice and friendly since ive left from there has done nothing but talk horrible things about me to customers. the manager does not care about you at all he constantly changes the schedule and cuts hours without notice, he has no respect for the employees and does not think about the risk of danger he puts us in when he catches someone stealing and confronts them and starts chasing them like a CRAZY person.  Theres really a lot that I can say about my experience there but that's just a taste."
bad,"Company is in trouble and needs to better structure how they run the company from the top down,as far as the door to shelf,cycle counting and budgeted hrs for each store,time have changed and in some areas of different cities there is more foot traffic then you give allotted hours for to run a store..They also work the manger more then 80hrs a week but only pay for 52,not how you run a business"
bad,"Working at Family Dollar was an experience for me. I mastered the cash register, and became very friendly with the customers that frequented the store."
bad,Have to work various hours that may not be compatible with a family.
bad,"All management roles are done with out payroll , no fair compensation for the hours put in. don't expect to have a day off, the only day off you are getting calls from upper management to get corp. task to get done or else. zero job security, no personal security be ready to deal with shop lifter's and if you a manager your store might get robbed in any moment . if it happens you just keep going with no support from your district to deal with the problem, lack of training, what I learned, what a waste of time .An environment of walking on egg shells and abusive bosses which cant get there work done, but except task be done with out giving the proper tools to do a good job. store merchandising for the customers are good. If the powers in upper management put people first, It would be a great place to work. The majority of the customers are friendly."
bad,"- Answer phone calls from retail store managers and corporate users experiencing technical difficulties."
bad,"After almost six years, the day always started the same. My team members and I didn't know what time we would be leaving until we were given our set ups. Sometimes it would be ten hours and others only half a day depending on the work volume and the season. Making plans was near impossible...kids, family and especially for team members who went to school in the evenings. When equipment breaks, which is often, higher than normal vloume or visitors from corporate there is mandatory Saturday work. Typically each morning, each team member signs out necessary equipment then goes to their department meeting. There we were told where we would be working and how long. Sometimes, if you are cross trained, you would be sent to other departments to help with being short staffed. As an orderfiller, I used a voice pick system to fill stores orders. I worked around lifts, conveyors, floats, and PIT's. A production standard must be met or you will not keep your job, get a raise and will not recieve a bonus for the year. Each year the standards were raised without improving the process. Only 3 holidays are recognized. The pay is below fair for the job functions. Whatever the weather conditions are outside thats what they are in the warehouse sometimes worse. FD knows they are at an advantage because in this small town there are no other places of employment other than McDonald's and one of them shut down recently. Also in my 6 years, I had 11 managers in Repack alone. If you need a job, it's the better of what Marianna Florida has to offer but not recommended."
bad,"The company in the California area is growing rapidly. The problem is that they hire so many people for management positions from other companies that they all are told they will be up for promotion as soon as possible, only to find out several others were also hired for the same position. They consider full time anything over 25 hours even though benefits of a lacking health insurance are offered only if you average 30+ hours. No employee discounts, no sick time for anyone under head store manager, and one week of vacation only loaded onto your account once a year. The security of the store is severely lacking. In my time, I've seen employees in confrontations with customers (because of the company), constant shoplifting (because they purposely build stores in low income areas), employee cars stolen/vandalized, and customers flat out carrying weapons on themselves."
bad,"Typical day at work includes greeting, assisting and checking out customers. During times when not checking out customer, I was responsible for stocking and organizing merchandise. The store manager and assistant managers helped rarely due to them talking on their cell phones or taking breaks. The co-workers were fine and did their jobs. The hardest part of the job was the constant malfunction of the POS system which caused angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with different customers from various backgrounds."
bad,This was my first job and the company was unprofessional in a lot of areas.
bad,Horrible employer who practice unfair firing practices. Bad managers who don't communicate with assistant managers.
bad,Management wouldn't help any. Co-workers were fine and many people didn't help.
bad,I wouldn't recommend employment for family dollar to anyone. A day at work was like a day in hell. They say you're title is to one position but no they hassle you to try to do all positions. My managers were okay except for one.
bad,"open the store, make deposit. How to work in  Fast paced company. unloading truck."
bad,"management was rude, nobody knew how to do their jobs, sticking to policies were ignored even by management and nobody knew how to grow up around certain calls,"
bad,"One shows shrink, terminate. Large shrink Will not be accepted in organization per rvp."
bad,"I worked here for a year as an Assistant Manager. They have an ""At Will"" policy where they can fire you for no reason at all. It is not a job that you can feel secure in. I worked 50-60 hours a week while my supervisors stayed home. It was a very stressfull and laboring job for little pay. As soon as the supervisor got upset with an employee personal or job related she fired them."
bad,Its a very stressful job and it doesn't balance off with my personal life. the management is very bad and its a disorderly company to work for.
bad,typical day was to unload truck then stock the floor and face front all items.
bad,Not very fond of their busines practices. I would not recommend this company to anyone!
bad,"Fast paced how I enjoyed the most, the job was loading/unload, stocking, so I was pretty much experienced within. It was sweet."
bad,My job was okay. Didnt really learn much. The customers always acknowledged how great of a job I did.
bad,dealt with customers as far as greeting and handling customers complaints and concerns as well as dealing with alot of theifs the enjoyable moments was having th4e regular patrons coming in.
bad,great experience. everyday some thing different would happen that would make this job worth coming to. the management was not on the job. to much shinkage that the locate
bad,it started off cool at first but as time went on i got to notice a few different things about my co-workers like change in attitudes co-workers stealing i got laid off just because i told my manager that I could not make it to work in the morning on Sundays anymore and i thought it would be better if i could come in the afternoon my manager told me no if i cant make it in the morning on Sundays i cant work... the only thing i can say good about that job is the costumers i got more costumer service gratification then anyone in that store
bad,Its ok not really what its crackef up to be. There isnt any benefits. No room to grow with this company. No job security. No raises.
bad,I had fun when i worked there you got to know the customers by there first name. It became a family they looked out for you.
bad,"Hours are long, I worked 15 hours at a time for 8.00 an hour as assistant manager!"
bad,an average day at work is like any in the retail field with usual cashire and stocking work what i learned at the store i worked at is that if you want to be successful there you and your co-workers have to be on one accord the hardest part of the job is probally a customer rush but if you handle it well you will do great the most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you meet working there
bad,New manager was unorganized. The company its self is decent
bad,"Management does not care about workers always overworked "
bad,It been really hard I’m a single mom and a  full time manager there and been there or 2 years and I’m always looking for something better it like my work is never good enough and I work really hard work over time come in for people and I’m never appreciated.
bad,This not an ideal place to work. Long hours sometimes. Other people don’t show up for their shifts or show up late. No recognition for hard working employees. No security.
bad,"The expectation is high. There are rarely breaks or lunch breaks. You will work by yourself for hours putting up stock, working with vendors and being a cashier. The pay is horrible as a assistant manager or manager."
bad,They promise all kinds of different things but once you are employed with them there is no point talking about anything that bothers you because most times nothing is done or they tell the other people who said what and you get backlash for it from the other person it was about if it concerns another employee.
bad,Not interested in commenting about the company at this time due to legal reguards . If you are a hourly paid manager u are ok . NEVER AGREE TO A SALARY POSITION WITH FAMILY DOLLAR / DOLLAR TREE ... U WILL GET SCREWED
bad,"My boss was very rude ,disrespectful & uninterested in me as a employee I hated working for her soon as I got the chance I left because it was plenty of days I went home crying but the pay was good for my first customer service job"
bad,"Management sucks, assistant managers aren't allowed to take breaks, if you do and are called to do something you have to go right away. No pay increases ever, unless you threaten to quit. Customers always rude."
bad,"Upper management would not even address the safety concerns I addressed several times. No help from upper management. They wound not ever takes any of our concerns "
bad,first   couple  months  were good.  then after that mangerment  went downhill   my district manager   was  very fake person  all she cared about was making her bonus   at any cost.    alot of promise   but  never  got  what they  promised     was made to work overtime  for what they need and   was  written up  for going over my hours   even tho it benefit  mangement.    if you need a job it okay  but  be ready  to leave   it a revolving door
bad,"Managed very poorly,rate of pay after 6 years was horrible,my home life didn't matter to familydollar,and I was treated like I was just a number not a person"
bad,"Long, 13 hour days, on your feet, unloading family dollar trucks, fast turnover rate. You cant call out when you are sick, they dont really care about there employees. It's a good stepping stone."
bad,The people who make the decisions don't seem to have actually ran a store. The expectations are enormous compared to the measly pay which is stressful and encourages burnout. Hard to find reliable help and the turnover is high. The medical benefits are extremely expensive and the work is taxing on the body.
bad,You work exetremly hard... 8 to 10 straight no breaks. Only the strong survive! As a manager you will sometimes close and then open the next day.. with only about 4 hours of sleep...
bad,"Terrible place to work!! I got hired as a cashier, two months in my store manager decided to leave the store and go to a different store and took two assistant store managers with him. I was then promoted to assistant store manager and that’s when I went all downhill.Corporate expects you to do everything within a reasonable time but they want to keep cutting hours, and they refuse to hire anyone else"
bad,"Family Dollar was an amazing place to work in the beginning. The manager was kind and understanding with a great work ethic. During my year at Family Dollar that manager had quit and moved to a new workplace and the manager they replaced him with was the complete opposite of him. I ended up having to quit due to the bullying of the new manager. Besides that, I enjoyed my time working for Family Dollar."
bad,Family Dollar is just a temp job or a second job. You are not paid enough to be able to afford living anywhere outside of public housing unless you live in your car.
bad,You never know what time you’re getting off work. Very poor management and supervisors! First shift gets all the work load and hours while second shift come in and play!
bad,it's not safe you get robbed and they don't care about you the pay is low. I work on my off they don't care people always stealing .not enough workers per store
bad,this job is cool long as you kissing butt..They can careless about your personal feelings or health. Safety is not an issue to management they wont help you unless you was physically injured...
bad,"Unfair treatment of employee"
bad,Para no tener empleo es mejor eso. Es un lugar muy malo en especial para la tienda.  Actitud esclavista. Pocos empleados por local. Muchas obligaciones en una sola persona.
bad,Other than the employees harassing me. I liked the job but I cant work for a company that the management is no where to be found when you have issues.
bad,typical day of working for this company will consist of having open communication with the customers. operating the cash register while also being a Stocker. Making sure every costumer visit is met to they're satisfaction accurately and effectively.while unloading merchandise and replacing inventory.
bad,Chaotic and derisive working environment. No sense of teamwork or continuity amongst the staff or Store Manager. In my opinion the toxic culture within the store is by design.
bad,i would come in and get to stocking and when we had trucks i would unload them. occasionally i would work as cashier. before i would close the store i would recover the shelves and then i would sweep and mop before leaving.
bad,"It was a stressful work place. Unorganized, drama, and not good management. I learned a lot on my own and some from mangers. The mangers was not the best. The culture was unsafe. The hardest part of the job was stocking freight and keeping the store up to part because us losing workers and them quitting. The most enjoyable part is working with different ppl"
bad,"I work for FAMILY Dollar 2 1/2 yrs. I love customer service and I'm a people person so i did love my job,but the managers and the Gm care nothing about anyone but themselves they don't appreciate good honest ,Hardworking employees. And what even worse within the last year the company has lost so many employees i mean people who has worked there for years and seem like the company would realize something is wrong but that's life."
bad,I didnt recieve a break for the first two months ever. You get worked like a mule for little pay. The job was extremely stressful. The employees were unprofessional and rude to the customers.
bad,They over work you and expect you to get multiple stock out in a 4-8 hour shift while running the register. They dont train employees they just throw you out and if you make a mistake it’s on you for not knowing. Part time people will work almost 40 hours and not get any benefits because you’re not full time even though you are working full time hours. Other employees will mistreat the cashiers and it take 20 days+ For HR and corporate to get back to you. The only benefits you will get is a coupon for the holidays that you have to spend all at once and in the store. Managers will go hours being by themselves and it becomes a safety problem. I’ve worked here for almost a year and a half and the pros are almost not there.
bad,"You're expected to be a cashier, stock person, security, greeter, janitor and all while making $7.25 an hour. The coworkers are loud and lazy and if management is their ""friend"" they are allowed to do the bare minimum while they expect everyone else do do 10 job duties for minimum wage. The workers are loud, rude, and very unprofessional."
bad,This is a low paying job. They do not have good management . They over work you with no hours and just do not care about there employees. This is a company I will not recommend no one to work at . Mangers ride to the employees and customers.
bad,A fast paced environment with little reward. Expected to work minimum of 6 days a week . 50+ hours. No support from upper management. Do not care how busy your store has become. They do not in rease store hours until the increase has been for 6 mos or more.  No help with with loss prevention but have unrealistic expectations. District help is nonexistent and regional help is clueless about what goes on at store level.
bad,Never trained put in has a holding manager.terminated bc failed LP audit. Long list of work to be done .no hrs.terminated the asm because of her age.said she couldnt handle the work.
bad,"The company is terrible to work for. You don't get paid nearly enough for all that you do. Management is awful, especially higher ups. I've worked in illegal conditions (no toilets or AC for months) and they were only fixed when OSHA was called in. The employees are awful and very petty and backstabbing; the whole environment of the store was it was everyone looks out for themselves."
bad,"The stores are in horrible locations.  You always have to worry about drug addicts trying to steal.  Instead of the company getting security, they blame the staff. I've caught hundreds of thieves and never got any type or recognition. They give you 2-3 team members, (sometimes 1) and expect way more productivity than you can produce. When the store is busy, people are trying to sneak out with hundreds of dollars in merchandise. It's a catch 22. Then when the shrink gets bad they just fire everybody."
bad,It is a good places to work but have poor management. They do not work as a team! The store is always full of stuff to where the customers complain. It just needs better management.
bad,This place has poor management on a corporate level. They don't care about their employees. They will work you to death and not give you any recognition for your achievements at your store location.
bad,"Management sits in the back room on their phones and expect you to be security, stocker, cashier, janitor and still assist customers all at the same time. This job is not something you should want for yourself unless it’s something temporary while you look for a career."
bad,Management takes off a lot of time for personal reasons but aren't likely to accommodate associates. There was a lot of stealing and gossip. Didn't care if you needed certain hours for daycare. If an assistant manager or shift lead wanted you shift they take it without consulting you. They also complained  about me sitting down while pregnant even though it was allowed in my state and the general manager even bullied me into standing with the threat of termination.
bad,Was just too stressful and expected one person to accomplish the job of many. No order constant change in the way things go. Just isn’t the job you would want to get by in life.
bad,"The worst place to work! Management is poor from corporate to the cashiers. You don’t have security at night time or throughout the day. The pay is okay, but should raise."
bad,"Gradually, you see through the smoke and mirrors. Shifts always changing, upper management treats most of the managers and ASMs like garbage. Unloading 1,000 piece trucks on your own by hand unless your store is fully staffed.  Rumors and drama between staff, manager and stores, more like High School. You get to work ALL holidays, and they care more about their pockets then the employees who work for them (at least in my district that was the case). Work/home time yeah good luck there."
bad,"High turnover among District Managers, Store Manager, and store employees. During my tenure, I had 3 DM's. We also offered the lowest associate wages."
bad,"The management did not treat me fairly. I had no proper training, I had to figure everything out on my own. It felt like high school. Constant drama from both my manager, other employees, and even customers who would harass me at times. It was awful."
bad,"This was my first ""official"" job. It's stressful, more work than paid for, you deal with rude incompetent people day in and day out. Not enough pay rate to live off of at all, even with advanced placement."
bad,"When you are management you are expected to ""run your store like it is yours.""  Since enough payroll is not provided by corporate, that means if you want to run the store as if it was your own, you will be working long hours every day to keep up with all the duties necessary to keep a store clean, neat, well stocked and open for business."
bad,"Clown show, standards have been slipping since 2006, now that they have been acquired by Dollar Tree, I expect some standards will improve for the workers and the customers alike."
bad,I think this location had issues finding staff and managers. It is a small town and they were understaffed. The managers were working 7 am to 11 pm due to staff shortages.
bad,"It was okay ! The pay was good , the customers was very nice . Overall the hour was good ! I like doing the orders & the stocking & unloading on truck days ."
bad,Always busy with usually one cashier or sometimes worked by yourself. To many assistant managers and not enough cashiers. Most employees did not follow the rules of the company. Hardly got days off. Got called in way to many times. Lots of work that always had to be done in one day and not enough hours or help to get it done.
bad,You can come across anybody that had a bad day nd the only seperating you and that person from ya register is a 2 ft arm length. You have to be everything from the security guard to the trust unloader
bad,"The lack of training, and poor management skills that my store manager possess is horrible!! He never takes accountability for his actions, plays favoritism to certian people. Complains nothing gets done in the store, meanwhile he sits in the parking lot thru his shift to work on his car."
bad,"I'm very unhappy here and want a better job asap. At first it was a good job,but now it's not. Management is terrible and the hrs are pathetic. I need better hrs and pay at least."
bad,Productive work place... Fast paced quiet friendly neat You get to know a lot of people learn more about food I didn't really get along with the manager because of her attitude she didn't know how to separate home from work and she didn't really help a lot she was never at work
bad,It started off fun then turned into a nightmare . Became a unsafe and hostel environment.  I am left with a lot of questions and no RESPONSE . Some days are stress ful and some go smooth depending on the season.
bad,After one month of working for FD I was offered a managers position. I was told it would be a salary position 50 hours a week. I ended up working 80 plus hours a week with no days off.
bad,"I have worked for family dollar for almost a year now. The management lacks training.  They do not fully train their cashiers or the assistant managers. I did a 1 week training session when I was promoted to management. That is in no way long enough time to learn everything needed to be an assistant. The atore ai work in is very disorganized and that is being nice about it. We have no true leadership, from any of the management above me and my fellow employees. My experience as a Family dollar employee has not been a plesant one. If anyone asked me about the job and how it was, I would not lie. I would tell them that when you work for family dollar your life is not your own. Your days off are not your own and to look elsewhere for a company that carea for their employees."
bad,While here I was blamed for things that were not my fault. Being promoted was a common thing like it wasn't even an accomplishment. Their core policies were not followed well.
bad,"The only hours available were evening, nights and weekends unless you were a manager. I had a terrible manager, but likes everyone otherwise. I left due to another job offer."
bad,"Store manager does not know how to run a store, only to the ground. District manager is not helpful at all. Terrible work environment. Unprofessional all around. Lack of communication from SM to ASMs. They don’t offer anyone to grow within and are never satisfied with all the work that is done. The pay for an ASM is not worth it, especially since the ASM is required to do the store managers job meanwhile they get there late, leave early, or just take vacations on the busiest time. Lots of favoritism. Great employees leave because of poor management!"
bad,I am thankful I was a team member.  They work you like an illegal.  Bad hours.  Wait till you have to handle the deleivery.  Too much work.  No pay.  i have to keep changing the words for my feeling for Family Dollar.
bad,Get told what to do then won’t be brought up for you to work then will listen to complaining about having so much to do without being gave the work. Managment gives unfair breaks they give you normal 15 for 4 hours of work and 30 for 8 but the will go outside every hour for 10 mins. Also managment brings home to work and causes drama
bad,People quit left and right. Most stores was very lazy. It's the managers who do all of the work the cashiers don't do much. They do the bare minimum. There is no annual raise . If you get 1 it's only because your store audit was successful and that's only once a year
bad,"The best part of the job was talking to the customers, not all of them where nice but the ones that where really made you're day. things i learned was how to problem solve really fast, and handle cash probably. other skills i learned where how to help the customer find what they need and if not finding what they need find something similar."
bad,"To be fair the job is fine for anyone who's in need or is looking for an intro into retail, but the pay they give even to the assistant manager position is not nearly acceptable for the amount of responsibility and work you are placed with. Their systems are out of date and confusing, constant theft and misplacement in store. Opening and Closing Counts are far more complicated than they could/should be but the corporation does not care to properly protect or maintain their funds. They also don't seem to care to provide the proper equipment needed to preform even the most basic of jobs."
bad,"The job isn't bad, its a good job, a great place to work, but I don't like the dollar tree way, they don't pay the part-time workers no holiday pay, no vacation pay, and they doesn't give good raises, they raises are no more than twenty cent a year. Family Dollar is great but with it being ran by Dollar Tree its not that good or fun anymore."
bad,This was a job from the devil. People not only stealing like crazy but threating you if you even look there way. Not enough help and the distrct Managers only cares about themselves.
bad,"Extensive traveling in lower 48 states. Travel benefits, Employment quite challenging in different parts of the USA.  Salary low for the type of work preformed."
bad,Schedule issues and lazy managers. Managers don't like to do work and will try to over work you by making you do things that they are supposed to be doing.
bad,"Family Dollar can not keep employees, they promote from outside the company. The average time of employment of the associates I work with is less than 1 year."
bad,"When I started with FD, I really liked my job. The people were great, the company was great! But then the company annexed with Dollar Tree. Everything went done hill."
bad,Managers are unprofessional and careless. Assistant managers do everything and it feels like there is no team and your in it alone. Pay is not good for the hours they want you to work.
bad,I loved the customers but the work environment itself is very hostile no appreciation for hard work and long hours. But the work was easy just alot of favoritism
bad,They do not appreciate there employees. You should not care if you bust your butt or do bare minimum cause you will never get a raise. The only way you make more then 9 a hour is if you are a manager or supervisor but still will not make enough that is worth it. Goodluck
bad,"I will not recommend to work at the Family Dollar. The DMs are unprofessional, we get robbed all the time, they don't give raises enough, and it is overall a horrible environment."
bad,I Loved my job....the people I worked with....but management was horrible with a dirty mouth and poor work ethic.  At any other store the working conditions would be better.
bad,This company does not support its employees or create a healthy work environment.  They do not support family needs or emergencies and expect employees to work outside their scheduled hours.
bad,Working for family dollar was a strain work environment. The managing team expected you to work 7 hours a day with 2 five minutes breaks. They wanted me to work every single holiday on regular pay
bad,Would love to recommend FD but can not. The leadership is terrible. Doesn't trust their leaders and always micromanaging. The company is moving towards a red culture.
bad,everything from the culture down to the store needs fixing and whoever the fort pierce district manager is my goodness i would never recommend this job to anyone unless they truly needed it the best thing about the family dollar is you get paid every week that is it
bad,Family Dollar is a horrible company to work for they will screw you over and every way possible with your hours scheduling they're rude very stressful work environment
bad,I liked working there but found fairness was not company wide.
bad,"Family Dollar is a great place to work if you enjoy high stress, poor work-life balance and ever changing management.  There are very few leaders that have work their way up to management positions.  As such, there is a lack of process and system knowledge, which ultimately leads to leadership setting unreasonable expectations and deadlines."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend if you are a single parent male or female to work at this company."
bad,bank drop get change for all day resets vendor checkins stock food rotation price changes ad sets unloading  trucks handling difficult  customers  doing returns providing great customer service
bad,"Really enjoyed some of the people I worked with but the District manager was demanding and rude. Had to work very long weekends every other week as an assistant manager (2p-1030p friday 1p-1030p saturday and 830a-930p sunday) with nothing to really make the hard work worth it. Not enough employees and most people would leave with no notice (probably due to the horrible criticism from said district manager) making it other peoples problem, sometimes from other stores and sometimes you are scheduled to go to other stores. Liked my manager and he did the best he could but higher ups made it difficult on most managers that I knew in the district. Fine enough job if you're a cashier but moving up, I found that I didn't like the district manager and there were no perks and just overall not worth bending over backwards for."
bad,the job was good .just that the management didn't care about the employees. to them you where just a number and could be replaced at any time by any body
bad,Family Dollars was a OK job. Only time really stayed busy is on Tuesdays when the truck come to unload and it was fast pace but besides that stocking the things was a piece of cake
bad,I really enjoyed being a Manager for Family Dollar; but in my opinion they don’t care about there employees. I worked with some really good people. The area managers were the ones who didn’t care.
bad,"work hours varied day to day, poor leadership, high turnover rate, good health benefits, lack of advancement, no form of support for job performance and lack of caring managers."
bad,Manager was a complete drug head and didnt like that I went to the dm and made false documents to have me terminated. Now Im now re hirable which is so very unfair to people wrongfully terminated
bad,"It is like a rotating door, people come and go. Too much nonsense from corporate and poor management. Workers are usually asked to do more than the job description and do not last long."
bad,"Family Dollar would probably be a great place to work if they paid you what the website said the salary would be, and the manager was a people person."
bad,I advise anybody to not get a job with family dollars. U will go yrs without getting a raise. Managers are poorly trained. And the stores are located in some of the highest crime areas in Florida
bad,every time I would come in I would have to stock because whoever was there before me would not be doing there jobs everybody attitude was not very good when they would come in no one would greet the costumers
bad,the store is in a bad location and was stressful dealing with the rude costumers. So much stealing and no one working to stop anyone. Only one cashier and one assistant manager at night. For the location i thought there would be more security there.
bad,"Very poor upper management, does not treat employees very well.  Required to work AT LEAST 52 hours per week, usually at least half of that alone in store.  Very stressful environment."
bad,Loved the job & the customers. I was great at my job and duty's I did there at Family Dollar. I kept front end cleaned & Stocked.I also unloaded the truck!
bad,"Too much work for little pay ! customers at my locations are rude !! "
bad,not knowing if you are going to get enough hours.  The managers play plenty of head games. they are very unprofessional  I can go on and on . I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"Overworked as a store manager. You do everything in the store. Legit everything!! Best advice, don't do it unless you are committed to be available 24/7!!"
bad,"I loved my job at Family Dollar. It wasn't until the new manager took over that everything went down hill. "
bad,The schematic always changing and not provided enough staff to productively get all that is required done. Have to love people. District Managers come and audit but very seldom like to help with improvements or assist with helping when challenges arise.
bad,Working for the company u barely have time with your family.you work every holiday unless you are a store manager.the sm want you to play a security role which is not in your job description.you are expected to keep a open schedule even when u are scheduled to be off .you not paid enough.you have to compete for raise.
bad,"Working at Family dollar Co. I had a very horrible work experience, the manager was very unprofessional. I felt very uncomfortable going to work everyday."
bad,Your life is in danger every single day people steal. And no security in any way . rude customers weak team work very bad lack of hours low rate pay poor servicr
bad,Family Dollar as a company needs work. They need better pay and real security in high risk areas. The company needs to compensate their employees more.
bad,"You will not advance with this company, and they don't pay much. They also give no benefits. Management does not seem to really care about their employees. This was by far the worst company I've ever worked for."
bad,good employees but a lot going on in work place always get dangerous at times. a lot of stealing going. plus best workers tend to be over worked by management.
bad,"Pays minimum, less money for hard work. I wouldn't advise anyone to work here. They just want to line the pockets of the big guys and the workers are nothing but a number."
bad,Its a ok place yo work they hive you to much work to do in a day time and if its not done they want to write you up but as a ASM you have to watch the store clean it recover the store be a cashier do reports on people running out the store anf iys only 2 people working
bad,"As a corporate employee for 15 years I learned a lot about retail operations on both the corporate and store level, but would not work for them again."
bad,"Working at Family Dollar was a horrid experience. The location is unsafe and was robbed multiple times, people were fired for no reasons, and management was horrible. The job experience is so bad that people would get hired and quit the same week. The manager would give you little hours and on the days off he would call you in to come work. You get no breaks and work long days. There were no benefits given to those chosen to work here and it was very unprofessional."
bad,"Not good if a manager at lower volume stores, most of day shift spent alone for long periods of time most times full shifts. Shortage of asst. managers"
bad,It was a ok workplace. Manager wasn't so friendly. I was let go with no logical reason. Store is always a mess. Although the coworkers were nice and nice customers.
bad,"Family Dollar always switch up their managers almost every 5 months and rules were always changed, everyone had a problem with the last person they didn't pay us good enough for the work we were doing but I did like working there customers were so sweet"
bad,Like the job at first but after while hated it but the judge b is just outta control at the place I worked at.i would not recommend this job they don't work with your schedule it's all about the store and never the employee
bad,"Management never had a ready schedule available in a timely fashion.  Breaks are non-existent.  You are expected to be on your feet for the whole day without any type of break or lunch.  Staffing was terrible.  The day shift had more people but only 2 people for the evening shift  (the manager and you).   Never a set time to leave your shift,  even during the day shift.  You are badgered to upsell candy bars and belittled when you don't. This place is an undercover sweatshop.  Was told that we don't have breaks. It is crazy to think that a person can work an 8 to 11 hour day without any nourishment...especially for physical work."
bad,They do not care about their employees at all the safety of the work environment is horrible and if you get injured on the job they threaten you if you need time off they will fire you
bad,Family Dollar was challenging. I had to deal with rude people everyday. I had to work most of the day by myself most of the time. A lot of the employee called in.
bad,I loved the job I did as manager just felt as if Dm expected me to devote my life to the store when I had small children. I spent 90% of my time at the store. Overall the company expects to much out of their employees with very little pay. I was not paid enough for the hours I was putting into the store.
bad,"Working there was okay.  The culture itself is okay, too.  I enjoyed working as a cashier at the dollar store for awhile.  I enjoyed helping out with customers as well."
bad,The job asked for their associates for too much within a certain time period and barely pay. Management handles things in a unproper manner and would treat employees unfair.
bad,"I am no stranger to working hard, but I hate an impossible task.  We were expected to Cashier, do freight, merchandise, security, assist customers, and other manager duties with limited assistance. 95 was allocated for a week and that includes 40 for manager. THE WORST!!!"
bad,Central Parkway Family Dollar is a very unorganized store and the environment is very unsafe. I wouldn't recommend it.
bad,The way management talks the employees inside the store is unacceptable. There is high theft (at least the store I was in) and security is a joke. I worked at two different stores and both the managers I worked for I would recommend taking a people skills class.
bad,I had lots of fun working here. The job is fun and light hearted for the most part. As a member of management it is stressful and unpredictable.  The ever changing policies and management can negatively affect job performance and stress levels. It's a good job for people who lack the experience for something with higher pay.
bad,I was a contractor working at Corporate.  It was horrible. The supervisors treated the employees and contractors as children. I had asked to be off one day for a funeral and was told that I should know that a day off requires two week notice. (SMH). Another contractor was told that they were only allowed to go to the rest room on their break. Management's idea of boosting moral is bringing in balls and games that management played in the hallway (distracting and loud) while no one else was allowed off the phones for.
bad,Manager was unprofessional at my location. Hours weren't distributed fairly and the manager was also immature and threatened to take away hours or fire me if i didn't want to come in on my day off.
bad,Responsible for keeping the store presentable. Stock and straightened merchandise for sale in the store. Construct and assemble display models. Perform excellent customer service. Worked well individually and part of a team. Perform all duties in a safe manner and follow store policies. Dedicated and dependable worker. Maintain a clean and safe work environment.
bad,The manager I had made me work my off days for a month straight so she could go shopping and drinking with another store manager.
bad,"A typical day is helping customers find the things they are looking to purchase,listening to the customer about their concerns. I have become a friend to a lot of the customers. I am and have always been a team player and that is what my Family Dollar co workers are to me we are a team we are all there for the same reason,to service each customer.The hardest part is unreliable hours out of the week never getting 40hrs."
bad,"Long hours in Boston, 4am to beat traffic leave at 6 or 7 hit traffic get home at 830pm. 6 days a week not any family life."
bad,"A typical day I would open the store serve customers work stock. I learned that most company's are underhanded.The management at my  job is like blind leading the blind. My co-works are great hard working people.The hardest part is not know if you will be robbed .The most enjoyable part is my team mates,I love my team were like family."
bad,"All I can say that they don't inform you of all you need to know if you have never been in retail before. The management tells you, you can do things that you can't."
bad,"Manager leaves all the work on Assistant Managers and there's not enough hours giving to the store to get the freight stocked, which leaves the store looking a mess. Most of the time I was the only one in the store until two hours before closing. That meant there was a rush job of  the closing duties. Must of this I think is because it's in a small town."
bad,Great management opportunity that has paved the way for my future. If you have never managed before you will get the training need here to move on with your career.
bad,They well give you incentives for work over 100%but they set there rates way to high to keep you from ever getting it. & if you can't reach them they well get rid of you.
bad,"A typical day at work would be assisting customers, and stocking any items that were needed, cleaning at the end of the day."
bad,Hello everyone! Family Dollar is a fast pace work environment that is not for the weak. You are able to advance fast if you work hard and comment yourself to your job. Overall it's a wonderful place to work just wish there were more job security.
bad,Company itself has some potential but the pay isn't great nor is the benefits aren't there bust your butt and it still isnt enough or goes unnotced
bad,"I was with them for only a few months, and in that time we went threw 4 store managers. The store over all is a complete disaster, and customers complain daily. Yet the management does nothing to improve anything. My former co-workers and managers did not seem to care, and where just there for a pay check it seemed."
bad,getting paid minimum wage is not enough to support a family. and the flexibility with retail is limited. a lot of drama with coworkers and no opportunity for a raise or advancement. most of the customers were nice though and loved interacting with people.
bad,"Claims to be a team oriented company,  but the district manager I had was a liar and if you rubbed him the wrong way he avoided helping you so you would get frustrated and quit. High turnover of managers, assistants and sales associate.  Very physical job and not enough hours in store budget to efficiently staff the store so freight could be worked and customers could be attended to the way corporate expected us to.  Work many daytime shifts alone doing it all by yourself if you are in management.  I  would never work for this company again."
bad,"This company amounts to a slave enterprise. They work you to death and pay virtually no compensation for all of your efforts. You're in charge of running and operating a million-dollar store, and are paid barely enough to live on. "
bad,I did not like this company they under payed their employees and also gave to many chances to the people who were stealing or causing trouble which in turn made more work for those of us who did want to work.
bad,typical day at work would be come in open the store take care of customers. Management above store managers are more worried about hitting payroll instead of growing business do more with less
bad,"Management has poor communication skills."
bad,"disorganized, unhelpful, think of absolutely nothing but the well being of the company without a hint of gratitude to those that help and are employed within the store it self."
bad,"Long shifts with no breaks, and if you try to take a break they'll make you feel bad about it."
bad,"A good day is a day when come to work and do not get robbed,and just work hard like a cotton picker You work by yourself for hours."
bad,"I worked for Family Dollar for 1 year, in 3 different locations. at my last location the store manager was extremely rude to the customers, so much so that they requested that she be released from that title. She did not follow corporate rules as far as scheduling go, and family dollar has the open door policy. When trying to use that open door policy I was completely ignored by not only my Store Manager, but my District manager as well as the Regional Manager. I had contacted my Human Resources Dept and unfortunately nothing was resolved. Ultimately after sacrificing a year of my life I chose to leave the company and start fresh. To anyone that may be interested in the Assistant Store Manager position, I would keep looking for other employment. In that position you will be overlooked and ignored."
bad,Stressful place to work with low pay and they think that all their employees steal. I want to try something new. It was my first time and I think it was time to move on to something else.
bad,I learned how to balance the money in the safe and get the deposit ready for the bank.  It was nice to learn that part of the job rather then just cashiering.  The hardest part of job was when corporate didn't send us bags and we had to use trash bags from out shelves.  That went on for 2-3 weeks.
bad,When I clock in for work I count the safe and check on the cashiers. I then count down a register for the cashier or I count the register for a cashier to began his or her shift. I learn that it is not easy to be a manager but I enjoy it. The hardest part about the job is the security of the store. Family Dollars are placed in some of the worse neighborhoods with no security and limited security cameras. There is always theft and there are a lot robberies. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that the pay is weekly instead of bi-weekly.
bad,The work was fulfilling and labor intensive and you need to be at the top of your game to survive. it has unrealistic expectations of people to hourly clear a truck of merchandise and monitor the entire store for theft. and in the end they will fire you for a simple mistake with no mercy or pity.
bad,Family Dollar is one of the worst companies to work for. The other store managers are shady along with the District Manager.
bad,I would not recommend Family Dollar as an employer.  This is not a pro-employee organization.  Very negative experience.
bad,"A typical day at work was busy, always on the go, and always interested in meeting new customers.  The hardest part of my job was trying to maintain positive work experience and trying to get all work done."
bad,"I worked for this company briefly, my experience was mixed. They introduced a new shift into everything and it was just poorly handled. Due to this, I left."
bad,"I worked hard, stocking and trying to keep the store in order. It was very poor conditions, seemed to me that i was working at the worst family dollar in Jacksonville. But overall i didn't complain and i learned to love my job. But It would have lasted longer if conditions were better than they were."
bad,"horrible self centered management.Considers other employees below them.Busy work,and low pay."
bad,"my typical day is greeting and meeting new people. I've learned how to be a better cashier working in a bad environment. the management I Think was great, the company had very nice people who loved there job. the co-workers were nice people and the hardest thing about the job I think was dealing with customers on drugs. the most enjoyable part would be just meeting very good people"
bad,I say Family Dollar was a boring job enviroment because it was all work and i barely seen my job employes.
bad,nice people but also to many management problems. the company itself wasn't stable. ok hours and ok co wokers
bad,"I work for family dollar for 6 months and we were robbed 6 times, i needed the job so i stayed it wasn't till we were on the news when i said enough was enough and had to put in my two week notice. The crew was nice small group i knew everyone very well and where all friendly."
bad,The company doesn't provide enough hours for the store to be properly maintained. A lot is expected from their employees.
bad,low pay and unfair work place..not all are like that but mine definetely was.
bad,"Low payroll budget, limited positions, and unfair wages. This store location along with many others has been closed and was an undesirable employment."
bad,"I realized that Family Dollar does not care about its employees, from DM, down to the manager of the store."
bad,"Running day to day operations of the store. Customer service, ordering, stocking, banking, opening and closing."
bad,"A typical day at Family dollar was simple. Providing customer service, restocking shelves, to being cashier not hard at all. The job becomes difficult when your manager wants you to do things that you know your not supposed to do like people who are trying to steal from the store. I AM NOT GETTING INJURED FOR SOMEONE TRYING TO STEAL A BAG OF CHIPS AND I AM NOT RUNNING OUT OF THE STORE AFTER ANYONE!!! The Co-workers were just as bad as the manager, however the assistant manager was very sweet and helpful."
bad,A typical day for me when i was working at Family Dollar was to create customer service while being a cashier.  I basically rang customers up daily and in between customers i would stock or do housekeeping.  I have learned to be compassionate and understanding.  The management wasnt the best.  The coworkers where great. The hardest part of the job was not being able to sit down and take a break and lunch.  The most enjoyable part was seeing different people everyday.
bad,"Company runs very minimal staff, high/unrealistic expectations for that stuff! Poor district leadership which results in poor communication between stores."
bad,"A typical day at work is very hot or very cold depending on the weather.Slow and unproductive due to the fact there's 2 only cash registers an a very limited amount of shopping carts. What I learned is to provide great customer service by pay attention to the customer,listening to the customer and providing the customer with information to help them with there need and or problem.Also I learn how to unload merchandise from the company truck manually while transporting merchandise to the salesroom floor unto the shelves with out assistance. I gained the ability to read sku's and label's efficiently.Management is fair and the work is fairly easy. The most enjoyable part of my job was providing customers with greet customer service. Listening to there problems and assisting with finding the best merchandise which is best suited to there liking while staying within there price range."
bad,Working 40 plus hours with minimal pay. Did open many doors for me though.
bad,Don't expect to work here very long. Either you'll hate it and quit or you'll get fired. Family dollar is a terrible place to work..
bad,"My typical day at work consisted of greeting customers, running the cash register, and stocking the shelves in constant rotation."
bad,"it seems to be all about who you know for this company. I have been with them for 7 years. Working my way from part time csr, within 8 months asm, then  to store manager in a little less then 3 years. I was never properly trained for my position instead I trained myself using their ""portal system"". All because the DM at the time was too lazy and pre-occupied with his favorites which did nothing all day but sit in their offices while he'll help or send them the help using feild members. I heard him state its either sink or swim i come back in 3 weeks to see how you do. Then after he got can, they sent a man whom couldnt handel the pressure of running a district and had people calling my store asking for help because I guess all he wanted to do is direct calls and blame his pm for everything. Which for some reason in this company the PM are in charge of eveything an responsible for nothing, but still they get treated like SH--, which is unfair( i had some great PMs). I was promised multiple times I would be placed in a career advancement program because im always up to date on company standars, always scored from 81-96 on my audits, and always willing to help those whom cant help themselves. Well it has gotten me no where Im still a sm or happens to be a district training manager now , but wanted to advance more into feild management but I guess since its albout who you know wont be going anywhere becasue i have went through overall 3 DMS, 4 PMS, and 5 AOMS within 4 years."
bad,i learned how do stock i also lesrned more cusomer assisties
bad,working at family dollar was alright and honestly I felt as though all the sales associates including myself were not paid enough for the amount and quality of work we did
bad,"Able to keep busy, provide customer service while maintaining store merchandise. The hardest part of the job would be working holidays, the most enjoyable part of the job, working with the staff and customers."
bad,"were never happy at that place, dealing with people of a certain is very hard, could care less, some good some bad, shopper lift,the hours."
bad,"Other than meeting amazing people, I had a horrible experience here. If you enjoy working your butt off all hours of the day with little pay, then this job is great for you."
bad,"Took over a store with high shrinkage, eliminated the reason by identifying fraudulent sales transactions, bookkeeping,   and internal theft, and in turn, lead the store with increased sales and lower shrinkage."
bad,"As a store manager you are required and expected to do many things without support from payroll therefore you end up putting in a lot of hours to accomplish tasks and projects and are only receiving salary wages, There is very little job work/life balance."
bad,Many of the store locations are centered in impoverished neighborhoods and security is not a priority.
bad,"Daily chores, run daily inventory, stock shelves, supervised others on daily tasks. I learned how to prepare a weekly schedule efficiently, unload trucks with merchandise."
bad,Working at Family Dollar has been a good experience. I have learned to communicate better with people and have grown into a people's person. I think the hardest task in my job is having to multitask. Having to stock ring up customers gets pretty hectic at times. The most enjoyable thing i like about my job is being able to interact with my customers!
bad,"The average store is run by 6-7 employees including its manager."
bad,"This job was a mandatory 52 hour work week. The store was understaffed and when I asked for ""help"" I was not offered any assistance.Many candidates would not work for the minimum wage being offered. I worked anywhere from a minimum of 65 hours to 80 hours a week. It was too many hours for one person. I did however enjoy running the store and working with the public"
bad,"hard worker,Got along with others, ran good store. i hated this job,90 hours a week, very hard to work for. you must make labor .no more than six associates to work for you."
bad,"The working environment was dirty and nasty. There were mouse in the store. Also, you hardly walk down the aisles. The co-workers are very rude. "
bad,"Loss Prevention consisted of literally stopping people from leaving the store with trash bags full of merchandise everyday."
bad,"To this day i enjoy shopping at family dollar stores, but while working at this company their were flaws in the system and my experience wasn't up to par as id wish it could have been."
bad,The company asks you to commute to a town 30 minutes away because they believe that employees that live and work in the same community are more prone to theft. The pay was not enough to cover gas costs and live on at the same time. Management was full of themselves and intentionally threw their authority around to make themselves look important. They were more concerned with their own authority than their mangement skills.
bad,"store manager treated people very unfair, i love my regular customers"
bad,I was a cashier and had to watch for theft of products as well.  very difficult to do both
bad,"I really enjoyed my co workers, the pay was alright the hours started out ok, it was a fun job at first"
bad,a typical day being an assistant at family dollar
bad,"after getting hired in early December for assistant manager position and working through the holidays for the first part of my training, I was laid off in January due to ""payroll cuts"". I was sorely disappointed, since I could have started elsewhere, and likely would still be employed. Recently I contacted the store for some details needed toa pply elsewhwere and learned that the store manager had quit as well die to frustration and stress from too few employees."
bad,a lot of work very small staff. 30 min breaks
bad,to much work not enough pay management is horrible under certain districts
bad,"Sometimes worked over 12 hours a day, truck day was the fastest day because it's non stop"
bad,very hard to work for ...very demanding district manager is not a likeable person
bad,A good place to work a second job or a first time worker. I'm not sure of advancement but it is a peaceful place to work and always something todo.
bad,I learned how to creat a tie for a pallet without it falling over. Worked with a bunch of wonderful people who was there to help if you need it.Was locating work that was suppose to be on the truck but wasn't. Able to get drivers out in a timely manner
bad,"There is never a moment there is not something to be done, I learned some management skills, but training was not a high priority due to how busy the store was. Management was hard to work with at the store I was at, not very encouraging . My co-workers were awesome but I usually worked alone. I really enjoyed the customers."
bad,"I worked at family dollar for eleven months and for nine months there was one manager, one cashier, and one stock guy.. Its a two million dollar store. We were always busy, Especially on holidays! I liked the company itself, the co-workers, the customers, the work , and management. But i rarely had time to finish my assignments mainly because we didn't have enough people or i was busy with customers. There wasn't anything i couldn't handle but i believe in teamwork and i like the fact that i can finish my assignments. I did not have that opportunity at family dollar. A typical day at family dollar was hectic!"
bad,"it's always hot,people always complinting and mg not caring so it's up to the cashiers to deal with it(not fare) not enough hours,or not being fare,that's always problem,going home is the best part of job beside the people that i do come in contact everyday."
bad,The job itself was good i had no problems with it i actually enjoyed it. But the staff were very unprofessional and highly disappointing. I wouldn’t recommend trying to build a work relationship with anyone that works there.
bad,"Schedules are inconsistent, the one where I work at they literally one gave full hours to only 2 people while they cut everyone elses. The customers around that area are terrible. The theft is heavy there and the customers will find any chance to talk bad to you or throw "
bad,"I was a customer service representative/cashier at my location which was bottom of the food chain in every aspect. The days were very fast paced and required me to get into a high level of multi tasking as I was usually the only cashier at the front of the store ringing up numerous people by myself. cashiers did the most work but got paid the LEAST. For 9 months I was consistent, on time and covered/filled-in whenever asked but would always get the run around from my store manager when it was time to be considered for a raise. I quickly learned that the situation was a dead end as both the store manager and higher ups of my district were unsupportive and lacked respectful communication skills. The only best part about this job were the good majority of reoccurring customers that came in and were encouraging and bringing positive energy to my day there along with my ASSISTANT manager. If it wasn't for the assistant managers I had there, the place wouldn't have even have got as far as it did. If you need experience or need something WHILE looking for something better then its worth a shot but otherwise this company is not worth your effort or pay."
bad,Pay needs to increase . Staffing needs work. More participation from upper management. Needs to be able to take suggestions and process them accordingly
bad,"Management is somewhat unprofessional. No matter what your experience level is, the pay is insulting. They expect you to keep your availability open even though they only give you about 20hrs a week and only pay $8.50 an hour. This job is more for high school students living at home with parents, or individuals getting Social Security benefits and just need a supplemental income. Do not expect to make a living with this job. Not enough hours or pay unless you are a part of management."
bad,Family Dollar does not give you the hours to do the tasks given but still expect it done. They don't hire quality people either. It's dangerous because in some locations there is high crime and no security. The monitoring company never sees that you're in danger or when the store is being robbed
bad,"I typed out a long review only to decide to delete it and just say, dont work here. pay is dropping come the new year for all new employees. on a good note, the schedule is somewhat flexible for me. close by my house as well."
bad,"The job itself is not hard, the customers are fair, the pay is great for a retail job, but the management including higher ups are horrible. They DO NOT care about their employees as a whole person. They only care about their stores staying up to par. They don’t take anything at all into consideration when they have certain expectations prior to their visits such as almost always being understaffed with very few hours to allocate, having huge trucks to stock stores and typically always end up with an overload of things with nowhere to put it or even having to work 60+ each week with no support. They do not care about your personal life, you have no life when working there, Family Dollar is your life. There is some favoritism, as there is at just about any job you work sadly. If you are looking for a job that pays well, Family Dollar does but be prepared to start seeing higher ups true colors after a while."
bad,"This isn’t a company you should break your back for. They don’t care about you, your worth or how hard you work all they want to know is if you’ll be at work so that they can go."
bad,"Its was not a fun time. They want 2 people to do the work of 5 and expect you to basically kill yourself with work, and out of 2500 customers per day, only 3 are nice. The rest are mean and have not nice attitudes. You get punched in the face, you're only supposed to smile and ask if they want the blood and teeth in a bag."
bad,Family Dollar is a company that doesn’t care about employees or value family time. They are open on every holiday with no holiday pay at all. If you’re sick or in an emergency that doesn’t matter because they don’t care. Pay is good but values are off.
bad,Mandatory overtime in up season is killing people.  Managment had no communication and direction.  Warehouse is a mess all the time w damages everywhere.  No direction and needs a major do over.  No one ever knows what's going on.  Good thing is is you can hide in a corner and do nothing if you feel like it .  just shows the enthusiasm there.  Dead end job due to broken promises.broken
bad,I worked. I worked. They gave holidays then they took holidays away. The stores need goods so you work on holidays. This is not like other companies that put value on family and time off.
bad,Family Dollar I feels underpays there management you work 5 to 6 days a week for 40 less hours they offer no over time unless they absolutely have to they expect you to do way too much in the time your there for your shift they can never keep employees they work store managers like a dog they have a lot of stealing and robbery's and there always understaffed
bad,"Never again. Not worth the headache. People quit on the truck days and come back with no type of punishment. Also you gotta beg for a raise, depending on management."
bad,"It didn't matter what your availability was, you were given the hours that the long term employees didn't want and that is it. There is also a 3 month blackout period from October to December, or so I was told, which lead to my departure."
bad,I definitely Wouldn’t recommend this job. The workers are overworked and underpaid. The management on this area is poor. Family Dollar doesn’t believe in giving raises when they’re due
bad,"All employees to include management work as a team- This include:  Cashiering,  Stocking, Recovering merchandise, preparing end of shift paperwork, and cleaning"
bad,Don’t work at family dollar. They work good workers like dogs. Lazy workers get weekends off and the best shifts. No compassion for what’s going on in your life.
bad,No. I will never want anyone to work there the worst experience of my life !!!!!! horrible management they accuse people of stealing while they let customers come in and rob the place BLIND !!!!  nothing done about it and they walk scotch free unorganized!!!!! unprofessional!!!!!!  people are underpaid here and th ey work you like your a slave i came in to do stock and end up being a cashier and that's not what i applied for
bad,"Any job title- from cashier to store manager you will unload the 500-800 pieces on the main truck every week. Recover the store, clean the store,  including the public bathrooms. You will stock all the items from the main truck and from the cold/frozen truck. If you can't do all of this you will be reprimanded. Basically you run your butt off every shift. No excuses allowed."
bad,"Understaffed, couldn't use any sick hours due to being unable to call out. Truck days were the worse when you had to unload a 1,000 piece truck by yourself because a worker was unable to help and having them be on your back about not being done within a certain amount of time."
bad,would not recommend working here. the managers were rude and unprofessional. team members directly disobeying and ignoring instruction from management.
bad,Family Dollar has a high employee turnover rate.  The hardest part of the job is not enough hours provided.  I have learned how to give great Customer Service.
bad,The advantages were poor as well as no raises no overtime just horrible training constantly dealing with bad health issues and health grades terribly ran
bad,The job could have been more.put together. They are not organized as much as they should be. Also they should talk to there employees more than they assume.
bad,"I'm Sorry but Family Dollar does not care about their employees or their families. You work yourself to death and can't get any help from upper management, just comments that you need to do more."
bad,"Dollar Tree is a franchised based business system; as such, the experience at each location will be vastly different. Eventually I was reduced in hours from 20 to 4 at barely minimum wage."
bad,Family Dollar is an unsafe place they do not protect their employees. Nor are they cosign or even care about their employees is all about the bottom line customer service is of no consequences. Family Dollar is not a great place to work
bad,"The pay is not enough for the work expected. Training is non existent. You'll find some good co workers and some bad ones. The long hours of standing can really damage your back."
bad,"You get one ten minute break in N eight hour work shift with no lunch unless you really have to, they prefer to work you to the bone and never give time with your family."
bad,"they work you like a slave and continually threaten to terminate you for not doing 200% of your actual production standard. Management is awful, pay is horrible for the amount of work you do. Work/life balance is horrible. Benefits are alright."
bad,"They promised me an assistant manager position but hired someone else for it, would cut my hours if i called out sick, when I told them I was pregnant they refused to take me off the freight crew."
bad,The nice thing about working here is dealing with the public. They are the reason the time fly's bye and I enjoy helping the public. The atmosphere is an laid back environment and the work load is not hard at all. Just management needs to become more organized ASAP.
bad,Could never make plans. I had to sit by phone incase schedule got changed last minute. Sometimes causing tardys or absence. Could work a double shift and not get lunch. Could eat behind counter if it wasn't busy.
bad,No dependable schedule. Very little training or even basic orientation for new employees. No reasonable time allowances for extra duties such as special merchandising for holidays and other promotional items.
bad,"Always understaffed "
bad,If you want to work at a good Family Dollar go to one where older people work. Those stores seem to be run more efficiently. The ones where kids work always have boxes everywhere five days a week. Where i worked was nasty and cluttered and when I cleaned it all up my hours were cut to nothing. It only took two shifts to put away the truck so that was all I got. I bet the store is cluttered again by now. Just a terrible place to work if you dont chose the right one.
bad,"It's low end retail; they have relatively high prices/ operating costs and low profit margins.  In non urban stores or a different market it may be different, but store property would go months without being repaired, unless the store could be shut down by a regulatory authority.  The store's online resources were often dead links, so learning operational systems often relied on calling other store managers or going on google to look for similar documents from other companies.  And promotion was handled through attrition; last one around got promoted."
bad,"Don’t break your back working here. Huge lack of communication and leadership. Overall, the constant promise of getting pay raises never gets followed through."
bad,I loved what i did. Did my job as i was suppose to and always finished on time. Had great communication with co workers. I was never late or never short.
bad,"Work often included stocking shelves, cleaning, helping customers, and handling the cash register. The culture was very mundane and negative. There wasn't anything difficult or enjoyable about the job, it just was what it was."
bad,"no matter how hard and smart you work, you dont make enough money to get out of poverty level income where i live.  i was an asst manager, treated with no respect and they expect you to give up your personal life with no return in compensation or how they treat you."
bad,Store was okay but when you have members of management working against you then you become unappreciated . Employees was not being held accountable for their work
bad,"The cashier job was decent at first, everyone started getting stressed from lack of enough workers. People started quitting, I was loaded with extra work, could never get it all done.  The lines would back up with 10+ customers at times before I got backup from a manager to open their line. Pay was not enough for the amount of work and stress. They fire people if they can not cover others shifts."
bad,"I was promised to be by a store managers side or right hand man, Promised being close to home and was promised to have a chance of owning my store, All three of those promises were lies. Id say if your looking for a job to help get ya out of a pinch then, yes! if to make long term and try and go far? No"
bad,I worked long hours and have no work life balance. The expections are unrealistic and demand from corporate was unrealistic. As manager we are expected to throw load hire unload trucks which are often days late and expected to stay until it's all finish texts are frequent. I receive at least 20 text a day that are actionable.
bad,I opened and closed the store balanced the registers dealted with very rude customers which i handled very professional did displys for the sales inventory straighted the store shelves cleaned the floors and bathroom areas
bad,"• you’re never at one place."
bad,"Great employees are over-looked. Security measures for store employees don't seem to be a concern. I've learned a lot from my previous manager. Typical work day is fast paced, but the customers make it enjoyable to a point. My upper management doesn't seem to communicate well with each other. The hardest part of the job is trying to understand my employee's scheduling needs and being able to give the hours with the payroll I receive. Its also very difficult to accomplish daily required tasks with only one employee in the store while taking care of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and establishing relationships with regular customer."
bad,"I did not receive proper training I followed a girl around for 30 minutes she said very little said i irritated her then quit I never saw her again and the other employees were condescending and did not teach me anything. They were not friendly or open to the mistakes I made receiving no training, the store was always messy trashy, and I never got a 30 minute break ever. My manager said I ate too much, even though I never received a break. The managers got breaks while I worked register for the whole 7 hours."
bad,Management could be better and there's no job security. Family dollar was robbed once a few months ago and the cashier received a write up for being robbed.
bad,The pay is low. the hours change a lot so no set schedule.  i only took the job to be closer to home than the job i had at the time. not a lot of advancement unless you are willing to commute.
bad,"I was An Assistant Store Manager and wasn't getting paid enough at all. was only making 50 cent more than the crew. I would say it might be a good job if you work as crew but don't as a manager. They over work the managers, and make them travel. I just personally wont work there ever again."
bad,The store manager has a lot of favoritism  for the people that she hangs out with outside of work so usually it’s unfair that those people get good hours and you just get whatever’s left.
bad,Store manager was always rude and did not have any type of professionalism. Customers are really arrogant and do not show any respect toward anything.
bad,"I worked at Family Dollar for almost a year and couldn't wait to get out. The job itself isn't hard but it can get stressful because of the lack of employees and hours. If you are working at a high volume store it is hard to get things done. Management could be better. I felt as though my store manager didn't care about me and my fellow employees. Scheduling and hours are very inconsistent, there is never a set schedule. So much to do for so little pay. Not worth it."
bad,"High stress, under paid for what the job duties. "
bad,"As a GM for this company you are to run your store by yourself for half the day. Labor is run so tight, that you cannot afford to bring in any employee help until late in the day. You are required to run a register, stock your shelves, unload your trucks, set up your displays, check in your vendors, do your paperwork, clean your store and be on conference calls. You work 60-80 hours a week, all while being continuously told that it wasn't good enough. The pay is equivalent to minimum wage when all the hours are taken into consideration."
bad,"Family dollar is a good company if you enjoy working retail. There is opportunity for advancement, primarily due to the high turnover of the job creating openings. As with most corporate companies, the bottom line is all that matters with little room for error. This focus on the money and not the employees leads to the manager being abused due to the salaried position. If you need a job and are willing to play the game to advance, or if you just need a job Family Dollar will provide that position."
bad,"constantly under staffed, could never keep up with checkout's when things got busy. company policy made it difficult to handle thieves. wasn't uncommon to stay at work two hours after we were suppose to close just to keep up with cleaning."
bad,The hours they expect you to work in a day are crazy. Working open to close and some nights closing at 10 pm. Means you work 7:30am-10:15pm with a 1 hour unpaid lunch.
bad,"The job was fun, because of my employees and customers. Unfortunately it was dangerous and upper management did not care or understand. They cut our hours more and more. I was expected 52 hours and six days a week, that is one thing, but the 52 hours would turn into 65 or 75 hours and 7 days sometimes, I would be alone from 730 am to 5 pm 4 days a week so I could have help during truck. Being alone sucked because we had runners and robberies often. Runners on a daily basis, multiple times a day really. In a year I was robbed 4 times at gunpoint. he first time I got robbed I wanted a couple days off and got told, ""we all get robbed, get over it."" It could be a really cool company and interesting, if there was hours to be able to run the store properly it would be awesome, but being alone 8 -10 hours a day, messes it all up."
bad,"very stressful with never enough hours for associates, and the lack of communication was beyond  words.  The company has no work life balance and expects too much from their managers."
bad,The employess were very friendly. We all got along great but management could be 100% better. Getting to know all of the customers that came in the store was a major addition to the job.
bad,"Wanted to advance in the company but the management wouldn't. No breaks, didn't know who was my boss, to many chiefs and not enough Indians. Couldn't ask for time off."
bad,It was a very hard job to have. I believe they did not appreciate their employees as they should and the pay was vary minimum for the work that you did. I don't think anyone wants a job where they work so hard for such little pay and no benefits. Everyone wants to feel appreciated.
bad,"Never get any help, no hours. Just not a good business to work for. The customers are the only thing that gets me up to work there, because if not. I would leave in a heart beat."
bad,Upper managements out of touch and dont care to respond with actual help. They expect everything to be done with no hours to help. Terrible place for anyone to work. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.
bad,Family Dollars was horrible. They do not care about the safety of any employees. I was a manager there & I made complaints about the safety & theft but nothing was done.
bad,Moving on to better things thanks to my experience with this company...Good pay but holy mackerel they sure make you work for it. Would be beneficial if they'd not be such tightwads with payroll.
bad,I enjoyed working at family dollar with the employees and customers started to cut hours. The most part I liked about working at family dollar was the stocking.
bad,"The manager is good, but you never have enough help and you are never able to stick with the schedule given to you.  There is no way to make plans for other thing in you life."
bad,This place is a joke. They are rude to the customer and even more rude to fellow employees. The District managers do not follow HR rules and allow bulling and. Favoritism and the store managers act like teenages and encurage the bulling.
bad,The corporate is dumb and they never want you to move up or get promoted. Other than that it’s fine accept the dm and corporate think we are all just numbers and don’t deserve things.
bad,Family dollar puts way too many responsibilities on one person. You normally work alone as an assistant manager/store manager during the day. If someone calls out if work you are required to come in to cover their shift but they also dont want you to get any overtime. They are very inconsistent.
bad,I learned a lot and the job cause stress as well. I met a lot of good people and made all of people happy with my customer skills. The down fall was the constant thieves
bad,I think this job is good for first timers but just to work here wasnt so great. They over work you and also make you do what's not on ur job description.
bad,It's a real nice to your place to work the customers come in and are nice the management at the time was okay they will hot and cold kinda if you need the money go ahead and apply it doesn't bleed over into your regular life too much the pay was nice especially for people just starting out working
bad,The work was attending and answering questions of the customers that came into the school. Checking their orders out and providing them an enjoyable experience.
bad,"I would like many things to change. Some of them would be how we were treated. I would have like to have a better understanding with my bosses. Also a flexible shift, can't forget the pay was not worth all the work that was put in."
bad,Pay more and lower prices and people might stop running for with their stuff. Close on Christmas and pay cashier overtime on holidays. Allow my discount for employees
bad,"The job started good with enough people in store to do the job that your trained to do (as management) with staff. Then you leave the training store and it goes down hill fast. If your not working in a training store you run into being understaffed and unable to do your job correctly. Not enough staff in store to do the tasked your trained to do. Store always seems dirty, unorganized, and theft is CRAZY!!!"
bad,"They dont car eabout their employees lives , "
bad,It's Family Dollar and I haven't worked there for 8 years. My experience should be fairly irrelevant towards their company culture as they are right now.
bad,Family Dollar stores really help struggling family's because of the low food prices. But over work the employees and under pays them. An because of store issues we the employees won't get our raisesan that's not fair. An the only way u can make any real money while working there is to accept to Management position. An thats where things really gets stressful because your on salary an sometimes you have to work Anywhere from 80 to 90hrs a week but only get paid for 52 because your on salary. I worked 3 straight years without a raise an then when I did receive one it was for .25 cents. An I asked why only. 25 cents an I was told it was because the store wasn't making any money but we was listed on the store portal as the 2nd highest money making store in the district.
bad,"The hardest part was determining which direction the company was going. The focus changed weekly from sales to shrink, to different company programs. "
bad,"There is always something to do at Family Dollar, from unloading truck, to cleaning the store. Gossip is a big part of our day to day lives, you will get to know the regulars very quickly.  Management varies greatly depending on which store you are working in. The hardest part of the job is sometimes having to bite your tongue, nodding your head and smiling at the person yelling at you."
bad,Why don't you offer FT to your store associates.Cant live on PT hours/Why do you make employees buy treir own shirts. You would think a co could  afford shirts
bad,To much work for to little pay. The company does not care about their employees. Management is over work which causes them to treat their staff poorly
bad,"Family Dollar is a great place to work ONLY under great management. Very unfair treatment when it came to pay raises, scheduling, and advancement. I enjoyed working with my coworkers  until the crew changed."
bad,"a typical day at work, is door to shelf,helping csr, bank runs,stopping theft.Cleaning areas,pulling in truck,paper work,fixing time, managing time,rearrainging"
bad,My review is that when your doing your best its not enough. When your crossed trained its still not enough to them. Some days you are tired from so much work
bad,It was an okay job for short term but some of the team members weren’t team players . I like a motivational surrounding at work with people who help others out
bad,"It's a great job for teens in school because the hours and pay wasn't enough to live especially if you have a family, it was very unorganized , stressful, got calls all times of the day to come in ect"
bad,Most of the assistant managers were clueless and lazy. They openly expressed stress and anger about their personal lives. Very unprofessional. The pay isn't worth the work
bad,Fast pace business with plenty of things to get done each.  I enjoyed
bad,I was required to work the store with only myself and an assistant store manager.  I was often required to restock shelves with an unrealistic expectation of how much I could really get done.  It often effected the customer experience as the register was often left alone and no one there immediately to help the customer.  Store also went to heck :) in a handheld after the store manager quit and higher management tool forever to send a replacement.
bad,This company does not care about it's employees they leave you in the building by yourself for 8-10 hours a day by yourself as a store manager but yet they expect you to be able to throw a complete truck worth of freight at the same time.
bad,"the location i worked was slow paced and corporate management rarely delt with us,which let our store manager do what she wanted like come into work drunk"
bad,enjoyed working with others like putting up stock keeping store cleaned.ran cash register  sometimes filled in as asst mgr.counted. counted money got nightly deposits ready closed store
bad,job very stressful due to robberies i find it very hard and difficult to return to this environment the customers were great and very lovable but i  would need full time security before i return as well as they nedd them now
bad,The overall company is great however the condition of the market in makes the job very challenging.  Management has changed multiple times one year.  I truly believe that the market can be managed with the right leadership team in place.
bad,a typical day at work would be pushing freight all day or ringing on the register. Management is poor. the hardest part of my job would be the stress that management causes throughout the day. the most enjoyable part of the job is when manager is OFF.
bad,"When I when I started working there, I was a cashier. I didn't have a problem working my way up to management. My problem was with my manager, playing with staffs hours. For example, one week I will have forty hours , the next week I'll go down to twenty hours. All because of relationships with the coworkers. Just a unfair working environment"
bad,"I worked for Family Dollar and as an employee it was great to work with others but when it came to me doing my duties as an Assistant Manager I was always let down by the manager, she never had the schedule posted you always had to call the same day to see if you had to work, she was very unprofessional when it came to speaking with employees and customers. But my overall experience was wonderful when I was working at other stores."
bad,I loved working with the people and approving my Customer service Skills each and every shift.I Also loved to test my patience in the work place especially dealing with new customers each and every day.
bad,"Management was awesome here for me. Unfortunately, her managers were not. This is a huge company that pays minimum wage, but expects their employees to literally work themselves to exhaustion. Also, this company wastes so many discontinued items it is ridiculous. I witnessed perfectly good items... Clothing, household goods, cleaning supplies, bathroom products being destroyed instead of donated. It never made sense to me."
bad,"Seriously, doing truck will be horrible for your body. The amount you get paid is not worth how physically demanding this job can be at times. May of just been the experience I had at this specific store."
bad,As any sort of management you are expected to open the store and work alone for 5-7 hours and be expected to get many different tasks done in that time period. The hardest part of the job is trying to make sure that everything gets done with no time to do it. The most enjoyable part is the people that you work with and a very select few of customers.
bad,Lack of respect for the ones that put their all in the work they do. Favors the ones that dont do anything. Training is a joke. Needs to have more through training.
bad,"Family Dollar is not a promote from within company. They sale you on that but once your in a role your rarely move up. I've worked for Family Dollar for about 9yrs and was stuck in a store manager role for 5 yrs with no chance of advancement. Family Dollar would switch District Managers very frequently and this is what really hurts the company overall. You'd have to keep building a relationship with every DM that comes and by the time your comfortable with the new guy, they either switch them up or fire them, which put the managers in a never ending cycle. Degrees mean nothing to this company. You will NOT get any respect for all the hard laboring hours from school to earn a degree in Management at that for them to just put you in as a customer service rep. Its hard to get a raise with this company once they pay you a certain amount the only way to get a POSSIBLE increase is to have a good inventory. Then they will come with an excuse when its time for an increase that you are at the max but they wont allow you to move up. MY overall perception of Family Dollar is once they get you in the Store Manager role and you perform well then you are stuck, because they don't want to replace you with someone that can't do the job and have to start over. I'd rather not speak on how cutthroat they are when its comes to firing and getting on bad sides. My advise DO NOT stand up for yourself."
bad,"Long work hour,over welling work,Over  all a good job to start your career off as a 1st time manager. Customer are great and employees are very helpful. The Training process could use a do over"
bad,"I had never worked in retail before but from my experience it is a very stressful job.  I can understand NOW why the turn over rate is so high.  Provide your own security.  Location is the key!  The few men that worked there were scheduled to work in the daytime while the females were scheduled to work at night in a high crime area.  The police were called to the 3 or 4 times a week.  All barely damaged merchandise, like a 4 pack of t-shirts missing one because some unfortunate soul stole one, would thrown in the trash.  So many people could have used those items."
bad,"Management from the regional to the district to the store management is inept, has no problem solving skills and will hire anybody that passes the basic questions on application."
bad,I appreciated the opportunity to advance but the help is scarce. We struggle to meet ends due to the lack of good & dependable help. The theft problems are never ending & without security I focus on filing reports & stopping theft instead of my other duties. Doesn't help that no one seems to understand the understaffing & lack of hours only adds to the problem of theft in our particular location. Although I helped to increase sales I never got a bonus either.
bad,"I would open the store and count the register while getting everything ready for the day to start, at closing shift I would count safe and deposit alone with all the register tills to make sure all the money was accounted for. the work place culture was bad due to managers not caring for their employees and wanting to bring their own friends to work for them. while firing the employees that actually worked."
bad,"My argument as a former employee of Family Dollar is the unfair salary, and having been hired for a full time position that doesn't schedule you for full time hours."
bad,"Company cuts costs on labor to bring the savings to the customer.  If you don't mind working in a neglected building with a large staff of inexperienced associates, you'll do fine."
bad,"Managers are severely restricted from organizing staffing to ensure work life balance.  Ideally if everything works perfectly then the job isn't bad however whenever one employee calls out quits or is forced to help another store, there goes your work life balance.  The problems is compounded with the company's ""borrowed employee"" practice.  In essence, you work hard to hire and train a team but the other stores in the district don't, they are able to borrow them burning their available 28 hours.  Family Dollar has a zero tolerance for overtime so the Store Manager pulls the shifts .  This is an ongoing issue.  When everything is said and done I was working for less than minimum wage."
bad,Working at Family Dollar was real stressful at times and those were the worse. I would just tune everything out and focus on getting the shift over to go home. The customers can be so rude they play a big role in making things difficult for you but you have to just let it go.
bad,"It needs to be security at store,One clerk on register, manager in back, customers frustrated.fourhighs on floor, customers can't shop comfortably.Security is my main concern, protect your workers."
bad,"As a manager you have to work a mandatory 52 hours, but if you only work that many hours you will be alone for 10 hours a day. Overtime is ""built in"" to your pay. If you 52 or 80 hours a week you still get paid the same. They require you to work double shifts"
bad,"The company overall is awful, they wont give anyone but the managers enough hours for benefits, the managers they work to death because theyre salary. Loss prevention is a joke they blame the employees for 90% of the store theft even if your store sits in the heart of the ghetto"
bad,"Low hours- as full time assistant manager i would get 20-30 hrs a week and if i wanted more i had to go to other stores. "
bad,"A typical day at Family Dollar, positioned as loss prevention, included making sure customers found what they needed, made sure everyone was safe, and made sure no person was stealing."
bad,I productive workplace but not very safe for the employees that work there. Not to mention that the store's cleanliness is not very well kept until employees feel like cleaning it.
bad,"working as a family dollar employee you found yourself taking on a lot of unnecessary tasks, you work in fairly poor working environments depending on the commitment of you manager"
bad,the atmosphere was awsome due to my co workers but hte company as a whole needs manager improvement. the pay rate for assistant managers is to low. corprate is very disconnected.
bad,"Help customers find items in the store. Ring up the items they bought. Open store for business and close store and end of day, Stock merchandise. Unload truck on Truck day."
bad,"Recover and clean, learned patience with slow customers, workplace environment is important to me, hardest part is the internal drama, most enjoyable is counting my own register and drops, management makes very little sense to me in regards to promotions."
bad,"First day hired as cashier, I got promoted to assistant. So that was pretty awesome. I worked 40 hrs a week, most the time I was the only assistant for my store. I loved the work itself, it was challenging and kept me busy. It made me take pride in my work ethic. However the 13-15 hr shifts with no ability to clock out for breaks were miserable. The physical labor and the mental strain eventually caught up with me. After a year of working there I was forced to quit because I developed mono and management wouldn't work with my hours. I explained to the ER all the tasks I had to do, the long hours, the extreme workload and they suggested I quit or I'd keep getting sicker. The employees generally sucked, the pay sucks even more, and my location was dangerous to work at. So it isn't worth it in my book."
bad,"i liked the job, when i worked here, we had a very unbalanced environment between the cashiers the assistants and the manager, not everyone was on the same page, and this made it a hard place to work."
bad,"I enjoy working and was noticed by the several customers that complimented me on my customer service while I was ringing their products up at the register and/or approched me while I was working along side one of the 3 assistant managers I have.  It's great to know that I have made a positive impression on my Customers and I can put a smile on their face. Nice to know that my positive (my cup is always full attitude) is making a diference and not going unnoticed."
bad,A typical day at work is dealing with customers and counting the drawer. I also unload merchandise from the semi once a week and putting the product away
bad,".....................................................Family dollar was an ok workplace but, I worked at a variety of family dollars all in one district."
bad,A decent job if you have to have a factory job... a lot of mandatory overtime which makes it hard to have a life and manage a family outside of the factory.
bad,If you are a store manager you will work 60 to 80 hour weeks amd days off almost never happen.  Plus they make you drive forever and a day with no compensation.  Better part time company.
bad,They need better quality staff more pay for all the work you do. Importantly security at all times a lot of theft and also robbery . More male staff more hours
bad,family dollar is a great place to work the only part I didn't like was the break ins an me having to do everything by myself on my first days an them cutting my hours
bad,Job is nothing but fast paced pulling and picking.  Can get very repetitive and boring.  The pay is decent but the hours are pretty terrible.  Most of the work will go to the first shift crew since thats where all the veteran employee are.  If you are on second of third you might have a full 8 or you could work 2 hours depending on the work load and how busy the stores are.
bad,Family Dollar is really a job for teens they have low pay but very flexible hours not suited for people with bills or children to take care of. Overall I would recommend a second job if you wanna work there.
bad,"This place was okay because they paid me, but the manager who hired me lied to me about the hours I would be getting just to get me to work for them. Beyond that, management was generally iffy depending on who you work with. The district manager and corporate were harder than they needed to be. The best part was my coworkers for the seven months I was there. If not for them, I would have quit long before that."
bad,"My supervisor was a great person, but that's about it. I learned about the Pricing gun and how it didn't properly register information. I learned about how unorganized a company can be and gained the determination to never work for certain companies."
bad,"I loved the customers at family dollar and some of my coworkers. i had issues with a couple of my coworkers. the company does not staff enough people everyday, i was left alone a lot from anywhere between 3-6 hrs on our busiest days."
bad,One of the best skills I have is moving things and picking up heavy items. It's quick and easy and fast cash.  You meet and interact with a lot of people.
bad,"First off they worked the dog out of you for that $11.50 or $12.25/hr pay, the hours are unknown meaning you never know what time you're leaving if you're on 2nd shift, the environment is Dusty, you break every 4 hours which is horrible thats's a 45 minute lunch and and another 15 minute break 4 hours after that, your next break will be home so that's a 1 hour break period within 12 hours and the supervisors are arrogant, cocky, and full of it.."
bad,"Some days are good ,but its those days were u afraid for your life cause some of the people that's not there to purchase anything ,but there to steal,run out the front door with product,back door with product, and side door with product, even comfort us about the product. I've even been threaten. Just not comfortable anymore time to make a change."
bad,they the worst job ive ever worked for they had to much drama there the manager and assiant would talk about other employees to customers they dont give benefits no dicounts on the in store products
bad,Worked 60 to 70 hours weekly. Store managers in a terrible situation of single coverage for most of day. Labor budgets as low as $1.300 weekly for entire store staff. How can one deter shrink and build sales with real customer service when store teams are running with head cut off to stock store and deal with specials. Pathetic culture!!!
bad,"The place was unorganized, the managers were rude, and the hours were horrible. I didn't get a uniform, and never got a good paycheck. That's not a good job to be involved with."
bad,The boss was rude and the store was unorganized. It was never clean because the workers were lazy. I loved dealing with the customers but wouldn't work there again.
bad,Reflective of the area located. The customers are your livelihood. The thieves are a fact of life. Let the thieves have what they want. I've seen a myriad of reactiong
bad,"Assistance manager the pay was only $8.25. You counted down cashiers, looked out for the thieves, organized and people were super rude. Tons of work including unloading the truck of merchandise 18 wheeler, super heavy."
bad,They dont work with employees my sisterv died they and i couldnt receive much time off tp grieve..also store has been robbed numerous of times and they treat you as if u were the one commiting the crime
bad,"great for a beginner trying to get their feet wet"
bad,They give out alot of hours and the security is terrible. I have learn that to work at family dollar you have to have a second jodb because you don't get alot of hours and the pay Sucks
bad,They are not very helpful with transferring someone out of their district to another district! They will try to get you to stay even though you drive 45 minutes to and from work! Not Cool!
bad,I will not recommend this job to any professional who wants to move up. Management is terrible  and they take to lay minute to let you know of decisions.
bad,"The store I worked for there was a lack of communication, failure to train properly. They failed to give me a raise. I stocked merchandise and checked in vendors. I operated a cash register 90% of the time as an assistant. I enjoyed some of the customers. I like to learn new areas of the company so I can be able to help out in any area."
bad,"I have learned a lot about myself working at family Dollar. I am a hard worker I take on different tasks that challenge me in a way it amazed me. The leadership I have taken on in a different way then I was trained. I have so much of work knowledge not just about the company,but also about work ethic alone."
bad,"Because of the Dollar Tree merger, Family Dollar is no longer a good or secure place of employment.  The workplace culture and morale has dropped significantly and you never know when another layoff will be taking place."
bad,"A typical day at work could be anything at all involving the job description, but was generally pretty easy. However, managers at some job sites can be very fickle. What may be a stellar performance one day may get you chewed out and berated for not doing your job the next. If a manager makes a mistake, they will put the blame on an employee, while asking employees to watch and report on one another because the manager wants to fire specific people and needs a reason to do so."
bad,At Family Dollar every thing was a clutter! As a sales associate it was my job to stock items and keep the sales floor in tact. The previous shift would leave things in a cutter so it was hard to move around. There was cardboard boxes all around in the back that i had to put in dumpster. The Manager basically let people do what they wanted and people would come in and out to steal. Frequently.
bad,The job is good just looking for better opportunities I am the assistant manager I take care of the customers and paperwork and stock all shelves
bad,"I enjoy sales, so this was a cool job. But store manager was stingy with time. They want u to get there at 7am open safe, run money to bank, come back open store work alone until 3p. This is dangerous."
bad,"easy work"
bad,I didn't work there that long but it was long hours and low pay. I would have to be there at 6 am to unload trucks and that meant unloading cases of bleach and if one was opened and got on your clothes they would not replace them.Also it was an older store not in a good neighborhood
bad,"Working at Family Dollar is basically a job. Upper management is very disorganized and the responsibilities of the assistant manager is nearly the same as the store manager with significantly lesser pay. You learn by asking and figuring out after major mistakes. Breaks are impossible if you are the only manager on shift. The processes are very outdated. You literally stand at the register to do morning deposits with over 4 grand. Security is not the best and the shoplifters are outrageous.  Scheduling is terrible, and you do not receive any sick days."
bad,"on a typical work i would stock the shelves, work the register, and clean the store. i learned that even the simpliest jobs and prove to be hard. i loved my manager she was very understanding and patience with me. the hardest part of the job was making sure everything was in the right place from the smallest things to the biggest things. the thing i enjoyed the most was dealing with people and getting to know each of the customers"
bad,"Always problems between co-workers. Manager has preferences in staff. Customers always complaining of being watched by the store manager. Store manager always thought people were stealing and would stand in front entrance with a stick."
bad,"Good company. Poor management at times. Little to no work life balance. Paid salary based off of 52 hours, most weeks worked more than 60. Probably wouldn't return to this company."
bad,"poor management, low pay, overworked, no appreciation or recognition. managers at most locations very unprofessional, develop ""clicks"" with favorite coworkers."
bad,The pay was only minimum wage and I never had a break. Work long hours. up 10 hours. Management wasn't good at all and kept getting broken into. Would not recommend this job.
bad,I love this job at first until my training store manager quit and left me running the store by myself with very little training. But i did it!
bad,Constantly assisting customer's in finding the proper product for their need. Ensuring the store always looks clean and welcoming.
bad,"I met many good people in Burgettstown in the Year I was there many very hard working managers in the company , it was a hard and learning experience"
bad,"wasnt fun being there, its like everyone who worked or evan just walked in for their own personals reasons didnt wanna be there."
bad,this  job was ok  to but dangerous but i had to maintain  a safe work place for other employees pay so not all that good  benfits was not good either it was  a job
bad,Hired on as a Store Manager. Unable to operate my own store without District Manager stepping in and trying to run the store how she wanted to.
bad,very high stress environment with minimal payroll budget which leads to not much staff and very long management hours. not much support from district and totally sales driven
bad,"Family Dollar Was An Okay job, the only thing I dislike is that they have NO discounts for employee's and they don't have benefits for part-time workers or holiday pay."
bad,"My job with Family Dollar is relatively easy. I got to work and open or close the store while performing everyday tasks such as counting money, doing deposits, stocking and straitening shelves, unloading truck, and Managing store associates is the average everyday life at Family Dollar. There are times it is stressful due to the allotted labor throughout our district to keep stores up to my standards as well as attempting to keep fellow employees happy and coming to work everyday. Balancing a fair budget as well as the need for getting everyday work done in the store with this company is next to impossible because we simply do not have the labor to do so! However, with as much experience as I have the job comes to me much easier than it would most people because I know what it takes to run a successful business!"
bad,"The turn over of employees and the inane directives which come down from on high are major issues which interfere with being able to complete even a simple task. The focus is on the money, not the employees. Injuries, family issues, being called in on days off...not a matter of concern for upper management. Working with the people can be enjoyable, but the workload and the amount of effort one has to put forth are not in line with the rate of pay offered, even to experienced managers. The fact that there is no steady schedule is a big issue, too. You never know what you will be working, or when you will have off, from week to week."
bad,Management was difficult to get along with and seemed in it more for themselves than the customers or co-workers. Hours were sparse and all over the place. No real goals or plans as far as a store.
bad,I enjoy meeting the customers that come into our stor. The work life balance is very good. As for pay and benifits it isnt what I want.
bad,"you are placed on your own in management, and expected to know all procedures. Hard to hire good employees in certain locations."
bad,"career advancement is very easy, they sometimes promote people too early. you're asked to do too much for one person. stores are kept staffed with 1-2 people at the most at a time despite how large they are. stores are often robbed and unsafe to work at due to lack of camera systems and bad locations, open too late for the areas they're in. not a bad job itself if you don't mind multitasking, but how long you stay and how much you're able to enjoy your job does depend on your co-workers. i've had great coworkers that make it easy to tolerate the work load and others that won't pull their weight and make it hard on everyone else. no benefits for part time and won't hire you at full time but will work you full time hours. no holiday pay. hard to contact upper management about lp and other problems going on in the store. i filled out a health and wellness survey to get a $50 gift card and never received it."
bad,Family Dollar is a ok workplace .I only can speak for the two I was working for .At both Family Dollars I was working for didn't have a lot of Productive employees.
bad,Family Dollar offered no benefits affordable for employees. The company expected you to be there all the time beyond a normal amount of overtime offered no help when needed replacing people who were fired/ quit.
bad,The company is working on a buyout by Dollar Tree and to many changes going on and training is not what it should be and they are no looking to check into stuff people are being accused of.
bad,Honestly working for the company feels like you are constantly mistrusted and incapable of functioning as a human being. This is mostly due to the fact that most people employed are largely not to be trusted and incapable of being functioning human beings.
bad,"The co-workers are okay, they could do much better with the hiring process, with management too. A lot of the stores do not have air so it is hard to work. Cooperate thinks you just call to complain they do not really listen."
bad,Worst job experience ever. Hours were terrible and the pay was bad. Upper management provided little support and threats were abundant.
bad,"the typical day at family dollar as any other retail store we had to keep an eye on people whom are trying to steal. i learned the difference between a real and a fake bill. The manager i had at beginning wasn't a very great manager but, than there was a new manager and he was pretty great. i got a long with all my co workers, the hardest part about the job was stopping people from stealing. my enjoyable part was being around my co workers"
bad,"f I were to open the store I would start by starting up our system, counting the safe, filling out the deposit bag & printing out the paper work from the previous day after I finished I would work on the floor (Stocking,Taking off/ putting up sale tags, Working on damaged items putting them on sale,Payroll etc.) until the time I am scheduled to leave. Closing the store I would pick with what the previous assistant manager was left to finish.  I enjoyed management and my fellow teammates company. I learned how to deal with rude customers in a calm and polite manners. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unpleasant customers, it makes you feel like you've done something wrong, but I was taught how to approach and solve that matter. I'm not sure what the most enjoyable part of my job was, because it was all around a pleasant work environment. The only problem I had was how unprofessional my manager was and the very rude customers."
bad,THis company had many flaws in their management. THey make you work short and I was working as a store manager at least 80-100 hours a week.
bad,"Training is minimal, rushed, and is often skipped to cut corners to save time and money. Independent vendors and retail refreshers arrive every other day, D.C. trucks arrive once a week with a load that is expected to be fully worked within three, but often management pushes for two, days; and Family Dollar trucks arrive at different times once a week. As a manager, expect a lot of theft, internal and external, expect to finish your C.S.R.'s tasks for them (with the exception of a few extraordinary employees,) signage is updated, or supposed to be updated, often; also expect upper management to come in often and which usually entails consuming almost all of your viable productive time to complete projects. Also expect to have management undermine your direct orders, even if your directions are administered by company guidelines and standards of procedure. C.S.R.s have it the worst since they are in charge of ringing up customer's purchases while unloading freight and refreshing multiple areas in the front (Usually four to six aisles) which as I mentioned before, management often expects stock (freight) to be finished and complete by 7 P.M. or at most within three days. The stockrooms are unorganized, unhygienic, and generally unsanitary. Once after traveling to work at a local store, with only an hour's notice, as a temp for a manager that was sick, during my work in the back room unloading materials to be stocked I encountered a rat and multiple droppings (fecal matter,) I developed a staph infection from cleaning the end caps. The toilets did not work nor did the sinks have"
bad,"I was an assistant manager for a year and a half. Loved the regular customers, but upper management were a complete joke. Very disorganized company seems they never really knew what they wanted done till it was too late. And store shipments were terrible always had way too much overstock and on hand counts were correct. Poor communication company wide. Application says no travel required. But you will always be asked to go help out other stores on days off . then only to be in trouble for having overtime hours on payroll."
bad,"A typical day at work was very stressful, and no day was the same. I learn. ed that it takes more than 2 people to run a business. My store manager hated her job, and she took it out on her employees. My co-workers were nice. The hardest part of my job was hiring reliable employees, and trying to find a cashier if the scheduled cashier called off. The best part of my day was when I could get my work done without interruptions, and customer complaints."
bad,we had no air conditioner in the warehouse. the coworkers were horrible.
bad,"You will work your butt off, and get no praise for all the great things you do, and only told you need to do more, and need to do it better!  Very stressful, and lots of drama.  You'll only make minimum wage, and raises are small and far between. You'll be expected to work almost every weekend, all weekend, and every holiday including Christmas Eve day until 10:00 p.m.  NO extra pay! You'll only get one 20 minute break no matter how many hours you work. Unless you're a smoker, then you can go out every 30-60 minutes to smoke a cigarette! If you're not a smoker you'll be ""punished"" by only getting one break! I did like my co-workers, and our regular customers that were nice. There were however some ""can't please them no matter what"" kind of customers too. It was close to my home, so that was nice, and get paid weekly via auto deposit, and that was good. I liked putting hard tags on clothing, and putting away the products that were lighter in weight."
bad,"The culture has changed within the last two months, stores are left to fend for themselves with little resources."
bad,"Managers overworked 6-7 days a week, given little payroll, stores located in high crime neighborhoods, warehouse orders unloaded by piece/case by hand. stockrooms small, corp controls the quantities ordered in multiple depts. regardless of overstock counts, poor LP practices. "
bad,"You'll work very hard, and at a quick pace, work weekends and holidays for no extra pay, and only make minimum wage! Allot of drama, stress all the time. No matter how much you do, or how hard you work, it's never enough, and never good enough! They cut your hours down due to payroll cuts, but expect you to get the same amount of work done, but in less time. You'll run a cash register when waiting on customers, and be stocking shelves, or cleaning something in between customers. Have to be doing SOMETHING every minute! They say they want you to enjoy your job, and have ""FUN"", but how do you have time to do that when they work you so hard? You'll only get one 20 minute break all day even when working up to 8 or 9 hours! My co-workers were nice, and I liked them, but they too are always up tight, and stressed worrying about getting everything done that's expected of us. My manager was nice most times, but got cranky from to much stress from what was expected of her on a daily basis from the Corporate office! The hardest part is dealing with rude, demanding customers, and how physically hard the job is because your on your feet all day, waiting on customers, and stocking shelves, always doing something. The part I liked about the job was the regular nice customers, helping customers find things they needed, and being a part of a team. Also it was close to my house, so not a long drive to work."
bad,I loved my Job on the east coast in Whiteville NC but since moving to Idaho found the management team to be too soft and hours too random for the pay. It is one of the lowest paying jobs in the area for the amount of work and dedication required.Assistant managers are just fill in cahiers on call.
bad,"When i work for Family Dollar there was Bad Management."
bad,"This is not the place to work if you actually want a life!  The hours are terrible, the pay is low, the breaks are almost non-existent and the pace of work is back-breaking.  As a cashier you are expected to keep the shelves constantly straightened but at the same time watching the register for customers, which is next to impossible due to the layout of the store.  The management people are actually quite good people, but the actual running of the store is shaky at best.  The hardest part of the job is the physical punishment that your body will have to endure because you are expected to be on your feet for pretty much your entire shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job is going home at the end of your shift."
bad,Work-life balance needed improvement. micro-management lead to a high-stress enviroment
bad,The boss was unpleasant at this Family dollar location. The boss kept adding more and more hours of work and even wanted me to work on days off. The co workers were pleasant and friendly. I would work the cash register and stock shelves daily. The hardest part of the job was the manager at that time.
bad,"a typical day would be cashiering, and talking to customers about their problems. What ive learned is hard work ethic.the manangement changed very often. My co-workers were decent. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the rude customers. The most enjoyable part were speaking with the customers who were cordial."
bad,"Family Dollar is a good job if you want to try retail for the first time and just getting out of high school, family dollar does have its good and bad sides when in comes to management. The management will make it seem like although the company my require you to work on weekends and holidays. It is not always a requirement, for you have to fight them tooth and nail to get off from work if it is for religious purposes that you need off on Sundays and certain holidays because family dollar does not have what most jobs do not have and that is a religious purpose clause. Family Dollar runs their employees down in to the ground to where they have no choice to either get fired because the management team does not like them and the employee(s) is doing the best that he/she can or to the point where the employee(s) will just quit/resign. The beauty part about family dollar is you get to work with some of the most amazing people in different stores and meet some of the greatest customers and help them with whatever they may need and just greeting them as they walk in the store(s) can go a long way just a well as saying have a nice day or good night. The hardest part about the job is the management team doesn't look at the at the good progress you make only the bad and the pace that needs to be picked up and always complaining about the time lapse based off of how family dollar quote on quote company expects you to complete certain tasks. When it is actually their time frame to push people around who are under them. The best part about my job is that I was able to help customers on a"
bad,every day customers would come in all day long buying multiple items with food stamps and credit cards with insuficcient funds as well as trying to return items without a receipt. the manager hired employees who were unprofessional and i actually had to terminate 2 employees personally.
bad,Dealing with customers that isn't the bad part of the job. This particular job would have been ok if I had a mature manager.
bad,"This company wants things to happen quickly and don't care if it means killing yourself. They don't appreciate what you do at all. I would not  recommend this job due to low pay, high risk of your life due to robberies . They want to EAT RIBEYE STEAKS  but pay HOT DOGS price to the store teams. Management in stores alone ALL Day sometimes trying to cut payroll and save but this is dangerous in high risk stores."
bad,A typical day at work would be very fast pace and alot of enjoyable customers. My favorite part of the job was being able to help customers in  finding things they may need and providing good helpful customer service to each and every one of them. I also enjoyed my co workers and loved working as a team. Because as a team would could get alot of work accomplished in short periods of time and also get all of oir freight out on the floor and on the shelves.
bad,Horrible corporate management. Hardly any incentives or positive feedback.
bad,"The particular store I worked in had a daily tension between co-workers mostly created by the Manager herself. There was no chain of command reachable to anyone except our Store Manager, Devonna. If you needed a day off no matter how far in advance requested It was never granted. Our Manager was very un professional and created a hostile work place. The hardest part of the job was truck days when store inventory arrived. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers! This company needs to pay more attention to the way their Stores are being run by the Managers. Overall the one I worked at, on Howland Blvd., in Deltona was poorly managed and very disrespectable to it's Employees and the Customers. It was so bad that I gave a weeks notice and left not having another job to go to which has hurt my life financially."
bad,"A typical day at FD would start out opening the store and working 5-8 hours alone until the cashier came in for their shift. I would work 13 hours without an actual break. I learned how to run a store on my own, due to the lack of knowledge in the company on how to train a person. The SM and DM were very unhelpful when it came to any questions and concerns about lack of security in the store (i.e no cameras/dvr system, and safe being kept upfront) My co-workers (i.e cashiers) were great to work with, very fast learners, and always completed tasks on time. The vendors were also very kind to work with, I always looked forward to monday and wednesday deliveries and truck days. The hardest part would have to be that the SM would change the schedule everyday according to her personal schedule. Also that I would never be able to clock out for a lunch for the last 4-6months of working there. Also, not getting paid enough for the work being done. The most enjoyable part would have to be the friendly customers that I saw day to day working there. I created relationships with every individual customer."
bad,"Cleaning store before opening hours, communicating with customers, keeping aisles organized and stocked, counted cash drawer, cleaned after closing."
bad,I loved working at Family Dollar up until I was robbed at gun point.
bad,"a typical day of work consists of managing store opperations and employees including inventory, stock, and customer service"
bad,"52 hrs a week required but workload is much more than that. During Christmas, 14 additional hrs added to store hrs, with only 1 minimum paid hourly employee for 8 hours compensated. Unloading truck required of store manager. Payroll budget VERY low, managers working alone til 12-1 in the afternoon alone for this reason. Company wants to blame all shrink on insiders while not wanting to address outside theft."
bad,"A typical day involved me doing doubles 3 times a week , i did many tasks ranging from unloading of trucks , to solving customer issues that were brought to me.I learned cash management skills like how much money we needed to have in the safe and also closing of drawers.Management is something that i did not appreciate , my former manager is currently involved in a relationship with another manager from family dollar , he has lied to his boss saying he was in the hospital when he was actually in puerto rico on vacation with his partner.The hardest part of this job was being short of staff and not having things done due to this problem.The most enjoyable part of this job was helping the customers with any issues or problems they had."
bad,"The workplace is a really hostile enviroment. The hardest part about working at family dollar ""Truck Day"" mondays. Their backroom and how the company operates is so unorganized and it is understaffed. My co-workers are helpful and knowledgable people."
bad,Enjoyed working here. I did a lot of stocking and unloaded trucks most of the time.
bad,"Sometimes only receive 30 or so hours weekly, depending on daily work load. Am not informed if allowed to work until I drive the 1 hour and 10 minutes to the center. No room for advancement. Very poor management."
bad,never knew if you were going get to go home at a reasonable time
bad,"If you don't mind being expected to work can do can't everyday, every week then this may be the place for you as they are still growing! From Regional level management the leadership is nothing more than YES men or women that don't care about anything but covering their behinds and always must find someone to blame instead of stepping up and accepting responsibility for what they allowed conditions in the stores to be."
bad,If you are a younger person just starting out then this is a good job for you. Depending on the area you can have some really great customers.
bad,Very low wages at all levels of management takes advantage of it's employees. Was told straight out after starting that the investor was number one not the employee i call that backwards. When a conmpany doesn't look at it's people as assets they don't deserve mine or anyone elses talents.
bad,It is not a good place to work if you are providing for a family
bad,"my experience wasnt that great because of the people i worked with, but doesnt mean that all the stores are bad, im sure if there would have been a better team the workplace and everything else would have been great."
bad,"Stocked Shelves with merchandise, worked as a cashier when necessary, Unloaded delivery trucks, Helped customers find products."
bad,This company doesn’t value their workers that deserves to be valued. They are not as organized as they think.  They expect a lot but don’t pay you what you’re worth
bad,I enjoyed the customers that I seen on a daily bases. The over view of the company isn't great. Worked managers way to many hours a week. Had very little family time.
bad,They dont really care for you just care more about the company the benefits they give are not good and neither the pay nor hrs ..its more of a part time even when they lie and say its full time position
bad,Enjoyed the opportunity to advance to assistant manager. Enjoyed interacting with customers in a daily basis. When you have a good team behind you the job goes along better.
bad,"At the end of my employment, I was offered even less hours and my manager quit without notice. The corporate wanted to take even more hours from me along with a .50 raise my previous manager had granted me."
bad,Overall horrible company to work and or grow with no real leadership abilities nurtured and recognition or value of work is little to none willing to let bad employees continue bad habits instead of developing good employees with necessary habits
bad,Family dollar cashier are put through a lot for the amount they’re getting paid. Their pay rates could most definitely increase. A break is required by law every 6-8 hours you are on clock
bad,We were suppose to be a team environment since we all work for same company. Nobody wanted to help the next employees. They are unfair and fire people with no reason!
bad,Communication is the key to a successful business working together as a team can also play a major part in to making the store better. Making the customer happy a satisfied with service can be a good look.
bad,"Management is great depending on whom you work for, so obviously that varies. The pay is a little low and payroll is low and inconsistent. There will be days when the breaks will be very short, and you will barely be able to breathe. The amount of work that needs to be done is not matched with the number of hours given for payroll. The SM has to pick up the slack (my boss was working 80 hour work weeks)Loss prevention is shady, and will pull little tricks just to fire you. Beware of that."
bad,I was required to work off the clock unloading trucks to meet labor hours. I did it anyway because I loved my customers. I did like working on my own as well as on a team. So working had both good and bad experience.
bad,"poor management. sm plays favorites, internal theft by sm and other asm's, sm shaves time off for lunches not taken.employees treated unequally by the sm."
bad,Working at Family Dollar was fun in the beginning. I felt appreciated by my boss. I learned how to process the freight and how to put it out onto the floor. I also learned how to recover the store and count the cash drawers bef9 and after the shifts.
bad,Family dollar doesn’t care about you as long as you breaking ur back or doing what they want the managers don’t know how to talk to you they just don’t care
bad,It’s a great place to work until they start cutting payroll been with family dollar 19 years not even making 15 dollars an hour the theft is really bad
bad,Worked almost a full year and get paid less than newer employees. Have been up for assistant mgr. Position twice and been denied for an unexplainable reason. Sometimes feel discriminated against as well.
bad,Decent pay but definitely not worth the stress. Upper management is awful. You do the job of many and get left in the store by yourself a lot. Worse part was always closing then opening the next day. Your schedule isn't listened too
bad,The pay for the amount of work expected is far from a fair wage. Managers are overworked and staff turnover is ridiculous. I am staying here long enough to find another job.
bad,Management is confusing. They're not on the same page. Some policies are in effect and some aren't. The store barely have the items you need. The sales associates are friendly though.
bad,I started off working 30 hours a week to have myself lowered to only 14 hours every two weeks if I was lucky and when I asked for more hours they claimed they didn't have enough which I knew was a lie. This company can't be trusted that's why i decided to leave and seek employment elsewhere
bad,Working there was ok I enjoyed it. The customers loved me. I knew how to do everything in the place. But the manager was so rude. I had to quite because of it. Then she told people she fired me to cover it up. She lost so many people due to her mouth. They need way better management for sure..
bad,I was Thankful to have a job but this company doesn't want to pay you time and a half or holiday pay except for certain holidays. It's A company I don't think I would ever want to work for Again.
bad,The job wasn't meant for me. My whole body hurt after they day was done. and u can't got by the clock to clock out u have to wait for the manager to call your department over the intercom to say when u can leave.
bad,It was just the employees that attack the customers and steal. No one wanted to show up to work or hire new people because it would affect the bonus the store manager was getting
bad,Demand too much out of few employees. Ads are confusing for customers. Never a set schedule so hard to plan activities outside of work. Full time is never 40hours. High turnover.
bad,"It was hard you have to unload truck piece by piece, and running from one end of the store to the other to just put up the stock, which I didn't mind due I like the exercise."
bad,"You wear to many hats for management. It's difficult trying to be security while stocking, cashiering, merchandising, unloading trucks and keeping store clean at the same time."
bad,i cant say i enjoyed my time working for family dollar. what was required of you was not worth what they were paying. the very slow pace environment was not for me.
bad,The job pay should be more I no I live in area where the cost of living is low however higher up dont care about the actual employees. There's constant theft from the customers robbery at gunpoint in mostly all the other family dollar locations in my area. Weekly  product coming in the store I worked at was at least 1500 pieces we had to lift up all these products from the trucks my back was killing me and the district manager says she want all of the 1500 pieces to be put on the shelves in 72 hours that couldn't happen when you short staff.  The customers were extremely rude I never want to work at this job again   1 more thing cashiers were stealing out of the register
bad,"The warehouse is a workhouse. It's extremely hot in the Summer and very cold in the Winter. hours are long, quotas are excessive, management often passes the buck onto their workers, rather than taking responsibility, when receiving criticism from above, fellow workers often back stab each other to get ahead, and rather than discourage these policies, middle management turns a blind eye to them, if not outright encourage these behaviors."
bad,I wouldn't recommend family dollar because the place because it was robberies all of the time. The managers was stealing money from out of the cash registers
bad,We're told that we are replaceable. Don't pay enough for everything that a person does. No benefits offered to part-time. No set schedule. Have to work nights and weekends.
bad,Really poor upper management. You will get burned out really quick because they don't let you hire enough people so you as a manager can get your work done properly and on time. They will actually tell you that your family comes second.
bad,"Like most places of employment, there is always something to be done. There is never idle time. Generally I have no problem with this but when you have a good staff and still get so incredibly far behind, it is frustrating. We are simply not given enough hours as a team to complete everything asked of us by the company. "
bad,Definitely a cool job just depends on management. It was a lot of disrupt communication skills between managers and employees. The constant theft attempts  were definitely annoying as well.
bad,"Honestly working there was like a death sentence, people would work there, leave then a few months later the store is getting robbed.  Where I started was great, but I volunteered to relocate to help out and when I did I regretted it.  Thankfully, I didn't get robbed the night i was scheduled to close, but anyway he came into the store but me being who I am I was always respectful and kind so maybe that's what saved me, not 10 mins after leaving he walked into a different store and I received a call to lock our doors because they had been robbed"
bad,"I would work opening or closing the store, waiting on customers at the same time as stocking shelves.  You would do this with only one person working in the store."
bad,I was happy when I it's started then things declined with time. Manager was allowing customers to bring dogs in the store that were not service dogs. Hours were cut and she gave same amount of hours to everyone even if they did not meet productivity. She didn't inforce certain policy that should have been. .
bad,"very fast pace , no breaks, and when it comes to management very poor. but if you love to meet new people its a good place to work. if you like fast pace it is a good place to work"
bad,the family dollar was ok as far as jobs but the area was not a good area it was alot going on that is why i started at security because it was more about the wrong AREA
bad,No family what so ever in the dollar. The store managers will work you a lot if you let them. Favorite employees get their schedule made to their liking. If your new just be ready to work them straight all closings. If you have bad stockers with you be ready for bad truck days; cause if that warehouse is not clean whew you will have stress unloading that truck.
bad,If You Don't Mind Not Having A Set Schedule....Availability Open No Time For Family ....And A Lot Of Favouritism To Certain People From The Managers Then It Maybe A Good Fit
bad,"No chance for advancement unless you know the right people, experience and good work ethics are not valued by this company. All they care about is having warm bodies to run the stores, not having employee's that follow standards and procedures so the store managers can complete their duties worry free."
bad,"would not work for company again. major staffing issues in stores. never enough time in a day to get everything done, that we need to get done.company is only about profits."
bad,"Good starting employment for those interested in retail. Learn how to give great guest service, learn skills like merchandising, plan-o-gram setting and proper stocking and safety procedures in a retail environment."
bad,"Manager is amazing, we will start there. But thats as far as im willing to give this company, I was moved to Temporary Assistant Manager in July where my pay was supposed to be bumped up, However my pay was not bumped till 2 weeks ago, and Im STILL fighting to get my retro pay. Some staff are back stabber's and talk badly about co worker, even when You do your job plus theirs. Corporate Will make up new rules and have upper management enforce them even if they are against the law ( requesting to look in ur purse in front if cameras Before closing store)"
bad,Unsable hours and underappreciation. The work load is overwhelming and the management is poor. Although pay period is weekly the pay rate is poor and doesn't accommodate for the amount of hours worked.
bad,I didn't get the respect or appreciation for my met goals. I was well over qualified. Felt like no room for growth. Things were out of order and sceptical.
bad,"The job was similar to all warehouse jobs so very run of the mill which is fine."
bad,"Super easy job, stocked items, cashed out, flexible schedule...................."
bad,This is a very easy going job there are advancement opportunities if they value your work great for entry level employees no rigorous training or extensive work history needed
bad,I'm currently a manager. The Cashiers always call out.. you work more doubles than you actually plan to. Policies contradict each other.. They want u to offer cash back but doesn't allow more than $60 of 20s in your draw.
bad,This job was horrible the management was awful. When management quit it fell on the rest of the employees in which I had no problem stepping up and filling the position but got disrespected when they filled management with other people.
bad,"Proper training is a must!!! In my experience your just thrown in to position  hands on with limited training."
bad,The most unfortunate experience working at family dollar would be the major cut back in hours. It does not affect the amount of hours dispersed between managers but i find myself alone in the store countless hours every week cutting back on productivity and the overall safety of myself and my coworkers. I've worked countless hours off the clock hoping to better the next weeks work load only to find it becoming the norm.
bad,This company doesnt know what its trying to be. I understand the goal is to increase profits but they do it totally at the expense of their employees.
bad,You work extremely hard and the appreciation is minimal at best there is little to no work life balance. you only get one day off and that’s if everyone comes to work on your day off if not u work several more days without a day off its a pay check for
bad,"Working at Family Dollar was not the best experience and I would not recommend being a store manager. working as a csr is ok and could even be a somewhat pleasant experience if you can live with minimum wage. but once you become  management it is a nightmare. Due to the companies strict labor budgets, managers are pressured to work long hours in far excess of their paid salary, often serving as cashiers and stock people, even when the store is staffed to company quotas. Even with a managers salary at 68 hours per week i only made at best 3 dollars over minimum wage. With all the other issues and responsibilities that come with the title it isn't worth the money."
bad,Started a great place to work. They care less and less about their employees all the time. Both hourly and management both. Want just as much when short handed and when it doesn't get done get help accountable and when it does no appreciation at all
bad,"At this location, we were required to wait on drug/alcohol abusers at the counter, and I personally witnessed the arrest of one person in the store.  It didn't feel like a safe place to work."
bad,"Was a Store Manager and was pulling 60-90 hour weeks consistently. Multiple doubles back to back. Assistants are not allowed over 32-35 hours so you have to make up for those shifts. You open the store by yourself and are there alone until 3-5PM and are expected to stock and maintain store at the same time. Several days there were no lunch breaks. At one point we had a leak in the office and the ceiling fell through, company did not fix it for weeks and advised us to just put a trash can to catch the water. Stores are high shrink (South Central Region)."
bad,"Hours inconsistent, some times there would only be a five-hour gap before your next shift making it impossible to have a work/life balance. store managers were replaced every 3 months leading to new expectations."
bad,"started off well then company and mgr choices made it harder and harder to want to come in.  If you want a temporary job to get by and to get on your feet,  it will be a good job."
bad,Very Fast Paced. I learned so much I can't summarize it up. High risk work culture. Hardest part working 16 hours most days and not having enough hours to cover shifts or get freight out. Customers most enjoyable part
bad,Helping customers with items helping customer cash out their order put freight up on shelves making sure pricing is correct assisting sup or manager doing special projects to help with store presents
bad,Working at Family Dollar taught me that when I feel I haven't gotten enough training in a job to make sure to address it right away and not wait until I fail.
bad,Family dollar merchandise store a good place to build work on your job fundamentals. I'd say it's a great place to start your first work experience. It's a good place to begin.
bad,The job wasn’t paying enough bad management no communication no support the team wasn’t a team nobody didn’t show to work half the time it was very aggy
bad,It’s not the best job I recommend this job for high school students the customer are horrible the team do what they want come in when they want to just not the job for me
bad,"Clean up after other shift"
bad,Working with district managers who had no knowledge of the work at the store made it difficult to do your job and working with workers who had no experience or work ethics is bad management
bad,"on an average day, I would go in at about 6 am and begin unloading a stock truck containing on average about 2200- 2500 pieces. finishing around noon to 1:00 pm to clock in at another family dollar that may need help recovering a store. the toughest part at family dollar was most likely the management and how they conducted themselves. the best part of this job was the ability to pick up hours at another store but that was combatted by the no overtime policy."
bad,"if you are trying to go to school and educate yourself or advance in anything in or outside of the company, they resent you for it. they will definitely make you chose your dead end job when it comes to certain areas of your life. management is horrible and treat employees as such. they always accuse employees of stealing and never watch or catch the customers who actually do. workload is ridiculous"
bad,"A typical day at Family Dollar was stressful and long. It always seem that we werre overworked and under paid, No overtime but overworked and understaffed. No appreciation, and they hire for one position and work you in another for less pay than the job really pays."
bad,I didn't like working here. The manager pushed to much for to little pay and demanded working on holidays. It was just a bad experience all around. Bad work place.
bad,"Family Dollar offers you plenty of opportunities for promotion, but very little in support. If you do not click with upper management then you will get overlooked. There is no encouragement to improve or want to advance. Many are given promotions that are not well prepared or trained for such promotion. And the atmosphere can be very unprofessional at most times."
bad,No no no when ifirst started it was crazy no real training threw me on the register showing me a couple keys then not long after i started maybe 3 months i became an assistant manager which is the person they blame for everything
bad,The main problem was short staff and the lack of training done. Little to nothing was taught and everyone began to quit making work become double for anyone still there.
bad,Family Dollar is currently restructuring itself to fall in line with Dollar Tree's Culture and Business Plan.  It does offer great benefits but does offer a balanced work/life benefit for its managers.
bad,"Work only 20hrs or less  a week if part time. You will work as cashier and stock the store your entire shift , that’s really stressful because soon as you walk off a customer is ready to check out and the manager still expect for you to get the job done. while the asm or manager stock the store and mingle with friends or local customer the entire time. Easy to move up with the company if you come to work and do as told. No lunch break"
bad,"Little advancement opportunities, a lot like high school, not professional. The pay is not great, and sometimes dependent on high turnover.  You often are stuck working odd hours, or 4 hour shifts only.  Physically, you are often on your feet for entire work-day. You are lifting, stocking and working a busy cash register. It is "
bad,I took on the challenge as an assistant Manager at Family Dollars. Maybe it was just the store I was at. I’ve experience pure stress since day one. Walk-in on 1st day almost the whole got terminated for thief and on a truck day at that. Store manager quit for different times and each time on truck day if I may add. Also this is a high volume store and the store is only employed with four employees. All I can say before considering taking a job in retail I will go and observe the place like twice a week before applying at any business just to see what I’m getting myself into. I’m no quitter and no stranger to hard work but this is beyond ridiculous. You could only imagine how bad the shrinkage is.
bad,"Basically working at family dollar they want you to be the cashier the cleaning person and the stock person with no help. Also they want you count the money like your the flash, which puts tension and stress on you."
bad,Had issues with the manager that was on when i worked there. Gave me hours for the week then took hours away for a rehire. Didn't have enough people to cover shifts.
bad,"Family Dollar was not a fun work place at all. The coworkers were rude, the store was always unorganized and dirty. Customers were almost always rude."
bad,This job is good as an entry level job or even someone who is retired and looking to make extra money. Get the experience and move on to a more promising career.
bad,Having to search for another place of employment due to some issues inside of the location and their being shut down by the government. Only given 14 days to find a job.
bad,As store managers we work 50+ hours a week and get 4 days off a month it’s a stressful job for retail. I only get 152 hours for my store 52 are automatically mine and 80 (40 to each assistant) is automatically taken out. Then I have 20 hours to schedule a cashier I’m required to have 2 cashiers at my store and I only can really schedule them for nights so  from 530-930.  We are in the stores by ourselves until 2 and 3 o’clock in the afternoon so it makes it hard to move around and get things done
bad,"Family Dollar is there to serve the community but in high crime areas or communities that have high loss/crime, steps should be taken to help employees and customers.  Get and keep good employees.  Make a point to professionally clean the stores.  This will be helpful for all, workers, customers and the community.  The community will shop there regardless but if customers are dealing with theft and bad customer service, they will go shop some other place."
bad,The company has been sadly declining for several years now. The lack of increase in sales is taken out at primarily store level with payroll cuts. This causes more work to fall on the already busy shoulders of its salaried store managers.
bad,"Working at Family Dollar seemed like an ok ordeal at first, but after management transferred it became a literal nightmare. With inconsistent direction from managers making the task much more difficult then it needs to be, and impossible tasks given to be able to complete in the amount of time given, it’s a stress filled nightmare."
bad,I've learned how to read the sku numbers to match up the products while doing inventory.most enjoyable is helping people and making sure their satisfied.
bad,it was unloading truck with no hours to give employees to help and put truck up while trying to run a store with no help . every time I will tell the dm he will say deal with it
bad,Overall stressful due to inconsistent job requirements and low wage for the work being done. i feel undervalued at this employment and they switch the schedule and are spiteful for situations you cant control.
bad,"The management for the local branch dont care for underling employees ,expectations are unrealistic.. racial comments made towards certain people made me never shop or back again"
bad,Work hard!! And never give up don't let nothing stop you be a leader this is just the start there will be bumps in the road so be prepared but get up and keep going
bad,"Family Dollar Management sucks, the customers are great but the employees have bad problems with certain customers. family dollar workers always frowning."
bad,The pay isn't horrible but it isn't competitive. Work hours are decent and you qualify for OT if the extra payroll hours aren't used by other stores. Managers are stuck working long days/nights. Working freight isn't realistic nor effective. Seems corporate needs a better system before they to broke
bad,We had 6 different store managers while I was there for 2 years so that was the hardest part. Some were horrible to the staff and treated us with no respect. the upper management actually listened to us and always looked into the bad Store managers thats why we had so many. The customers were great for the most part. We did have to deal with theft so calling the law was required. It was an overall good learning experience and taught me to deal with people in a different work enviroment.
bad,"This is basically all of the cons: I started as a part-time worker. This was in 2012 and I'm not sure it anything has changed but the salary was the worst part of the job. All I ever did was work on the registers and ring people up and we'd have three (or two if someone called out) people closing every night. Frankly, it wasn't the worst environment looking back, but the pay, alone, really sucked: It was 8 an hour and on top of the company didn't even give employee discounts. You only got one 30 minute break for the whole day and you couldn't get time off if you were part-time. "
bad,"This company is careless when it comes to equality in the workplace. Employees are treated unfairly, corporate chooses to look past any past or ongoing issues, and the environment itself is unacceptable."
bad,"I work for the company for just over a year and a half. I have many years of retail experience and was relied on heavily to work the weekend/evening hours that other employees did not want to work. Though the manager was kind and understanding for the most part, I saw much nepotism in who received management roles. One assistant manager was even the first cousin to the store manager, granted by marriage but still related. I was promised and asked if I wanted the assistant manager's position on more than one occasion and then passed over for it. When I complained about it, others were hired to cover my hours and they were cut. Also, I was listed as a part-time employee, which meant I did not receive benefits, but for the vast majority of the time I worked 40+ hours a week. "
bad,my job at family dollar was not a bad job. but the manager i had could not speak english very well. he always used to yell at everyone instead of talking to them. he was very rude.
bad,"The work place is great ince your working with the right people. It's an easy job but once the managers or the DM, they make it harder for you. Security is a must for all stores because you will be one the trying to stop them."
bad,Working here was not very fun. The manager did not do a very good job on keeping the store organized and stocked . The hours I worked were almost most of the time weekends and everyone would always change their shifts or not come in on certain days.
bad,Had to juggle numerous job positions including manually unloading a truck with 600 pieces at times while running back and forth to a register and everyday overstock for 9 months
bad,It was an alright place to work at but they didn't have enough associates for the job. The managers were expected to do a lot more than they got paid for.
bad,Not enough payroll to run store so Manager must do it alone.Corp. keeps cutting payroll yet demands more from Stores. Over orders trucks and expects one person to stock trucks in 24 hrs.
bad,very crowded and chaotic place to be as a work place. The manager showed very little concernism and lacked communication with the employees and customers.
bad,unfortunately my experience with family dollar was not the best. The store was always a mess and we couldn't keep the same manger no longer than 6 months.
bad,sometimes it was fast pace and other times slow i learnd to be patient and understandind to the coustumer the manager and the asstiant  manager were rude and unprofessional the hardest part of the job was stocking and the most enjoyable was cashiering
bad,Low staffed and high demand of employees. Worked with mostly good people and good management. Go back and forth from stocking to register hard to juggle at times.
bad,"no work/life balance, big tuck loads weekly but  never enough payroll to have the bodies in store to run store efficiently. no security guard in stores that are in high crime neighborhoods"
bad,Very little pay for what they ask you to do. You have to clean stock and attend customers all at once for only 7.25 an hour. It is very stressful with little to no benefits
bad,"Daily inventory,cash handling deposit ,work schedule , sale meeting with the employees and ,stock and distributed merchandise out on the sale floor. Responsible for hiring and training employees."
bad,"Demanding schedule"
bad,This one of my first jobs and i do not recommend it. Bad hours with rarely any call out leverage. Heavy truck deliveries in the heat. Just bad overall
bad,I did not enjoy my experience at family dollar. It was part time but the opportunity for more hours was presented. It was never delivered and the overall environment was horrible.
bad,"Has poor manager when i work there. Such a high turnover rate for a small town it in . Not eough worker at this ,the manager was always gone for weeks at a time"
bad,"Doesn't pay well, manger was too strict and too hard on everyone. Only smokers received breaks: long breaks. As a Family Dollar employee, you do everything in the store. As a cashier, you are responsible for customer service, minding the register, loss prevention, unloading truck, stocking shelves, facing the store, packing back stock and custodial duties."
bad,Poor management. Asked for more hours. Did everything i could to possibly recieve more hours and didnt get anywhere eventually i quit. I was left inside alone no manager with a line full of customers and register crashed.Called manager didnt even acknowledge the problem to come in to help was in the car with her girlfriend
bad,"Management focused on bottom line, shoplifting and nothing else.  Stressful workplace.  Hardest part of the job was meeting operational needs of the store while maintaining customer service while trying to monitor theft in a high-crime area."
bad,I was working for family dollar i couldn’t work one night and the manager told me not to go back in to work. I really didn’t agree with that and she was very rude!
bad,I was manger for almost two years and I never felt appreciated and all I ever heard from my supervisors was how I needed to cut costs even though my 2 yearly inventories I increased sales both years. This was the worst company I have worked for
bad,I hated the fact that they make people do unnecessarily things like the tests on the computer it was annoying and the people there are not so friendly everyone just looking out for themselves that selfishness
bad,The employees had a problem with working together to get things done around the store. They would do things on their own instead of working together to get things done and it seemed as if them working alone on things would get nothing done.
bad,I liked woring there before they switched managers. I would get better hours and i was traing new hires interviewing new hires. I did assistant manager work but wasn't getting the proper pay.
bad,"Customer service, money management, scheduling, hiring and firing, setting and exceeding goals on a daily basis, assuring a safe work place for customers and employees"
bad,In my experience working for this company I have found that veteran managers are allowed to do whatever they please while “on the clock” but new managers are often berated and watched closely. Managers often harass employees and it is difficult to contact hr or any person of power about such issues. Not a good work environment. Feels more like a highschool full of drama than a professional work place.
bad,Need a lot of customer service experience because its a lot of people all day and night coming and going need a lot of energy to always keep a smile on your face.
bad,"It was sort of my first job and they cut my hours the second day. There were lots of rude customers who did not understand that they did not teach me things like returns. The store was new and contractors were working. Lights went off and on and so did the refrigerated area. Management doesn't teach you about anything and expects a lot from you. I did not stay long and they also do not work well with your schedule whatsoever. Hours are as is, but I do not think any part time or full time jobs teach you anything. I really would not recommend it, to kill yourself for minimum wage. Just my personal thoughts."
bad,This is not a good place to work for.  Hours are inconsistent and pay raises are basically nonexistent.  There is poor management; employees who don't do their share are not reprimanded at all.
bad,people are careless and would come in and steal or make a mess. i would make sure every customer is comfortable for the most part and put a smile on each person that came inside.
bad,"took inventory, made deposits, unloaded the trucks, put stock away.  made the weekly work schedule, interview employees, check for expire dates on the food. just made sure the store flowed really good."
bad,I felt like it was a decent way to gain your customer service skills and your people skills. It was also a test to get as many customers out the way as possible to keep from gaining a long line
bad,It has a decent living style if you're going to school. But wouldn't recommend as a full-time job if the manager won't let you move up and get a raise.
bad,"a typical work day was very busy , i didn't learn anything. Management was very poor the store was unorganized. there was no hard part about this job."
bad,"Management wanted to platform favoritism to certain employees and if they done wrong (late for work, missing shifts, talking bad about fellow employees) it was overlooked. Worked numerous closes alone in a high crime area, no security."
bad,"Poor product quality, poor pay, just a job, no raises, no vacation time, stores nasty, upper management stuck up degrading to workers, stores should all be closed"
bad,The place sucks. I have nothing more to say. I didn't enjoy it. Poorly managed from the district manager on down. No pay raise. No chance for advancement unless you're 5 or 6 years in without a pay raise dealing with terrible customers and even worst management.
bad,"Lack of being able to stay fully staffed, poor management, risky area, dealt with alot of shoplifters...working in hot conditions through the summer.."
bad,"This business is so very unorganized, and could use more structure. Upper management does not understand the duties the follow below them. After Dollar Tree bought them out this business has went downhill."
bad,This company overall is not a good company or work for. Theft is extremely high and the company always blame the associates. There aren't any breaks given.
bad,"When I first started I liked it a lot. I was a cashier and soon promoted to assistant manager. I loved my manager a lot, but saw Family Dollar falling apart once things at the top started shifting. Around the time someone in a high held position was fired and replaced by a well known ""let's get all the money we can out of this"" (apologies for speculation, but it's been year but I recall reading about this) is when dollar generals started popping up everywhere. Long story already long cut shorter, I worked 32 hrs a week, no benefits and I was a manager. Shifts where I was completely alone and couldn't urinate without leaving the entire store unattended. I would ask regulars to watch the register so I could go to the restroom during 5 hr solo shifts. There was too much work, too much concern with loss prevention and store appearance but under manned. Never broke 10 bucks an hr but hired a walk on that got more. Resigned after almost 2yrs."
bad,"a typical day - making sure workplace stay clean, working the cashier, and helping customers"
bad,"I will start by saying that I am no retail fan. However, I'm in college and need some sort of income.  Working with the customers and employees at Family Dollar isn't that bad, it has it's ups and downs.  But the managing is absolutely ridiculous at our store. By far the worst manager I have ever heard of."
bad,"I swear this was the worst company I worked for, they are in horrible areas and sometimes not safe for employees. They don't really care as long as there stores are getting ran."
bad,my review of this place is many people know me for how well i treated them and came back knew me by name and i loved and cared for all who came into my path. But my boss seemed to not care about these statements about our missions as far as customer service goes and he cut me down on hours so i would quit. But i do not regret making a difference in my community and meeting new people
bad,"If you've been there a while then you're most likely able to do what you want and the manger won't say anything. However, if you're new then the manager wants you to stay busy at all times and you have to ask for your break. The other employees were rude and childish for no reason. It was just a very high school environment to be in."
bad,"i feel like i was underpaid for the work that they demand for. They originally hired me has part time but i always worked full time. You get hired as a cashier but do stocking, truck, and cashiering. It is fast paced and time does go by fast. I worked there the store was robbed three tims and it didnt seem like it was anything to manage ment"
bad,"Family Dollar isn't the greatest place to work for. Usually at the location I was working at was a hot spot for thieves. Everyday, there was at least ten people in there stealing. The store has no type of security besides any male employee that works there. They are not trained or being pay for being ""security"" at the location. It wasn't a safe place to work considering the company will not add security to the store. The employees they hired are not pay fairly. The actual work is easy as long you have time management skills. Some customers will try to bring counterfeit bills as well as fake coupons. As long as you have an good eye and finding them you won't get fired over it. The balance between work and personal life is almost non existing. You can get promoted within the company if you work well enough."
bad,Company needs to be more hands on with employees and interact with employees more. They should follow up with store visits more often. Promote within the company.
bad,The company is decent to work for.  The management lacks fairness and respect.  The oh is a bit low for the stress and work demand. The schedules were not flexiabke.
bad,Poor management. Work day goes by pretty slow and easy. Hardest part of job is dealing with coworker personalities. Most enjoyable is casual conversation with customers as I would assist them.
bad,the shifts that they have are 12-8 are afterwards and I thinks its something in the evening. The job is a good start especially for someone that is still in high school and looking to make some money.
bad,I worked for family dollar about a year and a half. I was told when I was hired that as long as I provided the days I need off I would get them off. There were maybe 5-10 days I needed off that were not met. I was over worked and underpaid even after asking for a raise. I rarely was spoken to by the DM. The store manager was not a reliable/trustworthy person. I found another job just to leave that environment.
bad,"A day at work is a 13 to 15 hour day huge turnover with associates because of the lower pay-rate,You are expected to be the only cashier all day . open all day on every holiday they dont care about there associates ."
bad,"it was not  bad place to work just not the job for me . I have had worse jobs , they are very good with employees but sometimes it get a little out of hand but all in all ok"
bad,"Typical day would be count the register if you given one, complete daily tasks like fixing items or putting up items. At the end you count your register down."
bad,It was productive in a fun place to work meet new people different personalities. Always something new each day. Working with fellow employees was a plus
bad,"The company is fast pace, and demanding. You can advance to a higher position if you are willing to put the hard work in. The company has its faults just as any company does."
bad,I was able to learn how to quickly assist customers while handling money and give good customer service. We were often understaffed which was hard to balance at times.
bad,the job was not great but it helped with the bills. typical day work was providing customers with enjoyable experience while they shopped in the store.
bad,"I helped set-up a completely new store in Walkerville, MI. The two company start-up managers from Family Dollar were great to work for, it was Corporate Family Dollar that was the problem."
bad,This is a ok job. My anager made it bearable. I liked working with most of the customers. It was super busy at times and at others super duper slow. I liked it ok i guess
bad,Wa required to work through breaks and lunch as an ASMwe were told to eat when we could. We unloaded the truck ourselves that could have started at 4 am  and general shop maintenance.
bad,"i did not like this job, management was terrible, workplcae culture was all for one, nothing was enjoyable about this job. hardest part was of the job was not wanting to be there"
bad,"busy consistantly, learned how to meet the customers needs, workplace culture is multi-cultured, retail is never easy, most enjoyable part is a great team and seeing customers happy."
bad,The corporate culture and environment was never consistent  The expectation did not meet the demand or the industries standards.  I was being told to do things from a corporate stand point that didn't fit with the actual business needs at the time.
bad,Family dollars need to do better by training people and learn the meaning of team work you cant just have one person doing everything and denpeding on that
bad,"Company does not provide enough payroll if store is not making sales. So they cut payroll and manager gets stuck doing all, cashier , stocker  just plain running the store ."
bad,overall working for Family Dollar was a great experience only down fall are the customers that steals and inventory comes around yup you get blamed for it sad.
bad,Terrible place to work terrible management.  There was absolutely nothing flexible with this job . There was a total of four employees who work there two were managers and two  were regular employees.  Meaning if you found yourself sick or in the hospital you would have to pray to the high heavens that the other employee would be willing to come in to cover you and nine times out of 10 they would not be leaving you literally stranded.  The manager in  colonial Beach is also extremely childish and petty.  They trash talk all of the employees as well as the customers and constantly abuse their position of power .
bad,"Greeting the customers and building a relation with everyone that came in the store as a regulars, restocking the merchandise on shelves, making sure the store is clean and neat"
bad,I feel that the workers are not paid enough for the work performed. There is no room for promotions. There is no confidentiality in the work place and working conditions are poor.
bad,It was a nice experience but it was just a temporary job so I wasn’t there for a long time but during my time there I meet some nice people and customers as well
bad,"pay was not enough for the amount that needed to be done. Lack of employee rate, and not enough hours. friendly staff, and customers. Not enough employees to run a business efficiently."
bad,This is a job for young adults or people with very few financial responsibilities. The shift hours are highly inconsistent and not very rewarding however it’s enough to survive provided you have some form of additional income
bad,"Would come in count my drawer down, get on the register ring people up or go fixed the shelves. Sometimes the air was not working properly during the summer and if it rained it would come through the door. The manager at the time would leave the cashier in the store and go smoke cigarettes and talk on the phone. He did not care if you were busy. Then when it would get close to closing he would then ask you to stay later to help fix the shelves. The store always looked recked. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the manager and how the store looked. I enjoyed the customers and other employees."
bad,Working for Family Dollar was an okay experience. The management team could use improvement and some of the staff. I enjoyed assisting the customers with their purchases and needs daily.
bad,I would never recommend somebody to work here because they treat you unfairly and don't pay you what they are supposed to pay and the managers where never there
bad,"An okay place to work as a customer service representative, though the pay is awful. Pay is slightly better when promoted to management but not worth the pay. You get paid for the required 52 hours a week, every hour after that is free. I work an average of 80 hours a week. I can see why turnover is so high at this company."
bad,Horrible company to work for. They aren't willing to give you any raises no matter how hard you work . Not a good environment to work in. Task would be stocking shelves.
bad,"I loved the people that I worked with however when it came to the job it was always stressful and no one managed the scheduling or helped you. This was a low paid job and it did give me hours but there was a lot of in house drama and no delegating you of what you should be doing, you get thrown to the wolves and have to teach yourself!"
bad,Family Dollar was a good place to work. I loved the job and the hours and I loved the regular customers. It wasn't a hard job and I liked that even if we were so I still had stuff to do as in stocking my part of the store.
bad,"The hours were not the best, Short staffed, Not a fun place to work. I didn't enjoy this job the management was poor and pay was terrible. It was good for the time i was there."
bad,You had to always work hard. Managers never stepped in to help. Left you with all the work. If you complained you were given more work. No accountablity
bad,"They tend to keep the staff at the stores low, but expectations high in that you service the customers while keeping the store stocked, clean and maybe 2 people to unload a full truck and then disperse the inventory."
bad,they don't pay to well don't offer good benefits customers steal a lot and they can be very rude the trucks come in one to two time a week and you have to unload them and put away the stuff
bad,"i would no advise anyone to work at the one i worked its no safe , the robbing is bad an they have your life at risk to much, the employees were my only reason for staying the length of time that i did.."
bad,Bad place to work. Get rob often..  Managment . crazy the onwers cant care about the employees never inne security gards..    Soppy business for inne one that work there period.
bad,it ok to work here the boss was ok. hours was not to good once you work for a while. it was agree if I work I had a set schedule which included me to work weekend but after a few months that change cause a family member was hires and he trump my house
bad,"A very stressful environment, only me and my manager ran the store at my time of employment.  It was fun being assistant manager but my manager was no the best at her job."
bad,"This job was temporary for me, but the experience I had wasn't the best. They weren't very fun managers, and they were all about sitting in their office in the back and doing no work on the floor."
bad,"good work environment.. I enjoyed the people the most doing my job and seeing my work keeps me going...assisting customers, stocking, and recovery...."
bad,"Very unsafe work environment for this location in particular.  No constant security at this particular store located in a very crime riddled neighborhood.  "
bad,"the job was ok... because of the other workers."
bad,I wouldn't work there again. You are over worked and underpaid. You are expected to complete everything in a minimal amount of time and that's not realistic.
bad,"Family dollar was a learning experience that could have been a whole lot better, the manager was super rude to customers and was so unorganized for a professional"
bad,"Fast paced and aggravating, however there is room for advancement if you work hard and show initiative. The pay wasn't great but the co workers were decent."
bad,I love what I do. I'm not crazy about where I do. I don't think Family Dollar genuinely cares about the employees. We are constantly put in harms way. They have no regard for the safety of the workers.
bad,"No benefits, they overwork their employees, low pay and not reasonable with their working hours. Management  did not understood employees when they had either medical emergencies or were sick."
bad,"I wouldn't suggest working here due to the constant technical difficulties I've experienced working as a cashier. The computer often malfunctions and there never seems to be enough bags within the store for customers groceries, not to mention that the bags when stocked are of an incredibly flimsy and cheap quality, often prompting customer complaints."
bad,working there was a complete waste my time . barley got any hours and my checks didnt even reach $100 every 2 weeks . the manager was ok . it was pretty messy to me the hardest part was
bad,Stressful working environment. A typical day at work was being watched at all times. Management was overbearing. The hardest part of the job was mopping. The most enjoyable part of the job was customers and fellow employees.
bad,"Family Dollar says there a family based corporation, but in all reality Family Dollar is not. I have 1 child, also have court documents signed by a judge in my county where I live. Family Dollar, my DM, my Manager were not willing to work with my court order child custody agreement as far as work scheduling. My manager gave me ultamatums, harrassed me, threatend me, and my job. I made my District manager aware of the issues, she did nothing to rectify the problems. My manager would constantly schedule me to work when daycare was closed ,and i have no daycare to watch my son  at nite time. My manager was well aware of my court order child custody agreement, she failed to abide by court documents. Poor management. Nobody should be harrassed at there job, or thretend. This has got to stop, and change."
bad,Scan and load items on the Belt and clean after and help others if needed. And check to see if anything is not missing or not damage on the items and make sure everything is clean
bad,"Typically very stressful. Must be quick pace and in shape. Things must get fast. NO LUNCH BREAKS! If management is bad then the place would be falling apart. Hardly anyone can find people to cover their shifts if they are extremely sick, they must work their shift. "
bad,A lot of work for only  two people in the store most of the time. They expect you to do so much with 2 people and complain when it isnt all done. District manager was the worst heard her yelling at the two different managers I had in since I been there. I heard she got fired by now though.
bad,I did at first love my job at Family Dollar.  I was a seasonal co-manager but after so long of working for them my store manager and the assistant manager we had would always call in and I was having to work open to close.  From 9 in the morning to 10 at night for weeks in a row. I have two babies to care for and am a single mom so I wasn't able to continue being employed with the company.
bad,"Horrible, hours where always unreliable, organization was lacking, Company in my general opinion really didn't care period about it's employees and way too much to do for one or two people for such little amount of earned income!"
bad,This job is mainly for afterschool high school children. Nothing for a person with a family unless its a second job. The staff was nice and everyone worked hard.
bad,This job was a dead end. No room for advancement and the customers were very mean. Management was poor and were never helpful with any conflicts. We have been robbed numerous times.
bad,It was a very stressful job. Lack of communication between management. Had to work to many hours for the pay. They expect to much from one person. Hope it's not like that in other states.
bad,"Operate cash registers at the front of the store, greeting customers as they make purchases. Scan all items, process cash, check and credit card transactions, also cleaning work areas and returning merchandise to shelves and racks."
bad,"Overall I did not have a good experience working at Family Dollar. Although you are guaranteed fulltime hours is part of the management team, the pay and culture of Family Dollar isn't the greatest. They really expect much more of you than they are willing to pay for. THey also dont stand by the employees."
bad,"lifting, pulling, pushing heavy Uboats all day long, no heat in the winter, no ac in the summer. Long work shifts at low salary, lots of employees that call in"
bad,It was a very busy place to be everyday. Loss prevention was a huge deal at this location.  My husband had a business open in Myrtle Beach so I relocated with him. Great group of people.
bad,"This job allowed me to survived when I was just beginning my exploration of the workforce.  The manager was very inconsistent, offering no concrete policy on anything, or just pulling it out of the sky.  It was very difficult to plan a school/college schedule, because of the constant emergency calls I was given to come in.  Schedules would be changed without notice, which ruined many of my plans.  The wage was disgraceful."
bad,It's entirely up to you if your willing to work and is diligent then your performance will be great. All I know I done my job. I was a cashier and work my shift that's.
bad,Never enough hours to have coverage so managers can get work done. Poor training requirements and set up for all positions. Small number of employees helped keep it feeling like a family.
bad,I can appreciate Family dollar for the growth that it provided for me. It gave me character. It helped me become business savvy. It also was the first management position that I received.
bad,"I hated working at the family dollar i was assigned to, the manager was not skilled enough to be a manager and relied way to much on her employees to do her work, if confronted she would become very hostile."
bad,"Stores are run on a shoestring budget, Always short staffed. Training was minimal at best. Seemed to be a sink or swim environment. Very little positive feedback. Felt like everyone was always being judge in a negative light"
bad,"Low pay, lack of appreciation, skeleton crew. Poor management in my situation. Terrible raises. I heard my raise after inventory was $.17. I was insulted."
bad,not enough pay bad management  nobody was willing to work they are lazy the pay wasn't worth what they was asking if us to much n the theft is real bad over therme
bad,Okay so I was able to do any of my videos till about a week later from hire date. Didn't like all the drama that was there. The manager had attitude issues.
bad,"I worked at Family Dollar after high school. I believe it is a job for young adults due to the fact that advancement is scarce in the company. Other than the ability to move up, it was a decent job."
bad,It was a decent job with no security in a bad environment. There were robberies and stealing every other day. I felt safe half the time. I didnt get the hours I was promised.
bad,I work part-time at a nearby Family Dollar.  This employment serves a current purpose with no expectations.  I have learned more about serving different types of customers and that is a good thing.
bad,nothing to review my hours were fine and so was my salary the management was ok the customers were different but all in all everything was fine until the anouncement of the closing of the stores
bad,it was lay back job but the pay was not worth it for the many hours you work and things you did for the company this is why I left the company and mov
bad,My older sister told me about Family Dollar and it seem like a nice easy job that paid great but i had to leave beacuse i had no one to babay sit my chikd!
bad,"A typical day was hectic,going in  there was always something wrong. With me being the only cashier i had to stock and ring in customers; i could handle it but the way the store was ran it wasn't how it should be."
bad,Wasnt happy there. Treat there employees poorly. Good for part-time work. Didn't get a raise unless u were assistant manager and they only did that if they knew u.
bad,They overwork you under pay you expect for you to do things that they were not do they want you to do multiple jobs that's not really required overall is just a really bad job well it was for me
bad,I loved the people I worked with and I like socializing with the customers so I'm good at customer service. I just don't think the company really appreciates their employees.
bad,"I was promoted to assistant manager after the previous manager was caught up in a scandal. Even though I had the title of assistant manager my pay was little over minimum wage. I was responsible for balance the register, making bank deposits, taking inventory, accepting deliveries, along with a few other things. The replacement manager, while very nice was a little all over the place, so a lot of the time I spent fixing her chaos. When the higher up finally came to check on the situation, instead of lending assistance they just replaced her, and all her employees. Which meant I was now out of a job. All these reason are why I gave it such a low rating but again my situation had special circumstances."
bad,"work day was long a slow"
bad,A regular day consisted of customer service along with troubleshooting team member issues. Moving up in a company at such a fast pace at a young age has been a challenge in itself. The ultimate challenge I faced was growing in experience while applying new understanding to an ever-changing work environment. Communication as key was always great while with the company and i have learned from my year experience of management with Family Dollar starting as an Assistant ending as a Store Manager.
bad,as an adult you can not survive working for family dollar the only way to get benefits is if you are an asm they do follow the labor law no breaks and no lunch no raises no matter how much you travel from store to store I don't have anything good to say about family dollar its just a job
bad,The hours was horrible and they pay was bad. I never had help and I wasn't taught anything new. I learned on my own how to do things. I wouldn't go back to this job.
bad,"Family Dollar is a great job for someone who has never worked before. Get to learn the basics of handling money and customer service. Very relaxed, and simple to learn."
bad,"The customers were always rude, the managers didn't care about anyone but themselves. Employees always called out or never showed up when they were supposed to."
bad,Upper management expects you to let them know on any concerns but once you contact them they include you in drama instead of being professional. They dont care for their crew long as their store is up and running thats all that matter to them
bad,It is a ok company to work for. I just know my worth and I know I am worth more than what I make. I'm ready for a new experience since I have completed college.
bad,I enjoyed this job at times. The management was horrible too many managers / assistant managers coming in and out we never really as one person stay. Overall it was an ok play to work in
bad,"If you want to feel like a slave then work for Family Dollar. You'll never see your family and you also won't make enough money to support them. Even being an assistant manager working 45+ hours a week barely paid for anything. People were great, company sucked."
bad,work was really unprofessional management was unorganized and it seem like they did not know how to make anything work. the employees were fun to work with
bad,The company was ran very poorly never had the same manager in the store for no more than 1 year the turn over rate was very bad the employee where not customer friendly just was not a good place to work.
bad,A typical day at Family Dollar warehouse was a fast pace job with little time to take a break. You had to walk ten minutes to get to your designated break place and another 10 to get back to your job site.
bad,Worse place I have ever worked. Low pay. Disrespectful. Would never work there again. I was let go because of a medical condition. At that point I was pregnant.
bad,"Family Dollar's management and expectations would be laughable if they weren't so horrifying.  The district managers and corporate office frequently expect 60+ hour weeks out of their management teams, even though they are salaried.  Enough payroll is not allowed for all tasks to be accomplished."
bad,Very little structured training provided. Store Managers expect too much out of their Assistant Managers but give very little assistance in achieving weekly tasks.
bad,Working at family dollar was just horrible! Managers would never last at the store. Would always be doing extra work when it wasn't even your job to do. Wasn't a safe place to work because they would always be robbing the place.
bad,management is ok  but very pushy paycheck are not the best in thing to look forward when it comes to having reasons of why you cant  work its best not to have any reasons or you get fired on the spot
bad,"The company was alerted to a health hazard in our store and did absolutely nothing to fix it. There was a heavy mouse infestation in the building. There were packages of food that had been bitten into, mouse droppings lying on the shelving, and numerous customer complaints. This one situation proved the company did not care about its workers or its customers, as we were all at risk for illness for consistent exposure to rodents and their waste."
bad,It was a good job to work for. The management was pretty cool and reasonable.It could be a lot better organized but as far as the job itself it was cool
bad,We did extra large amounts of work for very little pay. I got experience on how to run a store by myself. Management is ok. Co workers were nice. Working 7 days a week most of the time. It was never good enough for the big bosses. Customers were enjoyable. It gave you a chance to have a conversation with someone before going back to work.
bad,"Working a Family Dollar was ok. It was a paycheck. You have your good days and your bad. Overall the job is decent. Depending on your location you may have to deal with managers who have sticks up their butts. If you pick up hours you may be able to make a living working there. It won't be great but you can survive. But be careful, as they love to cut hours."
bad,FD is an OK place to work .If you just want a job then this is a great place to work. If you want to work on cutting edge technologies then look some where else.
bad,No I would not work for this place they have bad Mangers. they don't care about there workers. They don't help there workers to show them how to do things.
bad,Hours are long on occasion when there is not enough hours to allot overtime to accommodate customer demand!. This fact makes for a better manager because you learn the flow of your said operation. Assistant management is just as important as store manager and the two have to work collectively or it will lead to failure. The hardest part of the job is ensuring that only the best employees are hired to take care of the customers and their enthusiasum  shows in their work performances. The most enjoyable part is when a customer is elated on how much money they were saving!!
bad,No good pay..no raises..and growth opportunities are not worth it. Never enough workers..assistant managers process large trucks by hand off rollers sometimes by yourself with one cashier..lots of shoplifting..no security in store..company very slow with repairing items around the store. Managers hardly ever get lunch breaks..because there is hardly ever two managers on at a time..just very  tiresome  and stressful  place  to work..I wouldn't recommend being a manager at this company. There is just no incentives in place and no appreciation for the workers whatsoever. You'll never get to the  management  part of your job..you will basically  be stocking freight and running  a register..defnitely not a job for a elderly person.
bad,A typical day at Family Dollar would begin with counting cash register. Stocking shelves. Making sure items were in the correct place on shelves. Mark items with security tags. Scan and bag items. Issue receipts.
bad,I didn't like family dollar I don't like working there because all the work fell on me no support this was just a temporary job until I found one it wasn't a job I really wanted but a job at the time I was a hard worker from sales associate to stocking receiving and warehouse
bad,"This job was a blessing. Was able to walk in and get a job quickly. However, the turnover rate is unbelievable! Not just with the employees but also with management"
bad,As it is a dollar store the emphasis on cheap labor and lack of full time hours was a problem at the particular store that I worked at. Management was micro-managing starting with the district manager.
bad,Would have liked the job more if there was more advancement in the ladder for employees stable management and more hours for the job that was required.
bad,Great place to work . benefits were not the best. Job was very easy . I did not have a lot if any challenges. I found my self getting restless and looking for a better career.
bad,I worked for this company for almost 2 years. I was due to receive a promotion and a raise before they changed managers at my store. Unfortunately I had to quit because I no longer felt safe and the district manager didn't care about the employees safety after a robbery.
bad,"Been with Family Dollar for a short while. Retail in general is a well under paid industry with expectations of working lots of hours and being assigned projects to get done during your shift. With that being said the management at Family Dollar do work hard but I have found some who make the cashiers feel they are just cashiers. Belittling in the tone of voice. There is no training, only when you make a mistake is when you are told how not to do something with some of the managers making you feel you absolutely horrible. I know corporate is against unions. But don't you think it would be better to have one to organize better pay and raises and benefits? If they are against unions they should really take care of their employees including managers. No employee discounts. I do like the paid weekly and the store is always busy big plus."
bad,"A place to work if you're just starting out and don't have any bills. Poor management, poor budgeting at all stores. Not much respect for the employees whom dedicate themselves. Some supervisors also play favoritism."
bad,Just a pass thru job. They use u till they don't need u anymore. There is a lot of unethical things going on there. Theft and backstabbing. They treat people very poorly because of the people they choose to put in charge. Low educated and mentality.
bad,Other employees quite like fly's. they over schedule employees so there will be three cashiers to come in when only two employees are needed
bad,Hard company to work for I was with this company for 5 years and never felt appreciated and was always willing to cover a shift and train an manager but was never compensated for it.
bad,"like to work with people  and the team, mangement its not so easy but i like to do it, glad that my people like to work with me and we like to work with the customers, have to work a lot more hours, but i really enjoy what i was doing for this company"
bad,"as an employee, I was a cashier and stocker. These positions were fast paced which help the day go faster. Dealing with very disrespectful customers daily helps build a high tolerance for negativity."
bad,it was okay I was very busy all the time there is plenty of work they are always looking for new talent employees that are honest and can handle very difficult customers the hours of business are good the open around 8 am and close before 9 so it was good to not have get up early or work late its a very small store with few employees I enjoyed the customers a lot they were  good people and they made me feel good when I can sell them exactly what they needed at a low price the training process needs improvement but some employees are well trained. most of my coworkers were very kind and willing to help others get to work on time.
bad,Company has limited advancement for the teammember and management not on the same page  otherwise the pay is good and the benifits just need more advanement
bad,The job is very easy to do its just the managers an district managers that they choose to run the stores that i didnt like i hated everything from the staff the managers an i didnt enjoy coming at all
bad,The management here is a total joke. The General Manager is one of the rudest and unprofessional people I have ever had the displeasure of working for! Save yourself the stress!!
bad,I good job for a summer job. Not a good job for a career. Horrible hours and have to work on holidays. Gave them eight yes and the most I made as assistant manager is $9.38 an hour.
bad,A person needs to be single with no family in order to work with Family Dollar management.  It was the worst 2 years of my life.  Missed every holiday with my child for 2 years. Got told I was useless by the manger after I worked 65 hours in a week due to nobody being able to come in due to winter weather. Hope that whom ever is wanting to work there thinks really hard before applying.
bad,store was clean for the most part and hours weren't bad good team and good pay wasn't as fast paced and you got breaks to relax management wasn't bad but i would never want to work there again
bad,Its just a regular minun wage job. It consist of standing on your feet all day. It comes with rude customers. There are also a lot of thieves that you have to watch.
bad,It sucks I was robbed as a employee and blamed for the robbery and I was also laid off so there isn't much to tell about this specific job place so there u have it
bad,terrible experience all the way around.. regret waisting my time n loyality there..i would not recommend this job for anyone wanting to bettter themselves in there career
bad,Typical day consists of hard work in the beginning. Management and co-workers improved in attitude and professionalism. Hardest part of the job was hours decreased and most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers satisfied.
bad,"my co-workers were friendly, but the management staff was not friendly, I thought they need a whole lot more training to be more competent."
bad,not a bad place to start off working just as always comes down to people and management. but again its not terrible its just not for everybody
bad,"I started with Family Dollar as a cashier and eventually became a store manager, so obviously there is opprotunity of advacement. However, job security is non-existent since management expectations are unrealistic. One can not have a balanced life as family dollar employee. Additionally, I really did appericate the easily-attainable experience I attained at Family Dollar."
bad,"This review is store-specific. I suppose that, with a good team and management, this would not necessarily be a bad place to work... But a team that is lazy and perpetually short-staffed (which often happens in many locations due to ever-decreasing payroll budgets) and a poorly organized and maintained store is a death sentence to any retail position."
bad,I loved the location of this job because it was close to home but I preferred something a little more hands on and I didn't want to work so much hands on hands with customers.
bad,this job will be great for someone just getting out of high school or have minimum job experience. high paced enviroment
bad,after a year or so of working all the managers had quit then when the new manager came she said we was doing it all wrong and since i was the only male added to my work load
bad,"I can't really say much, other than it's retail. you know what you're getting into. If you don't, ask someone to tell you how it really is."
bad,while working for family dollar the company made it hard to run the store. giveing cashiers 10hr a week and doing 60-70hr a week.
bad,great expectations but isn't followed through. no hours and pay isn't for someone who is trying to support their family.
bad,"stocking, customer service and unloading truck on truck day. this is a fast and slow work pace as it depends on the manager who you are working underneath at the time. it was a fun place to work at before i had my car accident."
bad,Not a good company to work for. The turn over rate is pretty high in multiple locations. Seems to be not a great training program offered and usually left on your own to learn your own way. Leadership seems to be not a major factor with company.
bad,It really just depends on the store... I was a floater for a short period of time and the condition of some of the stores are atrocious. My main problem with this company is that the managers are going unchecked. As an assistant you could end up doing all the managers work without SM compensation. The managers currently in my district are also close personally with one of the district managers so if you have a problem with your manager it is never addressed and you are made out to be the problem. Also there is no sympathy for working parents. I would not suggest this particular job to another single mom. Schedules are always changing and it is very hard to plan things like daycare drop off and pick ups or childrens dr appt. because if they want you to work over... you better work over.
bad,"nice, compassion and professial to work with very heplfull to customers and respectful, work with you and your family very great company"
bad,Family Dollar is a very interesting place to work. The community is diverse with customers from all different cultures. Most of them are very nice and fun to work with.
bad,"Consistent place to work, nice fast pace, good benefits only didn't see a lot of room for advancement and high turnover rate."
bad,"A typical day is interacting with customers and organizing products. What I learned is that no matter how frustrating it becomes you can always walk away before things escalate. The management crew is good enough to run a business but could improve in a lot of ways. My co-workers are friendly and most times easy to work with,I just feel a little more teamwork could go on. The hardest part of this job is when the business is busy and no one is taking time out to think which leads to mistakes, that'll eventually need fixing. Fixing means more work and more work with short hours is frustrating. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers such as small children and elderly."
bad,"While my coworkers were enjoyable, there was just not enough of them. Often I was the only cashier, even during the start of the tourist season. This caused customers to get impatient due to the long waits. Resulting in some abandoning their carts and leaving. Along with being a cashier, I was also responsible for bank deposits, janitorial cleaning, stocking shelves, and assembling displays almost daily. The store manager was in store one to two times per week, while the shift manager worked primarily in the back room. The hardest part of this job was completing the many tasks that should of been divided between at least two people. The most enjoyable part of this job was the thirty minute lunch break."
bad,"Started as a temp with a large team doing a new store setup, worked closely with a manager of another store while doing setup, got suggested by him to be an assistant manager, although I didn't believe I was completely cut out for it (not good at managing others, small and young and female=disrespected by my temp peers who were mostly older women who saw me get the promotion instead of themselves)... Only a handful were selected to be a permanent part of the new store staff except for a manager who was apparently chosen from doing another store setup elsewhere... She ended up being a nightmare to deal with, always looked at me with suspicion as if she didn't like who was picked to be her assistant manager, then barely a month after grand opening she got some mystery rare illness and was hospitalized for a couple months during the winter holiday season. I was given very little training (which was mostly all on the computer and a bunch of nonsense really), felt very overwhelmed by myself even though other managers came to cover for when I wasn't there, sometimes felt like I was floating through shifts while receiving constant but subtle disrespect from employees, never felt comfortable in the store, was barely given any guidance or mentoring from other managers even though it was clearly needed at times. The pay was mediocre for what was required of the position even when the store manager came back from illness. I felt like she did very little compared to the mountain of overwhelming work she would purposefully leave for me to do so that she could be lazy. One time she pulled"
bad,My favorite part was working with the customers. The hardest part was doing doubles here and there. I liked some of my co-workers.
bad,Provided me with experience on how to operate efficiently in a retail environment and gave me opportunities for advancement.
bad,does not balance work life and personal life. Higher management are very rude and does not consider that employees have a life after work
bad,Family Dollar does not give the store managers enough payroll to effectively run the store. You are alone in the store till 3 o clock most days and this is unsafe. They expect the salary managers to do everything on their own and you basically live at work.
bad,"a typical day at family dollar for me involves me be prompt and on time manage and delegating staff while accounting for customer and making sure there overly satisfied, manage money on a day to day basis. the co worker a great to work with which is a bonus at any job the hardest part of the day would be recovering the store to make sure everything operational for the morning staff. the most enjoyable part is the customer and employee interaction."
bad,Loved walking into work to greet customers and deal with vendors. I learned how to handle accountables. My co-workers did not follow proper policies so therefore I did not enjoy that. I did not care for working late hours and missing my daughters time. the most enjoyable part of my job was assisting the public
bad,Unrealistic about protecting shrink. Stores are easy to steal from due to understaffing. Mgrs work lot of hours and cant protect theft because they stock all day and have nobody able to watch sales floor from theft. If something is in need of repair you might be weeks away from anythong happening. Stores are always cold in winter with employees having to wear winter coats and hot in summer. Upper magt all about cutting hours and shrink numbers. Never hear about sales!  If you are in the click you can move with this company. Many have gotten promoted with terrible shrink numbers and other terminated.
bad,"Family Dollar can be more attractive in recruiting by offering better pay and incentives."
bad,Company requires too much time and effort for little pay. Management required to do too many tasks as labor allotment is way to low. No support from upper management.
bad,There are no breaks. you are constantly on the go. The day does fly by quickly. I worked with a great bunch of people. I really enjoy my time with the customers. It gives you a good feeling when you can help some one find what they are looking for.
bad,"Open the Store, Customer service, Retail sales, Facing inventory, Receiving Inventory, Money management, Closing the Store"
bad,Would not work for them again. Bad management. Way Too many things to name and mention. Very unpleasant place to work. Not even the coworkers were pleasant.
bad,"Always under new management "
bad,This is the type of job to get experience and move on. This company is not for everyone. I thank them for a chance to get some experience to move on.
bad,the hardest part of the job was managing the store on what hours they gave you. The company does not care about you they only care about the store. If you are not good enough then they will terminate you on the spot.
bad,Family Dollar is great but there were several flaws within the company. We were short of help consistently.I was an assistant manager and pay was horrible.
bad,No work/life balance. Be on call 24/7. Hardest part is keeping people from stealing. Manager calls you on your off day just to reprimand you for something you did or did not stop someone from doing even if you did not work there on that specific day. If sales are down and customers do not show up then it is your fault. Missing or misplaced items are blamed on you.
bad,This job was not one of my favorites. We were overworked and under payed. The management was irresponsible and not caring of employees
bad,This job is okay for a first job. Not good pay not great management and not such a great environment. Though there are many things to complain about with this job it is a job and it does pay. It is a better job for someone without a family
bad,"Lack of communication, no balance between tasks or customer service."
bad,"I worked my way from a stocker to assistant manager but i had no help from my manager with improving the profitability and efficiency of team members. Find where the shrink is and fix it instead of trying to swallow up the shrink with sales. Sales does not cure everything if you are gaining profit from more sales but loosing it as you gain it your not gaining your still shrinking but that is just my opinion,"
bad,The expect a vast amount of travel for limited compensation. Managers are expected to work 65 hours a week for a a static salary. They use managers to cover for employees because they don't get overtime.
bad,I worked for this company for two years without a raise or any benefits. I was passed over for a promotion I was promised upon hire and the management did not care about the people that worked there and what we had to deal with on a daily basis.
bad,"Supervised 19 stores, visited 2 stores daily. Used exception management to decide daily visits. Working with the store managers was the best part and helping them grow was the best and most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,The job pays min wage to its workers the hours are long the work is hard and you will get laid off with out a notice. I did not like the job at all
bad,awesome job.awsome people. I loved working there.the pay is good as well as the flexible hours. omg by the way did I mention it was great.
bad,"bad management, not organized, hardest part of the job was being insulted by customers and not having a good management team"
bad,Family Dollar was my first job and it gave me a lot of good experience. It was challenging sometimes and a lot of hard work was Involved in the duties but overall I learned a lot.
bad,Family dollar over worked their employees and had many disadvantages as far as a team . There would only be one manager and one other employee working a closing shift. On truck days 3 employees and one manager working at maximum.
bad,The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. To excell in this job you have to be a volatile worker.The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to develop multi tasking abilities
bad,I spent more time cleaning out stockrooms instead of training the managers to do it themselves. Payroll was very lean which caused the shrink to go up in stores. Upper managers spent more time trying to move up and not fixing the problem in stores.
bad,"Great atmosphere, pay isnt good and def alot of physical work. Great  for young ppl trying to make some money not great enough for adults with real life bills and family."
bad,"Needs a lot of changes as far pay rate for experience applicants more opportunities and advancement, security for the sake of the employees and more hours"
bad,i stalked the floor. i learned to multitask i was a role model took pride in my work the hardest part was getting help
bad,one of the worst jobs ive ever had duty to horrible management.
bad,With the size of the store and not enough hours to give to people. They tell you it's a great place to work but full time sometimes only can get 29 hours. Everything is based on money. A certain amount of money is given and the store manager has to distribute hours by how much you make. OVERWORKED AND VERY MUCH UNDER PAID
bad,"No consideration for hard working loyal employees"
bad,"At first it was great. Now it's a bad case of overworked and underpaid. Policies have changed and it makes it harder to get done what needs to be done. I'm a first assistant, been there for a year, and just got my first raise. However I still barely make it from pay check to pay check."
bad,Customers make this place worth the while... Another case of too many chiefs and not enough Indians... Store manager likes to cut everyone's payroll just to kiss butt... Overall she doesn't care for anyone but herself... If you get a job here expect to be hardly trained and when something happens it's always your fault...
bad,"Meet a lot of new a different people,. I deal with many different people each day, that's the good part of working here."
bad,"This company is not a safe environment."
bad,"I enjoyed the job, but i wasn't getting enough hours to do the things I would like to do besides pay my bills.  This would be an ok job for possibly a high school student or someone that doesn't have many bills to pay unless their in a management position."
bad,"Clock in and begin to count the register your going too be on for the day. Your on register until told to either pack out merchandise or recover an area, Any task that has been given to you. I learned about keeping tabs on money when cashed out and the importance of having a clean and friendly store. My co workers had character in their own. The hardest part of the job was not having a break and wanting to finish a task but not being able to because your the only person on the register. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out."
bad,Turn over rate for employees are extremely high can never keep good people because of pay
bad,Productive and fun workplace. Management was great. NO AC OR HEAT and not enough equipmet.
bad,I will have to work as a cashier and deal with different customers.
bad,"There's highs and lows with working with and serving the public,but overall i love helping others and mingling with different people.I learned that you are there to do a job and you have to be able to withstand stress and still complete the task at hand.I've been there the longest out of my co-workers and management but you have to respect your authority figures and push on."
bad,It was horrible. Management was neglectful. There was hardly any training.
bad,The hours are long and the store is fast paced. There are a lot of objectives to execute in a short period of time.
bad,Upper management does not care about you. Work/life balance is non existent
bad,"Hard backbreaking work, for little pay. Lots of ooverstocked items, and Big truck deliveries of unnecessary things"
bad,"I do not wish to speak ill of others, however; as a Cashier, all was great, but once becoming a Store Manager in a fast rate of time that I strived for, I realized that being given 135 hours per week to disperse between 4 employees and myself, when our store operated on 92 hours per week was not conducive to getting the job completed. Plus, they did not provide me with training from assistant manager position to Store manager position, since they were in a pinch, which made learning as I went from asking other managers time consuming and taking away from my store's needs. No recognition for work put in averaging 75 hours per work, was not appreciated. Not to mention that they are selling out 370 stores do not stability here."
bad,great place to work when you are able to adapt to different surroundings.
bad,"not much nice to say felt like i was policing everyone."
bad,The best thing about working here was learning the ins and outs of running a company. My co- workers were great and fun to work with as well as dependable and anxious to learn and work.
bad,I woul;dnt recommend this company to people who needs a steady job.
bad,"As Family Dollar being my first job it was not the worst job, However it was not the best. Dealing with rude customers and unprofessional employees and managers was not what I had in mind. working here helped me develop tough skin and deal with all types of people day in and day out. I am not a hard person to get along with and can accept all types of people with different personalities. I also had good days where I will meet kind people and I did enjoy providing customer service and satisfying the customers."
bad,"·         Accountable for selling products and providing excellent customer service to consumers on the floor."
bad,Enjoyed meeting and helping people with all aspects of my company
bad,I worked for a Christmas season. overall it was OK job for the Holidays
bad,Not enough hours for employee. Management don't know what they are doing.
bad,"Company was more important than my life to district managers. They had unrealistic expectations with inclement weather. made me choose between college and career, Overtime never paid."
bad,"very bad management, rude customers, poor pay. but it paid the bills"
bad,"Never enough people there to work so I had to do it all. Open the store,go to the bank, run the register, do store order."
bad,This job is mainly for college or high school students. Can't make a living working here at family dollar.
bad,"pulling orders for stores. "
bad,I did not enjoy working here at all....I feel that management can be improved in this particular store.
bad,"Lots of running around "
bad,"a typical day at family dollar would consist of loading and unloading boxes, stocking shelves throughout the day cleaning store, making bank deposits, pricing down merchandise daily."
bad,"Assisting customers with product selection."
bad,you spend open to close almost everyday with very little help definately a company who is 10 years behind the times
bad,"trainer, ordering store products, putting together pay roll, making schedules, hiring and firing."
bad,"Store manager would monopolize the schedule to benefit her personal life. She would barely do any work, will not help unload truck, or even stock the store. However she would make personal calls, bring in friends as assistant managers and not enforce any policies or procedures unless if it benefited her."
bad,Really looking for employment that is closer to my home. Family Dollar I do not believe is an acceptable place to be employed.
bad,Treated me different then the other workers.  Singled me out.
bad,"typical day full of tasks and things to do, i manage my team well just feel the company could better assist its employees"
bad,"I don't have good ratings for this company because the location i work at has a lot of  theft from with inside the company, and from customers. i also haven't had a raise and i have been working there for two years, they base there raises off of how high the shrink is which at my location is extremely high. I say its a good place to work for someone who is going to college with no kids, like me. Its a pretty easy job, just a lot of crazy customers."
bad,"My day (or evening) usually begins with counting my cash drawer & completing a count of the cigarettes. Next my duties involve cleaning cash register tops, making sure there's an adequate of supply of bags at each register, and cleaning entry & exit doors. Then, I assist other co-workers with stocking various departments. I meet a lot of interesting and caring people there. I have a good working relationship with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is working with the fear of being robbed day to day. But, I've learned to show each customer the same respect and good customer service regardless of the customers' attitude or behavior."
bad,"Family Dollar is a place to work. Home Office is in Charlotte, N.C."
bad,"Make sure dollars are cleaned and mates a sweep. Finish what was not the previous work day. I learned how to check in vendors, file store reports etc.. My manager was very compassinate, understandable etc. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck."
bad,Helped district manager clean and get store up and running at company standards.
bad,being a manager at family doolars has it up and downs love the people i work with
bad,"Typical day at work involved cashiering, stocking, helping customers, and organizing store funds. Being my first job, I learned all of my retail related skills here. The quality of management varies, with managers being relocated and switched more often than necessary. Several of my managers were great, while others lacked the skills and motivation to perform their duties properly."
bad,"Family dollar is a great place to work if you are just getting out of high school or are attending school for a better skill, or training."
bad,My manager was awesome. The only bad thing was that we had to do literally everything and there wasn't anytime for breaks. I was really under paid for what i had to do and corporate could careless. And if your shrink was high it was not that the customers stole things it was that the employees were the ones stealing because according to corporate the customers never steal anything. Pretty much this company sucks to work for unless you have a good boss or you are running your own store but other than that you will get paid minimum wage and that is it
bad,I have been able to use my skills I have learned from my previous managers. Its just very difficult to have a Store Manager who is still very unsure how to do the job. I do love that its a steady pace job. It was very easy to learn the procedures of the company.
bad,Great customer and employees. i learnerd to manage a store as well satify a customer needs.the things i enjoy must about my job is making sure that my customer got a good customer services and able to leave with a smile and the products they wanted
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of unloading and inbound freight to the shelves of the store and deliver great customer service. In the store, I learned how to follow safety guidelines and how to perform the many task at hand that were required. There was new management every month and a half. While Working there in July of 2012 from January 2013 there was a total of Four Store managers during that period of time. My fellow co workers were very positive to be around and very positive. The hardest part of my job was to do three things at once (unloading freight off of truck into the store, loading the shelves and ringing up customers merchandise). The most enjoyable part of the job was being around some of the positive people that I was surrounded by."
bad,A Typical Day Would Be Always Catching Up On Something
bad,"Do not work for family dollar if you have a choice. the pay is poor, the staff is awful and the hours are inconvenient."
bad,first ill clock in and the ill go and countdown my register ti make sure its right. i also learned how to do some paper work .the co workers was very nice and love team work. the hardest part was dealing with rude customers.the most enjoyable part was getting to know your customers.
bad,"A typical day depends on your position but even the lowest level of employees work just as hard,if not harder,than the managers. Everyone is required to be able to run the register,put out stock,do schematics,inventory,cleaning up the store. The hardest part is bad managers who care nothing about the other employees,the ones who work way too hard for what little money they make. The most enjoyable part is the customers and getting to help them with all their needs. Seeing the customers smile and say thank you for your help is what makes your job worth coming to,because if it wasnt for them,none of us would have a job."
bad,"I felt like they played with my emotions. I was looking for a job for so long and i prayed for a job and it finally came along...well when i got to the job site..the place was empty...found out they were only needing people to help build the inside of family dollar from 8am to 5pm...sometimes 7am to 5pm..no off days...i wasnt okay with it but i still went ahead and completed the job even though MANY people quit the first day..iam 125Lbs and 5'5 unloading trucks with no problem like iam 200+ Lbs..so i thought i was doing great...wrong!!... When the store was done they let me and alot others go. So now im back to square one. Thanks Family Dollar you are awesome! (and im sorry if i sound like a person thats complaining and thats not my intentions, im just being honest)"
bad,A typical work day is putting up stock and working with costumers. I have learned how to do count so we know what is needed in the store and how to put up stock. I am really not sure what to write about management because there are so many and each one has a different perspective on how they would like the store conducted. I am a people person and sometimes I feel they do not want you to be that. I have felt like management would like you to get customers in and out. Working with the co-workers can be a challenge because I feel like they are there just for the check. I think the hardest part of the job is trying to get the other works to be proud of what they are doing and respect the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting a lot of different people.
bad,"A typical day at family dollar consisted of working for a boss who hired mostly her friends and dumped her work load onto me. The management style my boss differed from my own that I valued my employees and didn't belittle them. I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers as they each had different approaches to the job and their tasks. The hardest part of the job would have to have been unloading the trucks each week as family dollar process is different from any other company I have worked for. The freight goes directly from truck to the sales floor with out carts and gets in the way of customers, the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they needed and giving them ideas they hadn't thought about."
bad,"A typical day at my job is never the same. I think I am well liked by most all our customers, I like to joke around with the ones that have a happy disposition, most others you have to go by a day to day personality. My co-workes like me because I am very dependable and easy to get along with. I do not have a difficult job, I can laugh and have fun there and I like that."
bad,"A great day would include stocking merchandise,having a great time helping out others and greeting them at the entrance. Was a great job where i learned more experience with people, and with a cash register.Had amazing coworkers who were always helpful when i called for their help in question to a merchandise from the store. The hardest part was when customers argued with me,but i learned that the customer is always right.The most enjoyale part of the job was receiving compliments from customers because of my great service and patience."
bad,"Unloaded trucks , stocking , cashier, in avery fast pace enviroment ."
bad,"A day at work there was long, from 6 am till 10 pm. Came in and opened store duties such as payroll, putting money in tills, making sure hours are correct. Customer service, stocking shelfs, training and what ever it takes to make the store profit."
bad,A typical day at work was going in and checking out customers follow the stealing customers around fixing the clothes and shelves. I learned how to close the store. I didn't do management. I really loved my co workers. Nothing hard about the job. The job was ok
bad,This was my first job ever so I learned a lot with beginning the working world. This job showed me what to do and what not to do when I was employed. Very helpful during my time there because I carried all the skills that I learned to my new jobs and also to college.
bad,was the worst experience of my life. A good day was when I didn't have to work with the store manager. I had worked retail before so I really didn't learn anything new.
bad,"A typical day of work consist of running the register and stocking the cash wrap area. As well as making sure the cash wrap area is neat and well oraganized. At the end of the day all merchandise must be pulled to the front and placed in its correct home on the sales floor for business the next day. The hardest and easiest part of the day is dealing with diffrent types of people with even diffrent personalities. Some people are simply a joy to see as soon as they hit the door others seem like they only come to ruin your day. Believe it or not its the same with co workers some will naturally click with you others its best to remember its business nothing personal and continue to do your job and remain professional. Managment taught me the importance of being on time, no job is more important than others because everyones jobs keeps the business running as a whole. Managment also taught me how to be professional and remain calm cool and collect in stressful situations."
bad,"day at work was stressful,didnt learn anything,disrespectful,co-worker where nice,hardest part of the job was clearing stock room while I had slow employee,the most enjoyable part was the customers."
bad,I started out as a Repack area manager for one year on 2nd shift. Then became the 1st shift Shipping area manager for seven years. Then I became the 1st shift Receiving area manger for three years. Then I went back to the shipping department and was being crossed trained in the bulk department.
bad,It's a job. i just take it for worth its worth. Minimum wage but at least you get paid every week.
bad,"they only hired one cashier per shift, so the store stayed crowded and long lines. the cashier is under alot of stress every work shfit."
bad,Family Dollar Distrubution Center was a place were I stocked products on convater belts to be shipped to companys. The coworkers were friendly and the job was descent.
bad,I would look elsewhere first. The company isn't great to work for  they make your life revolve around their store. If you have small children I would most definitely not apply here
bad,Was not valued as an employee for all the hard work I did and was dismissed and replaced without a bat of an eye.  Corporate world all the way!!   I now see why there is such a turn over in employees!!
bad,"Business was constantly up and down, sometimes I'd only work one day a week.Cash register never worked properly. Manager at that time had a bad attitude. Store was always an unorganized mess.Would never want to work in this place again.The best thing about it is that they, are close to where you live. Overall not a good experience."
bad,"I loved working there I had good training, I did however have a manager who was rude as could be but not towards customers just me. Other than that I can say I did enjoy every minute I worked there."
bad,It's a easy job for the most part but if you don't have a good staff you will always be behind on work & constantly getting nagged at about it as if it's your fault there isn't enough labor to hire help
bad,"There is no balance between family and work life. The Manager employee is required to work over the 50 hour week, and cover for any employee who calls in sick. There is alot of turnover of employees. My opinion is that the managers were all unhappy and stressed to the extreem. Managers are very burned out. The job is not difficult, but you basically give your life up for a salary."
bad,"Great place for part time or for temporary employment to help a person to customer service experience or secondary income source, don't see long term employment opportunities with the company"
bad,Family Dollar is a really great place to work part time. There are a variety of advancement opportunities after being employed for a short while. It's an excellent opportunity for college students.
bad,"Not a good company to work . Employees are over worked and under pay . And too many people stealing and robbing the store , you were always at risk with your life."
bad,"It was pretty lame honestly. Good for teenagers, but the problem is that they want you to work like an adult but be satisfied with pay of some one with not that many life responsibilities."
bad,"a typical day at work running stock waiting on customers  keeping store clean and recovered ,one day a week unloading truck by hand.and caring manager"
bad,Not too happy with company but i still followed rules and did what i had to do .. Management dont appreciate your hard work . not enough pay. Very hot in building .
bad,"A typical day at work was starting off writing the number of trucks, then unloading them one by one. Constantly having to clean up after first shift before me and my coworker could even get to work though. I did learn how to drive the forklifts and work the electric Jacks. Management wasn't the best but better than some of my other jobs so they're ok."
bad,I am rewarded with the opportunity to put my skill set to tremendous use in serving the people of the downtown Suffolk local Family dollar store. It is rewarding to be a part of the proving a place that is close and convenient to those in need to purchase goods without having to travel far and who often time have smaller budgets. Family Dollar offers low pricing and a  variety of goods from groceries to home decor. however the pay can be better and benefits would be nice as well.
bad,"This job has its ups and downs. For example, rush hour, we usually only have me running register or 1 other person as well. They dont approve of sick days. I told them just last week that I was throwing up and wasnt able to make it in and they then told me ""Puking doesn't mean you can't work. If you get sick on the job we can send you home"""
bad,Often work alone. No cameras and theft is prevalent. Often used as a drug drop. We were robbed at gun point and there is no security for employees. Company does not care about that. Never enough help so there’s never the satisfaction of a job well done. Way too much work for a few people to do.
bad,it would get stressful but I actually learned how to deal with the public I would say the hardest part is the public the part I enjoyed the most was doing stock and staying busy
bad,"Working at Family Dollar was such a duplicitous experience. Let's talk Pros. The company works with personal bonds in mind. From customers to coworkers, if you can understand them, they will make your job so much easier. In addition, if your manager is trustworthy, Family Dollar has an open door policy that can help accommodate your job with your personal life at home. A much needed stress relief in today's employment climate."
bad,Ivory tower management style separates reality with expectations of day to day operations. Weekly allotted hours to run store is far below needs to properly maintain corporate expectations.
bad,Being a sales associate I had to do a lot of work sometimes more than the assistant manager and I didn’t think that was worth minimum wage. To what an actual sales associate can do it very limited and that caused a lot of problems when it came to returns or needing to ask a assistant manger to constantly come to the register so that they could do the return was a waste of time. It caused problems because customers would have to wait a while for the assistant manager to arrive and the ones that get backlash are the ones at the cas register. I also got really tired of people always stealing
bad,"Hardest part was working by yourself and/or unloading a truck by yourself."
bad,The store I worked in 5015 In hastings was a wonderful store the manager was awesome and all the employees there got along like a family but the company itself treats employees very unfairly.
bad,"It's a great starter job for a teenager to get their feet wet. However, if you have children the work hours aren't consistent. There aren't  many positions to advance to and the pay isn't good enough for the required work."
bad,Does not value their employees AT ALL. An employee physically assaulted me on camera and ONLY got written up for it! I took it to cooperate and I still haven't gotten a conclusion/justice for my case.
bad,"Family dollar is a very low paying job. Would not recommend to work here , management takes advantage of their employees. Some managers don’t care about the store on how it looks ."
bad,"Family dollars was an okay experience,  the managers get most of the hours but overall it's a nice fun place to work if you dont want to do so much heavy lifting in things like that."
bad,"Without a good team, from cashier to ASM and Store manager,  you'll experience long stressful days on top of fearing for your life after attempting to prevent consistently violent shoplifters from walking out the door with you potential bonus or raise. Upper management expect you to do way more and continue to force you to work with way less. That's not too pressuring but it demoralizes and discourages lower tier employees, especially because they dont get any benefits."
bad,I haven’t been with the company long i had a customer tell me my manager was talking smack about me and saying how she is gonna fire me... isn’t this a form of discrimination I personally feel targeted and disrespected
bad,"The work is easy but the district manager is not appreciative of the work you put in. There are never any positive things said about how hard you work, only negative things you have not done."
bad,"Working here while going full time to university has been unpleasant to say the least. People come and go. Depending on location, managers could come and go as well. The four years working there, i have seen six managers. half of which only lasted a couple months. Nice place to start out but try to move on after about two years or so. Some customers can be morons but others are really nice and friendly. One of thee reasons I stayed this long. Will miss them when am gone."
bad,"Sad to say, Family Dollar doesn’t care about its employees. Whether you consider the lack of security and the fact that they watch their own employees more than external theft... or the fact that instead of promoting from within, they rather hire their friends.... or the fact that they have a mandatory amount of write ups per week that encourages managers to find the smallest issues with their employees and minimizing any moral establishes.... its clear that Family Dollar doesn’t care about the happiness of their employees!"
bad,Had a few problems. May be better Now. The supervisors changed weekly/monthly. At the time. They stole money out the registers. Etc. It felt as the Coworkers ran the place. It was ok when you worked with certain people. No Tips
bad,"Store can be quite profitable with the proper staffing and product."
bad,"I was happy at my first store and content with my job(though there was an aggressive employee who had a problem with me but the problem was handles well. However once i completed my training and moved to my new store it was horrible. My new manager didn't care about anything and didn't tell people when they did things wrong. I would come in for my closing shift and there is a note saying clean back room for delivery tomorrow. No problem. I go to back you can't even walk. i spoke to the morning cashier and they stated that said manager told them to put all the back stock in there, however it was clearly not all back stock and cashier even stated ""Most people work slow on purpose so they don't have to do it all and manager takes care of it."" and once i got there she left all the cleaning up for me to do."
bad,We need more hours to accomplish what needs to be done. They expect to much done in to little time. They are not transparent about what family dollar are closing
bad,Since I left I think the store isn't has well maintained and cleaned looks like a mess and I don't even like walking threw there but some weeks I have to. It is very convenient.
bad,They work you way to much... S's specially if your a tore manager.... streasful they don't know how to treat employees like that should special with how hard they work for them.
bad,"Family Dollar pay is too low, I'm worth more than mininum wage. No other comments.  I no longer work for them. I don't understand why Indeed is asking for this information."
bad,"The particular district I worked in had/has very poor management. The company over all does not know how to operate efficiently, hence why they were bought out by Dollar General."
bad,"It is an okay place to work but it was hard to be able to do things since the hours could vary each week. Also had me working over 40 hours being part time when the ex manager didn’t want to hire another ASM. The people are easy to work with, but the customers are draining and complain too much. Corporate wants too much from their employees even though they don’t care about us."
bad,"how to adaptable to the each situation, customers in addition to being of aware of the daily duties and responsible of the job at a fast pace problem solving."
bad,"This company was very inconsistent, did not care how you felt, you will get written up for calling in sick with a doctor's letter, very bad company to work for"
bad,The time I worked at family dollar I had switched managers 4 times. And everyone that was working there was leaving. They expected me to run after customers if someone tried to steal and that wasn’t in my job description. It was always nasty. The managers did bear minimal while the other associates did most of the work. And I never received a break no matter how long I worked. I would have to sneak in a rest or just buy something from the store when I got hungry.
bad,You were required six days a week and a minimum of 52 hours.  Usually just yourself and a cashier.  This is a good company to get your feet wet and develop your skills for something better.
bad,A typical day of vendors with less payroll and more work.  It can be done if you're well organized and have a good support team to assist you in running your store.
bad,"Not good home/work balance. It's different for different people, so you need to work there yourself to see if it's a good fit for you. I can't give you that."
bad,Neither here or there sometimes just never understand it’s either family dollar or nothing. The company doesn’t follow or understand its workers everything is SALES SALES SALES
bad,"The manager of the location WAS the best thing about the store."
bad,"Worked there for several years. I've seen stealing, fights, public nudity and people using the bathroom on their selfs in the store. Security Guards are scared of the customers. Security Guards are always temporary. The stores are cluttered and the company is steadily adding more and more junk in the stores. Store managers are payed for 48hrs but required to work 52+ hours. When works call in the store manager has to cover the shift even if that means doing open to close. Robberies all the time. District manager concerned with how much did they get. Never is everyone ok."
bad,Very small store hard to keep clean and organized with the amount of freight they would send. The store manager was not trained properly and very  Unprofessional
bad,This is not a job that can pay bills alone. Unless you are in high school living or living with your parents there is no way to pay bill with this job alone.
bad,I worked for family dollar for 6 years. I learned alot about working with people and customer service. i really enjoyed the people i worked with and the customers.
bad,Be prepared to work they say 52 hours a week I never seemed to get under 65 hours per week.  My family suffered from the work schedule and I seem to miss EVERY event they had.
bad,A lot of long nights. It was hot during the summer and cold during the winter. The people I worked with was fun to work around.  The management was not good.
bad,"as a manager i had no life,"
bad,Sometimes managers had to be at the store until noon by themselves. I feel that is very dangerous. I did enjoy working with a couple of the mangers that actually cared about the company.
bad,"Working in retail can be both wonderful and stressful.  I learned the most about the difference between good and bad customer service and the value of hard workers.  I also learned how retail workers are often underappreciated both financially and in work ethic. I did appreciate the skills I gained in reading and implementing schematic resets and merchandising.  "
bad,I only got raise one time other then that my checks could not pay any house bills stocking was very confusing we didn't receive any discounts on anything
bad,"These stores are always a mess and need tremendous work and cleaning, I was pregnant at the time working here , I did not get lunch breaks , I had to stand and eat at my register due to it always being only 2/3 workers for each shift , the manger did not work to my hours and did not pay me for a full days work when I first started"
bad,Minimum wage for cashiers and floor Associates. Store managers must work 6 days a week and you work an average of 50 to 80 hours a week. Leaves no time for any quality of life
bad,"I have been working for Family Dollar for years and I liked it better before they were bought out by Dollar Tree. I will b the first to admit the turnover rate is but it is much higher now that Dollar Tree has taken over. I was a Store Manager and you are required work a MINIMUM of 52 BUUUTT that is not always the case. When I first became a store manager I was pregnant and work 60-75 hours a week because I ha a store that was in bad shape so I had to work some overnights to get it in order. We used to get paid weekly but now DT owns the company we get paid biweekly. Which I think is ridiculous especially for cashiers who make $8-9/hr and only get 10-20/week. The crazy part is they want you to have an open schedule and be available but who lives off of 15 hours a week. There are some managers whom are working 70-110 hours per week because of staffing and high turn over. The benefits are ok which is an upside. But they expect you to get work done when you are the only one in the store by yourself for hours at a time, and running back and fun to the register to check out customers There are not enough payroll hours given to stores in order to get things the company want done but yet they want you to be Houdini and make magic come out of your hat. They also took away travel time, which was a good incentive when you have to go work at other stores that are not your store. You get mileage for traveling to other stores (.38/mile). There is no discount, you pay the price everyone else pays. Although you get Christmas gift card at the end of the year and the amount is based on how long"
bad,"My store manager was horrible. The customers even hated when she worked. After my assistant manager quit I should have been offered the position, but instead she hires an outside individual and does not talk to me first about it, so I quit. A typical day at work is running the cash register stocking shelves cleaning the store greeting customers upselling products unloading freight setting modular. The hardest part of the job was doing so much for little pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that I interacted with."
bad,"Employment there is for some and not for some. I would not consider there a place to build a career. They do not respect work/ life balance. It's really hard when they make your work over an hour from where you live 6 days a week when there are locations you can be placed at just minutes from where you live. There benefits are poor both in 401k as well as health. There is no culture of respect, only getting work done as they want it, no matter if it is at cost to your family, your mode of transportation, or yourself. Their method and standard of operations have never been updated to stay competitive with the growing and evolving retail industry. Which in return, has already gotten them bought out not long ago and they still continue to operate the same way. You can reach out to management, but expect to be ignored. The hardest part of the job is realistic expectations and lack of communication. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers and your coworkers.   What I have learned through this process is nothing is as it seems and even though advancement and a career is promised,  research the sense of longevity from a career perspective before taking one's word for it no matter how high up their position is in the company. Do your own research."
bad,"I basically enjoyed my position"
bad,"Expects busy stores to run on skeleton crews, to get one employee to do the job of two. Often only one person during the daytime working alone, sometimes over seven hours, with no relief to take a break. If air goes out, you can expect them to drag their feet and let you swelter for a week or more. Will hire you as part-time, give you full-time hours, and avoid providing benefits. Quick to terminate with no warning. Culture of distrust and disregard towards employees,"
bad,Family Dollar is a hard place to work. The work is very physical and you are restrained with budget and having enough people to run a store. It was a fast and challenging place to work.
bad,"I would go in count safe, and till to make sure everything was correct."
bad,I open the store at 7 am. Count the drawers to see if everything balances out. Then do the paper work to see if the store is over or short on the deposit. Review everyone declares and signed off on there declares.  Closing shift I make sure the store is recovered such as everything is pulled forward. And to make sure the store looks appealing for the morning shift to come. And when the store is closing I make sure everyone is out except my cashiers. And I begin to count our store deposit making sure we have enough money in the more for the next day. And I seal it out to gardaworld to pick in the AM.
bad,"It always depends on your top manager, but their behavior aside it was a fun store. Most of the cashiers were fun and the routine of it all was easy to grasp."
bad,"Working at family dollar, you are put in a position where your store manager isn’t prepared to run a store, hasn’t been trained correctly and doesn’t follow things by the book."
bad,"The company prefers to promote within but that process is based on if your manager or district manager likes you. Individuals are not promoted based on merit. Training managers are not training individuals to be to competent free thinkers they are training them to put up stock. Most individuals complete training and can not create schedules or have a basic understanding of company policy. I have had five store managers and and only two could create a schedule, maintain the store, or had customer service skills."
bad,"The manager was rude, she robbed our Co workers and me for our hours. The manager also had us worker there and she knew we had rats eating some of the food and we were complaining but when we started complaining she made us sign the paper and told us not to read it"
bad,Not a good work environment. Shifting Management that makes it hard to advance.They move managers around with no previous experience to different Departments and expect them to tell you how to do your job.
bad,Stressful because I work with few employees. Little payroll.
bad,Paid way to little for the low amount of hours you are given. Makes it hard to feed yourself. They either need to up the pay or allow you to work more.
bad,"This job is fast paced. It can be very stressful and demanding  depending on what store you work at. Typical work week consist of 6 days on, 1 day off. Management averages 55-60 hours per week. Very hard to have a home/ work life balance if you have kids. This is not for everyone. Management pay is decent. Wish they would pay more considering what you have to sacrifice to work there"
bad,There was a lot going on a lot of favoritism playing with people's hours pay wasn't really enough lack of communication some people work harder than others I needed a better opportunity I was trying really hard to get management but didn't happen unfortunately it didn't happen
bad,Work was easy and organizing is something i am excellent at. My manager was easy to get along with and fair. Pay was below average and security was nonexistent.
bad,Every day was a new challenge. Ive learned so much and ive met some great people along the way. It is an easy going job that takes patience. knowing how to communicate is big to me in  the sale associate department.
bad,I absolutely loved working here. i enjoyed the customers and the pace of the job immensely. Unfortunately upper management was very ungrateful for the hard work we were all doing. The stores are very understaffed with extremely high expectations of what needs to be accomplished. Scheduling was a mess the schedule was never consistent and usually didn't come out till the day of. It should have come out a week in advance. i have two small children and in order to get them appointments and things scheduled was very hard to do. Some co-workers were favored when it came to the schedule and hours allowed. I was yelled at by the other assistant manager which i felt was very  unprofessional and threatening. That is unfortunately why i decided to get done working there..
bad,"I’ve made a lot of connections with a lot of great people because of this job. Family dollar to start off in the career field was a nice stepping stone, but there were no benefits what so ever, not too many hours to share with too much work to do to be getting payed at 11.25$."
bad,Not professional work environment. No breaks. Biased work experience. Appearance discrimination lack of leadership and manager support unprofessional management
bad,It wasn't what I though it was as far as the business.I enjoyed my job by helping servicing the customers.The management is why I left other employees weren't doing their job and nothing was done about it and I had to pick up their slack.
bad,The theft rate was sickening. Lost prevention ignored any opportunity to minimize theft and assure employee safety. Some of the employees and previous managers were great...but when the store manager left everything went downhill.
bad,"This is a great company however the rules and regulations are dumb  and so unrealistic . They expect their workers too slave themselves into making sure the store is up and running , making sure everything is clean, assisting customers and putting out stock on the shelves (1400 peices or more) witching 24hours, YES I SAID 24hours the truck had too be done or the district manager worker up the somtore manager. It was said all they care about is the product and not the people who help out the product out or anything ."
bad,"iv'e worked in a lot of stores and i can say, no 2 stores are the same, because some managers enforce tidy recovery, some don't, so it can be between a lot of work or very little work but the customers are always the same. you'll have a high volume of people and not that much help"
bad,I left FDS for multiple reasons but primarily because I was flirting with the possibility of retiring.  I have since decided to put my foot back in the work force.
bad,Family Dollar offers great compensation for all employees. Management team is very supportive. They offer 401k .  All team members are very friendly and caring.
bad,Mucho trabajo pork uno tiene que esta pendiente en todo lo que pasa en la tienda y en la rejistradora y poner la mercancia.
bad,"I was hired as the Soft Lines Coordinator for 24 of the Family Dollar Stores located in the Cleveland, Ohio area.  My duties required me to check and price tag all the soft line merchandise.  Unpack new merchandise and bring to and display on the sales floor..  Verify sale items, tag and price the sale items.  Soft lines were generally in great disarray, requiring sorting and price tagging.  The work was often tedious and physical but I enjoyed the accomplishment of the completed results."
bad,For my position Store manager you are very much over worked and under paid. It is mandatory to work 52 hrs minimum a week. Ridiculous task to completion time ratio. Always short staffed. Poor management communication. No one really puts in any effort to work as a team which makes it ten times harder to keep your store clean stocked and clutter free.
bad,I can't speak for other family dollar stores but where I worked was extremely unprofessional the manager stole money hired all her family members and the store went downhill.
bad,"Absolutely the worst company that I've worked for. I wouldn't work again for them if my life depended on it. The entire company and how they retail needs to be changed and restructured, especially the upper management. They should try hiring experienced game changer from better off retail forms to come in and train them"
bad,"Family Dollar is one of the most difficult and challenging companies to work for'"
bad,Store managers have to work many hours with minimal help.. most stores are in poor areas with no security. Much is expected with little to no help or assistance
bad,"I enjoyed helping my customers.  Fd did a lot of resets which was inconvenient for the customers.I feel like they should hire a crew to do the resets while the stores are closed.  Pay was too little for the work you do especially for managers.  They cut labor continuously, so the manager has to pick up the slack.  My typical work week could be from 65-90 hours depending on the season."
bad,"I was hired and told I'd work 48-53 hrs a week. Ended up I was working 65-75 hrs. "
bad,"To task oriented Managers have low payroll and high expectations."
bad,Overall not too much of a stressful job. I have built a stronger character for myself when it comes to working with the public. I would say my customer service skills go above and beyond expectations.
bad,"free insurance to hourly , managers pay for insurance , very blue culture, no clear policy manual to address team members, it is all based on individual case by case no consistent policies, turn over is very high due to competition with oil field, causes attendance issues"
bad,It is hard to work for this company. Too much is never enough. Upper management is always demanding more. Upper management is only concerned about making their bonuses. They treat their employees with little regard.
bad,"A typical day at work was making sure cash drawers, safe and deposit were correct. Management was wonderful, I loved working with my employees wonderful group. the job was not hard at all ."
bad,fast paced non temp controlled enviroment. Needed to learn job a a rapid pace as expected to meet protocols very quickly. Would not recommed to someone in poor health condition
bad,"Budget hours make this job very stressful for Store Managers. End up working 80 hours a week while trying to run the store. 200 budget hours, per week (if you are lucky) is not enough hours to have 2 employees in the store at a time, which is truly needed, when huge truck needs unloaded, stocked to shelf, schematics, proper customer interaction, theft and  more."
bad,There's going to be rude customers no matter where you go. This particular area there was a lot theft. and it was always hot in there. Usually it was just me on the register except it there was a really long line.
bad,"Poor benefits, not enough hours, and job security is pretty much non existent.  The management varies store to store.  Some have good managers, others don't.  On the plus side, your scheduling is as flexible as you want to make it."
bad,"Come to work and stock shelves, manage inventory, and run a cash register. Store manager was very kind and trusting of my decisions and discretion. Co-workers became like family."
bad,"I been working there for 1year and half and is always something. Shoplifting all day, everyday. People come to the store to steal, they doesnt respect about policies or rules in the store. If i kick somebody out the store they threat you, punch you, fight you and big bosses dont care about that. They keep hiring people that steals company money, people with bad backgrounds and i dont know how they pass. Insecure place to work, if you want to go home everynight for your family."
bad,This company does not look out for the health and prosperity of their employees nor their customer. There is no family in this company's motto. Family Dollar doesn't pay their employees enough money for the amount of time and work required.
bad,"It is a fast company, flexible schedule depending on the manager and certain situations such as school etc..., low wage for the amount of time, dedication a good employee puts in, you do learn a lot because it's constantly changing. There is no balance between work and life. Days include working freight, dealing with customers and organizing the store. The hardest part is finding good, honest, hard working people and treating them right."
bad,"The overall job wasn't bad. The store manager was a thief and stole money from petty cash but fudged the books to make it appear to be missing from night shift deposits. He accused all employees of stealing everything from a candy bar to electronics. Out of 5 employees, 4 walked out in midshift."
bad,Start at 5 or 6am and doesn't end  until everything is done. Minimum hours of manpower with means long hours for you. Work culture is determined by manager.
bad,"The boss needs to stop bringing his drama from private life to work. The management is a mess. People fire right and left, they do not last more the two months."
bad,This job is a good stepping stone into the retail world.They offer minimal compensation and its hard to advance once you reach a certain level.Although it is a good experience to have it teaches you the fundamentals of retail and management.
bad,"Its was o working there but it can sometimes be a unfair work place when everyone knows everyone outside of work, that would really be the only reason i stop working there i felt treated unfairly and different."
bad,"The work environment was great because of the customers "
bad,Working at Family Dollar is just what you'd expect when in a retail customer facing position. The pay is minimum wage and the labor is average unless you have to unload truck. There typically is no pathway for advancement beyond the initial position applied for. The customers you serve is what really makes the job worth it.
bad,"On a typical day, you stock the shelves with merchandise, cash out customers at the register, answer customer questions, and one day a week you check expiration dates of certain products."
bad,"i was the assistant store manager at family dollar loved that i knew how to do everything, but truckday was working sometimes 7am to 10.15pm with only one break pay is .50 cents more than cashiers . They dont pay extra for holidays no employee discount work saturday and sunday all day and also no security cameras working so theft is high then they blame employees"
bad,I would typically grab my drawer and count it to make sure it was accurate from the shift before me. Then I would start waiting on customers. I really enjoyed my customers I met some interesting people.
bad,Well to start off management was barley existent. Only got around 15 hours a week expected to do unreasonable tasks in a short amount of time. Constantly yelled at by General manager and assistant manager. No employee discounts. No benifits. The only thing that made the place bearable was the customers.
bad,always be prepared to learn and complete all and any tasks in need of completion. stay positive and friendly. have seen high and low points in company like lack of communication and falsification. keep documentation of all actions.
bad,"Another good seasonal job to have. The store I was at needed a lot of help, was short staff always, managers coming and going, no real constant leadership."
bad,"higher management does not know what they are doing. Everything changes from day to day and with no explanation. i would not recommend working for this company. you are asked to work on your lunch breaks even though your clocked out, so they ask you to work for free even though that is against company policy. the employees are great people they make being there bearable."
bad,"If you like to work and stay busy, this is the job for you. You unload a truck, you run the register, you put the food and clothes up, you clean up after visitors and co-workers. Safety is a major concern."
bad,Stock investor  maintain cleanliness  customer service  and management insured that employees are doing their jobs and putting things where they are supposed to and handling customers
bad,Not sure how to comment on this place after dedicating hard work for a really long time then to have our jobs taken away. They do work with you to juggle family life with work life.
bad,"I would never recommend working for this company"
bad,No comment ...poor management nepotism work for pennies no 90 day evaluation no incentive to grow lots of sacrifices for little pay
bad,This review will not matter. Family dollar is not family oriented and does not care about any private matters. The hardest part of the job was working with people who were not team players
bad,"It was easy to get used to, didn't get too busy but there was enough business to keep you occupied. Management wasn't terrible and it was easy to get along with co-workers. Though no matter how much you cleaned, the store always looked dirty and disorganized."
bad,i recommend this job for kids that are in high school. you have to fight for hours. under paid with too many resposibilties
bad,"Enjoyed working for the company and the challenges my position brought. Advanced quickly with the company. Opening and closing procedures. Ordering, inventory, deposits daily Store Manager procedures and tasks."
bad,"The particular store I worked at was a toxic environment relative to other employees. There was no team work or support. Training seemed to be inconvenient to assistant managers and I felt like I was a burden. Rarely saw the manager of the store but was always left notes on performance. "
bad,I was fired for doing what the General Manager had told me concerning the front counter. Very unprofessional place to work.
bad,Family Dollar is great to start but once you start as a managerment they put way to much stress and take to much yall family time. The stores are in the bad neighborhoods and should've be open until 10
bad,"A typical day as an assistant manager was rough. Because of the stress and lack of competitive pay as an assistant manager you may end up running the cash register, putting up stock and cleaning.  In my opinion I feel like the store was more concerned about employee theft than they were concerned about employee safety."
bad,The hours they expect managers to stay in stores are in human barely any payroll to have any help. So that means the manager is basically stuck there all day every day with no re-guard to there personal lives and the amount of street is unbelievable.
bad,"Cashing out customers, stocking the store and unloading trucks at least once a week. The hardest part of the job is the manner in which you unload the trucks. The hardest part of the job is keeping a clean and well stocked store with the budget payroll that is given"
bad,managers have to work to many days in hour not enough time  for your family not enough security some of the stores are unsafe some store you have to work by your self until 1pm are later not good for females the company has really change
bad,The safe was at the front of the store and I once got robbed and they told me I had to stay there with no security afterwards.
bad,"This region has a lot of favoritism and too much gets ignored as to why work is not getting done. Management is horrible and payroll is even worse. Good for a quick paycheck every week, but not worth the stress that it brings from the managers not doing their own job. They cannot keep employees and issues would be solved if someone other than the district manager watched the cameras and saw what little got done by the store manager."
bad,"Management and corporate lack compassion for their employees and what happens in their personal life. High employee turnover rate, five a month average. Overall not the most pleasant place to work. However, I did acquire nerves of steel to deal with customers."
bad,Its A job if you just want to be a cashier. i like i like its okay  i like i like its okay. the manager there was not good they was to busy thinking someone was going to take there job. Other than that its a good place to be a cashier.
bad,"I cleaned, helped customers, stocked shelves, cashier, and any other needs for the store. Easy to move up because people quit very frequently because the managers are given ridiculous tasks to complete and they constantly contradict what they say."
bad,Its a cool job but the location and environment it a little hostile. Its right in the middle of caos. I only stay because I love my customers and coworkerss
bad,"As a store manager, you are required to work a minimum of 52 hours to be salary, however, deeming themselves task driven, more often than not, you had to work anywhere between 60 to 75 hours depending on the week to accurately run the store. Upper management visited every so often and when they did, little was said in well regard. The benefits are comparable and the pay is okay for store managers and above. The hardest part of the job was the constant lack of support. The best part was meeting people and getting to know the ""regular"" customers."
bad,The company had no feelings for the employees. Safety was not a factor. Put stores in high crime areas and when robberies occurs all employees get is a phone call and then told that is normal and we call you in a week.
bad,My time at Family Dollar was good only because of the customers and my staff other than that I wouldn't go back. Because there is to much work and not enough people for the load.
bad,The management at my particular store was horrible. They were very disorganized and unprofessional. A lot of people quit/get fired within the first month.
bad,"I have decent weekly pay, but my co-workers can be rude to me and to the customers.  Employees don't like to clean-up the store.  The management is more concerned about themselves than about their employees and the work environment."
bad,"This is a decent company to work for but the only competitive wages are paid to store managers if you fight for it..Health benefits are lacking and upper management is unstable and inconsistent. They try to hold you accountable for things you have no control over. They expect you to work 6 days a week, require you to work a min of 52 hours a week and only pay you for 48, you will end up working at least 60 to 75 hours a week to meet goals due to shrunken payroll.. Typical of a corporate run company but doesn't take ownership of defaults..If you have no home life and are willing to put in the hours you can make a decent living working here..."
bad,"every store is different, has lots of turn overs so moving up is always a thing. "
bad,"There is no team work once you go into upper management.  The benfits are great.  The work life balance is good.  Alot of long hours, but the hardwork pays off sometime."
bad,"I enjoy managing employees and work projects.  There is nothing hard about my position, however, I am looking to change my work environment."
bad,"Stores are often awry, management tends to take personal matters out in the work space or on hours given. They also demand alot, asking for thing not in the job description, and are often reluctant to give extra hours unless absolutely necessary."
bad,"Work day was very bland. Upper management did not trust the employees, they held interrogations and the pay was terrible.. Did not feel safe. Store was broken into on a number of occasions."
bad,Store manager of these stores is expected to run the store by themselves for 4 to 6 hours each day. Manager's responsible to control shrink by stopping shoplifters while filling shelves and cashing out customers all at the same time.
bad,The management was very rude and didn't treat employees with respect. Co-workers were great and worked well as a team. Working for this company is good for a needing a job in the meantime but not recommended as a career choice.
bad,"I will never go back to Family Dollar. The District Manager & Some Store Managers were very unorganized & messy. Everyone gossip & slander names if you don't try to be a part of their clique. The Managers, District Manager, & some Assistant Manager's were all acquaintant with each other somehow prior to employment, how ironic! I was overworked, no days off, stayed overnight, gave full commitement & dedication while being lied on, disrespected, & couldn't recieve the pay I was worth vs. the ""ex-husband's grandchild"" & ""secret friend"" who done whatever they want & still recieved pay raises & more. I had to leave before I lost it."
bad,"Ive worked here for a good year and 3 months and i have grown attached with the customers and the regulars that come in but at the same time this place is a no growth zone for anyone who is trying to grow it is a good place to start or to keep yourself going but i wouldn't suggest it to anyone who needs a job with a future.The job is insanely simple but Management is quirked and a lot of credit isn't given when it is due but if you do your job you are fine....For a typical day at work would be Log in,Count your drawer and loan out 100$...after you are loaned go ahead and move the drawer over and the register and now yours and 9/10 times there is Product to be put out and rotated and other misc tasks that need to be done."
bad,"my co-worker/ cashier was very hard worker, good with customer services. The hardest part of my job being by my self for over 8 hours with no cashier due to pay roll, you couldn't do your management duties at times."
bad,"Maybe it was the location, but I've had better jobs.  Sadly, there was A LOT of shop lifting and the cashiers weren't on top of their jobs.  The DM wasn't very helpful at all.  The Store Manager, however, was always there (or a phone call away) to help answer questions and give guidance!"
bad,"Management doesn't work together, DM and ASDM aren't on the same page. they use you until they don't want you anymore."
bad,"Overall my experience with Family Dollar was good. The only problem I had was how unprofessional my manager was. Besides the unprofessional behaviors that went on it was a good job especially for someone straight out of high school like myself. The job was easy, the hardest part for me was keeping a smile on my face when customers disrespected me. I enjoyed meeting new people, I have mad life long friends working for Family Dollar."
bad,The manager was not available to train me. This person put someone who was not in a management position in charge of doing that. There was favoritism and poor scheduling. My co-workers were not very friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers.
bad,"The reason I say a good place if you don't have anybody but yourself is cause they treat you like you don't have a life outside of work like a family, grandkids, kids even tho they are grown and a fiance that works during the week and off only on the weekends. But that is not the place for me to continue working for cause I do have a family, kids, and grandkids and a fiance that is only home on the weekends and don't get to spend time with any of them cause Family Dollar only works me 3 days a week and 2 of them are on the weekends. They treat me like I don't have a life outside of them and I do. It's not just myself if it was it wouldn't matter"
bad,"Most of the co-workers are highly productive and knowledgable. "
bad,"I go in and verify the petty cash. I get a till for backup. I start any merchandising or stocking that i have to do that day. About 4 hours before closing I start my recovery and facing. About an hour before closing, I count the cigarettes and start any paperwork I have to get done after closing. Once we close, I verify the petty cash one more time, count the deposit money, log it in, then we leave."
bad,I hated my job everything about it about because managers wasn't doing their job and i had to step behind them and do it for them without getting paid for it.
bad,"Started as a cashier, and was quickly moved to assistant manager. The customers were the best part of the job. I love retail work."
bad,Days here were very slow. It was easy to get side work completed. I learned how to do deliveries. We had shipments every Monday. My management wasn't the best. I often left hours late because of money handling situations. Only one employee counted all the shifts money and did paperwork. I think the most enjoyable part of this job would have to be my regular customers.
bad,"I enjoyed my employment at Family Dollar. However, the rate of pay was too low, and the hours of work were very limited. My co- workers and I often agreed on needing more hours in hour work schedule."
bad,"Initially hired for a grand opening. Promoted to Store manager within months. No training  from Family Dollar on how to manage a store. Never enough payroll to hire the people you need to cover. As a store manager,   I loved working with people but the store had a high theft rate which left me frustrated."
bad,Only way to make money here is move up. Do not care about people. I was their 8 years. When my new DM started she let me know how upset she was that she had managers making more money than her. Really lady we have been here for years your new. They dont give enough labor for stores. They had me travel to a store out of town. I was working 14 hour days and dm wanted more I was leaving house at 530 am getting home at 1130 pm. when I informed her I could not work these hours that 13 was plenty she got rid of me.
bad,My experience everything was average...  Hardest part on the job was that there was no security and unfortunately there was lots of robberies.  Most enjoyable part was there is lots of beautiful pple in spirit and the customers can be proof of that.
bad,"The hardest part of the  job was pleasing difficult customers, however,I enjoyed servicing my regulars."
bad,"As Customer Service Representative you have to maintain the store clean at all times, cashier, help customers with returns, unload truck weekly, and count all earnings and personally transport earnings to bank in own vehicle."
bad,Its usually just me at the register with a long winding line and my on duty supervisor in the back doing his/her task for the day. The hardest part of the job is not always having help on the register but I deal with it as best as I can. It is very tiring and is taking a toll on my body in the worst way. The most enjoyable part of the job is the regular customers that always come in and check on me. They know I work hard and am always friendly and they usually help me get through the day.
bad,Working here wasn't normal. I was usually the only person that was ready to work every time I showed up to work all my other co workers didn't like to work or put much effort into their work.
bad,"I think Family Dollar as a corporation could do a lot better as far as safety for their customers ,and employees. In a whole I truly believe that there's a lot that they need to do in order to have a better corporation."
bad,"I would never work there again, nor recommend working there for any of my friends. Raises are nothing but a joke, even if you work your tail off."
bad,"heavy labor with freight and six day work week every week.  No payroll for associates, plan on working everything by yourself"
bad,"When you are a store manager, you pretty much have no life. You are expected to work 48-50 hours a week sometimes even more. There is no job work/life balance with this job"
bad,"one of the worst jobs I ever had, the staff treats you like garbage and they do not give consistent hours"
bad,6 DAY work week is not what an experienced manager wants let alone doing 12-16 hr days bcuz you only have 5-6% payroll. grat
bad,If you don't plan on moving anywhere or doing anything with your life this job is perfect. They have a good ole' boy system that hires friends and families over experienced or educated applicants. They are very resistant to change.
bad,"Overworked "
bad,Working at Family Dollar I had extremely slow workdays than steady workdays.  Mostly I worked as a stocker and later was trained to become a Store Manager towards my final weeks of working at Family Dollar.
bad,"I was a Cashier with Family Dollar, which means i was in charge of greeting guests as they entered the store, help them with any questions or concerns they may have. I would also help stock merchandise throughout the store."
bad,When I was there I was either stocking or working register that's about it. When you get promoted it basically to handle money and to be blamed more because your second in command. Especially when   your manager like mine was rarely there. My coworker were decent but just a bunch of older ladies that couldn't doing anything and I was the only male. So I had to do the 53 foot truck on my own most of the time and stock on my own most of the time. The hard part was being expected to finish a truck on my own and stock the store in such little time with being yelled to for not getting the job done. Nothing is enjoyable about working for this company.
bad,working at family dollar was probably one of the most worst job experiences I've ever had to deal with from the management and hours to the stores appearance i was not satisfied
bad,"Its an ok company to work for if its your first job.."
bad,"A typical work day was doing  stock and  checking out customers on a daily basis. My coworkers were nice. care free close in age so we all had a lot in common. The work ethic was minimal on the part of the management which lowered the teams morale and slowed down work on some days.  other than the rats, the job was alright."
bad,"My typical day was making sure customers was satisfied with our service."
bad,"great people "
bad,Family dollar was a fast paced discount store that required lots of hard work. I learned how to handle alot of tasks in a days time. The hardest part about my job there was dealing with very difficult customers. I really enjoyed seeing very satisfied customers and shopping at the store.
bad,Family Dollar Stores was a very diffacult environment to work at.
bad,"A typical day would be to clock in count my drawer and then just start my day. The cliental isn't the best in the world and its not a safe enviornment. The management is actually a delight to work with my co-workers as well. The hardest part of the job would have to be the customers I can deal with them, but there not the best to deal with. The most enjoyable part would also have to be the customers I love interacting will all different types of people."
bad,"Going to work an performing at a all time high, i learned how to work under pressure an at a steady pace. The management of the stores were very poor.all my coworkers worked to pay bills an didnt enjoy what they did. we rarely even had a chance to balanced work and life outside of work. i learned something new everyday i went to work."
bad,was fun at first but now its not as exciting as when i started. only get 30 minute lunch breaks and the schedule is too flexible. im lucky to get 30 hours and its a little unorganized.
bad,"Family dollar can provide stable employment and mediocre benefits at best. You can easily advance in the store facilities, however, you must become an assistant manager to even be granted a raise."
bad,"A typical day of work started with opening the store for the business day and completing paperwork, including cash deposits. Any special tasks for the day would be listed on the company computer system. A few examples of these special duties may include: promotional activities, new ad signage, scheduled meetings, etc... After special tasks are completed, freight was to be set on the shelves and organized. Management is also responsible for ensuring customer safety, store appearance, and loss prevention. Production shrinkage and loss prevention was the two aspects that intrigued me the most. The cashier's I worked with on a daily basis were a joy to work with and were usually cooperative in the tasks assigned to them. Management continuously encouraged me to reach beyond my initial potential. My overall experience at Family Dollar was pleasant. However, unloading product from the freight truck was physically difficult at times."
bad,"Set up new stores when they opened under the impression this was a permanent job. After store set up was done, all of the workers were laid off. Had a great time while working there, just wished it was permanent."
bad,Have been in many situations where i havent felt safe there. Not A great area so delt with many issues of theft and volience
bad,"The work is very routine, hardly ever changes. I've learned to always have a positive attitude at work, no matter what. The management is the worst!!! In less than a year I've been through SEVEN managers! The co-workers are okay to your face, talk about you to others. The hardest part is multitasking, the most enjoyable part, PAY DAY."
bad,"a typical day here was running the cash register,and stocking there was not much to learn here the management was ok considering the type of job my co-workers made the day go by quick and the hardest part of my job was what i was making.sometime it was a fun environment"
bad,I loved working at family dollar because of the customers. My manager was not very professional and they did not treat theyre employees equally.
bad,"employee where great people to work with, but manager had his favortie people. not kool"
bad,The day of family dollar is to work hard and make your customers happy so they would come back.
bad,Family dollar does not believe in having real physical security which makes the company quite vulnerable at times to robberies and extreme shop lifting.
bad,i learned alot about the business. Ienjoyed working with the public.I learned alot about management.
bad,"A typical day at work started with checking out customers, and when there was no one in line, clothes needed possibly needed to be tagged, and maintain a clean checkout area. I learned cash handling experience because employees were responsible counting down their own drawer. Management was very rude and inconsiderate. The hardest part of the job was rarely getting weekends off. The most enjoyable was great co-workers."
bad,"No job security, inventory is always a case for lay-offs. Family dollar expects way too much for the peanuts they pay. They expect multiple positions work to be performed by one person with one hourly wage. You are expected to be a security guard/ policeman *(and be held liable if you're wrong and they're sued), slave drive the underemployed, underpaid, usually part-time employees, full time is 32 hours- and you're expected to squeeze 55 hours of stressful work into it. The stressful environment causes many a health problem, stress induced outbursy, and even broken family {store manager work a mandatory 55 hours w/ a mandatory close and double shift}. Overall, this was the worst job I have ever encounter."
bad,"They trained me well, however, I worked in a rough neighborhood and it made the position very demanding."
bad,"You learn many different aspects of management as well as associate jobs. You are at times the only one in the store for long periods of time. You have to cashier, stock , order, help"
bad,"Job was not difficult, but having all your higher management like District Management not helping or showing support made it a very unhappy work environment. They only cared about having the store opened, not how it was being run or caring about the customer and the employees"
bad,I worked alot by myself i closed alot af was alone. I didnt like the hrs because I was there all day. I had 3 different managers while I was there. But the pay was good
bad,"Boo set schedule. Waitress to be texted by manager in when to come in. Had to text mgr to all to come in. Never got trained or utilized as cashier only a floor person. Not a bad place to work for but as a mature woman, I just needed someon something stable to pay bills. Good fora ring person& as a first job."
bad,"Working at Family Dollar was ok. As a manager, you have to be prepared to do most of the work. You have to be very motivated. You have to get trained in all areas."
bad,"I lost a lot of weight, but that ask too much of you given that you have one job title at the bottom of the ladder pay. Assistant and store mangers push of their job responsibilities onto Assistant managers and cashiers."
bad,This is a good job to have if u have another one to help pay living expenses. It does not pay much or have lots of hours. You can meet lots of people and help customers who don't have much money.
bad,"Job wasn't terrible, but being in shady areas of town with no asset protection made it a little uneasy"
bad,"My team is awesome! No complaints there. But they place these stores in the worst parts of town. The clientele is horrible, and the theft is outrageous. Your life gets threatened on a daily basis. The company really needs security guards. If corporate really cared about their employees and their shrink numbers, they would at least have security."
bad,Working at family Dollar is ok but it depends on your store manager and if there is team work but they never give enough hours a week and alot of the store managers don't like to do there job so it makes it harder for everyone else.
bad,i would stock and maintain shelves and cleanliness of store. management was hard on workers but rewarding to work with because of the thing you learned during the job experience.
bad,"High turnover,  can't keep managers, abusive customers."
bad,"To be honest I loved the manager she was friendly, but I hated working here because I was always criticised for what I did.I loved the fast paced work though and being able to be around people. I loved getting the customers most of all"
bad,"I was very happy working here with my manager. I travelled to other states to save my manager from having to travel."
bad,It's good for getting your foot in the door of management. You can learn a lot although most of the learning will be on the job lessons. Family Dollar can be exhausting and expect to work around the clock.
bad,"As a manager, employees MUST work a minimum of 52 hours a week. I regularly work 60+. Most store seem to work on a minimum crew. Manager alone most days and do 70% of all work in store. Corp controls ALL store hours and no one but store manager goes into overtime. No employee can take vacation from Oct till after New Year..."
bad,I have learned a lot over the years.  Days are very busy.  Culture is lacking and has gotten worse since the acquisition.  Development opportunities are limited.
bad,"Doesn't really work with schedules, have to fight to get time off with pto time. The only thing that was good was the crew I was working with was amazing,"
bad,Family dollar is a great place to work it has it's up and downs just like any other work place but for the most part is was family oriented  and they did work with you
bad,When I started at FD I had a great manager. She moved on and they brought in an uneducated manager who really didn't want the job but took it by default. The DM had her travel to his other stores so often but left the local store in dire straights. Many customers would not shop if certain staff were working. Several customers complained about the store manager (she drank on the job) but the DM did nothing.
bad,"It could be better work place better"
bad,"worst experience ever. I would not recommend anyone to the cedar and university location, the people are very rude and nasty. Very unorganized and messy."
bad,"The company is a billion dollar company and needs to invest more in security for the employees and the pay could be a lot better. Also, the stores are under staffed mostly."
bad,"it a job, thats about it. would be ok if everyone carried their own weight, there is no balance of life when you work there. other people call off all the time and you end up working double shifts"
bad,"The people were good for the most part but the company is terrible. Decent environment most of the time, don't expect good pay or sufficient hours. Meh overall."
bad,very fast pace you had t unload the truck tend to customers as you unloaded truck and still place merchindice on rollers to be taken to the isle to be put away.
bad,"It’s a fun starter job. You get really close with the few you work with but no overtime. Paid holidays for only managers, paid vacation only for managers aswell."
bad,Six day work weeks for Store Mangers. Most buildings are not in good shape and the new stores in the city are understaffed due to tight payroll budget.
bad,"I worked there for my senior year it was good money and good hours for a 18 yr old. I do not recommend this job for anyone that is looking for something full time, there where plenty of times people wanted to transfer because they were not getting any hours. The only bad thing about that is the manager has to approve of you transfering, which sometimes they dont just to do it. Very childish grown women my asst manager always told me this saying ""do as they say not as they do"". Good for short term but a big NO for long term. Manager got away with alot of things and only got by by making her asst managers do most of the work and her cashiers."
bad,run the store 16 hrs a day and never expect to get off on time. pay is ok but not for the salary workers. to many loops to jump if you need something done for your store.
bad,I really enjoyed my job before they start making us work 6 days a week and if one of your employees don't show up you have to stay and some weeks you are working 52 hours and other 80 it makes it really hard if you have a family or doctor appointments. I love my customer and I will truly miss them and the work is good but I am in the store by myself anywhere from 8 hours to 10 hours alone and the same amount of work has to get done no matter what. And even know you have vacation time they make it really hard for you to use it and if you don't you lose it.
bad,"Stores are Robbed and burglarized constantly, assistant managers are worked like slaves while store managers are encouraged to delegate Assistants to do do their work and part time employees do little to nothing to stop theft keep stores clean and some can barely count their drawer so money is often over/short due to hiring individuals who are not trainable or just have no work ethic. A very stressful job for an Assistant Manager because they get the grunt of the work. 75% of Family Dollar store managers are lazy and very unprofessional I was told by a fellow store manager that I was being talked about by my peers , mind you this store manager had her entire staff quit in one week and her store is robbed on a monthly basis. Very Sad and unsatisfying career, the only people who stay with this company are sad to say minorities who cannot find another job."
bad,"Good job to work at with a better environment.Fun hard working people who were really trying to make the store better, good manager to work with who really cared about what went on in the store"
bad,"The work was constant and the advancement opportunities were available, however the environment was very unsafe and the deadlines were not realistic since a large amount of the time there could be only one person on duty. Very large turnover rate."
bad,"It's a great place to work under the right management, this is a completely biased review based on my personal experience with poor management. The work itself is fastpaced, but it's difficult being the only person on cash register all day."
bad,Family Dollar was alright to work in but not an overly fun job.  Corporate tended to micromanage and everything was a crisis.  I spent my day putting out fires not proactively managing.
bad,This would be an okay place to work if management cared more about the place and their employees. Also if they paid you more because the amount of work is required of you isn't worth the pay. You sometimes work 8 or 9 hour shifts and don't get a break unless you stress it. If you don't say anything they wouldn't care if you get a break or not.
bad,"No discounts, or benefits because that’s how this company makes money. Cause they keep everyone but their managerial staff on part time. Low money. Low hours and some family dollars just have The theifs for their employees. Not just the customers steal"
bad,"Overall, I gained the management experience I needed but due to lack of communication between store management and corporate, my term did not extend to the length I thought it would."
bad,"I started as a cashier and in less than 8 months, due to people quitting, I was promoted to assistant manager then store manager. I really liked the job but got very little training on proper procedures. I was always promised by the district manager that I would get the training I needed to do the job correctly but it never happened and the district manager would always come down on me about the stuff I was asking training for. They are a typical corporation that only cares about the bottom line and shareholders not their employees."
bad,"stocking shelves, cleaning and sweeping isles."
bad,"The company was purchased by Dollar Tree so the culture was changing.  Also, the jobs were systematically being sent to the Dollar Tree headquarters in Chesapeake, Va.  The lay-offs are coming."
bad,I enjoyed working with the public. I enjoyed taking on the responsibilities of my Manager. There didn't seem to be much pride taken by other employees and Managers.
bad,i liked my job and doing customer service . but as far as the higher up management it seemed like training never happened with them. my dm could not even run a register
bad,The position I was hired for basically sets you up for failure with the way the production is calculated. You have to hit a certain productivity percentage but they start you out on the hardest floor to meet quota on and you can't be moved until a new employee is hired for that position which only happens when someone leaves that postion. If it takes you to long to be able to keep your productivity level to meet there quota they let you go for lack of productivity so instead of putting the new hires on the simple zones so they can get better to advance they put the experienced seniority workers there so they can get their pay incentives.
bad,My work days were relatively chill.
bad,After a year I feel unsafe in my work place constant theft and no one cares. My corporate management team was here for a visit an no one stopped by the store to see if they where ok
bad,"This is my third job, undoubtedly the best job I've had so far, but it has one major flaw. The store I work at barely has enough payroll for its employees to make enough money to live off of. It has forced me to begin looking for another job because the schedule now has a template that every schedule must follow. At my store, there are two cashiers (including myself), and one week I'm getting 12 hours while the other cashier is getting 16 and then it switches. This template has made it practically impossible to ask for days off. I would love to be able to stay with this company but I'm afraid I won't be able to."
bad,Walking into work I would go clock punch in at the side of the store on a small computer. Then start working without asking any manger what to do because I knew what to do. I always stayed on my feet moving all over the store helping customers if they need and ring people up if they need. Being part of Family Dollar team the co*workers was easy to get a long with and easy to get a task done as a team.
bad,"Family Dollar tries hard to make your work place environment as stressful as possible. They make up regulations that you are intended to do but you have no time to try to complete your tasks because you are so under staffed. On top of all your work duties, if you are in a bad area, you have to constantly be looking out for shop lifters and there isn't anything you can do to stop them. The management is also micro managing."
bad,Sometimes I have to unload the truck by myself which in my case was not bad. But may offend other employees. Lack of communication throughout the team.
bad,Policy and procedures are confusing. Pay is not enough for the work that is being done. Expectations are unrealistic. Turn around rate is  high. Unsafe work conditions for some employees.
bad,"Working with my team was fun but we had so much stolen that it made it stressful. They say don't worry about if someone runs out with merchandise, yet if the theft amount for the year is too high, they fire you. District managers provide no support, mainly because they don't want to. Expect to be over worked, hours cut, short staffed and a high shrink percentage. Hopefully you wont get robbed at gun point like i did."
bad,Don't work with relatives.you don't get that much pay .not enough work hours managers have they're picks when it comes to scheduled hours customers constantly steals so on and so forth.
bad,Everyday was a struggle on keeping employees and ensuring all shifts were covered - not just at my store but throughout the district. Higher Management did little to no help at stores.
bad,I love my team the customers and the company mission but the job is impossible due to lack of leadership and training. Hours are do tight that if someone else in the district goes over hours we all have to cut back
bad,The company has a strict labor law. The company wants the store manager in the location by themselves at least 5 hours throughout the day. I been robbed a min. of 5 times within a month and a half period.
bad,I come in work get a register. Manager give me duties for the day. Customers come in store. Greet with a smile on face. Take funds and state have a great day come again. Go stock and do same things with customers until I'm done working for the day.
bad,Busy and you get rude customers and management sucks a/c never works and nothing is ever organized. Seems like management doesn't care about its employees only on business part of the store.
bad,"Family Dollar is a productive place of business. Working at family dollar teaches responsibility and how to multitask better with people, there money,and with they items and the items you have to watch around you."
bad,they want you to play security guard as a cashier when in real life people go through months even years of training to properly prepare for positions in security occupations in our society and get paid accordingly.  they have no heat in the winter no ac in the summer.
bad,It's ok not enough hours and the new manager came in and ever one left do to the hours and things over work and under paid no breaks u working by your self
bad,"You clock in, count your register. Switch registers with manager. You will start out as a cashier, be prepared with good shoes/insoles because you WILL stand and walk your entire shift (6+hours). No breaks. You learn real quick how things work in the store. Keep yourself busy or you will go crazy. Hardest part of the job is dealing with mad co-workers alongside peeved customers. All while trying to keep yourself calm and not walk out/start yelling back at everyone. Enjoyable part is when there isn't a single person in the store and you can work in peace and read/listen to the store music/look up job postings on your phone."
bad,"This was just filling time.  I took this position at the time to be close to home.  I decided after being there for about 6 months, that I needed to get back into what I normally do.  A lot of work for very little pay and no chance of fulltime or benefits."
bad,"Working there was fun. I started as a cashier and within a month I was a Assistance Manger, With in 3 months I was a Store Manger. If you can find a District Manger that will stand by you."
bad,"I usually work for 4pm-10pm or sometimes 10am-10pm and everyday theres angry customers at me because of what the store provides; Like terrible shopping bags, missing shopping carts etc. Management was pretty terrible in terms of employee rotations and who was hired. The hardest part of the job is waking up in the morning and going to work knowing everyday just somehow gets just a bit worse. The most enjoyable part is getting to go home right before a day off and getting a goodnights sleep."
bad,"Family Dollar was a very unsafe work space, i was robbed at gun point my first day on the job. the other workers would slack of to leave their left over work to others to do. As for management, there was more than likely so mix up or miscommunication. A good day at work was when everyone got their own work done at a good pace."
bad,"I love the job itself, the customers are great and I love how fast paced everything is. You never know what you'll be doing from stocking to a complete reset. However, the management in this company is a joke. You're not coached your talked down to and put down. And it's never to your face. If you do something wrong it's said to every other employee or written in a note book for the whole company to see. You will not get breaks either, if you're in a management position you can count on being in the store for 6-8 hours on your own. There is NEVER more than two people working when there should always be a minimum of 2 at all times. I think there really should be 3 employee's working at all times. The company does like to move you up quickly, but sometimes I feel like that's a huge down fall because you have a lot of people in management that has no clue what they're doing. Full time employee's get less hours than part time."
bad,The store managers do absolutely nothing but sit around on their phones all day and then complain when you do not have everything done. When it's really only one or two people trying to work an entire delivery plus whatever else comes throughout the week. They also do not train well. Watch and read a few things online then you're trained. They do not show you how to use anything or even as an ASM how to do things that you should know to do on a daily basis.
bad,"A typical work day would be at 2, and I would close the store. During the day it was normally always cleaning, restocking, frontfacing all items. I learned that work enviorments can change dictating who is there. I had an interesting workplace culture but since it is a small store there were only a handful of employees. After the Store Manager, Terra, transferred she was replaced with a manager that directly lead to leaving the company. The hardest part of my job was to leave, I love what I did and I enjoyed the pay. The most enjoyable part was the regular (customers)."
bad,"Work was super easy but, district managers were aweful, treating each employee with disrespect, as well as laying hands on employees. Did not enjoy dealing with upper management."
bad,Fun easy really liked it would work there again if I could. Boss really nice. Coustomers nice. Get along with everyone up there. Idk what elese to really say.
bad,"I worked for a short time, and had a good attendance record. They worked me through the holidays, and the hours went down to 6-8 hours a week. Shortly after they would not schedule me for two weeks straight because AutoZone didn't have the schedule ready soon enough, even though it was fine for months."
bad,"Manager does most of the work. Safe is at the front of the store, for any one to see. Many robberies. In safe neighborhood. Unload truck by hand, entire semi truck. The culture was not a good one, as we always felt our job was on the line. They went through management very quickly."
bad,"I enjoyed my job as per what I was hired to do.  Unfortunately the demographics of the store began to wear on me. I had asked to be transferred to a closer location, but nothing was available for the position I held within the company."
bad,"A typical day at work was just like any other cashier job. Ringing people up and smiling a lot. My manager was very cool and sweet. The worse part about the job, was that we got robbed several times."
bad,I liked the people that i worked with just not the store the store was dirty and really needed cleaned up the job was just to hard on my medical condition so i couldnt continue
bad,"opening store "
bad,"This is by far the worst company I have worked for the customers are so rude, they steal daily, and try to get violent with you. If there was ever a place that needed security it would be there."
bad,"I had a nice experience working for the company, I learned a lot of basic life skills there like learning how to deal with different attitudes and personalities.  It's not the kind of job you can live off."
bad,My typical day at work is mostly hectic between cashing out customers and stocking at the same time there's a lot to do. Throughout the time I've worked for family dollar I have learned great customer service and I gained great skills in multitasking. The most enjoyable part of my job I would say is interacting with customers and the hardest part would be to get everything done when the time is really busy. Coworkers are great its like we are all one big family though not by blood.
bad,"A regular day at work is usually I am cashier or doing stock, working on the floor. I've learned a lot while working there like, communication skills, people skills, a little about management and how things should be done , and some organization. Management there is pretty fair friendliness and work is well separated. The co-workers are co-workers. Hardest part of the job I would say is maintaining positive while working with customers. Other than that, I just enjoy being able to have something to do everyday at work."
bad,"You have to be a people person to deal with the different mood changes, I'm still learning any new  methods that I can add to my manager experience I already have, store manager is fair, co-workers carrie different attitudes, it isn't hard at all and I enjoy making people day."
bad,Family dollar was a good stepping stone for teenagers needing to get the experience in the work world I would not recommend this job to my worst enemy pay very low expects to much from employees and did not like to pay for working on holiday's
bad,bagged groceries for people helped load groceries for people that needed help. learned how to arrange flowers and check out people
bad,The environment is good. As long as you do your job. being a manager is nice because you have more responsibility but it is a lot of work and multitasking
bad,"A day typical day is opening the store setting the registers up, stocking helping customers. I learned how to help hundreds  of people on a daily bases and how to do money transactions the hardest day is having to work on most holidays the best day was when you can help and make a customer happy ."
bad,Start facing products on he counter to up keep the store place items in wrong areas put in the correct place. Making sure the store was in tact as far as cleanliness and organized .I would proceed to stock shelves of any item  that needs to refilled.
bad,"My struggle with working for Family Dollar in the ID,Treasure Valley area has been a rough one. I have only been with the company a little under a year, but I have worked in multiple stores as a regular employee and as a sub. In this time I have seen a great deal of unprofessional behavior and high turnover rates. In a local sense, and as a corporation, I have to admit I do not think very highly of Family Dollar and I advice anyone who has an interest in the company to think seriously about their options before applying. Getting hired into Family Dollar was very easy. I was over qualified for the position and showed more professionally than most other applicants. If you are like me, someone who cares about making my job environment a better place, then you may struggle with the lack of discipline shown by members of management in the district. ( I can not speak for other Family Dollar Districts, but this one in particular has a lot of dirty secrets.) I am shocked and horrified at the behaviors I have seen, and the lack of care that upper management takes to correct these issues. I have seen good managers, and absolutely horrible ones. A lot of good employees are lost here. "
bad,"Family Dollar was my first job right out of high school and I began as a cashier. Shortly after almost a year of working there, I was promoted to key holder and then under a year later I was promoted to assistant manager. The advancement is there. My particular location had very rough District Managers that would not give raises based on performance, even if the Store Manager requested it. I enjoyed a lot of the co-workers I had over my 4.5 years there and I very much enjoyed being able to take on management duties. Typical days at this establishment consisted of high foot traffic, especially on the weekends. As long as you can multitask, you'll be just fine. I think the hardest part of the job was having to discipline certain employees due to their high amount of sensitivity and my military mentality. I always ran a tight ship and made sure that everyone under my supervision had tasks to complete. A big con for me was being expected to spend every holiday away from my family."
bad,When working for the stores it is hard for a person to get their work done like cleaning and stocking the store when you are always at a register and still having management argue there is time in the day when knowing there isn't. The coworkers most of them were completely dishonest and cut throat.
bad,Very people oriented. At times it could be fun but every job has its days. Not enough room for advancement in he company. There is a lot of favoritism within certain stores.
bad,Ran a 3.5 million dollar store in `da hood buried with freight everyweek receiving a full truck every Monday  my favorite day of the week kept store neat in a risk class 4 neighborhood  remodel  was planned crew came an after 1 day had store shut down due to structural  issues  company put me in a low volume store it was like mayberry removed all the product 4 trailers worth after 6 months reopened my store and transfered me back set a a brand new store with a new staff worked every day never taking a day off 65+ hrs a week inventoried in Sept  results not favorable  fired me and my whole staff family dollar ironic  ally does  not put there people first their profits  come first without  their people  they have nothing
bad,"Just not enough support in the store. No guard or protection, just simply a lack of security for threatening purposes or situations."
bad,"The work was relatively easy and  they have a decent training program to bring new employees up to speed.  However it would be important to note that co-workers and management is largely reflective of the community the store resides.  A lack of professionalism was the biggest concern, though I am sure not every FD is the same.  Otherwise a great place to pick up some extra hours or work full time while you pursue other goals."
bad,"This is my first job in an environment like this.  When I first started I felt it wasn't a bad place to work, but the longer I'm there the worse it gets.  A lot of the management is not experienced in the positions that they are in.  They make jobs a lot harder then they really are or need to be.  Family Dollar has lost a lot of really good employees because of the things that they do."
bad,I am thankful for receiving a customer service experience. This job is a good way to learn how to multitask. I like this job a lot
bad,"It a good job if you looking for something part time. If you are looking to put your foot in the door, It is a start. It also a place too move up fast pace."
bad,"A typical day was busy "
bad,"The hardest part of the job is the physical work.  I am constantly putting freight away.   The store is always HOT in the summer and FREEZING in the winter.  "
bad,"many hours 52-70 per week"
bad,"Like many jobs, where we still have to remain focus while meeting goals throughout any obstacles. I learned how to conduct myself at an executive level while leading large groups of individuals. The teams always have a positive affect on you as a person and as a manager. The hardest part of the job is working in the public and servicing the public with no security. (unable to promise the team safety in their work place) I enjoy that I can help others in the work field and customers in the retail field."
bad,"To me, working at Family Dollar isn't recommended. The management is faulty. They bring their home problems to work. Asst. Managers constantly call in, making work for lower level people like me hard. Manager Codes are needed constantly to run a register but most of the time, the managers either aren't there, or they ignore you. Also, there's no respect of privacy. I was with one of my family members in a hospital after a family emergency and i had to call in that day, (keep in mind, that was my only call in since I've been employed with Family Dollar). One of the managers called the hospital to see if i was actually there because she didn't believe me. A typical day on the job involves stocking, recovering shelves and daily housekeeping, i have absolutely no problem with that. On other days, i get spitted on, have money thrown at me, get cussed at and even get swung at. All customers are different and i know that but the way the company handles that is what i have a problem with. If you try to stop somebody from stealing and you get written up or get in trouble. One of the managers threw a fellow coworker of mine under the bus and got her fired just so he wouldn't get fired. the hardest part of the job is when the main manager under staffs us on the most busy days. that pretty much happens every week. this might sound like im just trying to bash the company as a whole, but in all seriousness, that's what really happens. I was promised a raise in October 2014, i still haven't gotten it. When i ask about it, i either get ignored or scolded. This job is the reason I don't want"
bad,I have found that with this company you cannot have a family and work balance. My life revolves around this store and when their trucks decide to come in.
bad,Not a company I would recommend for some one seeking long term employment. Physical working conditions are good (clean and well lit).
bad,"Pay was the only thing that kept me there, felt used from the minute was hired and falsely accused of talking about payroll.  New employees hired to helped build store highly insubordinate."
bad,"Working for Family Dollar Distribution is the correlation to legalized plantation work. Unfortunately, hard workers in this facility are not compensated nearly enough as the rest of competitive distribution centers for conglomerate companies like Family Dollar."
bad,"This company expects management to do everything, from stocking shelves to unloading trucks and everything in between. Sales clerks were basically there to man the registers."
bad,"I was a store manager for Family Dollar at several different locations. My salary was high for my age at the time and my inexperience to this position. I had a quick training and was on my own to run my store. As a salaried employee we were required to a minimum of 56 hours per week. Often times in the store alone until at least noon. This made it quiet impossible to complete all the tasks to keep the store running with out working additional hours. This is why I chose to leave my position. It was impossible to juggle the demands of a family, have a life, and work this job."
bad,"a typical day at work was very tiring. always did the same things everyday, dealt with the same stuff, same people stealing. "
bad,"*Poorly staffed"
bad,"Only worked here a short time. Basic tasks, help customers and cashier."
bad,"The company is slowly going down hill. Always two or three steps behind the competition. The manager's philosophy is to ""plan for the best and hope that the worst doesn't come"". Hence, the company gets hit by any delay or issues that arise and spends months trying to recuperate. The company promotes solely based on seniority. The same goes for vacation time, work hours, and raises."
bad,It became a difficult and uncomfortable place to work at because all employees were treated as expendable.  I did learn what it takes to be a manager and how to make executive decisions that affects my team.  The most enjoyable part of my job was doing schematics and participating in the overall recovery and organization of the store.  It made me feel good when customers walked in and saw the difference in the overall appearance of the store.
bad,Not a good company to work for. Corporate level does not care about their emnployees.
bad,"I was the store manager I opened and sometimes closed the store, bank deposits making schedules, payroll, filing papers and organizing vendors. running a store and overseeing 2 assistant managers and 5 cashiers. revamping the store."
bad,upper management needed a change when I was there. Its a very fast paced company. A lot of responsibility between company and employees but enjoyable
bad,At this company you get a lot of stress with no good pay.  You are in charge of 10 times things more than any usual company.  A lot of robbery and you put your life in danger.  No such as secure and no consideration.
bad,I learned that at Family dollar then even If you do everything that Is required of you They Still want more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,i learned how to help speak with customer service skills and helped customers with problem the have in the store. money management
bad,"For the most part the job was fun, very faced paced. My Co-workers were a delight to work with, we all got along, worked together, and had a great communication between the co-workers and Assistant Managers."
bad,"On a typical day working at Family dollar I would clock I and start checking out customers, cleaning, stocking, and helping customers find items they were looking for. I learned the importance of customer satisfaction. The management there were the best I could ask for, they were always willing to help me no matter what it was and always showing me something new. my co-workers were really easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with an unsatisfied customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers."
bad,"low pay, a lot of work. I was an assistant manager, every time I fixed the schedules to work best the payroll would get cut. short version not enough pay for the stress"
bad,"on the cash register, looking out for shrink, i have two assisatnt mangers. We deal with alot because of the area in terms of theft, sp it becomes a high volume store at times."
bad,Never a minute to spare! Always something to be done.
bad,"Poor management, no structure, no payroll. high expectations when theres no payroll. I've worked 5 hrs overtime due to lack of payroll."
bad,I have been with the company over a year now and can't help but notice that the procedure for training new hires is somewhat nonexistent. It is more or less a job in which you learn the ropes on your own without someone being there to persistantly make sure you are comfortable with your duties. I lucked out by having a great Store Manager but others have faltered due to poor work envirements.
bad,"I initially worked to open several stores in the immediate vicinity and got picked up permanently at the fourth. While I worked setting up stores (stocking and unloading trucks), there was a flurry of activity over a 7-10 day period after which was followed by a month without any work."
bad,"A typical day was opening/closing at times with many challenges. I learned that some people were not as dedicated and serious as others but they taught me how to speak my mind. The managers or co-workers weren't the best they stayed in the stockroom talking and were not there. The hardest part there was not having anyone on the same team as I and doin someone elses job. Clocking out was the relief, the end of the day."
bad,"There was job security and good salary compensation but the position demanded 60+ hours a week. Holidays were the busiest, so there were no off days during those times and family-time was limited. The payroll budget was low for quality associates annually so managers were expected to fill in where they fell short."
bad,ok first job...my particular store was poorly managed.............
bad,The store manager is required to work a minimum of 52 hours. Most managers work an average of 70 hours a week. Managers work six days a week. The day manager usually works alone. The pay for hourly employees is embarrassing. The average cashier gets approximately twelve hours a week. The assistant manager gets on average of 34 hours a week.
bad,"there is no work / life balance "
bad,"They don't care much for there employees, was fired for reasons out of my control and believe was treated very unfair after all the hard work and dedication I put into my job"
bad,It all depends on the store you work at but basically they all are the same.  If the manager likes you you'll have hours n time with your family. If they don't they you'll get barely livable hours n always work evenings n weekends. You can be the best worker they ever had n never do anything wrong to anyone n they'll still get rid of you in no time.
bad,"Spend your day checking every hour for "
bad,I was extremely unhappy with the store manager at family Dollar. She was constantly rude and condescending. The manager seemed to only be friendly to those she felt were on her level. Yes she could manage the store but was far from a good manager. She is the only reason I left
bad,"You make decent money as a manager but, you have no time to spend it. Truck never on time. Store always open time has change to 7 am. Which is silly when you already spending much of your day there. Management is not recommended for person with small children. New managers coming in make more money then employees that's been there for years,7 years in my case. Tight on raises. If you don't speak up you gets nothing sad to say but true. OVERWORKED AND UNDER PAID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,I liked working there it was just the distance from home n little hrs i was being given by week. Schedule was always being changed due to truck . it was nit a set schedule.
bad,this company is a very negative and not one that wants to help one co worker grow. the Area Mgr / DM is not looking to help team grow but is focus on just getting things done
bad,"Great place for flex scheduling . Does not promote within but says that do. Could pay more for the work that must be done. Constantly busy, not enough time to get all work done that's needed for day."
bad,ok work enviroment but not enough support from corporate. pay is good for the company and level of work. The life work balance is hard to find because of the demands of the store.
bad,Ok and good. You never have enough employees in the store. The company never have enough hours to provide for the employees. So the store manager works a lot of hours with no time off.
bad,"Good place to work if you like working independently most of the time.  Manager salary average, however hours are not competitive with salary. Mandatory minimum 52 and you way over exceed that weekly.  Overall, I enjoyed Family Dollar but there is absolutely no work/life balance.  Your life revolves around your job.  Just keep that in mind .This only applies to Store Managers and above."
bad,"The Family Dollar Warehouse provided me with a very respectable salary and provided many benefits as well as plenty of hours. Unfortunately, my specific distribution center was damaged by Hurricane Michael and had been plagued by major issues ever since. This location is not recommended for anyone with health issues or a history of injuries that affect one's ability to work in a labor intensive environment."
bad,It was a very stressful job and it included a lot of heavy lifting. Dealing with the public isnt always easy especially when your the one they come to with all of their complaints
bad,Not about family at all. You can learn a lot and grow within the company. But prepare to work every holiday without holiday pay. Prepare to be overworked and overwhelmed because they’re always short staffed.
bad,The HR. person is terrible she needs to learn more on how to help the employees there and the managers go by what this Hr lady says. The wharehouse is being managed poorly .
bad,"I have struggled because I am uses to being responsible for my store and "
bad,"Ideally not a place that I would work for again. From the top in corporate down to the customer service representatives, I feel like there is a lot of room for improvement that could make this a great working environment but I doubt there will be any changes"
bad,My experience wasn't what i expected working with this company. Its quite challenging when you constantly have to be on alert for thieves and robbers. Wasn't pleased with the atmosphere of the company.
bad,All positions do multiple jobs. Very fast paced. Comp and clean stores are top of the list.  Managers can do anywhere from 52-70 hours a week at salary.
bad,As a Store Manger you are a salaried employee. I worked 70-80 hours a week but was only paid for 52 hours.The workload was very demanding and the payroll budget was extremely low. No overtime was allowed for hourly associates unless approved by the DM. If there was a call out and no associate from that home store or another store wanted the hours the Store Manager was responsible for covering the shift. Work and home life balance was difficult. My last 2 years were the worst. We could only hire part-time associates. The only full -time associates were your Assistant Managers. Family Dollar is open for business all holidays except Christmas Day. Stores would be open on Christmas Day only if associates volunteered. Overall Family Dollar is a good starter job if you are looking for a job that promotes from within and are interested in a management career.
bad,Fun place to work but pay was terrible hours were all over and no benefits unless you were at a higher position but in turn you get way to much responsibility for most to handle and if your on salary you work way more hours then what your payed for
bad,"While the store management and assistant management are great, the district and up are horrible. No hours, no raises, treatment of employees is terrible."
bad,"family dollar used to be okay,they have changed a lot. The district managers are unprofessional and disrespectful. They don't give enough payroll for thee workload. They need security"
bad,I work as an Assist store manager under the store manager who was really rude to her staff and the public. Often showed no respect to patrons in store.
bad,"Helping customers find items throughout the store. Keeping items organized and clean in its proper spot on the shelf, to keep store running productive. Stocking shelves with new product. Interviewing potential candidates for future job placement. Counting money and keeping files secure and placed in office."
bad,"Constantly filling in for call offs, big time bosses don’t really care about how much you work and need help. They don’t send help from other stores for you, they expect too much out of store managers"
bad,"management at the location i worked at was very poor. the store manager would let one of the Assistant Managers walk all over her. I was terminated for a poor reason i felt was not my wrong doing. The Dm does not keep up with his stores, Everyone including the Dm talks about their own managers or employees behind their backs. And they retaliate against you, They don't care if you are a good employee.They really need a reality check on District Managers!"
bad,"It's ok if you need a job bad enough. With any retail, it can be stressful. The anti theft tags are a pain from an employee perspective. I am glad I don't work there anymore, personally."
bad,This place was more fun and a good place to work for when i first started back in September but as new management came it became stressful. A lot of drama also.
bad,I worked less then 15 hrs a week and the pay wasn't something anyone could possibly live off of. Very inconsistent shifts sometimes I'd work only 2 days a week.
bad,"Family Dollar is a productive fun work place. Wonderful hours. Wonderful team work ethic. They have Great customers, great co-workers. The team is always very helpful."
bad,"This is a place if you have no family, the people you work with usually are the best part of working there if you get along with them. The company itself does not truly value their employees, understaffed majority of the time."
bad,"I was an ASM just a little short of a year. The company was every man for yourself. They didn’t schedule people properly and always was giving you less than 40 hours. Another thing they did while I was there was if you were close to hitting 40 hours they would put in that you took a break or even took the hours away from you completely. I have a 1 year old so if you guys didn’t need me working I would be happy to stay home with my daughter. Then on top of that, I called out once in the whole time of being there and the company stole my PTO when I decided to leave in a professional manner. The final straw with this company is when they told me they needed help in another store and they sent me there and they winded up keeping me there. It was so far. They lie to the workers so much and they always change their policies so beware. BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY. If you want management experience, you’re better off going to Target or somewhere else. Don’t waste your time."
bad,"company does not believe in overtime, expect a lot out of employees but not pay does not reflect expectations. overall if you have good work ethic advancement can happen with 60-90 days."
bad,For only two people working at a time they expect displays to be done products put away and cashier at the same time while checking for people trying to steal. For this much work they do not pay enough and if it is not done then you have big bosses come down on you as if you weren't trying hard enough. If you are manager or assistant manager then you do not even get a break you get a few minutes to eat while you are still working.
bad,The most enjoyable thing was my team members. Management poor. Hardest thing was to stay happy. Typical day was order filling and staying productive. All in all good place to work just management is unfair.
bad,This job is just a filler until another one comes arounds. The pay is bi-weekly. And hours are average of 25 hours. The envirment was okay & the co-workers are fun.
bad,"It's an okay place to work. You stay very busy all day. But there is to many things to do and not enough time to do it all. Not enough staff. The store I worked at is a very high volume store with a lot of theft and disturbances. Most of the customers are polite, but majority is very impatient and rude."
bad,"The store manager is very rude, she does not like closing. she wants you to do her job and everybody else. When you need time off for the doctor or sick time she gets mad and write you up. I hate that store !"
bad,Everyone talk down on others and very inconsistent in work hours and environment. It was a stable environment for me because I did my work and serviced the customers due to me loving helping others and meeting people.
bad,it was ok there but there was plenty of red tape to go around and no answers to questions. Or just a no with no follow up to resolving a problem. Lot of potential in the company wasted
bad,"Even in a very high end area that cost of living is ridiculously high, they still only offered me right above minimum wage even though I had years of retail and management experience. They constantly called on me to come in for other shifts, but they would also insist that I had too many hours and needed to go home."
bad,"Had worked for the company for approximately a year before quitting. I give a two weeks notice usually, but the unfairness at the current time working there were not very awesome. There is new management currently, though."
bad,"It was fun, it's a good place to work. A lot of thing to do. You can make some friends right there on the job, but can't trust anybody, including your store manager."
bad,Budget was ridiculous. could only staff more than 2 people on shifts was at night or on weekends. almost always worked day shifts by myself. Communication between stores and warehouse was awful. Would always send way too much of an item or none of something that was ordered as out of stock. As a store manager I had to work a minimum of 52 hours a week but usually worked 60-70 hrs per week. When i first took over the store i worked almost 2 weeks straight without a day off and did a lot of open to close shifts which was usually 6 am till 10:30 pm. No time for family or any life outside of work.
bad,"Expectation do not meet compensation or allow for work/life balance."
bad,I speak then I clock in an do what job assignment they want me to do an I do it next job assignment is learn how to work on the register there always 2 there. The people are always friendly most of the time the hardest part is lifting but what I like you all people
bad,Get to work a 7. Run the register in a store by yourself until noon while having vendors coming in. Trying to stop thieves. Unrealistic expectations by upper managment
bad,"It's a filthy understaffed store that is stolen from way too often because it is an understaffed store.  You have to do everything from unload the delivery truck, to putting it away to waiting on the customers if you actually have the time."
bad,"Not a good place to work. Only got a .15 cent raise. You have alot of people stealing. You also have a lot of work but no real raises. They will not allow you to be full time unless you become a manager. Since dollar tree bought family dollar, they are trying to get rid of everyone thats been with family dollar for years and bring their people in. Sucks we dont get the money or credit we deserve."
bad,working for this company i will say it made me grow in my skill to be honest .because i had to learn how to keep us with the crew and also move faster
bad,"Its okay to start with, same stuff every week, truck on Monday, another truck for cooler food."
bad,"Good for a first job. Wouldn't recommend staying long term unless you plan to move up to management. Work 7 hrs no breaks a lot of the time. Managers sometimes forget the cashier's are there. Multitasking is something you must learn to do well. Scheduling may differ due to management. For example, you may be a scheduled to work 9-5. Some managers have you clocked out no later than 5:15; others may mean they're taking off the register at 5. So you'd be leaving 30 minutes to an hour later. Verify with your manager. Customers are Ok. Co-workers are cool. Management changes frequently."
bad,I work at a store in Charlotte NC when i became an assistant manager i agreed to the hourly salary they offered me i am always there never call out no matter what and it is a low salary for everything they want you to do. Now a cashier who has been there for way less time than myself and not a dependable one is making more money than me and they said they will not fix it
bad,"A typical day at work consist of signing on to register. running deposit, working by yourself for majority of shift. while running register you must stock shelves, check overstock, change schematics, check food for expiration,fix clothing area. I learned how to be more efficient with time. the management was alright for some time however i learned quick they would lie to you to get something out of you.Very unprofessional. workplace can get hectic, mainly when you are by yourself and you have customers who come in to steal. the hardest part of the job was handling thieves. the most enjoyable was the other associates, and majority of the customers."
bad,"I would go in start my day or night by putting freight up on the shelves, waith on customers, assist with finding something the customer is looking for."
bad,It's a place to work if you are getting your first job and want to continue being in the retail business but if you not a person who loves retail i would not recommend staying with them.
bad,family dollars warehouse was a great place to work for so i was told until i work there and saw that everything is so demanding with bad pay and the work is very hard with bad pay.
bad,"Rude customers, manager all stress about losing their job to a somewhat racist district manager etc. But yeah there also no work life balance in working with them."
bad,The company can  make improvements in many areas. The job security is very bad. The pay is awful for the required work. It would be a decent job for teens.
bad,"The people one works with are great, but the Company places undue demands and hardships on each employee. They demand organizing, stocking, cashiering, cleaning, customer service and merchandise retrieval from a single employee and it feels like all at the same time some times. The managers don't have it any easier. They are expected to do more than most companies and with less thanks."
bad,"Customer service is great!! Working alone, trying to fill merchandise in between ringing out customers was stressful!!  When these  companies move to micromanaging the employee suffers!"
bad,ok but some days were very stressfull. the hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done before a set time and couldnt because there wasnt enough people there to help
bad,On a typical day everything goes good. I learn new things everyday and meet new people something that I love to do. Management is somewhat ok but could be better. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers and their attitude's because they are drinking. The best part I liked about this job was that I I learned something new everyday.
bad,"A typical day at work is coming in to access the amount of shipment you have in the stockroom. You must also view the daily tasks and assignments that are mandatory for the day. The work culture is very rushed and very busy as expected. Most employees are very tired and stressed. Most stores are in a poverty area. Robberies are common and there is not much support from superiors. Just a police report, if you are held up with a gun they may give you a few days off, and back to the usual. The company emphasizes that you should just give up the money. If you put up any kind of resistance or try to defend yourself, you may be fired. The hardest part of the job is hoping you get a good staff who are in the mood to move the shipment with you and assist the manager. The hours are long and your family life is hindered. Plus you hope all day that you don't get a gun pointed at you."
bad,"First job handling a register, learned a lot about face to face customer service. Management was sub par, hours were flux, no set schedules, everyone just worked whenever they were called in."
bad,This is an ok company to work for maybe if I'd worked at a different location it wouldn't be any problems but I guess every manager isn't the same looking forward to doing more business with family dollar
bad,"The health insurance for employees is free, however its expensive for dependents when you rarely get a full 40 hours. Production requirement is sometimes impossible to achieve due to the dependence it has on other departments. Incentive pay is available but includes A LOT of exceptions. Coworkers and management are very good however with the push on production team work suffers."
bad,"They gave me the opportunity to grow up ,the managers was very nice, human, responsible and professional people. "
bad,"A typical day at work was ringing customers out and stocking shelves. I learn just because you are a good worker does mean you can't be let go.  Never underestimate management they will find a way. My co-workers were great they have always 100% behind me."
bad,"Typical day at work. Come in help customers, put away merchandise, and clean the store. Most managers were ok but most of the time out district manager would expect us to do things that were impossible."
bad,Working at Family Dollar was a learning experience. I learned how to handle customers in a professional manner and how to be more responsible for jobs that are expected of me. Management was harsh at times.
bad,"the ,managers and teams were very friendly and welcoming. Stayed busy, loved the interaction between the customer and I. Clean environment and believed in team work and getting things done. Man goal was too satisfy the customers and that is what I did."
bad,"I am thankful for receiving a customer service experience. This job is a good way to learn how to multitask and deal with attitudes daily. We're required to do more than within our job description. The hardest part of the job was being main cashier, stocking, recovering and pricing all at once."
bad,"Never ending chaos. Rely on a staff of poor character people. No payroll to assist in running the store. The company has a lot of opportunity, not many people stick around to see the store successful.  It definitely takes a lot of hard work to keep the store operational.  One person drops the ball, the whole store turns to chaos."
bad,"A typical day for a store manager at Family Dollar involves ordering, scheduling, cashiering, and stocking. Store manager is basically the back bone of the store. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance workload needed to keep store in functional condition with limited payroll."
bad,Left to enter college.  Didn't feel as if I was very welcomed by managers.  Some tension between employees.  Managers and co-workers were rude and cursed in front of customers and children.
bad,"Assists with all store functions including scheduling, ordering, freight processing and all day-to-day store activities as directed. "
bad,I have learned that being the manager of a store you must have good employees to work for and with you. Everyone must work as a team.
bad,"Very much like ""Bad Girls Club"" or some other reality show with unnecessary drama and violence on every shift. Will never work there again!"
bad,"Busy days with many different activities as an assistant store manager. Learned some insides to a corporate chain location. Most co-workers were hard workers and nice people. Very high turn over rate for cashiers. Management had a lot of tough choices with employees, using blanket corporate policy for personnel is not generally affective."
bad,"you can advance quickly if you are willing to work 70 hour weeks and run a store with little or no help. they are open all holidays which is ridiculous.No safety whatsoever, you are by yourself in the store quite a bit of the time, and you are never able to take lunches"
bad,"This employer is amazing to work for, you have to be fast. You have you're typical days, but that's retail in general. I have learned lots from the company and enjoyed working with this company."
bad,"a typical day at my job would be managing my employees,stocking merchandise, dealing with different types of personalities all day, the hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers"
bad,Friendly culture but not enough people for the jobs that were expected to be done
bad,"They ask so much to be done by a few people, and we were not paid well."
bad,"it was a ok place of employment, fun employees, and management care about their workers"
bad,Working for my particular retail store was an average experience for me. I had my good days and bad days like everyone does with their own career or job. It's just time to move on to something better for myself
bad,"the job itself was a little depending, all at once you had to be the cashier, stocker, security guard, maintaince, loss prevention, and sometimes therapist. my location wasn't in such a nice neighborhood i should say. on average there was about 3 or 4 run outs a day."
bad,I learned most of my experience with customers and hard work at this company. Being in a high traffic area I learned how to balance dealing with large volumes of customers and work. My coworkers and customers were like an extended family to me and were the hardest working people I've ever met. The hardest part of the job was meeting the demands of corporate but me and my coworkers always came through. The most enjoyable was interacting with different customers and making sure everything was done.
bad,Started as an assistant manager and was promoted to Auditor. Great advancement potential and benefits.
bad,"a fast paced job,i learned what retail was like,my coworkers were very good to work with,the hardest part of the job was the area the store was located at and the costomers were very challanging to work with,the most enjoyable part of the job was working for family dollar."
bad,Fast pace fun work enviroment with plenty to do. working there makes multi tasking more fun!
bad,"Family Dollar is a fast pace . Never a dole moment. I've learned to tag clothing.stock shelves,multitask.Some mangers are nice and others are being mangers doing there jobs. Meeting coworkers and getting to know them. It makes it hard when you lose a job you don't see them any more and lose a freind ship that was started.Is to laugh about the crazy thing that happen at work that day."
bad,"Typical day is very busy. I learned cashier techniques. Management could be way better.Co Workers friendly,helpful. Hardest part of the job is having to chase people down. Enjoyable part is helping people ."
bad,"A typical day at Family Dollar is great, all of my co-workers are full of smiles and I love it everyone gets along its a fun environment I learned to be outgoing,patient and quick, the hardest part was having to get a new manager. The most enjoyable part of my day I would have to say was seeing all my customers leave satisfied and happy with their visit to our store."
bad,"Good starter job until you can find something more stable, security sucks and advancement is few."
bad,"Its an okay job, the work ethic of other workers aren't that great and the store its pretty old and needs more help"
bad,"Working here was good because I love working the public, i am very big on being around people. I am a very happy go lucky person to everyone i meet and always tried to bring a smile to my customers face."
bad,"For the amount of work you will have to do there the pay isn't worth it.They did not scale up the in house workers as minimum wage went up,therefore the newly hired were being paid more than people who were there a while.That's why left"
bad,Corporate doesn’t listen to anything you say. No matter the situation it will get brushed off. The work is good until it’s your time to shine. Somebody will always be there to tell you to sit back and let the store manager take the credit for your work. Management does nothing but tell you how to do the job that they are suppose to be doing.
bad,I don't have a lot of good things to say about family dollar during my time there I had to quit one of my two jobs because of poor scheduling. I wasn't being paid what I deserved for all I did and there weren't a lot of hours to go around so 3 work days out of the week at 8.00 an hour wasn't allowing me to take care of my responsibilities at home and family.
bad,"The store I worked at closed. It was decent money for a retail position. My direct manager was great to work with. His boss was awful, always looking for something wrong instead of seeing how my manager turned the store around. The other issue was staffing. Sometimes I was the only employee in the store. This became a personal safety issue. There was a lot of theft and shady customers. I felt unsafe many times."
bad,They really dont care how hard you work for them is never good enough for them.. they wznt you to keep eye on lost prevention  while taking out stock with just you in the store or a mgr an employee..you try your best but they still steal you try stopping them running out the door after them not they want u to runn aout the store but if you dont get ur stuff back you inventory come back bad you get fire
bad,"When you work with them, you gain more experience in areas unknown. You interact with all types of different people their. The only thing to do is be you no matter what, so even people who are rude will show a slight smile. No matter how a person is rude or mean you have to develop a skill to overcome."
bad,"you must be able to lift at least 50 pounds or more on a  daily basis, the company is good about promoting from  within, i find that corporate does not fix things in a timely manner and it can make it an uncomfortable place to work"
bad,Job responsibilities were sometimes more than the compensation given. I enjoyed working with the public and my coworkers. It seemed to me though that my first manager let personal feelings negatively effect our working relationship.
bad,Was often asked to come in on my days off and worked longer hours than scheduled. Had some flexibility from the manager but when it came to working with a new schedule there was no flexibility. Would not work there again.
bad,"My manager is great. However the poor working conditions are not worth the pay. You will have multiple job descriptions to fill such as unloading truck, running register, stocking, and recovery, Truck almost never comes on time for those who unload. Customers can be nice but depending on the location, sometimes it’s not worth dealing with the way you’re treated and the mess people make. If you’re a student and want part time. The hours are flexible, and if you have a good manager they will work with your availability."
bad,I was over 13 employees scheduled the store hiring firing order for inventory open and close store deal with customer service set the planogram for the store price changing making sure all items are current and up to planogram to the company standard
bad,great company to work for. you get benefits. you get hours. you get lunch breaks. loved there as long as you have the right managers. get to work on the truck if you want to.
bad,I counted and received the material in to be picked and shipped to the stores. If I had a problem I would take it to the receiving clerk and she would fix it.
bad,"A typical work day at Family Dollar was never the same. Everyday there were different customers with different attitudes that really tested your patience. I had to constantly have the front end of the store tidy and neat when I wasn't busy with a customer. Recovering and cleaning was also a part of my daily routine at work. The Management was very all over the place, we never really had a consistent boss. We always had store mangers from different locations come to help us from time to time which wasn't always a bad thing. They showed us different ways to run the store which made us in a way versatile. The workplace culture was very difficult at times, due to the location of the workplace there was a lot of rude customers who lack the basic use of manners. The hardest part about working here were the inconsistent organization, some days we would fall behind on unloading the trucks because we were understaffed. Also it was hard to keep the shelves nice and neat as well. The most enjoyable part about working here was seeing your co workers and superiors work so hard. I really got a sense of what it means to give a hundred percent when you work with people who have something to lose, it helped me build character."
bad,A typical day consists of stocking shelves. Employees are expected to stock between 3-5 pallet carts each per shift. Assistant managers are essentially stock persons.
bad,"At Family Dollar the pay was next to nothing, barley minimum wage for Ohio. I struggled to get a full 40 hours every week, traveling from different store locations was the only way to earn full time for me personally. Overall, it was not to bad but very mediocre. Low pay, easy work, customer service."
bad,Enjoyed working there until a new co-worker was hired and began calling and complaining of bogus things I supposedly failed to do or not do. I was not working alone on my shifts.
bad,"The beginning of working at Family Dollar i enjoyed my time and had fun, but then they had there faults. Everyone was nice at first but then i started to see them turn on each other. Overall the customers where very nice but some complained."
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. The warehouse does not value their people nor do they respect each other. The pay is good if you work a lot of hours on the hot factory.
bad,My review summary of Family Dollar was pretty good as well as boring. The tempo for most days at work were pretty slow but sometimes were productive as well. Stocking wasn't so bad and i can agree to that part. I learned how to work well with others and communicate with one another. The hardest part of the job was staying busy because when things start to go slow it becomes so boring and that can be a problem but that was what energy drinks were for while at work. The most enjoyable part working at Family Dollar was the usual customers who shopped there they always asked me how school was going and how was business. They made it enjoyable.
bad,"Expect a fast paced work environment and nice people,okay pay,wonderful customers,good location,steady work,a great place to gain experience, a over all good experience"
bad,"unloding the truck everey week.responsable for the money of the store every day.packing out the merchandises.cleaning the floor,go to the bank every day."
bad,"Hours vary wildly from closing one night and opening the next. Pay is low. Customers can be rude but that comes with retail. No paid vacation, no lunch breaks, open all holidays and you must be there 6 months before you can receive holiday pay. Constantly covering other people's shifts due to call ins."
bad,"8+ hours a day is a typical work day time"
bad,enjoyed working for the family dollar corp found very caring people in the corp who showed me what I was worth to their company but when it was sold over to dollar express all that caring went with it! then dollar express sold out to dollar general and either company tried to find other positions for me after my long hours and yrs of service to the company they had bought! very discouraged & disappointed in both companies! I miss the family Dollar I once worked for specially the customers!
bad,Overall they are an okay company. Many of the stores are run down and do not have sufficient environments for their employees. The store I worked in had a leaky roof and no air conditioner.
bad,They are paid weekly. As an assistant store manager I started out at $11. Turn over rate is absolutely awful. Merchandise truck comes every Thursday. They do not give a discount to employees on items in store. Stores don't have a panic button either with is very unsafe!
bad,i really enjoy doing team work and there really isn't much team work in this workplace. it can be really stressful at times. sometimes the headsets don't work properly and that makes the job more stressful.
bad,"I work as a Assistant Manager, I work a lot of hours weekly and most of my time was always at the store which was difficult to balance with my social life. It does have lots of benefits but it feels like you work harder to not even get notice."
bad,"Very stressful for a manager, lots to get done in a certain time frame. Was hard for me to keep up at times especially when you're short staffed. You don't really have a home life with all the hours you have to work. Hard to keep it balanced."
bad,"It's an okay job, no benefits unless you're a store manager. No set schedules, if you have an emergency it's hard to get days off. They expect a lot with a little bit of pay. Hard to get any overtime unless someone calls off"
bad,"Customer service, learning the company, learning managerial trades, counting cash, doing money drops. Management was awesome, Laid back, busy, and sometimes stressful. The paperwork. The customers."
bad,"This company had very down to earth workers and a good supervisor, if you didn't have a ride to work someone would come and get you and I just overall enjoyed working here besides the customers asking questions all day."
bad,Working for these employers was very fun and routine.Unloading the truck then stocking shelves and help check customers out also filling meat case. Three times a day we would also have to do a safety sweep.
bad,"My review on the job was rare , the manger was a bit rude but having that experience was good . The hours I had were good as well , and meeting new people was not so bad , I can tend to be shy but I open up well . at first I wasn't sure how to do things but I asked and I meet people who showed me around as well and that made me know how to work with things and if I wasn't sure about something I would ask so I can be able to know ."
bad,"every day coming into work I would restock items, ring up customers and recovery. I learned how to multi task. Me and my manager had a good relationship, everything he asked me to do I completed it."
bad,"I worked for Family Dollar almost 3 years. I was first hired as just a part-time cashier, which was fine, and i quickly earned more hours based on my work ethic. After about a 1 and a half years, i was promoted to 2nd Assistant Manager of the store. Advancing is quite simple within the store/company, but the benefits they have to offer are not that great. The insurance they offer is not that great, but they take quite a bit from your weekly check for it. They do not have any incentives for their employees, and their Christmas bonus is a gift card for Family Dollar only. Management at the store I worked for, (prior to my advancement) was actually great."
bad,"A typical day was always processing a truck, sometimes being alone in the store for hours, and a lot of cleaning."
bad,money making sure you giving the right change back to the customer. say hey welcome to family dollar  with a smile on your face
bad,Opening and closing the store. Be responsible for securing daily cash transactions and bank runs. I learned how to be more responsible for handling cash and dealing with hostile customers.
bad,"Poor management and the store itself was falling apart, customers steal constantly and no cameras in store, CEO's/chief officers, etc, are unaware of these issues. And low pay for what they demand."
bad,"A fun and friendly work environment that had great customer relations. Not only do you learn how to work the cash register, but focus on building great relationships with customers and co-workers. It is a very unsafe job because it is a easy target for robbers. They do not pay enough for the job that you are doing."
bad,"The work is very typical of its industry, but it seems to be very tight on money.  They expect the amount of work done to be done to take less time than most places and to include the minimum amout of people doing it.  Most days the store is opened by a single manager with no cashier to help.  The cashier doesn't come in until typically 11 am at the earliest.  Sundays they don't until 3 pm.  And when there are reductions in the man hours available in the budget, they still expect the same amount of work to get done."
bad,I enjoyed most of the people I worked with which was the most enjoyable part of my job. The area and customers were very trying at times that would have to be the hardest part of the job.
bad,If you are management expect no breaks or lunches. And NO family life. Pay and benefits aren't worth the suffering. You can expect to work 60 plus hours a week even though you only get paid for 52. They break so many Labor laws.
bad,Working there gave me alot of management experience wich i tend to use going forward on to other emloyment oppurtunities.
bad,Don't really want to talk about it expect had a medical emergency at work and it was not handled in a profession manner by other management.
bad,"I was a cashier and stocker."
bad,"*Stand at the register meet and greet customers with a smile and ring out customers, stock shelves with new products, mop floor if the floor is to dirty"
bad,"The job is known for workers to just randomly quit at a moments notice, mostly due to the stress the job creates, along with some poor management communication. As part of the stock crew the main problem you would find is that when other employees have not done any work at moving stock, we get massive over stock issues"
bad,"Good people to work with, and an opportunity to meet alot of different people,"
bad,"Not a very good company to work for, benefits are terrible, store manager is very unprofessional, you can work as hard as you want to prove yourself worthy of a rasie but they are rarely ever given if at all, business should close a lot earlier on sundays"
bad,"The manager I worked with was great. When she quit, everything went down hill. The upper management only cared about the store making money instead of internal issues within the store. I dont believe the entire company is bad, only the district managers that were over my location"
bad,The workplace there is very clean but the management there is not very good because they are not on top of things. The most enjoyable part of my jobs is meeting people
bad,They want you there by yourself always then want you to somehow control theft. There is no payroll to give to employees so mgrs work more like 65 plus
bad,It’s not hard to work here the job is simple! It’s up to the person if they’re truly capable of doing what’s asked of them. Just do your job and you’ll be fine
bad,"I was quickly promoted from cashier to assistant manager which was lots of responsibility and fun. I had the keys to the store and had to open and sometimes close, locking up. it gave me a sense of importance."
bad,Area managers never check in with you after making calls to them. Slander their employees under pay them and over work them and fire them for unreasonable things .
bad,"This company is not bothered at all with employee happiness, and no one is really there to help you sort out any issues. The people I worked with were good people but no one seems to care about their job and it seems to start at the corporate level and trickle down"
bad,It was ok to work there..good people and pretty easy just the low pay was bad and short hours but overall I give it a 6 because the pay n really not much to grow fr
bad,"being a assistant manager is really hard work ,you do as much as the store manager but if you love unloading trucks and stocking shelves it a good job for that"
bad,This is very good place to work at n all the people that work there is also nice too they are very understanding work around your time in welling to help u out
bad,The job is okay the management is very unprofessional the staff it's friendly the customers are nice with a few exceptions they have a lot of theft on a daily basis
bad,"The customers and managers expectations is what makes this a tough job. The store is not given enough hours for completion of store certain deadlines. Which gives the cashier more to do than already dealing with rude and unpleasant customers, especially during the evening(3-6) which is the busiest time. This gave me great customer service experience but also showed me my worth."
bad,We all need jobs famiky dollar was a bit messy i did my work but over didnt like the people who work there very disrespectful manager was rude other than that it was ok i got my job done and did what i was suppose to do
bad,"I enjoyed working there for the most part. A typical day at work would consist of clocking in, counting your drawer, setting up your register and working on cleaning/organizing the front while waiting for customers to get in front of the register to purchase their items. The hardest part of the job is that you're standing most of the day or having to crouch/kneel to put things on the lower shelves. Old management wasn't fully organized and occasionally ran into difficulties with opening the store on time until the new manager started."
bad,"A Typical work day would be business ,stocking shelves helping costumers out etc.Ive learned how to manage time by making sure at the end of my shift the shelves were fully stocked.The most enjoyable part of the job was surrounding myself around positive outgoing people like my coworkers."
bad,"Family Dollar has poor management and awful customer service skills, the manager was always rude as well and never really took time to train me. I highly recommend not applying for this company."
bad,Significantly assisted me improving my time management skills along with management skills. The manager was wonderful to work with. Fun co-workers and customers.
bad,It was a wonderful experience to learn customer service. But however the store closed due to low production . Management was not to great. I did enjoy my regular customers .
bad,the job at store is less stessful and laid back and do my work on my on paces how i feel and the way of my ability and i learned alot working with new people and the management cool and nice and hardworking also too and the workplace is clean and neat and the job is not hard at all and i enjoyable the job alot
bad,Was a manager and was alone all day until 2pm sometimes 3pm. Not a good place to work because require too much from a manager and not enough hours for whole crew.
bad,I loved the job but not management. I had issues with baby sitter and she fired me didn't even tell me I learn from a friend and than put me in a non hireable. That was my first time ever working and family Dollar now can't ever work at one again
bad,The store I worked at on/off couldn't seem to keep employees. The store I worked for ran a skeleton crew and had so few employees they could barely keep up the store. Managers would quit without notice and whole crews would walk. I quit after only a few months after the last manager stopped showing up and was appointed Holding Store Manager. I was robbed of Overtime after I was put on Salary and did no receive the support I needed from the district manager.
bad,You always have alot of work to do but no time to complete it unless you work off the clock because they will never let you get overtime. The best part is half of customer are cool but the other halves are theives you have to watch for
bad,As an assistant manager you have to do the majority of the heavy lifting even if there is men on your shift you still have to do the heavy unloading alone while the men recover (fix items to be in a straight line all facing the same way). Job duties are not equal.
bad,As a former employee at family dollar I made my way up the ladder fairly quick. This is a greedy company that most often than not wants to compete with big stores but its stores are not suited to hold so much merchandise making them look like a hot mess.
bad,Family Dollar is not a place to work if you like things organized. Things are all over the place. No respect for the employees. Don't work here unless you need to.
bad,"I loved my customer's.  I also loved some of the employees. But, when i went to my store manager about store drama she basically told me to brush it off my shoulders.  This was more than once. I did more than my fair share of work between both of the assistants. I was told i was going to get manager twice and was brushed under the righ twice. I was told i worked with while i was there.  One was drinking and was reported to die manager but nothing done.  Very unprofessional.  Couldn't go to DM bc the DM and my store manager were VERY close.  So i finally handed in my assistant keys after 3 years of a no winning battle . I kept getting promised a store of my own 3 different occasions and she put someone in my place every time.  I wad even told the last time i had it. That was the very last straw."
bad,I would run the cash register.  In spare timw front face isle then unload my totes or help with unloading i boats or pallets. Clean my area or help with customers
bad,As a store manager at Family Dollar they expect you to basically give your life to Family Dollar. From the 52+ hours a week. Which by the way a Family Dollar store Manager is a salary position so while your check never changes you are required to work hours over 52 every week with NO EXTRA PAY. Also there is really no need for assistant managers due to the fact everything falls on you anyway
bad,When I was working there I'd have to remind myself before going in that I was there only for a check. It was emotionally exhausting more than anything. Physically and mentally it was pretty easy I guess. I would recommend to anyone just starting or someone who really needs the money.
bad,It was fine in the beginning but quickly turned bad because of the management and how poor of a condition the store was in they would leave me in the store by myself all the time. I was working in the store by myself every holiday and then would get in trouble for closing early. All in all horrible job
bad,"A typical day at family dollar is form 8:00am to 3:00pm. We used pallet Jacks, fork Lifts as well as tuggers and walkie riders. Teammates were productive, friendly and seek the interest of the company."
bad,"Family Dollar is a good job for those looking to work there temporarily (2-5 months) and leave immediately thereafter. The work is easy but direct/lower management lacks manners and decency, & the assistant managers get treated with a lack of respect by team members & Store Managers alike. Overtime is punishable via write-up and labor scheduling is shoddy at best. The turnover rate is high for management and employees, they will cut your hours or fire you without notice, and if you have an important position that requires a team you should most definitely be ready to get another job at a moment's notice. Assistant managers should be prepared to be blamed for the Store Manager's mistakes and their team members lack of effort, freight managers in particular should watch out as they will lull you into a false sense of security before demoting you/ firing you. Don't invest your time in a job that will use you & throw you away like a dirty rag, instead use them for what you need then quit after you've gotten your rocks off."
bad,Untrained by those in charge and left to my own vices. Rude customers and impatient staff; was expected to do things I was unskilled at or had no prior knowledge of on the first day.
bad,They do not pay fairly during the to time of employment. Always short staffed. Having a weekend off to do personal things They will not give you a set number of hours so you can seek other work..
bad,very fast paced working environment. hardly any options of career advancement. a good temporary job to help you with experience to get the career you want.
bad,"Family dollar is an okay place to work. Family Dollar Offers short breaks and store needs updating no matter how hard you work you will get low pay. You  don""t have a life anymore"
bad,The managers were undertrained and didn't have alot of  knowledge.  The stores were mostly clean. The associates were well trained and  polite. This company was good.
bad,I Enjoyed My Job I Took On Hard Responsibility’s That Others Couldn’t Handle It was a Great Job Hopefully I could Find Something Similar To That Job Or Maybe Even Better
bad,"It's  a great company , The  bad  part, was it had bad  management, to work. I,work about 30 to 35hrs.per week. As a stocker, .I stock ,and un load the truck."
bad,I really enjoyed working here. But the thing was there was no benefits no discount or anything so Im not considering working here anymore. I guess it’s a chop
bad,No real opportunity. Great for a student or any individual satisfied with the earnings offered as a store manager. There is not much room to grow with the company.
bad,"A typical day working at Family Dollar would be described as a slow-pace business of productivity. There were repetitive customers, some friendly and others not so much. There wasn't much of a difference in customers, but the other side of the counter seemed to be more aggressive than other places of employment."
bad,"With the fast paced environment its great for young and able kids just starting work. The pay is also minimum wage, that is suited for a high school worker."
bad,Was a contractor while there. Big setting with a large number of employees and easy to get lost in the shuffle. I happened to be there just before the buyout occurred. I've been able to keep up with a few of the coworkers but all have left for other opportunities.
bad,"Being under new management, I would go back if I had the chance. Maybe someday I will find a job I loved like I did here. It's a great place to work.."
bad,Don't do it. It's a trap. Although I promoted quickly I was pushed into 17 hour days regularly. I was hardly recognized for the effort I put in and was left alone in the store the entire day in many occasions.
bad,"Once again most of the customer are the way they are and they had an issue with a African American being a manager in this small town store where everyone comes to shop there, but I have great customer service skills and I just did my job regardless if they were wrong"
bad,"If you want to work here, be prepared to have no life outside of work because you won't get one. Your life is your job working here and it sucks!! You work your butt off for people who don't care about you period. They would replace you in an instant and not even bat an eye. You have no say in your schedule of what you need you work what they tell you to and if not, your out!"
bad,"I enjoyed working for the company,they just don't hire good people the people that works for family dollar don't have a strive for the customers.The company don't appreciate their workers."
bad,everything was fine with this job i actually liked it until they cut my hours for no reason at all and i was driving from another town and didn't have money for gas cuz of the cut in hours
bad,I loved working for family dollar there was always something different going on never a dual moment I would work there again its always good to meet new people
bad,take advangtage of their emplyees while underpaying and underappriciating.bonus with the overtime pay when you get 50 hours but after 3 weeks and no day off it gets to be a bit much.
bad,Working here was very stressful. I hardly got any working hours. The management was very unorganized. I really didn't like working there at all. I didn't see myself advancing there.
bad,Family dollar can be a lucrative employer. The location I worked for was in a transitioning stage so when it got busy time could get stressful due to lack of management in the stocking department.
bad,Is alright place to work if you are looking for part-time are full-time they work around your schedule if they have to. I was able to go to school while working at the family dollar part-time
bad,It was ok I had good and bad days there. Management is ok depends on the store you're at. Shifts are fair. the pay sucks for all the work you have to do.
bad,"Overall job is fine but managers could be hired with more intensive discretion, i.e. more compassionate and responsible people. Weekly schedules are messy but this is due to employees calling out frequently. Perhaps this was just how my store was though."
bad,company doesnt give enough money into stores that are falling apart expect you to boost sales with leaky roofs and single man shifts. physcially and mentally exhausting
bad,The issue with being dependable is when you work with others who are not dependable. All of the shifts and responsibilities fall on you. Horrible crew in NSL.
bad,It is a great part time job not much for pay and is always hiring learned to work in a fast and slow paced environment and how to solo run a store normally with one other person the hardest part was no benefits if you are less then management.
bad,"company seemed ok but the manager was bi polar and did not like me. inconsistent scheduling, would decide I was not working when I showed up on time for my scheduled shift."
bad,This company would benefit from hiring more people paying better wages and getting everyone onboard with  team meetings. There is way to much put on the manager and never enough help to get everything complete.
bad,"Working for this company is a good way to start your retail and customer service experience.My favorite part working with this company was learning new things like how to unload a truck,how to reset schematics,how to properly stock merchandise.With this company being my first job it has gotten me a lot of growth and knowledge i can go anywhere because of just knowing hands on duties."
bad,This job is better built for the multi-taskers of the world. This job will want you to work the cash register and stock the shelves if you have time to do it. But no one helps out the cashiers when they have multiple customers and but there are three other people stocking the shelves of the store.
bad,"It was okay. Miss my coworkers more than anything. It was easy, not too demanding. Schedules were very flexible. If I could work anywhere, it would be there. Minus the manager, it was a great job."
bad,"Cold in the winter and hot in the summer, some decent jobs and some really bad jobs located in the facility. My job in maintenance wasn't that bad though."
bad,"I really disliked that my pay was a little over minimum wage. The hours were only limited to 25 a week. If you are not great with dealing with the public, i suggest you find another place to work."
bad,"Had lots fun working there, Lots of great people to work with. They don't give enough hours and work schedule is all over the place. Was fired for no reason and was lied to about reason.  They tried to fight unemployment and got caught in lie for reason fired."
bad,Typical retail job. I was a cashier so for the majority of my shift I was behind the register just ringing people's items up. They didn't drug test and there wasn't really an interview.
bad,The district manager didn't won't me to be successful. Great place to work but I never had an off day nor their have managers.I didn't have any type of training but I was willing to put in work. Some of the other managers where all about them selves they really didn't believe in helping others. My staff was awesome well my CSR because once again I didn't have any managers
bad,The District Manager and Corporate expected shipments/displays to be done yesterday while still waiting effectively on customers. On weekend the person opening was required to work 12-14 hour shifts.
bad,not enough crew on at a time and they want you to unload a truck and stock shelf and help coustomers but at the same time there is only one to two people on a shift at a time
bad,"Depends on your district, the one i was in was horrible. Management was a joke and they expected you to put the company before your family and your own well being."
bad,Family Dollar is a mini-Walmart. Diverse selection of products so customers come in for everything. Always busy & never a dull moment. Associate's & management are down to earth & friendly.
bad,"Family Dollar is a good entry level management position to learn about leadership and retail.  It is not a place you will stay at long ost likely.  I made 52k per year which sounds good but worked 80-85 hours per week.  The do not provide hardly any payroll hence you work more.  The more you make as a manager, the less hours you have to pay employees hence, you work by yourself."
bad,I do not recommend this job l was there way to long.They are not helpful or friendly.. never have hours available for people only 2 people working at a time over all sucks
bad,It was a good but ran different had to adapt to it. From helping customers to find things they need or to be cleaning the store. Some days was worst than others but the job had to geat done
bad,"I can only be responsible for myself                        its not very clesn"
bad,"The Manager I worked under was not there to improve the the company, but more for her own needs. She has been removed since I left. The District manager in unwilling to help employees in situations at the work place causing a lot of employees to leave."
bad,"Helpful,management will keep the place clean and in order. Managers help customers and employers with everything they could. You can contact the job and speak to someone when you needed to."
bad,"The management was good, the hours was long but the work was easy. The hardest part was being there long hours. We had to 15 mins and a 30 minute lunch break. Everybody was nice and loving."
bad,I hated the job and worked to much for not enough pay and no breaks and management was horrible but I worked the job for money
bad,"The job started off good till they change the manager. The manager should have been of sick leave do to the fact she had cancer. Do to the cancer, she was never in and would call me in almost every day that she was so she could leave. Would never work there again."
bad,"as manager is not the greatest place, you have to be married to place . not enough payroll to offer great customer time.  you cant even go to bathroom when you running store alone and mutli tasking  10 things"
bad,although i worked at family dollar for a few months its a job where i you're not motivated to come in to work. Its a job for those in high school or college not a job where youd be able to make a decent living.
bad,Really enjoyed working here . Okay management really have kirbjbg else to say about it . It's like any other job just have to work hard or you won't get anywhere
bad,"Horrible, come to work and you get nothing but altitude from employees and management. Not a good place to work. unorganized and nasty."
bad,Management was terrible. They would leave employees to work alone at night in a bad neighborhood. It was robbed several times and the managment was more concerned with money than our well being. let us work in conditions where a leak had ruined our stock area. It later began to grow mold and we were without a bathroom for 2 months before they fixed and issue.
bad,Working as a manager at Family Dollar has taught me two things. one you have a lot of responsibility and two you have to keep a clear head about things that you are doing. you can never let anything out of your sight.
bad,"The store I worked at was very unorganized. Had a high theft rate and robberies, more and likely due to the neighborhood it is located in. Working there will have you paranoid and uncomfortable. It is best to know the background of the store. Family Dollar stores are robbed too frequently."
bad,"Worked with wonderful people, would not have traded the experience to work along them... gleaned from all who were willing to share, I accepted graciously..."
bad,working at family dollar was a great first job experience because it made one work hard and forced you to be able to work any job position. staffing is inconsistent however and there is always lacking in the amount of people on the sales floor.
bad,"I would start my day by counting the money I had in my register to make sure I had $100. That's the amount we keep in our cash register to give back change. I ring up customers and tell them about any good deals or sales we have going on. I deal with cash everyday and customers. We have inventory on Wednesdays, so I help the manager unload the truck and put out whatever is needed on the floor."
bad,It was dirty. The workers would come in late or wouldn't show up. The customers were rude. People would break in to the store. Managers would quit over and over.
bad,"lack of resprect, over worked , under payed, the did not treat their employees rite at all, no acknowledgement for jobs well done, facilities were always dirty ,"
bad,All in all it's a typical work environment that requires self sacrifice of your troubles to bring out an unparalleled shopping experience.
bad,Under managed and poor morale. Even though this was the case I still upheld my end of the bargain and fulfilled my daily requirements
bad,"I learned while working here is that no matter how hard I worked and no matter what I did, I was never appreciated. I was always told I could be replaced."
bad,I honestly can't make a review of the new company standards but the old one weren't great. there was a distinct lack of good governance from the higher ups. they tended to rather than promote within bring in new workers in higher positions regularly which is a stupid practice as they know nothing but what they have been taught and can't effectively run a store without practice though there are some exceptions there few and far between.
bad,"A typical day a work would be running the cash register and stocking shelves, running deposits to the bank, and opening and closing the store.  The manager and coworkers were pleasant to work with,  The one thing I did not like was always being called in on my days off because we were short handed, and the manager would not hire anyone.  The enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers on a daily basis and tending to their needs."
bad,"Working at family dollar was an stepping stone to better"
bad,I really did not like working here. They didn't pay anything!!! My co-workers were great but the hours and the pay made me hate the job.
bad,"counting teals, training cahiers and training new managers. Management was pretty fair. Co-workers was a blast to work with everyday. Hardest part of my job was working late a night without security there were a lot of shoplifters. Most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people."
bad,"It was nice to work for the company for a time, but once new management came in that didn't seem to care much about the company, much less the employees, things took a turn for the worst. Once the people in higher positions than me stopped doing their job correctly, that's when mine became very stressful causing me to leave."
bad,"The coworkers i worked with were really nice and good to me, but as i worked here for those 3 weeks i could not get the hang of the job so i decided it was not for me as i wasn't detail orientated at the time."
bad,"Since managers are salary, you are required to stay until the job is done. Also must cover all shifts when necessary since not a lot of other stores have extra people to loan out."
bad,"Taking in various deliveries, putting out shipment, ringing transactions and interacting with various different customers. Opening or Closing store."
bad,Not much to learn from this experience and the people were always rude there. Staff and customers were nothing to be cheerful about. No motivation and no good energies.
bad,"It was a good learning experience, but the hours were bad a lot of nights and weekends, and the area wasn't the best. "
bad,staff is easy to get along with for the most part. customer's are the best part they make your day. fun pace to work. you are always expected to grow with the company
bad,an ok job didn't really like the hours or the management! A lot of favoritism was going on in that location!! but a job is a job I did my responsibilities the best I could.
bad,Became very knowledgeable of work situations and surroundings. Leader even in assistant management. No challenge to big for me to overcome.
bad,"Typical day at work would be greeting customers, restocking and checking if any extra work needs to be done while on my shift."
bad,"A typical day at work was confusing. I learned how to perform in a hostile work environment. Management was ok, very unprofessional. My co-workers were great, very cordial. The hardest part of the job was being there. The most enjoyable part of the job was being terminated."
bad,I truly didn't like the environment due to the way the staffing was there I did not feel like an equal team player in this organization.
bad,"I learned a lot working at Family dollar"
bad,Work at family dollar is very challenging and you learn that you must always be alert. The hardest jobs is thefts. But I really enjoyed work at the company because yo meet different people
bad,"A typical day consisted of checking emails, working a register, stocking shelves, placing orders for the store.  Making a schedule for a crew of 5, unloading trucks, making daily deposits to the bank. I worked with a great group of people.  Sometimes the hardest parts of the job was the long hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
bad,"I enjoyed the manager I worked for, he was organized and fare with the work scheduling - I learned a lot form him. Upper management however had a displaced sense of reality at our retail level. They over-worked and under appreciated their valuable employees."
bad,"Being a manager and only a few hours to work with for employees, you were tied to the store from open to close."
bad,"Good place to work yet it was not a rewarding career. Worked without a store manager for most of my 2 year wmployment with this company. Resulted in very heavy workload, but it did help me learn more about management."
bad,There was a lot of inconsistency in leadership with the management and due to conflicting with my job at Shopko. I chose to leave.
bad,"Needed more associates to zone floor at all times, needed freight on pallets instead of single cartons down the rollers, parking lot was very dark at end of shift and was located in bad part of town, etc..."
bad,Great customer service environment. Long hours lots of work..
bad,was often good until my hours got cut  the manger was very rude and but my co workers help me to get though the day
bad,"As an assistant manager, what would normally be a full time job, is more like a part time job. I went from working 50+ hours my first two weeks to working 25 hours. While being given an extremely small budget, we're also short handed. The structure of my store is (it's an average sized store): 1 store manager (who works at least 50-60 hours a week not on the clock), 2 assistant managers (who work anywhere from 25-40 hours a week), and 2 cashiers (who work 15-20 hours a week). Usually, working 25 hours a week would be a blessing, until you realize that you still aren't breaking $10/hr. "
bad,"Unloading truck and working freight to the sales floor. Only had one assistant manager for about two months so freight working, merchandising, price changing, schematic setting, was all left up to me. Hardest part of the job was not getting help when requested. The most enjoyable part was the compliments from the customers and the rise in sales weekly."
bad,honestly I dislike working in family dollar. we had a lot of thieves in the store and we were never given a security guard. and the work hrs were really bad
bad,I would come in and countdown my register and then begin to help my co-workers place new merchandise onto the floor. I would also make sure the front entrance was neat and clean upon customers entrance of the store.
bad,i am standing at the register doing cash and credit card transactions.
bad,I learn to do projects alone or with groups. managers was great. customer service is hardest and easiest part of the job depending on the consumer.
bad,Challenging workplace with lots of diversity within the patronage of the store.  Always learning something new whether it be part of the job or how to interact with customers.
bad,Some of management was very unorganized making it hard for staff to get some tasks completed
bad,"The crew worked hard, we did basically everything, The store was very compact and could be over crowed at times"
bad,Typical day at work I learned how to develop a store. I was hired temporary only to develop and open the store.  I worked there for about 5 days straight until the store was ready to open.
bad,"They have management working 14 hour shifts with no breaks, and they don't seem to care if you made plans, or if you are sick. That's my personal opinion."
bad,silly rules cost me my job here. was the cashier when my husband went thru the line and that was a no-no.
bad,"I was personally not in pressed with this job. I have learned a lot of thing like different computer functions, date checking and processing of food. they over schedule their employees and have no consideration for family's needs.my typical day was 14 hour shifts stalking shelf's and running registers. While training new cashers and teaching them proper bagging of merchandise. I was responsible for all returns and any thing that went wrong in the store. I enjoyed visiting with costumers and helping them find what they needed. I hated the long shifts and the turn out rate was radicals they either run people off because they don't like them or fir them for theft weather they did it or not. I went through 10 cashiers in 9 months."
bad,stock shelf's order product unload trucks be cashier build customer relationships
bad,I would stock shelves and run the register all day. Enjoyed working with the customers.
bad,Greeted the customers and make sure the shift is clean and up and running for the next crew
bad,Great job and work environment .I love the plan o grams and the advancement  and promoting within.
bad,Greeting Customers letting them know that you see them and if they need help that you will be there to help them
bad,"I did not enjoy my time with this company, in the store I woked at the employees where over worked and underpaid. The manager would leave when ever she wanted and not come back for hours or at all."
bad,I enjoy working with people and try to help them as much as i can.
bad,"At this job i would unload the truck in the morning , stock , and also was a cashier at times. i enjoyed working here at first until the manager started doing certain things that me and my co workers did not like. i had to quit this job because she told me i was going to be fired since i decided i wanted to go back to school"
bad,This store is no longer around in Jacksonville Florida. Once management changed the store and the employees started to take a turn for the worst.
bad,i work lots of hours each week. This job lacks alot of stability in ways that the turn over rate is high. Im interested in becoming a bank teller. the hours will be better i believe. and it should be more stable. I havent obtained any new skills from this job that were not previously learned. i have improved on handling returned product and costumer complaints as well.
bad,I started work around 4pm. I restock the store and when they need help in front I was on register.
bad,"Demanding hours, low pay, long distance. This company as an over all is not the company that I would tell people to apply to if you have children or family."
bad,"Not enough payrolls, raise not good. Alots of turnovers, truck was to big and no room in store.."
bad,"Hardest part of the job was meeting payroll and having to work the extra hours to do that in order for the job to be done.i learned how to unload a $30,000 truck in two hours or less..the most enjoyable part of my job was having employees that enjoyed coming to work for me."
bad,"Customer service, learned how to receive, stock and merchandise displays."
bad,Unload the merchandise off the truck piece by piece in all types of weather for 3 to 4 1/2 hours. Be a back up cashier witch I enjoyed the most about my job. I also enjoyed coaching and teaching young people about life and work ethics. The hardest part of my job is approaching the shop lifters and try to get the merchandise back (very dangerous). But when I got attacked by an employee; Family Dollar did not absolutely nothing and want nothing to do with my heath and safety. From that point I never felt safe again.
bad,The company is a good company they just do not pay very well. You need to be willing to work 3 jobs and get paid for 1.
bad,Not only are the hours unsatisfying but the staff is horrible. The maintainence on the bathroom was horrible and it gave the overall working experience uncomfortable
bad,"Working at family dollar was horrible , the store manager was not a good leader at all , no rules were being followed , poor instructions were being given , just bad management overall"
bad,Was forced to quit and seek other employment somewhere else; was come on to by another store manager....Didn't report the issue in fear of possibly being fired.....
bad,"Starter job for high school kids,  not moms with kids and a family. Mostly part time with minimum wage pay, so it’s not worth it honestly. Like I said great for a younger crowd."
bad,Zero positive complaints long hrs money missing from every check managers needs customer service field managers are rude customer service training needs to be implemented
bad,It's a busy place to work especially certain times of the month. They need a better security system and a better way to keep employees safe. Depending on the manager it can be unfair in the scheduling.
bad,"The hardest part of my job was dealing with the bullying by the manager, I enjoyed working with my customers. & helping them find what they needed. I learned a lot how to run a store as a manager handling the money & making deposit's."
bad,"When I began working for this company, the manager at the time was very unprofessional and not nice at all. I learned a lot from the manager I had when I relocated back to Dallas, TX. She was very patient in teaching me the ropes. Since it was a small team of us, we all worked like a well oiled machine and enjoyed working with each other."
bad,"Very stressful to work their, low compensation, advancement opportunities presented but not worth it for low pay raise and high added responsibilities. Normal day was signing into cash register and balancing money, then taking care of customer transactions and trying to juggle that while stocking items on shelves was very stressful.."
bad,"my typical work day included opening the store, counting in rawer and safe to make sure everything matched up, stocking the shelves, assisting customers with item placement in store, Checking out customers, and answering customer questions as best I could."
bad,"The store manager and the other employees in the store are wonderful and I couldn't ask for a better group of people to work for. "
bad,When I first started with family dollar it was a great place but as time goes on I feel as though they care less and less about their workers. Although I left in Feb of 2017 I still keep in touch with people that work there and they are having an extremely hard time staying with it. If you don't mind the pay and standing on your feed all day this is for you. I did enjoy how active the job was through it all.
bad,"Very fun fast pace job although management often made me feel as if I was stealing and like my work wasn't good enough , even though I never attempted to steal and I am a very hard worker"
bad,"As far as the average Family Dollar assosicate. The pay is minimum wage. and the hours are very random. You never have a set schedule. The pay is terrible for the amount of work you have to do, especially on truck day. The rest of the staff was awesome. The only thing that sucks is the pay"
bad,For assisant manager's they pay 10 a hour that's a liw ball. To say your never home. Dont expect weekends off as store manager's hate to close. Beware there is a rule for store manager to close 2 nights a week but they lie in the system and steal time. Keep in mind you will be unloading trucks and running shifts and giving up your home time all for $10... There's better job out there just apply and search. $10 for and assisant store manager lol really!!!!
bad,"My typical day involved stocking shelves, and completing customer transactions."
bad,Every day was very busy. I had to also take customers orders. the manager was  great and very understanding.
bad,i like working for them had fun an love benign there .love the people i worked with
bad,"it was a fun imvoriment for me i enjoyed my daily work with the staff and i learned alot of indepenence working for the comany and my co-workers didnt do have the things i was doing at the time of my employment there. the truck days was the hardest park of the week, and i enjoyed seeing all the same customers everyday. "
bad,It was ok job and part-time not a place to make a career for me it was something like a summer job because I attended school and the place had been robbed before so I did not feel comfortable there
bad,"I was the assistant manager at this store I was on day shift and the store manager worked mostly night shift. I did not have a lot of personal contact with her and much of the running of the store was left to me. The hardest part of the job was the bad location, it was in a rough area of town and the store did not have a good layout which made product hard to display."
bad,"Was told ill be a cashier soon after i was loading heavy packages resetting a store. I was in the bellport,ny store. Then after unload packages he wanted me to clean some mess his employees made cause they threw tiolet paper and cardboard outside the dumpster even tampons and pads everywhere plus it was raining. I quit after 2 days can careless about familly dollar or its other chains of employment horrible work enviorment."
bad,"Family Dollar is an average place to work. Needs much work on management roles and budgeted hours to get things done."
bad,They are good at their job.. I had good days when i was at work. They are very near and organized. Work with you on your hours. Very flexible schedule
bad,The environment was horrible and the District manager didn't do her job and was just a bad place to be the area was bad. The store was always clean because we worked hard to keep it clean
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is my customers. The hardest part of the job is finding loyal and hard workers. On a typical day, you stay so busy that times seems to fly. There is always work to do."
bad,"Family Dollar was a decent enough job, however management needs weeding from time to time. Pay is decent however overtime is capped. Overall a good company but not forever."
bad,"You work long hours, alone and more work to do than one employee could handle at a minimum pay rate. I learned to balance work over home life which is very sad for a family. Management was good until you did something they didn't approve. They need more employees to run a smoother store and still help customers demands. 13 hour days over a weekend time. The employee I met and bonded with."
bad,The prior CEO was on undercover boss the was fierd starting pay is minume wage lots of multiple working skills are needed they run a skeleton crew always
bad,I Enjoyed Working For The Company.. I Always Came In With A Smile Ready To Work.I Love Meeting New People. I Love To Work. I Have No Complaints With The Company
bad,They expect you to work half of a day alone taking care of customers and getting task done some in which you cannot see the front. No hours for employees managers are overworked.
bad,Family dollar would be a great place to work if they would treat there employees a little better then they do as far as pay and getting hours some days are good and some days you won't to kill some one it can be very stressful at times
bad,"I learned a lot at this job. Recovering, working the truck unloading the truck. But the security is not good I will love to work in a safe place, with less stress."
bad,"i dont enjoy working there, the work load is light and i dont enjoy the retail community at all fwngoiuhd rgknsogu agsernkgou gasrghdu hghdh adghdgh dg dhuigbyd dgjndif dghadfugiy dgnadougy"
bad,This is a great job for someone who is available 24/7 and 365 days out of the year. The customers at this job are very demanding. The store is still under construction. The Store Managers are great and are friendly as well as the employers.
bad,I enjoyed my time at family dollar. working there taught me a lot I had wonderful co-workers they helped anytime I needed them.
bad,"I supervised a team of 7 individuals, conducted daily bank transactions, scheduling, payroll, customer service, hiring and firing, merchandising, store ordering and stocking."
bad,"A typical day at work involved assisting customers, completing task that were assigned to me, cleaning, stocking, handling money, and using good communication skills. While working here I learned how to complete task faster, learned how to use more advanced technology, and deal with difficult customers in a more professional manor. The management was decent. The hardest part of the job was learning exactly where everything was so that I could answer any questions that the customers had. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work with the public and help people in a professional manner."
bad,Good company to work for fast paste company yo move up in.Hardest part was really trying to stay on top of the lost provention.
bad,"i always have been a cashier, but working here tiped the cake! one day i had to chase this man around the back of the building because the alarm went off and he took off. i caught the man and he screamed he didnt have anything, but after i demanded what he took from the store numerous times, he pulled out some socks out his jacket and was scared of me! i guess he figured i couldnt catch him... lol"
bad,"working at family dollar was a great experience indeed, i learned great communication skills , was able to deal with a different verity of people.. the management could be a lot better there very unprofessional.. there wasn't really anything hard about this job.. i enjoyed coming to work everyday"
bad,Managers are overworked. Not enough payroll hours to cover  store. Manager has to cover slack.  Company doesn't care about employees personal lives and family.
bad,They change managers too often. Seems as if no ones stay at that location for longer than 6 months. The store is always cluttered and nasty and the manager doesn't speak to the customers
bad,Family dollar will have you doing the job of 2 ppl for less the pay.  They cut hours every week leaving some stores behind on task that needs to be completed in the store.
bad,Although this job got me through school budget I am grateful how ever they treat their employees like cramp The air has been out in our store for 10 days and we have had to work in extreme heat. Registers haven't worked in months upper management is horrible
bad,It as sooo long ago i worked there i truly cant remember full details BUT i know i didnt have any issues with the store or company. i'd say go apply and work
bad,"The best part of working there where the customers during the holiday."
bad,I love my job and the people I work with it's a great place to work the people I manage are fun great people who you can have fun around. I would recommend it highly
bad,Being a cashier you greet customers as they walk into your store. Help your customers find things they are looking for always with a great smile and nice appearance
bad,A typical day at work was good we would set the store up and bring in product/ What I learned at family is that you have to move fast. The management there was good overall. My co-workers was great and fair always ready to work and never had a bad attitude. The hardest art of the job was getting the product off of the truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was I knew most of my co-workers
bad,I assigned tasked to associates as well as worked with associates in keeping the store safe and stocked for cutomers shopping experience. Operated a cash register and kept track of daily sales and transactions.
bad,Great place to work!! I really enjoyed the time I spent with the company. They had flexible hours as well as very good leadership personal in place. Great Company.
bad,A typical day at work was fun never a dull moment. I learned a lot good customer service good management skills how to be a good manager over employees.
good,"Dont get a misunderstanding, I loved working for family dollar, the customs were the ones who made me feel like  I was excited to go to work, but the store manager down to list pro has no STRUCTURE. I feel like CORPORATE   should change the way the employee "
good,"Coprate job is all that needs to be said"
good,"I don't have a good team or A Manager that I could talk to about better ways to improve the store. Working for Family Dollar has its good and bad..The good is you can get the hours if need be,the bad is you may not get a good team"
good,U do a lot of everything within the store mostly ran register management isn’t nice nothing u do is good enough very unappreciative but if you are willing to work and can ignore the bullying you get all the hours u want
good,It a good fast moving job its lots of good people there just dont give anyone good hours to work working 3.days a week cant help pay bills that the down side to that job the hours an the pay is not good at all.
good,Wouldn't recommend this job to anyone . They do not pay enough but want to work you like a slave. They air wasn't working . It was terrible. They dont give enough hours either
good,When I work at Family Dollar my core value of the company was very high But as time went by I realized I was mistaking my values for their values. it started to become very noticeable that the only value in this company is to work and make money for it by any means necessary and if you speck up on any things that needed correcting and structure get thank you next.
good,she is all about her looking good and her goals not her enplyees the place is a mess n very rude . they can never keep a worker its always new faces .
good,"Have to work mandatory 52 hours with never happens you may end up working 60+ hours no overtime.  The upper management is trash  (depends on the person )"
good,"the job had bad management, it was just a job but for me to worked there again it will definitely be a no that's not a job i will do again it was just an experience that i  had."
good,Go into work and do what was told to do and once you’re done we had to make sure that we cleaned the area we worked in and when needed be on the cash register
good,Working in this company is a very busy place. There is always something going on and something to do. However u feel that there is no sense of accomplishment or recognition
good,Family dollar used to be a fun compelling place to work. Since the buy out it is not. Everyone even corperate employees fear for their jobs and store level expectations are truly unrealistic with the payroll provided. Salaried store managers forced to work 70+ hours a week with no compensation
good,I use to love my job at family dollar. Then after being promoted to a Store manager i was only paid for 52 hours of work in a week even tho i was working over 70 hours a week. Every day was a battle between keeping or losing my job. I was told if i didnt unload and work 300+ trucks by myself i wasnt doing my job and would be replaced. told i had to be in my store from open to close 730am-1030pm or i could turn my keys in.
good,"This is a family company"
good,Family Dollar is an enjoyable place to work but the management here is not very good. It would be so much better if someone else would take over and be fair to the employees.
good,Treated you like they were doing you a favor by working for them. Didn't care about your personal life or issues made you work in sewage with no bathrooms for weeks
good,its ok work not a desired career good just to make money while in college. starting of part time. and assistant manager should be paid more for the responsibilitys
good,"Although they gave 9 hr which is a good intermediate start rate the company has a very bad turn around rate while I was there for just over a year I had been through 3 managers and even more Assistant managers, I could barely remember the other cashiers names because they were in and out so fast. The store also needed to have security but none was provided we were usually only two people in the store and with no security it was scary some times. There was an instance where one of the employees got caught stealing and so they went and interviewed all of the other employees asking us questions which is not good for the employee environment."
good,"Really fun workplace. Flexible with your schedule. It's always busy so there is always something to stay busy  around the store. Stock, recover , receiving truck is very easy."
good,"Very fast paced understaffed, high volume of inventory constantly changing layouts, management is very disrespectful to employees won't ever work for the company again"
good,They run a small crew so the employees have more to do during the day. Stocking products and cashier. Customer service is top priority. Long shifts for management.
good,"I'm constantly checking out customers, and when I get a break I fix and stock shelves. I learned how to deal with difficult customers and employees. The hardest part was being told I wasn't working hard or fast enough. I loved the decent nice customers who didn't treat me like I owed them something."
good,"I liked the job, but was not trained . I was told to read the directons on everything. I was even left alone on my first day."
good,"My everyday includes opening and closing of stores. Manage 3 associate on daily tasks. Inventory, data entry and customer service is performed every day all day I've learned a lot of the many years that I've worked for this company about rules and enforce them help trained other workers on all stores procedures. my job is so natural comes natural customer service is the best part of my job and the most enjoyable apart is the help of me assisting people"
good,This company makes money off their employees backs with no respect for the employees when you need time off you can forget it
good,"its a nice place to work, kinda fast paced and it can get slow at times but there's always something to be done wether your ringing up a customer or recovering shelves."
good,"Family Dollar hires warm bodies. They hired me even when I disclosed that I need surgery on my knee very soon. I told them I would not be able to work more than 5 hours per day for 8 weeks after the surgery and they agreed to hire me under these terms. They said my limitations after surgery would be no problem to accommodate and encouraged me to get the surgery done as soon as possible. I accepted the job and got the surgery.  My schedule was never less than 10 hours per day with no breaks whatsoever. When I reminded the manager and even came in with a note from my surgeon stating that the knee was not healing properly due to over use the manager said he would accommodate me, but again it did not happen. I ended up having to quit the job due to my health. "
good,there could be better pay and hours but for now its a help in assisting with what I can with my family and children
good,"Each day I looked forward to seeing and interacting with the customers. I've learned how to set up a store, stock and merchandise the items. Management is very insightful. My co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is catching a shoplifter. I enjoy the entire job."
good,"I learned how to open and close a store, manage money, the most enjoyable part of my job would be my customer."
good,I been at family dollar I’m the only black for 3 years I go over in beyond for my store manger never missed a day but I’m paid poorly and the district manager doesn’t have our back we get belted cursed out by customers and they steal continuously and we have run outs daily we have no protection or safety
good,Glad to know now that I no longer work for them that they have security now. The management in this company need to care about the workers up under them.
good,It was an okay job until things took a turn and nothing was right. management and corporate could not get along. Made things a little less enjoyable..
good,Great friendly place to work.  If you weren't on a personal level with the manager she didn't give many hours to you.  I requested days off and I volunteered for more hours both didn't work out.
good,When I started working there they wouldn’t teach me anything unless I asked for help. It was my first time working a cash register and I basically had to learn how to do it by myself. The only thing they taught me was to sign into the register. When I left there I was learning how to stock and put things away. They also had me clean if I stayed until the store closed. It was a bad place to work at and I won’t work there again.
good,I chose to write this because while working at family dollar the district manager doesn’t put his team on the fundamentals of working together they work against each other.
good,they pay salary @ 52 hours then demand all your time. I was working 70-80 hours weekly. they dont give their store managers enough payroll to run a store and often times i was left alone in the store from opening until late afternoon.
good,"It is very unorganized, and the management sucks.. they pay so little for a big job. People steal for there . It’s just to much that be going on and it’s not worst working there"
good,"My review for this company very little words.Poor communication with management.For that reason,store is unacceptable to work for.If communication and appropriate changes where made Family dollar would be a great company to work for."
good,Good job for high school/college job. Not the greatest compensation depending on what minimum wage is in your state.  Can get hectic around the holidays season
good,"Most filthiest place I've ever been. Management is poor and not worth the time working there. Not only was there no break room for employees, but even the stock room was full of flies and just general filth. When dealing with Management, they were so quick to point fingers instead of looking at themselves at the problem."
good,"The store manager was great, help with hrs and did whatever she could, it was the (dm) that put me on the lowest pay, and after a year still had to wait 5 mouths be for a raise, but the new works got pay way more then I did, he didnt care about the store, we ask for help cuz 3 poeple quit still nothing he would do to help us,"
good,"At the time I was there, there was no consistency on hours. I was told I would advance but never was given a time to start training for the advance in career. The pay was very low due to low hours, and did not meet my cost of living. The store at the time of my employment was a mess with stock from the truck always in the isles because none of the workers could get to it due to low staff. The manager was always leaving for military training and never made consistent attempts to straighten the store up. Overall it was a horrible experience for me."
good,I go to work do my job and go home. Its hard to work for a company that the rules change daily. No raises for being there 6 months or even a year and its nothing but drama
good,"It is a fast paced (which is good) they work you like you are 3 people in one. Hours are 20 or less a week. schedule is unpredictable, management is not good."
good,They need to monitor the behavior of their management staff more carefully. My manager was eventually fired due to his inappropriate behavior towards customers and staff. This is what led to my resigning.
good,"Barely any hours, not enough pay, no security, not fairly treated by managers or executives, no paid time off, no overtime even though it is badly needed because of th stores appearance"
good,"This company was a company that over worked their employee, raises were base on if the DM think that you didn't let stock or merchandise go out the door."
good,I was working there for about 2 and a half years I was part time all that time. The managers did not want to make me full time. I would do most of the work and they gave me my first raise at the end of 30 cents. They employee a lot of low life’s.
good,It was a hard task keeping that store together. It was very Un organized and the pay was not enough for the work that was being performed. I hope they have made it better now
good,This job is dramatic. ALL the girls that work there flirt with every Latin or black guy that comes in. Latin Asian girl has 3 guys coming to see her and a white girl has intercourse in the parking lot.
good,Loved my job with Family Dollar until Dollar Tree toke over now there is no suability lake of communication and the people pushed into rolls they know nothing about
good,Management at family dollar was unfair and lack to meet my demands. do to this it caused me to leave but the money is good but only if was better manage.
good,"My experience with Family Dollar was long-lived. Starting as a cashier and advancing to a store manager position over the years. In my last few months at family Dollar, I saw and heard a lot of things that were unethical and I just didn't agree with. Although I loved my job and enjoyed my customers, I had no choice but to put this part of my life behind me. It was very hard to find work/life balance. The long hours and constant worry were starting to take a toll on my life!"
good,Besides getting robbed often the customer was decent after that got to know and under you management didn't really care about you or your life and the pay was not good
good,Depending on the day it is will determine how your day typically goes because we get our vendors and trucks in on different days. Also working the over stock and the truck its-self varies. Learned that people (customers) just do not care if you just fixed the products in the store they will ruin it. The people i work with are nice and very hard working most of them at least. Hardest part is trying to keep the store clean since customers do not care if they ruin the store. Most enjoyable you sometimes meet friendly people that do care.
good,"Management will give hours to who they want, not who's doing the best job. I really like the company but I could not move up because management wanted to give the position to family"
good,I do not like the work place. the managers are not equip to mange. The pay does not meet all the work i put in for this job. Break is to short and my employees do  not work well with others.
good,"they don't care about the employees"
good,"edifying management was a tad unprofessional, unorganized and unconcerned for their employees. the customers on the other hand were great. some people were unpleasant to deal with but it was only for a short while."
good,when you have an awesome DM your district can run smoothly we had one but she left. our rvp here is not nice and has not an ounce of customer service or people relations for that matter. we have an awesome field human resources manager though he is a man of his word. I was promoted to store manager with no training and pretty much had to learn as I went so to speak. the hours are long even though as a SM you're required to work 52 hours a week i rarely saw 52 more like 60 sometimes 70 but were only paid for 52 because SM's are salaried employees
good,I overall enjoyed working at Family Dollar but the store manager was hard to work with. She was unwilling to work with my schedule at all.
good,This is a company that is geared towards anyone under the age of 30 that has patience with people and can tolerate a lot of nonsense
good,"A typical day at work would be me greeting customers with a friendly smile, assisting them with finding products, and stocking inventory. The best part of the job was meeting new people, the hardest part of the job was not being able to work full time."
good,Working for Family Dollar takes patients and you have to be willing towork.
good,"I believe family dollar over works their employees and under pays them. However I did have some good days at work. I learned a lot of new things, how to run a store, create store orders, create schedules, handle bank deposits and unloading and stocking merchandise. My co-workers were fantastic. I would have to say the hardest part of my job was knowing I deserved to be payed more due to the amount of work I put in and the dedication I had to my job."
good,I made a mistake and instead of given me a chance they fired me.
good,"Helping customer ,making sure the customer come back making sure I recover everything and stock shelf."
good,i really liked the job i just wish the manager kept her promise and making me manager like i trained for.
good,This is not a great place to work. I can barely feed my kids after bills but I’ve been denied food stamps. So we scrape by day to day. I still look for other work everyday.
good,Had to work 60 hours a week to just manage the store. Never enough payroll. Manager above me was more of a dictator than a manager. Advancement is always an option.
good,Anytime I went to management to let them know I could not continue traveling to different locations or I needed morning shifts they would barely schedule me for the next month and would not honor what I applied for
good,"It is an okay job just do not have enough help and j am left along in the store with no one else just me working by myself I know I am a manager, but it's not safe at all in there Begin along."
good,"Good place to work but didn’t work many hours and no benifits. Great service and other co workers, just wanted to improve with better job Opportunity’s. Everyone was always pleased and happy!"
good,Basically work by yourself from morning to mid afternoon. Never enough man hours to have help in the stores to complete all the task necessary to run a million dollar store. No balance
good,"I have never worked for us a lying individual in my life. I felt extremely disposable, I worked like a dog and got paid next to nothing. I caught my manager on multiple occasions shaving time"
good,Too much drama with company staff. Customers can be to hard to handle. Very long hours with alot of intrupted when on breaks. Not enough communication with management and other employees.
good,"family dollar is a great company , they expect alot for what they pay you , need more staff , a better security system , need more experience managers"
good,"If you're not a strong, self reliant person, not a good company to work for. Very little upper management help at all! And no personal time at ALL. I loved my store and my staff, but they closed my store and took our money and benefits away."
good,Family Dollar lays on the work load very thick. You're basically expected to be 5 people at once. They give you many tasks but very little hours for the store. You are not allowed to work over those hours. I had to unload 900 piece trucks alone once a week
good,Management sucks. No structure in certain stores and they always get robbed. They don't care about your safety. Some days it's only one person at store working
good,Production and supplies were accurate. Store was unorganized. Store needed to have similar items on the same isles and shelfs. Helping customers was the best. Carrying the merchandise for the elderly to their cars made me feel I was really helping the customers that needed the most help.
good,The most valuable assets I learned from Family Dollar is growth and leading a crew. Though the job was never easy it had small rewards at times. Family Dollar helped me grow more into a leadership role to ensure a job was done and handeled accordingly.
good,"Good for pay however the atmosphere is chaotic, customers are rude, no security (gets robbed) and managers play favoritism with hours. No raises or benefits."
good,"They dont guve employees breaks or lunches, they're pay is under by far, they have to lift a pieces by hand coming from truck, Any if their store dont have any air, store are nasty managers dont care, Store Managers dont work at all Sundays. This is really a bad company."
good,not the best place to work at all long hours pay not the best and you really have to split yourself in half here not the best ..........................
good,The mangers had a really really really really really really bad attitude they just threw me out no proper training At alll it's a shame they are only about money
good,Learn a lot of great skills. Fun being in control helping and solving problems for customers and employees. Fast pace working environment. Management is a big responsibility and it takes a strong individual to handle the job.
good,"It’s an easy job , but requires lots of teamwork to manage the store properly and that’s not easy for everyone. With better teamwork the store will be better respected and taken care of ."
good,"n/a do not want to, only good to work for as a cashier, not saying anymore, long hours, lots of hours working alone, getting to know fellow employees,"
good,"I personally would not make a career out of Family Dollar, however it was a good step towards where i wanted to be. The job can be very vigorous and requires a lot of heavy lifting daily."
good,it was ok but I wouldn't work there again or recommend anyone to work there. sometimes you have a good day and sometimes the day cn be vey busy and over whelming
good,This company is not Family oriented . It does offer some experience in working with public.  I love my job and think the customer comes first. They should offer break time if it's only 10 minutes. They should also find a easier way to unload the truck
good,It can be a fun place to work if the store manager wasn't there. He didn't seem to care about his j ob or employees that he's hired. He always expected his employees that he has just hired too move fast and they had no idea or things went.
good,"typical day at work would include always being a cashier which meant at the end of shift counting drawer and adding up the total of items bought by customer. I caught on quick, wouldnt be a job for someone who dont catch on quickly. no time to do so. hardest part of job was organizing items and doing shop back. most enjoyable part of job was being the cashier."
good,"no comment"
good,Most of all the employees that work in the store were worse than the customers. They were hateful and rude when the customers asked for certain items where. 2 of the cashiers that worked at the store with me were always moody and didn't like most of the customers mainly because they had altercation outside the store. The manager thought it was all about her. She was arguing with one of the customers because her child fell over stuff they left on the floor.
good,"Good environment to work in. Friendly staff and manager as well, with flexible scheduling and hours. Good place to work if your thinking about getting into retail."
good,My last few years at Family Dollar was right after the Dollar Tree purchase.  There was no clear direction or goal from management.  They were focused on getting new people into the positions and not promoting from within.
good,I liked my job well I should I say I liked my job but for the amount of time I'm in the store I'm under paid .... And that's my problem I want to be paid for the hours I work
good,"If Family Dollar would pay more it would be the perfect job. They require a lot of work, but do not pay well. My managers were cool and very understanding. It has its busy moments and it has its laid back moments."
good,Not a job you want if you want to advance and make enough money to support your family. Swing shifts are horrible and not being able to plan for your life has many set backs
good,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at Family Dollar because they get robbed often while I was working at Family Dollar I got robbed 4 times."
good,If you like working 60 + hours a week plus weekends then this is the job for you. Management is constantly understaffed as well as the hourly employees. Quota and long hours comes before anything else causing high turnover and accidents. Reprimanded when quota is not met but it can't be met with turnover.
good,Family Dollar does not have a balanced work life balance.
good,The management staff had a lack of nowledge of distribution of a balance of work between employes the staff was very unfortunate clear to the employee s of what needed to be done
good,Family Dollar lacked in the management department and the manager at the time had a high turn around rate because no one stayed there for long term. You didnt know your hours till the day of the next work week. But working with the customers was a blast!! Had a great relationship with them all .
good,"It pays for a highschool student. I'm almost 24 not making more than $100 + every week... Unacceptable. They need to up the pay, be more flexible and fair with scheduling and everyone deserves a break."
good,It was a nice place to work but as a single mother they did not work with me in schedules..i liked my co-workers and enjoyed working with everyone but the manager was unsatisfactory.
good,"This is a company with a lot of benefits and a variety of serviced for its customers. But the balance between the amount of work and the available time to performance is really unbalanced.As an Assistant Manager, the responsibilities for the position in a short amount of hours include: Restock, Cashier, Recovery, unload trucks, supervise, etc."
good,"A typical day at work, depending on if I'm on the register It's fast paced and my only option for help is to ring the bell, patiently waiting for the employee that I work with takes about 1 too 2 minutes to get up to the register, So I immediately apologizes for the time that they've been standing up there. ( Of course said with a loving smile)."
good,working here is alright but not most of the time.  You do not get any medical insurance or any paid vacation or anything. You are made to take breaks even though you are not there 8 hours and they are an hour long so the company doesn't go over budget.
good,"At first glance it looks inviting however the work is hard and strenuous. There are many times you are left alone for hours all while trying to help customers and finish the enormous amount of work needing to be done. Shoplifting is a huge problem within the chain and the Corporate office will not add additional cameras to assist in deterring this from happening. The corporate office is consistently changing rules and regulations without advanced warning, such as when you are suppose to get a raise and they decides raises will no longer be available until a specific time. Oh, and they believe that every employee is a thief."
good,Opening and closing the store. Doing the weekly schedule being a leader. Doing task that need to be done. Working beyond the hours you are supposed to.
good,I learned to always come in with a great attitude and energize because its alot you have to do at once far as handle customers helping them find items why on the phone also getting the work your manager said get done also keep store clean and organize for customers to find items safely and easily. And im always up for the challenge i love it but now that i have that down pack i wanna move up.
good,"Loved Dealing with the customers and satisfying their needs, it was a good place to work, but there was no hours there, and manager wasnt very pleasant to work for."
good,I liked the people I worked with. I felt it was a lot for such little pay. I did like cashiering because I'm a great people person. There was needed improvement as far as updating which I had told the manager many times.
good,"I worked anywhere from a 31 hour week to a 40 some hour week, even though I was working fulltime my supervisor had me on the schedule as part time, so I never accumulated any vacation time. In turn when my grandfather passed away and I had to call her I was pushed by only get 14 hours the next week of work because my supervisor was mad I had a family emergency and had to call out."
good,"Family Dollar is a place to work while you are between jobs it's really not meant to make a career. I learned a lot while being employed there, I learned how to put together displays, how to rotate product, and how to order product for the store"
good,"If you are 18 and want to enter into the working world, this is a good place to start off. You don't have to have any experience, they'll teach you everything you need to know. One day you are stocking up the shelves, the next you are unloading the truck and another day you will work on the register."
good,Good place to work . flexible work schedules. You only get one holiday off a year which is hard if you have family/children.
good,"A regular day is running the register, front facing, and customer service. I learned how to stock and make sales. My manager was never really there during my work hours but the assistant manager was a sweet woman. I really didn't get a chance to talk to my co-workers because there was just one worker and one manager on duty at all times but my assistant manager was understand. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the customers when I was the only one working. I enjoyed the customers and the friendly atmosphere."
good,The store Manager when i first was hired did not train me very well and when something was wrong gave us all an attitude. up side i got to meet new people. Enjoyed working with the other staff member. i also really took a lot of pride in my work.
good,I had no issues with customers just the higher up managers treating me like I didn't exist. I did enjoy working there it was easy and the customers were sweet
good,"Family Dollar gave me the opportunity to grow as a store manager, but the higher management was too demanding with the shortage of employees. Family Dollar do not treat their employees fairly and think that everyone is a thief."
good,Working retail is hard work with little compensation. Physical labor and working with the public is hard.  Very little chance to move up.
good,It was a part time job. They did not tell me there was a robbery and was told not tell me. I was not getting paid enough. the other co workers were very nice.
good,"This job was a lot of fun because I really enjoy people. I liked the people I worked with.  "
good,"Responsible for training new assistant managers and customer service reps  ● Perform sales, customer service and cash register operations  ● Handle all logistical inventory as it relates to the store  ● Recognized for outstanding customer service from peers and customers  ● Responsible for unloading truck inventory for store  ● Responsible for transporting large amounts of funds to and from bank for store operating procedures "
good,"A typical workday included running the cash register and putting stock away as well as straightening up the shelves called ""facing"". The store when I got hired was very messy, cluttered, and unorganized. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I tried myself, the work as a group to maintain professionalism in the workplace did not sustain. Helping out and interaction with the customers was the most enjoyable part of my day, and the least enjoyable was the frustration that came with feeling like I was the only one who really cared about how the store maintained."
good,"the hardest part of this job is being able to do the job with limited payroll.  the best part of the job is of course the customers.  they are literally the highlight of my day.  we have regulars, and ""newbies"" and they are all so much fun!  the regulars will stand there and talk your ear off, and then you can make regulars out of the new customers just by speaking to them, and being kind.  i love to see people's faces more than once in my store, it makes me feel like i changed their mind on where to shop on a daily basis."
good,"This job requires a lot from you. You should just throw away your personal life now."
good,"Job had no security and was very dangerous the only things I liked was the experience of talking to different people and helping them with whatever they needed. The store managers would assign me to work night shift all the time and only certain people could work morning shift, they really didn't care about you or your well being."
good,Work was constantly moving at a slow pace. We always seemed to be out of merchandise that are customers were mainly looking for. the hardest part of the job was bad management.
good,"work days were always the same and nothing really changed all that much. The management wasn't permanent so it was really hard to full get things done around the store. I learned how to use the basic point-of-sales system and how to recover stock and unload our receiving. It was a typical dollar store, not very exciting."
good,"While working as a cashier at Family Dollar, I improved my patience and self control skills while interacting with the customers."
good,"it was always a struggle people had a bad attitude all the time. upper management promised you thinks but never came through.  the customers were great.  I had 4 managers, 3 assistant managers and multiple employees.  Low paying"
good,"I was a high school student, so I came in right after school everyday and didn't leave till 9 p.m. I learned how to deal with money transactions and how to properly address customers who stole or had a sour attitude about the store. I didn't have many co-workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with parents who did watch their children and let them destroy the aisles and mess things up and not pay for what they did."
good,"Unless you like children, this is an okay place to work at.  Other than that, it's like every other workplace."
good,"Manger of certain stores were lazy"
good,A typical day at work was kind busy being that everyone goes to family dollal.. I learned how to be a cashier... The management was good.. The co workers was awesome to work with. The hardest part about this job was people coming in and stealing from the store. The most enjoyable part about this job was I love working around people.
good,everyday along with maintaining daily operations i has to deal with trying to catch thiefs due to fact that if the shrink level was to high i would lose part of my bonus for the year. but i did enjoy the employees that i had they would all do what was expected of them in a timely manner due to the training from myself.
good,It was usually slow at the store. Not the nicest customers or co-workers.
good,work long hours or not enough hours. don't have a manager an the assistant changes the schedule too much during the week for no reason.
good,"The most enjoyable part of being an Assistant Store Manager was meeting new people and talking with my regular customers on a daily basis. Also, being able to coach and train my employees with their position descriptions."
good,It depended on who i worked with on weather it was fun or not but generally speaking the only problem i had with this job was after it became a hostile work environment for me. I learned not to tolerate anyone hitting me and no i am not even joking. Life is too short to work for a place that stresses you out.
good,a typical day starts off with me balancing the drawer. after I balance the drawer I relieve the cashier on duty. I learned that the level of professionalism must be maintained at all times.  Management was dedicated to the values of the store. My co-workers and I were cordial. The hardest part of the job was customer complaints. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying customer complaints.
good,"inventory specialist"
good,hard working .learn to hanlde more than one task at a time .enjoy working with co worker in a forever changing work enviorment
good,"I love opening the store. I always come early and get as much done as possible before opening. There are always people waiting for us to open. Sundays I work 7:30am to 9:30 pm. I am usually alone until about 2:00 pm. During the week I work some days 2-9:30 & others 7:30-4pm. Sundays the new sales for the week go up, signs, stickers, papers, etc. Cigarette counts are done twice daily & entered into computer. Also, cycle counts are done Sundays by me and Wednesdays by the manager. In any spare moments, we are unloading inventory and putting it up and setting new displays. "
good,It was an okay place to work but it really wasn't safe to work there its was a very busy store most of the managers are ok not all of them its not a hard job to do the most enjoyable part of the job getting off of work
good,I like the people I work with and the majority of the customers that come in I have learned how to do schematics and set up displays and endcaps how to follow a planner It gets frustrating when you don't have enough staff to get everything done
good,it was a short but brief experince and i truly think that it would be okay for a starter job for people who are in high school or going to college
good,"My time at Family Dollar was a learning experience. In the 2 years i was there we went through 3 store managers 4 asst. managers, numerous cashiers. Before i was released of my duties from asst. manager via text message with no reason, i was the last one of the original crew when i started in 2010."
good,Always had something to do. the hours were good. didnt hav a social life
good,busy
good,alot of joyful customer contact but not to friendly or professional managers
good,"A typical day at work would include assisting customers throughout the store no matter what the issue was. The best thing i like about the job were the customers. All of my co-workers were female and did too much gossip. I learned trust ONLY yourself. The working enviroment was so unstable, the manager walked out."
good,"I""ve somewhat enjoyed my time working there. But it just wasn't the type of job that fitted what i was looking for."
good,"A typical day at work would be going in and processing the previous days paperwork then opening the store and taking care of the customer's needs and sometimes I would be there the whole entire day. What I learn is store operations, time management, leadership, how to be flexible and how to make work fun when it is so stressful. I led the management and I had two of the best that did more than a superb job. The hardest part of the job was getting an overlarge truck and having to unload by myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning to do schematics and merchandising so creativity plays a big part in it. For the time I was with the company I was very happy and felt like I finally found a home and I fit in."
good,higher management unfair there was favoritism that should not have happened.
good,"I have had a lot of struggle with this company from day one. At the current store I work at there is a large amount of unreported thefts, the manager and employees tend to look the other way. It’s sad to see a company hurt by one stores lack in proper management."
good,The customers can be difficult. The cash registers and technology is very outdated doesn’t always work you only get about a four hour shift as a cashier so the pay isn’t the best. This job is also a lot of one person doing everything.
good,"It is a ok job for a student. We don’t work that many hours only 12 hours a week, who can live off that! Family Dollar should give their employees better pay and better hours. Once I only had 8 hours for 1 week."
good,Work was fine till i got robbed at gun point and my manager put my life and other staffs lives in danger and then i  was asked to open the the store the next morning. No benefits or help was offered and the manger was fired.
good,No breaks were offered and there wasn't a break room. After my employment I told them I needed a break. So breaks then became mandatory and they made a break room. Also you had to do some work off the clock at the end of your shift. Like putting returns back.
good,"Mid level management was very unsupportive,. They would not let me hire even though the store was short staffed after I found internal fraud and terminated 4 associates."
good,I love our customer's and the smiling faces some are varry friendly and i love the kids that come in varry great place to work if you are starting out
good,To much favoritism. I was hired as a full time assistant manager and I was switched to part time without knowing  you aren’t allowed to do overtime. I honestly wouldn’t recommend family dollar to anyone
good,Not very organized and time management is poor. Manager I worked for was very unorganized and very short tempered. I would work for Dollar General any day over Family Dollar.
good,The day at work was so busy and over whelming. Working here taught me that you have to be on your toes. Management was so pour here they was very racist. The hardest part of the job was unloading a truck by yourself or being left alone in the store for more than 6 hours at a time. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the people.
good,The family dollar life style is very hard on a young female. The management is not very open to new ideas. I had many shifts of little to no help. The money wasn’t bad but I don’t recommend.
good,"Great manager that ran my store but the company overall sucks and does not care anything about their employees at all whatsoever. You never were guaranteed the amount of hours you were promised when hired, 1 break per shift, way to much stress for barely making ends meet. And I worked in one of the highest theft crimes stores in my district and we were supposed to make sure no one was stealing thats funny"
good,Worked there 12 years. Was a victim of cost cutting. they replaced me with someone making 60% less in order to shore up their bottom line prior to being bought out.
good,If you can't motivate yourself there is none coming from FD management. Typical day starts with early morning opening and no associates until 12 or 1300 so you are stuck running the register and watching the thieves unable to work stock or set mods until someone comes in.  Like the retail interaction.
good,"Management stresses out everyone. They want u to be an octopus with super speed seriously. They expect so much from these managers most of which is impossible when you dont have proper staffing/hrs. Top store, literally #1, in the district but they still complain. They cut payroll hrs too much to want so much done. Hrs suck unless its holiday season! 40hrs or more Sept.-Jan. Then its down hill from there 30, 20, or, 10! Good hours in the winter tho....."
good,"The district Managers were rude and wanted tasks to be completed but didn’t want to pay employees the hours to do them. The constant schedule cuts, lack of workers on each shift made it impossible to fulfill the tasks that were handed to us. I worked there for years without a pay raise only promises of one when I would ask."
good,"My job at dollar tree was dirty and not clean, after organizing and putting items away after a long hard day of work I would come home and my hands would be black, the store was never clean or  organized, I didn’t like working there but needed the job. Employees were rude to each other and sometimes customers"
good,Did not feel I was safe working for this company due to cut allocated hours a week. I worked bymyself everyday except one day a week. Stores robbed constantly and still the company has stores having one person a shift working  by themselves and not making them feel safe.
good,"Lacking in any real managerial interaction, the only time upper management was seen was in the event someone was in trouble. Customers were fantastic and the day to day operations became mundane after some time working there."
good,Nothing to say. It’s a job. Just don’t transfer out of your store to help. If you get a good team your good to go if not there’s not chance. It can be tough some times
good,Did not like the job much store was unorganized and dirty short on staff careless management not enough hours not even enough part-time hours horrible pay.
good,"Overall, it just depends on store managers. Most of the tome though, family dollar management can never run their store gracefully which makes all the staff do about 40% of managers job."
good,"It was a great first job and helped me gain skills. Additionally, the job got me in the habit of how it feels to work a fast-paced environment. Also, I learned how to talk to people, so my customer service skills improved."
good,Family Dollar need to improve on the care of there works and listen to there worry’s and complaints. Family Dollar need to proved a safe environment for there workers
good,"Cost of living vs. wages and hours allowed, it is struggle to maintain. There is a lot of conflicting routines that make it difficult to execute efficiency."
good,"My coworkers are a great bunch of people.  Customers enjoy how we try to keep our store clean.  "
good,"Family Dollar Management in my area is very disrespectful. Would create group chats for schedule distribution but exclude me. Barely touched thirty hours in a single work week, when i was hired under the premise of full-time. No registered breaks, breaks are mandatory but not allowed with minimal time to eat no help getting your work done."
good,"Opening procedures required to count your till before opening. Customer service skills, unloading of freight and stocking. Handling of printing shelf prices and stickering non placed items in store. Restocking shelves and pulling expired or closeout merchandise. Break down of trash and daily clean up of store. Tobacco counts daily and vendor correspondence. Knowledge of register procedures and ability to except cash, check or credit. Handling planograms and resets daily."
good,"I worked at a Family Dollar that was in a rough area. Had to keep an eye out for thieves, while steady restocking the store. Cleaning up spills, sweeping and unloading trucks. Really enjoyed the co-workers I worked with."
good,"It was ok not the best place to work but not the worst either . "
good,Staff is always the worst  of  the worst. Cut throat.  Managers have cashiers working for 6 hour shifts so they don't have to give them breaks. Way too much risk with no reward worth doing it.
good,Faced paced & a job is a job. You have days that’s stressful but other than those minor things it’s ok for the most part. It just the security is what’s bad.
good,I enjoyed working for Family dollars however there were times where I didnt want to go to work due to my safety but I had to anyways. I was think the culture in your store is what you make it but leadership from corporate is distance.
good,"I consider it just an okay place to work. It pays my bills, but that's about it. I am not making it a secret that I'm seeking other employment opportunities."
good,The manager kept cutting my hours because he didn't want me to do my job and help customers who wanted help finding things within the store. He stole money and then in turn tried to fire me. But the assistant manager backed me on it because she knew for a fact I didn't. Plus the store manager refused to rerun camera because he knew he was wrong. I quit because no employee deserves to feel unsecure in their job position when they do well at their job.
good,"My time working for family dollar wasn’t really a pleasant experience the manager wanted us to basically stop people from stealing even though that’s not apart of our job that is for lost prevention or security guard, I’ve seen my manager get into physical fights with people that are stealing, I’ve seen here take breaks from employees checks even mine even through we didn’t go on break. Dirty break room flys everywhere food everywhere, wanted me to basically do the rush job and clean up fast when the big bosses would come. She would always be on her phone talking the whole shift. I’ve never worked for a company like that before or seen anything like that before."
good,If I had no children to take care of I would stay. A all evening job is just not for me. Family dollar is a wasteful company they would rather throw merchandise away than donate it to those in need.
good,Its okay to work here if you're a highschool kid but as an adult the pay isnt worth it. Too much stealing internal and external and not alot of advancement within the company.
good,"High pace retail store.Less pay roll and not enough help"
good,"It’s a good company but sometimes they treat people like trash . There are no benefits, no discount , and you do a lot of work they don’t even pay you enough for that ."
good,I like working here the only problem I had was management they couldn't get anything together we're never on the same page and the only thing I really don't like about Family Dollar is you have to work there for 6 months to get holiday pay and the only holiday they pay for his Christmas
good,"Beside the fact that this company does promotes from within, there are many things wrong with higher managers. Things like favoritism and low pay rate as well as non negotiable pay raise, has made working at this company extremely difficult."
good,Family dollar has went down hill since new management came to this store. Constant mess. Not friendly anymore. Manager is always out side smoking and on her phone or talking to someone. Also takes forever to get checked out.
good,"Always greet customers,and get out in a timely matter.Solving problems on prices and make sure that they are satisfied.Watching out for shoplifters.Managing the money to the best of my ability"
good,the one thing i can say about Family Dollar is that they do hire up first from the inside first. what i dont like is that the stores always getting rob and the head people dont care they expect you to open rite back up after the police leave. They really dont care about use or your well being.
good,This job is very physical and demanding which I personally enjoyed every day! Unfortunately not everyone works as hard as I do and I was finding myself having to pick up the work slack on a daily basis.
good,work at family dollar was good. but was a lot because there were only two assiatance managers. and it took a big toll on my son cause i was hardly home. managmenet was aswome. cause was all worked togetther to keep the store looking nice! the hardest part of the job was dealing with theifs! everyday there was someone steeling! the DM never did anything about it! the most joyful part of the job was learing something new eveyday! or making a customers day!
good,I enjoyed working at the Family Dollar under the female manager. She was fair and she knew her stuff. The next manager after her didn't know what she was doing so everything sort of went downhill from there. Now the store looks horrible and it needs some fresh blood.
good,"The store manager didn't come to work, so I had to work double shifts and I was under paid. Upper management didn't do anything to help me. I didn't have no personal time."
good,"I see all kinds of possibilities that this company can offer to have a great balance to work and life, but it feels as though they want to own you without paying for it. It appears its like that in many companies now. Holiday pay requires certain stipulations just to get paid for it. I agree with some of the other reviews. They are very accurate in their assessment in what the companies expectations are for their employees . One employee does the job that many companies pay several people to do. the job gets done, but not as it should be. There are several people who have spent years with the company, but I do not believe that is the companies overall goal. The higher turnover of people will keep pay levels low. So I do not believe they have any value in any employee."
good,honestly starting off  was nervous but excited to get back into the working thing and first month was good and the peple were nice and the balance of work and school was good . But things change and people change including management and this were never the same.
good,"Company used to be great! A lot of the old management retired or got promoted and started bringing in a bunch of crud. New management didn't care about the employees or the customers. A lot of them had serious integrity issues and in return, ended up losing a bunch of really good Store managers."
good,"If you don't like to stock shelves and clean, then this would not be the job for you. Unless you are a manager or assistant manager, then you will be the main one on register checking people out. Also on top of that you will clean, stock and whatever else they tell you to do and if its not done then you could possibly get written up. not fun unless you like this kind of stuff."
good,"Some days would be alot harder then others but I always loved the challenge and making sure that all customers were happy and taken care of and that the store always looked clean,nice and organized. I learned a lot of leadership there, making sure that all duties were done and that all customers walked out happy and satisfied.I learned a lot of leadership skills and built up great communication skills with the customers and my co-workers."
good,Depends on what you are looking for. It was not the place for me as the culture had deteriorated since being bought out by Dollar Tree. Poor communication but good opportunities to advance.
good,Ever since being taken over by Dollar Tree the new policies were horrible. Plus the pay raises were changed from the hands of the GM to HR which was no was fair seeing as that they new nothing of the employees
good,"Family dollar was ok till I met the dm manger "
good,"Every employee is expected to do everything. Corporate is hard on Management and stingy with work hours. Not enough positions or delegation of duties, everybody has to do everything!"
good,Environment is not safe but the pay is weekly and raises are every six months. It’s a job for people who loves a variety of familiar customers and new customers
good,"poor employees, organized not up to standards, location is high crime area, fear of being robbed, and high turn over rate, lazy employees that didn't care about their careers"
good,It started out pleasant but soon became unbearable at times to work with my DM . No matter what you did it was NEVER good enough for her..............
good,I like most of my co workers my manager has issues with how to manage employees. She sometimes unfair with how she scheduled the hours. I wanted advancement and after i asked about it she then starting treating me totally different and giving me the atleast amount of hours she could.
good,"Being my first job, it was great, but when the first manager I worked with moved to being a district manager, the new one was in over her head. I was really ill and she demanded I come in. I wasn't going to do so, I didn't want to get anyone sick. She threaten to write me up and I simply quit. Bad decision but it was the heat of the moment. I grown and know better now to leave on good terms."
good,"•	Oversee all crew and train them according to company’s qualifications"
good,"Honestly, I will say it was not all bad. I enjoyed seein new faces, and working hard with a team. It was the perfect balance of working hard and playing. Money was good, I was paid weekly and I averaged about 30-35 hours a week. My first 10 months there I had the same manager, who was aware of all of my health issues on top of my pregnancy. They switched him over night as though it was nothing. I hardly worked with new manager (maybe twice) but when I did it was HORRIBLE, I'll never forget the day I was 7 months pregnant and I hadn't ate a thing. No water, no restroom break, I didn't receive a 10 minute break... NOTHING.. My shift is almost over and the manager asks me to step into her office for a second. At first I'm thinking this is an overall assessment of what she thinks of me as a cashier. Instead I'm getting a write up, being told that the assistant managers complain about the fact that I have to use the restroom and how some simple tasks are almost impossible for me and that stops the other managers from doing their job. Overall she told me if I can't get a doctor's note for my complications she's going to have to let me go and I never went back."
good,"Family Dollar was a job to have until something better became available. It is a hood job for a young person to start out. Not a permanent job,  because of lack of advancement. Poor management,  and no understanding of family values."
good,"THIS JOB WAS AWFUL . no comunication channels to speak to regional managers. store managers will leave you to handle all the responsability in the store while giving themselves the least amount of hours to work a week . other times they'll ask you to open but won""t give you keys to the store so you still have to have them come by and unlock doors"
good,"A typical day at familiar dollar would be sometimes long and very stressful. Dealing with rude customers. Some want discounts, some like to try to get over on the store, other stealing from the store, and manager/coworkers not wanting to come to work. Always leaving me there to work by myself."
good,This company is more worried about making money.Its hard to have a life when truck don't come on time . They dont give you enough payroll nobody wants to work for this company.
good,It was ok for the most part because I knew my co-workers we all got along and stuck together as a team we had a few run outs which I feel in the neighbors with high loss prevention need security and should pay more than 7.25 no adult with a full family can feed their kids and pay bills off this salary them ppl need at least 9.00 hourly pay
good,"Management is to lenient, you don't get lunch breaks however, you can ask for a 15 minute break to rest your feet. You have to sell 30 pieces of the candy a day for a contest for each month. You don't even get a employee discount, but you have to use your employee number when you purchase something so they can calculate how much you spend. There is a lot of merchandise to put out and not enough hard working people and hours to get it out. its hard to get merchandise out when you are the only cashier."
good,"Time with family was a bare minimum under this employment. Schedules were very chaotic and uncoordinated, which prevented any personal time. I have two young children, and usually would only be with the both of them for small periods of the day or when asleep at night."
good,"My Regional manager was too busy trying to build her bonus, and convince the store managers to over work our employees to build our bonuses than to actually listen and help in a productive way...which I didnt feel was an actual corporate type of proceedure. When you talk down to people that have worked years in retail as if they are idiots and you only have months experience as a Regional manager...you miss opportunities to inspire your workers."
good,Management is too laid back and the cooperation is way too cheap to hire more than two employees to work in a store. Management is indeed to poor to take seriously.
good,"I really enjoyed working with customers, but the lack in responsibility from Managers made it very hard to do so. Managers over work there employees and refuse to hire anymore sales associates. I was on my own for several weeks working 40 hrs on my own. Managers stay in the break room while everyone else does there jobs."
good,company ONLY cares about money.  the safety of it's employees doesn't even register on their scale of what they need to do. company builds mostly in poorer parts of town therefore subjecting employees to much criminal activity.
good,"There was never a day when there is not a problem, its just no way to get the store in control. The store district managers all work together but not in the way expected."
good,"It was a good job when you worked with certain people, the boss at the time I was there never got in a hurry, did things that was against procedure, the boss made work harder on everybody else that was there"
good,Need help finding better store management and more security.  Was finding meth needles in bathroom from customers.  Very unsafe.  You do not get to have a say for days off .
good,".....not a bad place to work. Worse part about the job is customers. But that's all retail jobs. hours were steady, no real advancement. Hopefully that changed"
good,"Duties: Cash Handling, Customer Service, Suggestive/Cross Selling, Team Management, Stocking, Receiving Truck and Vendors, Recovery, Opening and Closing Store, Staff Scheduling, and Bank Deposits."
good,They wont alot from you and dont pay you enough. They know you are a college student before they hire you and don't respect that you have class and want to you skip class because one of the other employess called out. You have to check your pay check because they will get you with the hours
good,"Working for this company for multiple years has caused stress and obstacles that are not worth the benefits or compensation.  The teams are not very functional, and there is a lack of understanding between district managers and store managers.  There is unfair favoritism."
good,i worked here through school for extra money it wasnt the greatest place to work because everyone worked off the books and was riude
good,I was a casher... It was a friendly place... their weren't alot of workers their but the ones that did work their taught me alot they were realy helpful
good,You definitely have to have patience working at this job. Definitely if youre a cashier. Not too many people are friendly. My management wasn't quite the best.
good,"The manager and assistant manager are best friends and treat anyone else like poorly.  typical day of work consisted of being treated like very poorly, work like a mule for very little money."
good,"Making sure that the Safe/Registers are accurate. Maintain funds in cashiers registers for customers, Periodic cash pick--ups and safe drops. Build end caps with featured products, Stock shelves as well as do a detailed recovery of aisles. Drop off and pick up cash deposits and deposit slips, I'm learning how to convert shelves for upcoming seasons, My co-workers are fun and communicate with one another well, The hardest part of my job is being aware of the customers who steal products and make a scene or be aggressive with you. The customers are the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,liked working there it was fun and professional work place learned alot about the store like how to build shelves and stock thing properly
good,"Opening the Store counting cash safe, registers, walking the store for issues, Greeting the customers, Helping, paper work. Learn much about people don't be judgmental, management is easy once you get through training the workers should fall in line. Training. Unloading trucks .Is  seeing a Satisfied Customer Compliment the store and it's employees."
good,"The job is very irritating while we are understaffed and then to rely on the assistants and the ""one"" cashier we have to get stuff done. We go through managers like theirs no tomorrow and i am just fed up with it."
good,"Working for this company was productive there was always something for me to do which i like, the customers were friendly and i liked my coworkers. the only thing i didn't like is the manager always changed the schedule you could look at the schedule before you leave work and see that your off the next day than when you enjoying your day off you get a call asking if your coming in cause your scheduled to work."
good,a typical day at work is packing out U-boats. i learn how to rotate stock and make the store neat. Everyone works as a team to get everything done. There are no hard parts about this job. Most enjoyable is when i come to work and get my work done.
good,"while working at family dollar i experienced alot of things, this being my second job it taught me how to work with rowdey people and how to keep calm in certain situations. But overall this job is okay i would have to say."
good,my overall rating is an six due to this store could hire some men to do the stocking part of the job. there is nothing more I'd like to say about this job
good,cashier; checked out customers; stocked shelves; cleaned work area; enjoyed customer interaction; checked in venders
good,"Customers were lovely"
good,"It's a great place to work if they can just make all the districts the same. They put a lot on you for low pay. It has a very high turn over rate. You have to throw freight, run a register and do other tasks and mostly work alone. The hardest part of the job is trying to get things done and run a register when you are the only person in the store. The easiest is getting the paperwork done. Most enjoyable part is being able to help the customers."
good,A typical day at Family Dollar was fun because of my customers and the relationships I built with them. Seeing the loyal customers on a weekly basis made my job interesting and enjoyable. I did emjoy the work I did for Family Dollar however I didnt see any room for adcancement or promotion. I showed alot of interest in wanting to move up the ladder but management at my particular store didnt show any feedback into my inquiries.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job is my coworkers and customers. From the Store Manager to the Human Resource Office, it seems there are no personable skills. There is great teamwork among the cashiers and Assistant Managers. There is room for training for everyone. Happy employees seem to improve business."
good,Would like to have had better security measures also would like to have had more employees working shifts to discourage theft. More updated equipment. Nice products very affordable.
good,they did not want me to go to collage so they got rid of me. i dont thing it is bad to balance school and work if you can handle both. there should not be a punishment for this.
good,"this job was a good experience, I went from a cashier to an assistant manager within months."
good,"I worked as a store manager at one of the worst locations in Memphis. My store was burglarized more than 5 times in one year. Upper management has not done enough  to prevent these crimes. They did install a steel roof, which stopped thieves from coming through that way. However, now they break-in through the walls and doors.  I've since left, but the new manager at this store is going through the same thing. Sad state of affair...Family Dollar!"
good,This store unexpectedly was sold and reopened under new management and i was laid off although the district supervisors and management were eaisaly accessable and contact regularly.
good,A typical day at this job is that you never know what to expect. I learned with this company you have to brown nose and literally kill yourself to keep your job. Management is horrible. The hardest part of this job was keeping dependable and honest workers on board. Working for this company you have no family life. And there was nothing enjoyable with company. Was very stressful and wore an individual out mentally and emotionally
good,"a typical day is stocking shelves and running a cash register, at closing clean the store and count my drawer down. shift is about 5 hours, 3 or 4 times a week."
good,You must really know someone or really be special to get promoted without any backlash.
good,"Great job but losers for customers. They come in with big bags and rob the store blind everyday, all day. The crazy part about that is that management gets in trouble for the shrink! Seriously! They tell us that we cant stop the shoplifters but on the other hand they tell us that we cant have the shrink. Are they mental!!!"
good,I have been employed with Family Dollar for 4 years and nothing has changed.  The store manager is unfair and te district manager is no help either.  Ready for a change.
good,I ran day to day operations. Unloaded the truck every week. Staging the merchandising to the shelf.  I hired and terminated employees.
good,"Okay place to work if you want to boost your resume & work history. But if you have kids to feed & goals in life, this isn't the place. This is a job. Not a career. "
good,"I love working with the customers. For the most part, working at Family Dollar is enjoyable. My only issues with working there is that there is not enough money for everyone to have good hours. My hours keep getting lower and lower. If there are not enough hours/money for everyone, why hire a bunch of new people? And they pay is only minimum wage, how can grown adults live on minimum wage?"
good,"A typical day at work starts with restocking the store, making sure cashiers have change and things to do. Maintaining the sales floor by cleaning, and doing returns of merchandise."
good,"a typical day is very busy. I have learned a lot about manageing people and customer satisfaction. I do not see a lot of upper management, as they stay busy in other stores that have "
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was assisting the customers and making sure that they were satisfied. Some of the upper management needs to get their stuff together but overall it is an okay job.
good,Not enough guidance and management from the managers. Everyone pretty much had to handle everything on their own with no help from management. And it did not help that we were in a rough neighborhood
good,my particular store had poor management... they work you to death and they pay you minimum wage but yet they make millions of dollars
good,"Work day was ok, Counting money, and  dealing with customers and emploee relashions.I learned you have to keep a positive attiude when working with the public. The management was just as hard working as reagular team, and my co-worhers were a ggreat team,"
good,"*A typical day at work is very quiet and slow paced."
good,Loved the people and the hours. Unfortunately there was a high turnover rate for the management I worked under after only one year. Many did not have the people skills that made it easy to work for them. Teamwork is up in arms when it comes to many of them.
good,"Similar to the majority of ideas by a hegemonic group, they lack true insight into matters outside of their own cultural perspectives. For example; the company states that ""most professional thieves avoid stores that provide good customer service"". This is based on a statistical survey of thieves. Wow, extremely odd. A company that believes thieves and not their own employees. Second, I find it hard  to believe that  a professional thief would  steal low dollar items. Well if you judge a professional based on making any monies, then any one that does anything to make money would be classified as a professional. The guy that flips burgers is a professional, a petty drug dealer as well. On the other hand if  professionals are  based on a specific quality of work, then the only professional thieves would be those that stole high dollar items, and maintained a demeanor  consistent with other white collar professionals. To make matters worse, how can you win against external and internal shrink, when almost every one know how you operate. No new ideas flow beyond this one matter. You can go to any district and the DM repeat the same old stuff. Continuing in this manner leads to a decadent company, that would eventually fail. A continuous theory of ""lets fire everyone"" instead of recognizing the social and economic differences in each community, leads to a community of ex employees who all are aware of the weaknesses of their community stores, should they decide to become the new professional thieves."
good,"I gave my all at this job, until I got fired because the manager went back on a demand that she gave. I liked the people I worked with though."
good,"Day at work was good, learned a lot about being an assistant manager and the responsibility that comes with the job. The pay sucked for such responsibility. Management was good until a new manager came. Co-workers were great, and the hardest part of the job was being disrepected. The enjoyable part of the job for me was putting up the stock and talking to the customers."
good,Created shelves and stocked shelves with supplies preparing for the grand opening.
good,"I would go in and get on the register and help customers. I would stock the shelves when we would get a truck in of merchandise. This was a pretty relaxing place of business, but it becomes stressful when people you work with are not doing the company good. My manager and some employees stole merchandise often. Not a place that I would want to work at again, though I do know that not everyone acts in this manner. There wasn't any part of this job that was hard, it was all very manageable. The most enjoyable part of this job, was meeting all the people I did here."
good,Threw out my stay at family dollar I was rarely protected. I learned patients and self control and as thankful at the end of my day when i made it home safely.
good,The most enjoyable part was the costumers. the hardest part was some long days 8am to 10 pm with no help. my co-workers were ok. this was my first management postion in retail and i think i've performed well at family dollar.
good,"i am looking to change of lifestyle, more home life."
good,busy often
good,"Going into store, picking up deposit and take to the bank. Go back, and prepare registers for the day, turn on the lights, pick up around the store. There were certain days, I would go in early and do store counts, store ordering, put up signage, merchandise and keep the store clean. I had so many comments about how clean and neat the store was while I was there. I would run the register, help customers find things and straighten and face the shelves. I had an awesome crew, with what I had. The DM would not give me any more store hours, and I was putting in 70 to 80 hours a week, on a 52 hour salary. I just burnt out and was offered the job in Casper and jumped. We had great customer service in out store, and it even came back to me through other store managers. I did the daily, weekly, and monthly reports. Completed end of day paper work, locked and closed the store."
good,"I was an assistant manager. I was the overseer of staff, balanced cash,made deposits, and did shipments."
good,"This place use to be a fun and enjoyable place to work but lately they have become so cheap. They lack at help for the store and focus on the store manager like they are the only one that can do the work. The secret to success is team work ,which they lack at and don't understand."
good,"Stocking and ringing cash. training and development of team. cash deposits,"
good,"customers decent, work load is decent, always occupied, i learned how to make decorative decisions w/o contemplating too much, hardest part of the job was absolutly running register and cleaning/organizing the store at the same time."
good,"It a pratical day. Same work is done everyday expect for hoilday, when everythin is rush. Management abuse their power not all but some."
good,"My overall experience with this company was difficult, the job was in a bad neighborhood where the crime was high and stealing happen constantly. We as employers were always threaten by the customers and verbally abused. The only bright side about this job was that I had a great staff to work with which made the working environment a little less stressful at times."
good,"The workplace is pretty decent, Can be fun at times, Customers are what make the job fun but thats with any retail job"
good,"very unorganzied , hours where a pain. they really need to hire people who care and not just there for a pay check"
good,"My biggest problem at family dollar was the management. The favorite thing to do was pass the buck, upper management did not step in and remove managers from their positions to allow others to succeed. Instead they make you do the work for them for pennies. The best part of the job was the customers."
good,It was okay. Just be careful of who your managers are because they will place you on the NO REHIRE list quick. I got placed as no rehire for not coming 2 work 1 of the days.And I had let my manager know that at the time . i had 2 work 2 days for 3 hours each and I lived like 45 mins away I'm not wasting my gas twice for 6 hours that could been given in 1 day.
good,"I will only recommend to anyone that barely starting to have customer service experience is great start. The reason why it is not that difficult attend customers, help them, and communicate."
good,"Its a waste of effort and time the  higher up managers treat the employees poorly and have no consideration for the employees with anything(ex kids at school, sick, your schedule for school) if they think your not open availability they will try to get rid of you they want desperate “yes mans” it makes it easier to control you as an employee"
good,"Dollar tree bought the company"
good,I would go back to work for family dollar. It was a good experience just bad store managers. If I could I would love to go back and make a difference in another store
good,Its not a bad experience. It's okay. Just have to stick to yourself . And do what u have to do. I prefer being open minded and not being so on guard and just enjoy the experience
good,Will work you like a  Hebrew slave for that Lil 12.00$ that a customer service employee get and what the asm get its nothing else to really say about this place a job is a job somebody gotta do it guess I just was at a horrible store with a horrible store manager
good,Employees are called out and reprimanded in a group chat with all employees included instead of in private. Schedules are changed and no notification is given. Your job is threatened if you have to call out due to illness.
good,Working for this place will have you tearing out your hair sometimes..managers are required to work 52 hours and 95% of the time work 60-80 hours a week. No overtime and the turn over rate is extremely high. The higher up people only care about the sales you make and no one is really there when you need help.
good,I left due to poor management and being so unorganized and many other problems! I liked my job it was just to much going on half the staff wouldn't do their jobs while others did
good,"I have worked at family dollar for 7 years off and on. I had a good store manager who really appreciated his workers, however that's more then I can say for any other store manager in this company! Honestly if I didn't have my store manager, I would have left in a few months. I moved up and have worked in many family dollars in the tri state and honestly its not a good company! There are no raises at all, and its a do it or else company. Many good employees have came and left. I work hard have managed to stick it out. If you get to be store manager from the jump you can have a good work experience at this company."
good,I been a manager for about 6 months and they over worked me. They are very unorganized and they dont treat customers or employees like they suppose to.
good,"You would count in your money and start your day, You were always busy if you were not cashiering you were stocking and cleaning. I started off as a cashier and then was given the assistant manager position. We didn't have a manager and the store was run by the assistant managers, I work for six-month straight and I learned a lot about running a store. It may have been stressful but I was able to keep the store running and was able to provide a place for people to shop."
good,May differ at other locations but management was terrible and irresponsible. Lucky to get 15 hours/week unless you were one that got stuck working overtime all the time.
good,"I loved my job, my customers as well as most of the people I worked with. They had fired me because I wasn’t available to them due to working full time at another job as well as part time there."
good,Too much work for minimum wage. Managers are always stressed do to being under paid and pressure from cooperate. Risky environment due to rude and angry customers. A lot of theft and robberies.
good,"I feel like the people who been with the company for more than 3+ years, should get a proper pay. I came in as a Assistant Manager, and was receiving what I knew what I was worth, but physically seen other employee pay who been with the company WAY longer and were receiving awful pay. For all the work that these employees do, I FIRMLY believe they deserve better pay. AND any manager at the store HAS to close as well as other key holders. Schedules are supposed to be rotating closing shifts, only fair to those who have children and a life."
good,Management was horrible I worked there and everyday I went home crying because I wanted to leave. Overall the customers and other crew.members brightened my day.
good,The manager that is currently there is a homophobe  I've feel like I was treated unfairly and it was announced that he wanted me gone so he could hire more women so he can stare at being a creep and cheating on his wife and also he offers to fight me on multiple occasions I've tried to get in contact with the district manager for some time wrote and complained to corporate but no one is taking any seriously
good,"Management would have to work alone most the time and put up freight . Manager is supposed to work 52 hours a week , I'd end up working 70 a week , they would cut our hours so that would put manager work two doubles a week. DM expected so much and I barely seen my family ."
good,The family Dollar dosent offer enough hours or pay enough you won't be able to make a decent salary by working there also no breaks so you have to eat while working plus the management was terrible
good,"Great working experience ,especially and the great working experience of the agreement and the opportunity for the company to provide a strong customer service and provide support for customers and services to customers and businesses and businesses"
good,"Always a productive day for the company, a typical day at work is always busy,  there is always work to be done, sometime you can never make plan after work, you may or may not get off on time."
good,"Working there at a young age was to much for me, at the time. The manager position was just thrown at me.I was opening an closing the store by myself. Unloading the trucks while trying to run register. But overall I like the responsibility."
good,"it was a decent place to work but our store didn't have any security guards and we had a lot of shop lifters. We had to constantly kick people out for stealing and it was very confrontational. People would yell and cuss at us and steal anyways. If you could handle people yelling at you, then it isn't a big deal, but it can be stressful at times."
good,You have the opportunity to learn new skills and get promoted. But it's dangerous; i.e. robberies & assaults common + you're understaffed & overtasked.
good,I work with a lot of older ladies. It's always some he said she said. It's sad cause we are alll to old for the bull.The pay is low and they want a lot out of you. I believe that family dollar is good as a first job (for a teen) or a job for someone that is not trying to live on this one check.
good,"Working for this company, makes you hate needing the paycheck. It's bi-weekly pay so the company doesn't have to work over as much money. Management doesn't give you but a week of training and then aren't there when a problem comes up. With other equal position people thinking they are above you and even doing what they want. Still don't have to worry you won't be fired. Always an excuse never a solution."
good,Family dollar is a fast paced enviornment.  if you like working most days by yourself this is for you.  Do not expect help from your DM. or other stores.  The portal will be your best friend
good,"Typical day consist of ringing up merchandise and stocking items. You have to be able to communicate and have a good personality. Its not really located in a good area. many crackheads hang around the store. The hardest part was making sure nobody comes in and steal items,"
good,"At this job you are required to work the cash register and stock at the same time, which inst as bad as it sounds. Poor management. This job taught me to work hard physically."
good,Don't expect to have a free day or have fun because that job is all about work. You have to be quick and be able to multitask. This is a job not a career so don't think you'll stay there forever.
good,This was a nice place to work fun and I enjoyed. The employees bwere nice to work with . I would recommend this job to a friend. The job was very easy
good,The work atmosphere is great if you make it great. If your new in management or retail at all this place isn't the best. They will set you up for failure if your not careful and know the insurance and outs of management
good,If you don't suck up to ur boss you don't get no where. You do your job and still people say you don't and try to get you out of the company.i loved working there with some of the employees. But the manager needed more experience.and do more than they did.
good,In the short time that i was at family dollar i advanced to an assistant manager position very quickly. Once i obtained that position i was trained extremely well and within a week i was able to run the store by myself.
good,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Buddy buddy work place and and it’s hard to get promoted. You have to do three or four people jobs and get under paid. Long work days and weeks.
good,needs new management. . when new management gets in there it will be a better store. it is easier to work with the ASM than it is to work with the manager. He doesn't do his part.
good,They can't keep good help because the district manager is not friendly. You can't go to her and let her know there's a problem. She says well the work needs to be complete wehter your short handed or not. Very degative attitude
good,being an assistant manager of a store is very stressful and long hours are acquired. most the time i was there by myself for about six hours until the 2pm shift would come in. it was stressful when there were a lot of customers there and only one cashier.
good,"Friendly customer. Open hours for evening until nights. Great job for starters. As I said before will keep you smiling from ear to ear.....,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,Managers don’t work with your hours too much.I have daycare but I am willing to work nights which makes it complicated along the way. Other than that the job is simple and you can’t beat what they bring to the table! This work can be very awesome!
good,"A lot of hard work, had to get get truck door to floor. Fun customers, working during the day is hard because you work by yourself. I  did a lot of being a floating asst. Mgr"
good,Working for Family Dollar was very stressful at times. I was an assistant manager and was making just fifty cents more an hour than the regular employees. I was required to do more work and not getting paid more to do it. Customers could be very rude and demanding at times. Management didn't care much about you personally as they did about making money for the store.
good,No support from you district managers.  They throw you to the sharks and expect you to survive.  Some district managers have even left the company due to not being able to meet the expectations from corporate.
good,i loved my job but they  just  have very poor management . it help me with my people skills . i also stalked shelves and learn a lot of things about new things .i would also clean up the store and outside
good,"I worked at family dollar for seven months at two different locations. My first location was at Mount Sterling. The General Manager there was okay but rules that apply to everyone seemed to not apply to her and other managers. Same at Family Dollar in Washington Courthouse. Both places managers were very unprofessional, I had constant troubles getting managers help and when I finally did receive help they were rude to me in front of the customers. Family Dollar is a job that you will require a manager often and they were angry that they had to do their job."
good,"Even though I liked the team, I need to work at least 21 hrs a week ( I am on disability) and I barely get 10 hours a week.  Therefore I need to find different work."
good,Close to home they pay was okay management was not professional and no means of promotions. Mangement would not work with you on helping with flexible schedule.
good,Too much for too little pay.  Store managers are lazy and leaves everything on Asst. Manager.  Staff is always short and they have a high turn-over rate
good,Bad experience period!!!!! my own manager will not teach me anything and passed me over and did not tell me about a manager position in my own town saying i didn't even know what I was doing in her own store. my manager picks on me treats me like im nothing and just wrote me up saying i was insubordinate was using foul language at her gives me write ups and they were final warnings
good,Family Dollar was my home away from home. I stayed there more then I did with family or friends. My customers became family and I didn't mind that cause I absolutely loved my customers. It's just being there 52 or more hours a week became hard on the home life. The upper management needs to get it together or else family dollar is not gonna make it. I don't wanna go back to that place but I do sometimes miss the people that came in.
good,It’s not hard just really stressful and not a set schedule. Good job for a teenager or someone just to get something who needs just a little extra cash
good,Too much work for anmoumt of work for what was paid mainly your work was cashier basked and less management it’s mainly stocking and cashiering Thant’s it
good,Great team work could use a little more help with management and corporate..but overall it's an amazing work place..not mu h pay but just something and a second job.
good,work is not hard but not enough hours given to make it worthwhile to stay long term. they required online training which was ok but interfered with getting your job done.  treated everyone as if they were going to steal from them.
good,Very behind in the times.  They need to get up to the 21st Century.  They overwork their Managers and you have no outside life at all. Well never work for them again
good,"A Typical work day is arrive very early to open the store to count all the money in the box to see that everything is in order, also receive the delivered and attend to the client. Work hand in hand with the manager to make it a daily success."
good,I worked here for 3 years and started as a cashier. if your going to work here you must be a people person. and you must have a patience of a god. you will have your regulars who always come in and sometimes make your day better. sometimes your coworkers will drop like flies and you will have to do overtime. you wont have a fixed schedule so you may close one week and open the next.the amount of hours is also never the same. it could be 25 one week 35 the next. the pay for the amount of the work an assistant manger is suppose to do does not reflect correctly and they should be paid more. that being said i enjoyed my time here and recommend it if you like a fast pace environment and causal chaos. (also be ready to see plenty of crazy because you will see a lot of that)
good,"In my three years at family dollar it was an enjoyable workplace. About two months ago we were placed under new management and all of the more ""seasoned"" employees were forced out to bring in new people"
good,"I did store manager duties and kept the store in order and clean. The store manager was easy to get along with and made work enjoyable and fun, she left a week after I did."
good,Enjoy the fast pace and the competitive contests. Can move up to store manager position quickly. Hours are flexible. Managers are fair and try to work with you and is always willing to coach and help you succeed.
good,"It was a productive workplace and there were alot great customer's, but at the job the manager wanted you to chase the theif which is putting your life endanger"
good,"aside from the types of people family dollar hires & the type of customers it attracts, it's actually an ok place to work. the pay is too low for the amount of work you have to do daily. the expectations put on the team members are sometimes unreasonable & unfair. upper management shows favoritism to their ""pet"" managers. if you do your job & meet the requirements of your position, you're pretty much left alone, so to speak. not the greatest but certainly not the worst."
good,Cashier stocker and unloading all In one. Occasionally do audits.. your basically a work horse and suspected to have max productivity with mostly no help.
good,Worked too many hours a week made an impact on my family of me not being around. I am super underpaid for the job I complete and accomplish with no help recruiting from manaement
good,"To many changes in management, most  managers seem to be unqualified. Out dated equipment (fridge/freezers, missing cameras in major theft areas, faulty ceilings in the store an stock room,  unsafe break area. Work orders are made but nothing is never ready at the right time.  For instance: Freezers break down the matinance man may come to fix it but the part may come a week later, then the part sits or ""goes missing"" and when the matinance man comes back to repair freezers no part .Our regular customers are not wanting to come into our location as often because we're currently next door to an Internet/gambling place that bring a lot of late night crowd, dealers, robberies an shootings ect.  We're losing our regular neighborhood customers because of the traffic."
good,"Work included working the register, stocking shelves, and cleaning up after we closed. The work was simple and was a bit boring. I left because I was not getting enough hours, but if you have a higher position you should be fine."
good,District management changed and he was terrible he was sexist and extremely mean training for me when i went to store manager was non existance.they take extreme advantage of salaried managers sometimea working over 90 hours a week very short staffed so you work alone a lot and still required to get everything else done.  They offer paidv time off and sick days but very hard to use there is alsono store discount.
good,I was the assistant manager at 2 different stores. I was in charge of training and inventory. I like the customers which I learn most of them by name.
good,"Good job, stressful,  you wont have a life outside this job so if you have kids probably not the best job for you. Sorry to be honest they distract managers do not care if you have a family all they care is that work gets done. Some store managers are willing to work with you but it is hard. This job has so many responsibilities but if your not willing for the challenge then i recommend you do not apply.  It is a good job do not get me wrong but there is so many expectations and if you do not have a good team working with you than it is super hard to get the responsibilities that need to be done done. But on a good note at least every 6 months you will get a raise depending on your work ethic and if your store does well during inventory they you get s good raise not spectacular but good. Customers can be veey rude but there are some that are really loyal to you and when you find them keep them happy bevause they will be willing to spend and arm and a leg in your store because they are happy because they are treated like a person and not a customer even tho they are a customer.  Make then feel good and happy and if they need help they know who to find. Cutomers are everything thwir happiness always comes first."
good,I love working for family dollar but it's the inconsistency of the management that's has me looking for other employment and I wouldn't mind staying but I feel like I am being used like cheap labor and under appreciated
good,It was a decent job. I stayed very busy and worked really hard. I learned a lot of excellent things that will be beneficial in my next endeavor. After I earned my management job i felt there wasn't much higher i could go in the company due to a lack of advancement opportunity.
good,It’s was good to work their not a job you won’t for life but a good place to start off with when it your first time working. They are pretty much not organized very well
good,"I loved working for Family Dollar but the upper management team was very mean sense the owner sold the company. lots of gossip, not a healthy environment"
good,There were four managers but yet I closed the store at least 4 days out of the week. It was very unfair and they don't pay enough for all the work you actually put in.
good,The likes are working in the public and creating friendships with all your customers on a daily basis. The dislikes are the pay raises weren't the best and didn't have a say in availability times
good,"Typical work day was assisting customers, stocking shelves and unloading trucks. The job required you to work evenings and weekends and with small children was very hard."
good,Family Dollar gives a very limited amount of hours to save money. As an assistant manger I found myself working extremely hard to get thing done. The pay didn’t equate to the work.
good,"A typical day at work is fun. You can laugh with all your co-workers."
good,"As the store manager, they paid me what i asked for without letting me know that there would be not much left for associate scheduling. I worked 7 days per week from 7 am until. There was also a 1k piece truck that I as the store manager hasd to manually unload 3 times a week. Either I could schedule a stocker or a cashier each day. But never both on the same day"
good,"they over work you for little cost ,i learned that they care more about the business then the employees,some of the manager are great,hardest part having to do everything on your own..best part is getting to know the people you work with and the relationship you get out of it."
good,Need better district management and better job security. Frequent shift changes etc make it difficult to arrange out side of work endeavors around work.
good,Family Dollar was a fun place to work sometimes. It was very fast-paced and you had to stay on your toes. Some of the customers was some of the most amazing people you would meet. I thank them for the growth and experience for I did learn a lot to take with me to advance my career.
good,It was ok working sometimes but had to be cautious cause of the robberies... Also poor management to the Customers. Always wanted us to lie to customers about bigger bags. Basically saying their wasn't none when it was. We had to bag their items in small bags.
good,"Family Dollar is a fast pace environment with a lot to accomplish in a short period of time. Everything needs to be done within a certain time frame, period!"
good,I worked with a great team for 4+ yrs. That was one of the best parts was having a great relationship with my coworkers. However my boss was really awesome to a certain extent. I learned a lot from her and she taught me many things but the communication amongst managers and other coworkers was horrible. I didn't receive many hours. No benefits or discounts. No holiday pay for cashiers only managers except on Christmas.
good,Enjoyed the job I just didn't care for the people I worked for and also they need better security in this type of work environment! I think they should use management class for the managers they hire everyone don't seem to have the proper skills to run theses store properly!
good,"It was overall an okay place to work. The hours could sometimes be very long. The store was always over stocked. To the point where you sometimes couldn't even get to the break room. At times there was not enough staff, but in the same sense it would be overly staffed. Management honestly depends on the store you work in. My original manager was great. But when I moved locations, my new manager was horrible and very disrespectful. All in all, it's a job. If you need something to help pay some bills, go for it. You definitely won't get rich off this place though."
good,"The best part of working for Family Dollar to ME was working with my Customer Service Rep, and of course the customers that I would meet each day that I was scheduled to work!"
good,"Make work schedule for my employees, make deposits, order merchandise for the store and run the cash register and stock the shelves with merchandise and sweep and mop the floor."
good,"Nice management. "
good,"Helping customers find items, checking the items out, stocking the shelves. I havent really learned anything being here, just things that i already know."
good,deposits to the bank order change for next business day. you have to train new hires as well. hardest part of job was being in rough neighborhood where you never knew what was going to happen.
good,You're Standing On You Feet For 6-8 Hours a Day Putting Away Product & Taking Cars of Customers. The Best Part Though is Working With The Little Kids. Yeah
good,"Since the merger with Dollar Tree, there is no long-term job security at Family Dollar.  Entire departments have been terminated and hundreds of people have been either let go or found another position."
good,unloading boxes from truck and stocking up on merchandise vacuuming and take out products and stocking on shelves and taking clothes and putting them out on racks
good,"Upon entry I greet staff and customers. I then begin counting my safe to make sure its balanced from previous shifts. I start a pre-shift staff meeting, informing all employees on the delegations of the day."
good,"Flexible schedule on their behalf, unstable schedule for students. Management was always somewhere else when you need them. Pay was too low for the work they wanted"
good,"A typical day with me as MOD during my shift was basically stocking, fill-in cashiering, possibly banking and opening or closing of the store. I efficiently unloaded the truck each week, was my designated duty as well as my favorite part of the job. The store manager was excellent and we worked well together. I thoroughly enjoyed most aspects of the position. The pay, however, was not acceptable. Even at full time, a person cannot live on their own on it. My personal, least favorite aspects were the cashiering and computer work. I much prefer the active duties as well as my physical limitations doing better with it than sitting or standing basically still."
good,"Shift changes every week, not enough hours to hire new staff. No opportunity for growth. Managers can work 60-80 hours in one week. Managers are not able to order the things they need"
good,Family Dollar isn't a great company however it isn't the worst company that I've worked for. The pay rate needs to be a lt better for employees. They also need to have more then one Management person on the shift during the key times of the day. There should never be only one person in the store at any point of the day( time of day)
good,"Was good in the beginning because I had a good manager now my manager left and the new manager he's not reliable and fixing my schedule."
good,my job was to come in get my assignment or project for the day. then stock the area I'm given clean and face it as well. work my way ton front on register and provide customer service.
good,"Family Dollar was a good job in the beginning but as time went by the management used favoritism to promote employees, also working 12 hour shift with an infant wasn't ideal for me nut I had no other option."
good,My main manager had a awful temper. He threw keys and such any time he got mad. Being the only one that did not smoke I never got breaks. It was never organized. Behind our registers was always a wreck.
good,"This job was one of the easiest jobs I've ever had, and was praised simply for showing up for most of my shifts. A lot of workers were fired and rehired while I was there in a seasonal winter shift. There was no room for advancement, you had to work many different jobs at once, it was robbed a decent amount, and there was no job culture."
good,I was under very poor management.This job was very simple though.I didn't really feel safe at work.I was also lied to all the time by my boss.I would not work there again.
good,Very friendly environment Associates tend to become friends outside of the workplace. Great prices as well as flexible hours and easy training to get on the schedule quick.
good,"it was a good place to work ,, but I really didnt have the chance to advance, and didnt have the oppurtunity.. the people there was really nice, but the manager really did not give anyone a chance to prove themselves."
good,"Enjoyed the customers and actually the job. Regional leader was unreasonable as to how many hours where needed to run the store. Hours were extremely low to run the store properly. "
good,I enjoyed helping clients. I really enjoy working with others. If you are not a manager you will work part time. It's a great job for students after high school.
good,"A typical day was busy"
good,"Cashier, cleaning babysitting warehouse cooking stocked labeling customer service draw count  closing down in General keeping the store clean and neat we worked as a team and had different hours all the time we made it a fun environment for us and our customers"
good,"Collects payments by accepting cash, check, or charge payments from customers; making change for cash customers."
good,Employees were amazing. Loved meeting all the customers. The workload was too much. Was injured on the job due to workload. Long hours. Pay is minimum wage.
good,"They had their picks"
good,There were probably 20 people that worked everyday long hours to break everything down in one building to move and rebuild in another store. Jobs after moving was promised that no one ever got.
good,Cashiering is a great position to interact with the customers. Its definitely a learning experience. Stocking helped me also by learn different parts of the store
good,"Working at Family Dollar for 4 years was rewarding yet very stressful.  There is little to no consideration for work/life balance, many unnecessary processes, compensation isn't bad but doesn't measure up to comparable employers.  There have been many times that I felt valued but many more times where I felt undervalued.  Leadership is inconsistent and very political.  Advancement is typically based off of someone's personal views of you.  Some leaders are great but many others lack leadership skills.  They will get rid of some great employees for minor issues yet keep mediocre employees because they personally 'like' them.  There is no true checks and balances when it comes to open door policy and many employees do not trust the chain of command.  I have personally witnessed and experienced leaders setting their employees up for failure just to find a reason to get rid of them.  The company recently went through an acquisition by Dollar Tree and things started to get bad fast.  It seems as if leadership got overwhelmed and took it out on the employees.  I hate that it got to the point of my resignation after so many years devoted to the company however I could not take any more.."
good,Too much going on when you first start everybody want you to do everything . Overall it's what you make of it. You be on the cash register restock during down time clean up the atore count your register down
good,"Assistant Manager at this retail store where I handled returns, bank drop offs, money exchange, write ups, audits, merchandise delivery and restocking, as well as opening and closing the store."
good,Family Dollar is an unorganized organization where most of the employees are overworked and underpayed. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience in regards to getting to know the customers personally and providing them with solutions. There needs to be new management. The turnover rate is ridiculously high.
good,"dangerous, overwhelming, not paid enough, poor management, But learned alot on my own as far as managing employees store recovery deliveries fun working with other"
good,Working in family dollar was for the most part enjoyable. I learned a lot about the company and learned how to work faster at times when the store was busy
good,I don't wish to comment about the company at this time.  I am just glad to get a paycheck every week.  Hopefully things will change for the better.  That is all I wish for.
good,Working at Family Dollar gave me the experience needed to move on in the retail industry. I'm all for the fast up passed life style needed for the real world. Now i feel like i can work retail anywhere.
good,Not a terrible place to work but wasn't what i was looking for in a job and i got paid really low for a full time assistant. Management wasn't that great could have been a little better.
good,Really didn't enjoy this work experience and wouldn't recommend it to anyone work here but it might be good for a first time worker
good,It was an ok place to work at. I think its more for like high school kids cause pay sucks. You get more lip from customers then what you get from your boss.
good,"Working for Family Dollar for me was nothing more than just an extra paycheck. The hours are longer than some other jobs and you don't really receive a high amount of pay. The management can be difficult and tricky sometimes, and this company is notorious for having a huge turnover rate. I was promoted to management in two months because we had so many people quit at once. I did love to meet new customers and see new faces, so its honestly what you make of it"
good,This is a wonderful job if you are looking to learn quickly about retail stores and how they operate. The best part about my job was the customers and their smiles.
good,"I loved the work, my regular customers, but the manager was was the reason for my departure.  The manager was  disrespectful and constantly degrading employees even the customers."
good,"the customers mad the workplace and environment much easy to learn, grow, and experience the ups and downs. I was trained to operate cash registers, assist customers with merchandise and questions. clean, fold, and prep store for each sale. My co-workers were fun, kind, respectable and dependable individuals."
good,this was my first job working here was ok the boss was never around and the manager was always on the phone.i really did not like working here long hours with little pay but it was my first job so i did not complain.
good,Good job enjoyed working there but I was traveling over 15 miles for only 5 hours a week. Wasn't able to pay someone to bring me back and forth to work and keep my son
good,"The typical day was generally slow, except truck days. I learned what makes a bad DM and GM. The hardest part was keeping up on my studies due to employees quitting as soon as they start and have to stay over or called in to work on scheduled days off. The only enjoyable part of the job was a co-worker I become close friends with and sales customers. I don't like to write bad reviews on a company, but was a requirement on this site."
good,if you are not the manger friends or family it is very hard to get advancement in this job. i watched many people get hired to work here and they would ended up walking out shortly after getting hired
good,"customers were extremely rude, the store was infested with rat. there was always merchandise missing, the co workers were not always doing there job."
good,place was always short staffed manager was not a good one always had to have 2 days off back to back weather we were covered or not when short staffed long long hrs worked 5 days straight one time open to close those 5 days by the time 5th day came i was so tired could barely stand
good,A typical day at work consisted of helping customers and keeping the work environment clean and clutter free. the hardest part of the job was trying to make sure everything was done in a timely manner with truck deliveries.
good,my co-workers were absolutely amazing ! I will never forget them. the customers were very rude but I managed. the manager I didn't really agree with some of the decisions he made. but my co-workers made coming to work not so bad.
good,A typical work day includes the employees either on their phones or standing around talking. The management was just as bad never around when they were needed. The hardest part of the job was trying to do the job with little to no help when the lines got longer or things needed to be put up.
good,"A lot of Costumers, Management Was Excellent, Hardest Part Was the Traffic Of Costumers But It was Great. Co-Workers Were Nice, Hours Were Decent."
good,This was a excellent job for part timers looking for a little work. This is not a hard job to do. Had down time to restock shelf if there where no customer to check out. Just need more working hours.
good,"Everyday was about the same, I seen no real advancement within the company. I learned a lot about management though and the hardest part of the job was department resets."
good,The job was full of different task and has made me the worker I am today with add. skills. I have learned so much and I continue to learn to be able to further in life making  a career out of the many skills I have astablished.
good,"i go in and get yelled at to do a million things at once."
good,"I worked at Family Dollar on two different occasions in two different states. I would say that for a start Family Dollar is a nice job but there isn't much room for advancement. They will often times label you as part time worker and give you full time hours just to avoid having to pay you benefits. I had lovely co-workers and went through four managers in about a six month time. My second experience with  Family Dollar I was fired one day after one day after wanting to go home feeling ill, something that could have been avoided had the district manager at the time adhered to warning. But if employed under proper management Family Dollar is a pleasant place to work."
good,I've been with the company for four years. I want to try something new. It was my first time and I think it was time to move on to something else.
good,"Easy keep everything in order"
good,"It was very hard trying to manage the store and raise a family, all the hours at the low pay was driving me crazy. The best thing about the job was meeting new people. The worst thing about the job was the low pay."
good,"This was a decent place to work but the manager would make you work open to close then be back the next day for a full shift. Long hours and hard to get time off because of being understaffed. I enjoyed all of my coworkers except one who is very rude and did not like me simply because she ""had a bad feeling about me"" working with her was horrible!! She should not be in customer service. But other than that it was a decent job especially if you just need something to make a little bit of money each week."
good,I will go in about 7am in the morning open the store properly by counting all the funds in the safe and ensuring all bank deposits are accounted for from the previous night. In-put all the opening information into the computer systems.  Make sure  that all the workers I have coming in for the day with have enough work to do to stay busy for the entire length of the shift. I would say that the hardest part of my job is not being able to see my kids a lot of the time.
good,fun place to work but not very well managed.  manager to young to control hours and manage store correctly.  poor and un fare with time distributed among employees.
good,If they see that you are a good worker they move you up very quickly.
good,I am in a great position to learn new things and work with a great team of people.
good,"A Typical day at Family Dollar was like being the first time at a job, you never knew what you was walking into.  From when i first started until the day i left i had been through 8 Store Managers. They would give you varies task and expect them to be done by the end of your shift which is impossible."
good,"my normal week was 70hours,usually 21 days without time off unless I used a vac day"
good,Looking for something better with a set schedule instead of a random schedule..\
good,"Learned more on merchandising, loss prevention, and management."
good,"Family dollar was an ok place to work. I enjoyed going to work, however I was over worked being that I did most of the managers job."
good,"This was a job that I kept only because I had no choice.  I was thankful for it, however I can't see anyone wanting to maintain a job like that long-term."
good,"Hi level of stress pay was good not enough help"
good,I only worked there for a month due to school and work conflict. The store owner was awesome but the employees were stuck up.
good,I have learned that smiling at customers always help them if they are having a bad day. I had nice co workers who are welling to help if it was needed. The hardest part of th job was dealing with snoty customers. The best part was leaving the customer satified and smiling
good,A typical day at work would be I would go in clean up the work area. Wipe down counter tops and registers and also put away any unwanted or returned product. Tend the register and handle any customer issues or questions. Set up product displays and endcaps with any sale items. Do price changing and put up sale tags through out the store. Answer telephone and look for items that customers have questions about. If we had any vendors come into the store I would check in the product they were bringing to us before they would put it on the shelves. If I was closing the store I would count the cigaretts and enter them into inventory on the computer at the end of the night. Also would sweep and mop the floors so the store would be ready for the next day and also count the register down to $100 and drop the rest of the money into the safe so it could be picked up the next day by the bank.
good,"a typical day at work was greeting clients answering questions."
good,company provided good customer service and basic needs for their customers
good,"advancement is usually based on ""who-ya-know"" not what your quality work ethic is. Was told by a previous manager that as a low-end customer associate, i HAVE 0% JOB SECURITY AND THAT ONLY THE MANAGERS ARE GUARANTEED POSITION. this was to me and the rest of the employees in a meeting. Advice only to work there only if u absolutely need a job. Work there for a year and a half and even after receiving notoriety from 3 different in-store managers, i was refused a raise from my now proven corrupted district manager."
good,"I would start off ringing out customers, facing shelves, dusting,  sweeping floor, putting delivery away."
good,The customer is always right in the world of retail! I learned that at Family Dollar customer service was very important
good,Pay was not good at all..bad managers. hours can go to as low as 9 a week.
good,"A work day for Family Dollar is a experince that I could carrie to any other job. "
good,Horriable  management  could never talk to district  or assistant district manager  was constantly disrespected by managers and  they had poor people skills wouldnt recomend it
good,ringing up customer purchases and handling returns while maintaining a clean store front and assisting with stock.
good,"Supervision of fellow employees in all aspects of the job. Stocking, inventory check, placing orders, invoicing, opening and closing the store, cleaning, security,ect"
good,"Working for Family Dollar became a simple job for being my first job. It taught me to be very responsible, to be on time, and to multi-task. Management was great. Everyone little by little taught me the do's and don't. The hardest part of the job was being able to re-stock the shelves and made sure no one was stealing as many people came in the store. "
good,This is a fun job being that its not a huge store. not much security so they are always robbed. but i enjoyed interacting with the customers to make the day go by.
good,Really enjoyed working for the family dollar company. There needs to be better management personal in some of the stores.
good,"A small budget to work with made it hard to schedule anyone with you, alot of times by yourself till later in the evening. Learned alot on my feet about management and keeping a store running. Loved working with the customers and creating a friendly atmophere for customers to shop, and using my creativity to set displays of seasonal product, worked hard to build customer base and made number one in sales for the district numerous weeks."
good,had the wrong people as management which allowed friends and family to steal from store.need to give pay raises to employees that earned it.
good,"Very productive environment. Always something to be done, and never a dull moment."
good,you have to be flexible to work here. not a good job for someone that is in school and sometimes even have kids
good,I enjoyed helping the customers. Vcame in and opened stayed till close. Ordered the customers books. Made sure the right books came in
good,ok company to work if u could deal wih higher figures disrespecting you.
good,My team members is an exceptional group of people. We Deal with a lot of people on a daily basis. This job has taught me a lot about myself and what it takes to be a manager. The hardest part of the job is dealing with budget cuts and trying maintain my store. I enjoy seeing my co-workers enjoying their jobs and the team work.
good,"A typical day at work for me is making sure customer is satify. I learn more about thr retail world. My co-workers was team player. The hardest part of the job wrer to stay safe, enjoyable part was making it home okay."
good,"I would have to take deposits to the bank before the store opens. Make sure the safe is balanced and the log books are matching. Get the registers going. Let the employees in check in vendors, do the store orders and unload the truck. Most of the time there were me and one other employee and I'm efficient when it comes to customer service. The Management was not on the same page I believe that the company would be more successful if they provided better customer service throughout their stores."
good,it was an ok job but whenIgot hired the management was in transition andit was alittledifficult to deal with each others ways of doing things
good,"Job was interesting, but hours were short. Needs some security to ensure employees are safe as well as store merchandise. I learned some valuable information while employed there,management was satisfactory,co-workers were a litthe young and the older ones had to many personal problems they wanted to unload,hardest part of the day was having to expel customers who tried to steal,helping customers locate the merchandise they needed and their appreciation for the attention I provided them."
good,"And it was fun but rough. I started out as a cashier and worked up to assistant manager. I did the best I could working almost 70 hours a week, exhausted. I stocked and organized our merchandise while assisting customers with questions or concerns. I usually opened the cash drawers for the cashiers and made sure they balanced at the end of their shift. My manager above me usually sat inside his office doing..who knows what. It was a small store and fairly easy to maintain."
good,I love helping and checking out customers. I enjoyed being able to keep a smile on my face and have a bubbly attitude to make the customeers feel comfortable and appreciated. The managment at the time was so great because they expected you to put your job before your family. I loved working at a fast pace and making sure my customers got the help they need and left happy so they would come again.
good,"Family dollar is a company that does not really focus on the people's needs , It is focused on the company needs, I have found there has been too many district managers placed in the few years i have been here, The company would be great if they could get everyone on the same page, not have different rules for one and not the other."
good,A typical day at work would be a lot of gossip. It's like you are in high school again. The trainers are great when they are getting along but do not go against what they say because their way is the right way no matter what. They do not take into consideration that just because you are new you might have good ideas. Dealing with the drama is probably the hardest part of the job and the easiest part would be learning to keep your mouth shut.
good,"I have been working at family dollar for over almost a year now as a recovery specialist and part time stock. I feel restricted with my talents and feel as if I need a different opportunity to expand in a career. During my time at family dollar I have a tedious task of fixing items, janitorial duties and restocking the entire store. I have worked 25 hours a week part time for almost a year now and it seems as if i will not be getting any extra hoursand i am very grateful and will continue to give my all."
good,Family Dollar could easily be the # 1 small box retail chain if they
good,"Most of the time, work provides opportunity to stay busy. I have learned alot about merchandising and its products. I've learned that it involves alot of man- hours to manage a retail store. I enjoy working as a team player or by myself, but like usual not all co-workers are team players, which can make your job atmosphere a bit difficult. The most difficult part about my job is lazy co-workers who don't like to work and petty customers. But overall I enjoy being around people. If anything I drive on every opportunity to make someone happy, whether it be a co-worker or a customer."
good,"i like the costumers the best. i like my co-workers, but some were pretty mean w me.. work wise hours, everything was okay..."
good,I worked there when a new store opened. Working there wasn't bad but I got my hours cut to one day a week because my manager hired her pregnant daughter. I needed more hours than that so I had to look for something else.
good,Management does not show a team member effort. You might work a 12 hour shift without a notice.
good,Family Dollar under pays and over works their employees. they expect you to do alot without giving you the proper funding.
good,It was a good experience I learned alot about working in the corprate world and it was also enjoyable.
good,The store is always unorganized. Management is annoying and harrases female employees. No one has focus and promoting is out the window if you are not a slave. Terrible work environment
good,"The only good thing was my store manager, she always worked everyday all day. The only reason I made $10.50hr. I was hired my a manager going into retirement. I am pretty sure if u are hired on now it's around $9hr."
good,"If you not ready to talk to people or you are easy angered don’t work here! "
good,It ok for some one who really doesn't have bill they don't me enough but other then that you would be ok I don't no what else to say about this job not for me
good,"Had to constantly bounce between locations to get 40 hours a week. Loved all of my co workers though, everyone kept each other updated on shifts and schedules"
good,Open the store put everything in place unload trucks greet the customers take out trash sort out all of the items clean up the store customers were great
good,"Being able to be a person with authority, gave me the chance to prove to other companies that I do have the potential of being someone that can mange a store without higher management looking over my shoulders."
good,"So so job but the hours you work are never the same. Great learning experience for newbies or an first job, but you get no employee discounts, and are left alone a lot."
good,It was an easy job and I loved my job and most customers. Just poor management. Other than that it was a really good job but I do wish it paid better.
good,Managers dont provide tools you need and never take responsibility . The pay is decent work is pretty constant. Employees are great and friendly and are a joy to be around
good,When I first started I enjoyed working there but after like 2weeks in my days were just getting cut down more employees were getting hired while Not fair
good,It can become very stressful and frustrating working at Family Dollar it can be a fast paced place to work at customers can be very rude and disrespectful.
good,I have learned so much working here good and bad. I am happy I was able to get the experience and grow and meet new people. I was able to manage and perform multiple tasks at a time on a time based schedule.
good,"Besides the pay and the overpriced medical coverage, it would be a nice place for someone just starting to work. That's if you can get past the high turnover rate."
good,The manager was awful. I couldn't recommend working for this company. I can't stand how they treat their employees. The one I worked for is now shutdown.
good,"Family Dollar is a good company to work for ,great flexible schedule, could use better pay , and holidays off , but other than that it was a okay job ."
good,Working at family dollar was not at all what i has expected. It can be very busy and customers can get pretty rude and impatient. So i learned great customer service skills.
good,I would never again try and work for this company or its brother or sister companies.the hours and higher ups are all about lies and getting what they want.
good,"People that work there rude, they expect u to noe every thing and work fast like them. They had me workin other assistant managers Registers wasn’t tellin me I wasn’t makin store money."
good,"I sincerely loved working with my customers. Management on the other hand,  Just no recognition for the good work that you put in I was an assistant manager and was knocked down to a cashier lost all my benefits all my hours just so another assistant manager could come back to our store."
good,"I came in on Sunday..Cleaned Parking Lot (pickup garbage). Took out in Store, ReStocked shelves...Monday: UnLoad Trucks w/New Merchandise into Store Room and put on shelves. That's All that week. Unless something came that I'm needed."
good,"When I first started I love the job. My manager was amazing and the people I worked with were very easy going. Overall the manager was amazing but the only time you got a raise was when state minimum wage went up each year, any other raise you had to fight for in order to even get 5¢. The company would never provide enough hours to keep the store in good working condition and fully stocked and then the district manager would complain when it wasn’t. The only full time employees were managers and no benefits or PTO are offered to to part time employees at all."
good,"Was a great company,  things have changed. No home life, high expectations with low support. Managers are expected to work for more hours than they are paid for so the company can cut labor store wide."
good,When I worked there Manager would yell at me in front of Customers!! Everyone would share a drawer so my drawer was always short I knew excalty who was taking my Money!! I was second asst manager getting 10.50 per hour while 1st manager was getting 13.00 an hour all because she knew the Family.
good,Great company to work for as long as you don't become a store manager. Does have great benefits. Wish I would have stayed an assistant manager. Not worth living there as a store manager. 70 plus hours a week.
good,I enjoy working with my customers and my employees. Overall since the merger of the company it is not the same. A lot of stores closing with short notice. As the manager they expect a lot of you but you are running the store alone for hours so that makes it extremely hard
good,"I enjoyed the employees and customers but the manager gave everybody a hard time. Was very rude and unprofessional.Would get mad when I couldnt come in due to my sons daycare being closed. i gave him the PROOF ahead of time (during interview and first day started) Overall, I did what I had to do to support me and my son."
good,"They were never satisfied with any progress. They give you an advancement opportunity, but give you a problem store. They put you in a position to fail. If they don't like you they gossip about you and alienate you."
good,"As a previous asm I was grateful for stable work but after 1 1/2 year of no raises and constant pressure to work longer/ harder (due to lack of employees) I quit. They will NOT fire you, they will make you quit. Mother’s Day my stores glass door was shot out and management told us “Business as usual!”"
good,"It was a super easy job, but the manager was OCD and a little crazy. The amount of time spent making employees do unimportant tasks is ridiculous. I've been in retail since I graduated high school and this store was over the top for unimportant things just so the manager would look good."
good,"Benefits are great. Sadly that is it.. Nonstop heavy repeatative lifting and stacking. Very fast paced."
good,General Manager was to confrontational! Always felt like I moved all the product out on the floor! Also to much theft!  The company always said it was the employees fault even though we couldn't stop a customer if we knew they stole something! Just a stressful environment!
good,It can be a friendly atmosphere. I learned to be patient with customers. Some Asst.Managers should do more work.I love seeing smiles on people's faces.
good,Will answer if asked. To much to say and will not post on here about them I feel they do not care about their employers family time. Love the job just not having no time with family
good,"I Was Very Excited To Work At Family Dollar Because This Was My First Ever Job, But Due To The Type Of Treatment I Was Receiving From Some Workers I Had To Leave. I Believe I Can Do Better."
good,Managers do not follow protocol. Contacting Human Resources is mostly useless do to not following up and allowing District managers to control situations.
good,"I think they should pay more"
good,My time was well spent because I was always there.I learned that every manager is different and although she was hard on her staff she taught us alot. The strore was cleaner and more friendly
good,"Management was stressed trying to keep up with the large amounts of freight sent to a small building which caused stress for everyone under them. The hours were never posted on time, schedules were switched without asking and there were no benefits to speak of. Combined with bad communication it caused many problems and more stress than it should have."
good,Fun place to work. Very busy store. Not enough staff to cross train. Maintaining was a challenging. Yet it was a very good learning experience to develop management skills
good,i worked with the company during high school but i only had half days at school and once i was finished with high school i stayed to work for college. It wasn't very flexible in schedule and the management was terrible.
good,"The Cashier position is fast paced, some customers are rude, and you are expect to do everything while the managers walk around the store doing whatever."
good,"Been working 5 to 7 HOURS per week because I mentioned to the managers pet that i was going to leave the job if my school got harder to balance with my job hours. Manager is very unprofessional reprimands in front of customers and other staff. Also tired of the people stealing. And when they are caught, they threaten you so you have to be careful leaving at night. Would not go back."
good,you have to be doing something productive. You dont have to work yourself to hard but at least try to get something done. The job is actually pretty easy you just dont make anything
good,A typical day at work was smooth and boring at the same time. It is a very quiet workplace. The management was bad because they would wait until the last minute(the night before) to tell you about your schedule the next day. The truck days were only hard because there isn't much space and sometimes you'd have to unload the whole truck alone.
good,While family Dollar pays well they have High theft rates and bad management who if they don't like an employee will find a way to force them out.The benefits were decent but the customers are rude and mean and if they can't afford something they will take it.
good,The customers are great so are my coworkers. But the work ethic is on a fast down fall. Since they have been bought out 2 years ago it has slowly to a turn for the worst.
good,In the beginning you are optimistic about the work and it’s culture but you quickly realize that what was promised in the interview will never happen and that the company itself isn’t willing to work with you or offer constructive criticism. It more threats of termination or replacement.
good,You work your take off  in the short span of time your there. You never have enough  employees  working  to get  anything  done on time. If you get hurt and stay and continue  to do your job your crapped  on. Your not appreciated  and your thoughts are not taken into consideration. But if you can handle low wages no hours and no time it's your kind of job.
good,"Family Dollar, can be very demanding at times, and if you end up with a bad manager, then you are more likely stuck doing most of the work, a lot of conflicts between other employees at times, but that depends on the people you work with. It is very rewarding seeing everything you do , and how the customers also notice, and employees notice as well."
good,"Small, Dusty, Full of boxes and always have roaches or mice crawling about Had an awful smell of egg salad and lavender toilet paper; Always had only one chair when 6 of us would be on break at a time.."
good,It is very inconsistent. The schedule is forever changing depending on where you work and you may be gping from store to store if there are other in your city.
good,"messy place, unbalanced, not oranized. some employees dont get what they deserve as far as promotions ans other much needed recongnition. the managers at soe of the stores are messy and unbalanced the store is everywhere."
good,Family dollar should be able to rasie their minmum wage like other retail stores have started. It has always been a joke among co workers that theyd rather be at target or even walmart. I had a manger that didnt believe in break let along a lunch. even though our 9 hour day is suppose to include two 15s. terrible. my store didnt even have a break room. Its not right to work someone non stop for 9 hours.
good,"I have to say the best days to work are Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays. These are the days we receive product and restock shelves which keep the days running fast. When typical opening shift consists of wiping all front windows, sweeping the parking lot, throwing out all trashes, and loaning on register to start the day. Then I front and face my isles."
good,"Temporary job for someone who is looking for extra money. Hardest part of job, on a store level is dealing with shop lifters and working with other individuals who make the job hard."
good,An okay place to work has its ups and downs but switching to a every 2 week pay check I couldn’t not do . So unfortunately I had to find a more convenient job for myself.
good,Everyone seemed not to enjoy their jobs work enviornment was very uncomfortable not any advancements didnt have flexible schedule and just overall i feel if you can out work manager i dont wont to be in the work place
good,I'm just looking for a new job. I have nothing to say good or bad about the company. I just want a new job in a different field. A new career sounds wonderful.
good,I am a very upbeat and out going person. I had enjoyed talking with the customers and helping them find products they were interested in. I had a store manager and two assistants. I did not get along with one assistant. I got along with the rest of the employees and the customers.
good,Retail is something you have to be strong and committed too. It takes away from alot of family time during freight days and inventory time. You have to be very careful with other employees and every action that can be used
good,"i worked my butt off for that company, traveled to help other stores and all my manager did was complain even tho she would always ask me to cover for anyone who called out.i didnt mind the job just the lack of respect at the store i worked"
good,My time at Family Dollar was spent mostly begging for more hours to support my family. I wouldn't recommend this job to the head of household unless you have a manager's position or it is your second gig.
good,Not as advertised. The training is sub par within the industry and the communication was not adequate. The have systemic issues within upper management which causes staffing issues.
good,"management wasnt good it was unorganized, there werent enough employees, didnt get paid enough for the work that you did, everyone was miserable there was a shoplifting problem"
good,management needs to be more hands on and stop by more unexpectedly to get a better understanding of who really works and who stays in the back office.As a former imployee i was greatly disappointed in the lack of interest of dress codes and work ethics. some of the management seem to think that doing minimal work is all that is required to keep a job. in my opinion the hardest part of the job is working hard to better the company and watching management do very little. This is way we need more surprise inspections to weed out the slackers and promote the hard workers. until that happens productivity will continue to decrease.
good,"Family dollar is exactly what I would call a good work environment. Customers are rude and steal on a daily basis. The companies solution to the theft problem is if, ""we work the products to the sales floor faster than they're are stealing are sales should fine""."
good,"Different sites have different management, not all the same. Hope that the sale has changed those in management. Not much care for employees, all work, without any breaks 9-12 hrs a day, no water, no one cared, so hungry after shift. Unhealthy atmosphere, developed health problem as a result. Felt used and abused by company. Had to leave after 3 years. Never again."
good,When I first started wveryone acted as if they whwre my best friends later come to find out some others where sneak talking about me a lot I couldn’t tell u how I felt it was like I was in high school again with teenagers only good manager there was was shaunndra she’s a great manager and stood up for me and fought for my employment
good,"Problems consisted of backbiting, hearsay, slander, empty promises of promotion, as well as non-professionalism. Dirty, crude, & simply off-putting. Inability to work together; management disrespectful; assistant management complete & total disregard for rules & regulations. Vulgar music that does not coincide w/ company policy. Abuse of authority w/ total disregard for public safety or comfortability."
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in, work 5-6 hours alone running the register and putting up freight/back-stock, 4 hours till close have someone come in to run the register in order to have coverage, have a task sheet filled out by someone you rarely get to see or anything you hear from is negative, do whatever I can do with what very little I have control over and go home to either enjoy a day off or get called in bright and early because someone either called out, something personal has come up, or someone just didn't show up, which depending on who the manager is they will either cover the shift or you will get called in every chance that arises. The things that I have learned here however I feel will help me a lot in future workplaces, anything as far as running freight/stocking/recovery goes, as well as increasing my experience with customer service and working with a lot of different kinds of people. (Seeing as people tend to come and go often.) As far as the management goes, from what I have experienced personally may not be the same for everyone else and I have been under 3 different managers since I've been here, that range anywhere between hard working, dependable, and then if you're really lucky you get the manager that you never really see at all unless you're getting called in and briefly speak to before they leave and you work their shift. Higher management so far in my experience is almost just about the same, you get who you get for your district and so on, and can range anywhere between. ""Oh okay, we hear you loud and clear."" - 3 years later. Or someone"
good,"Management constantly made life harder for all employees. Lack of basic communication lead to a disarray in the staff. Manager did not follow rules when it came to disciplinary actions nor enforced them when needed. A basic day was working from 9:00am to 5:00pm and hoping the ASM on clock would remember your break. I enjoyed working with my fellow CSR, but the customers will always be my favorite. The hardest part of my job was walking in knowing i was being taken advantage of and not being able to express that because of certain ""management ties"" with higher staff."
good,While management at a local level was fairly decent upper management left something to be desired. Employees often worked alone and were denied basic human rights. The safety of their employees was and is not a priority.
good,It was a learning experience. Definately taught me a lot about customer service and how to handle upset customers.  The other employees were great. It's a very physical job.
good,Family dollar is not real bad to work for. They expect to much from there managers without any help. Most managers are in their stores for 8 or 9 hours by themselves and still has to get things done.
good,The district manager sucks but there are several managers that are good to work for. They do like to promote within the company so it can further your career.
good,not good for business to work really dont care who steal or buy i dont like the place the people the boss an the workers an how managment be its not good
good,"open store make sure everything is secured. Go bank get change for the safe. Deposit any finances from the night before. Check in merchants truck loads. stock shelves wait on customers till my "
good,"Unless this is a temporary job, I wouldn't work for this company. They do not care about your home life period.  It's all about the company. If something last minute happens they expect you to tell them the day before.    Which is not possible"
good,"The work was easy and meeting all kinds of customers is a perk. But I would have to open the store and close it on weekends with little to no help. There are no scheduled break times, you just take one when you can."
good,Could be better run and smoother transitions in which the store successfully helps and demonstrates its success in the community. Also needs more on the same page workers
good,Productive but confusing with too many ppl trying to be the boss. If it was something that needed to be done. There would be the managers but then also other ppl trying to boss everyone around and confusing the workers.
good,long day with no breaks  short staff     unloading trucks alone  in the store alone with no help  staff will walk out on you  my district Manager was not very well trained  so the training i got was very poor   the building  was ok but the floor was not maintained the shelving  was to high  there was no one in the store most of the time we worked alone with no help
good,open store prepare cash drawers for incoming sales reps verify safe totals drop off deposits clean store inventory and stock unload trucks assign work areas make weekly schedules for sales reps interview potential new employess
good,Working at Family Dollar has its ups and its Downs some days were a lot better than others we had some very great customers and some whack jobs if you ask me
good,"I was at this job for two months. I sord of liked it from the beginning, but after a while I did not. The manager was starting to slack off. He didn't seem to care what was going on at the time."
good,"A typical day at work was checking out customers,cleaning,and stocking. I learned how to stock, and management sometimes were ok. The work place culture was interesting. The hardest part sometimes was dealing with rude people and the most enjoyable part was I knew how to do my job so it would go by."
good,Hours are sporadic as they can go from 30 down to 15 in week easily. Salaried and hourly employees share hours and they are allotted to the store to be distributed by the manager. Many times a manager has 40 to 60 hours while hourly employees can have 15 or less.
good,Be prepared to train yourself.And expect as a store manager to work a lot of hours while on salary.Customers steal a lot and they just won't give you enough payroll to watch or run the store.Most days you work by yourself.
good,"Store was busy all the time. Most enjoyable part about the job was the great staff I got to work with through the years until new manager took over. New manager was lazy and tried having me do her job when she went on vacation which could of lost me my job and hers. Most enjoyable part was stocking the shelves and not having to cashier, it made my shifts go quicker."
good,"This company does not offer benefits or any type of job security. Do not get stuck working as a cashier for two plus years, as it has happened to ninety percent of the employees. Great way to earn extra dollars without too much attachment to job."
good,"I would greet people has they walked in the store with a smile on my face, I would also assist any costumers who needed my help then i would cash them out and greet them again as they left. I also stocked merchandise in there correct isles by there bar code number and did some light maintenance if I saw the store a little messy I would avoid any cluttered areas because i like to stay organized and have the company looking professional."
good,I like working at family Dollar but the pay rate is not enough to take care of 6 kids and prefer some morning but work in the evening I'm trying to seek better pay else where
good,The manager at the bissionet location wasn't fair he was rude and didn't look into things when i complained. Store also has rats in the food section. The manager and the assistant manager would always yell at me and point their fingers in my face.
good,"The store was split in half. You have some employees working while other employees are talking on the phone, outside smoking or making trips to other stores."
good,Working for this company was nice in the way that people could afford the things that they needed. However they required me to work open to close 2 days per week and only got 1 day off if i passed the DM's walk thru. They had very little concern about the work life balance of the employees or me as the store manager. I had the District Manager come in one day with a belly shirt and flip flops on to visit and not say a word to me and then leave the store so i really felt the professional ways are very limited as well.
good,It wasn’t bad but it wasn’t good. I worked from 3pm-10:30pm and wasn’t allowed any breaks. I was the only cashier which was tough because it was very busy. I was also still in high school so the hours weren’t the best fit for me but I had no other choice
good,Not enough money. Not enough hours. Lack of communication through employees. Lack of care and work ethic from employees. store was always dirty. no room for advancements.
good,"money handling, customer service, did refunds, open the store, closed the store, stocked, cleaned, sweet and mop the store, made cash deposits, dealt with vendors."
good,The store that I was working at had rats and they were not trying to do the correct procedures to get them gone. So I think they should look into their management
good,You work hard and they don't appreciate the work  we do.  I work as a assistant manager and that a lot of hours I work if the employee don't show up to work I have to work that shift.
good,"Since I've been here alot of the employees have shown hospitality and welcomed me, they provide one thirty minute break where it is mandatory to clock out."
good,There was no chance of growth at the facility I was in. I was  hindered from even trying to research what possibilities there may be in the future. I was resented by fellow employees because of my experience and the trend of the manager to rely on me rather than them.
good,It was a lot of work for little money. The environment was very fast paced. I had no problem keeping up though. I had a great crew with me who really helped the day go by.
good,On a day to day basis the environment was very hostile. The immediate management was very lax in there operations of the store. Not to mention the district manager almost did't care about what was happening in any of his stores.
good,"I love the customers that come to family dollar, seeing there faces make you want to stay with the company. As far as benefits and compensation for your job it isn't the best. I wouldn't recommend it, but at the same time it's not completely terrible."
good,"The typical day involved stocking and managing the front desk at the same time, The manager did not care about my safety and one of my supervisors smoked marijuana while on the clock."
good,I worked hard for little pay and the job just requires a lot meaning mental and physical stress. It is good if you want to make quick money and have no other plains. because the schedule change faster than the second hand on a clock. For anyone who works there Good Luck!
good,I enjoyed working with this company. The only issues were they didnt recognize the benefit of pumping during work and how that worked. they played favorites of who would advance and who wouldnt. they did not understand after certain surgeries that doing truck would hurt you more than help.
good,Pays fair but once they feel like your not useful termination will come from anything if your not favored. Everyone acts very sneaky and it’s not an upfront company to much behind the back behind the scenes.
good,Retail is retail and of course it's a small environment and you get a lot of random folks. Not to bad though! I didn't mind the work load. I actually enjoyed the employees.
good,"I don't like to speak ill of any company, but being a family first person, this job is not conducive to the needs of the average family. The odd hours on weekends place you at the store sometime 13 to 15 hours a day on Sundays."
good,"fast pace work place "
good,"The family dollar at worked at was located on Cullen, and customers would usually steal, and sometimes threats were involved, one night they robbed with a gun, and it was a dramatic experience for me, so I had put my 2 week notice immediately."
good,The customer are great and the job it self is awesome! The management at some locations are great and other not so. A Typical work day is dealing with Geat people.
good,"Management wasn’t that great but coworkers we okay, the workplace was bad and wasn’t as clean, but overall it was an experience I wouldn’t forget nor enjoyed."
good,"I mean I enjoy the customers, I don't really care for the company. I would enjoy my job if I got paid more because I have experience and also I would like to have benefits... I would feel motivated to come to work."
good,"My job duties were not an issue, but the manager that I was under seemed very unfair and unprofessional. He was not a team play at all! My typical work day consisted of being followed around by my manager. It almost felt like harassment."
good,Working at Family Dollar provided me with time to improve myself. It taught me a great deal with how to deal with people and certain situations dealing with them. I liked it at the beginning. But as time went by I felt it was no longer for me and I needed to grow. So that's exactly what I intend on doing.
good,It is a good place for teenager after school and older person for the day time. They more experience worker to train the new employees.  They should be more attended.
good,I liked working at Family Dollar personal issues came up so I quit. At times it was fast pace and other times it was slow. When it was slow I stocked the product and cleaned the store.
good,"I like family dollar as a whole. but our manager is the devil with two faces. she has lost 2 good employers in the past wk. and one was a very, very hard worker, and getting ready to lose 2 more. have put in transfer requests but never happens. would love to stay with family dollar, but not work with her."
good,management sucks can do whatever they want and the higher management does not care as long as the store opens. Just another junk store with a lot of people with bad attitudes
good,Not a safe place to work in a high crime city the problem was security or the lack of but hopefully things will get better for the safety of the family dollar employees
good,They are a slow paced work environment. It's hard to advance due to the lack of openings in management. Managers don't get paid enough. Job and personal life were pretty balanced
good,"Not a good fit if you need a good work and home life balance."
good,"I really enjoyed the customers, and employees at Family Dollar.  This was a family environment store.  I loved assisting the older customers with what they needed in the store."
good,"You would have to be at your fast pace of moving to stock or unload the truck. There will only be two employee working, the cashier and assistant manager and sometimes the store manager."
good,"Got terminated for being sick and needing to leave and no one would cover, so I closed the store and left, they fired me the next day. My district manager told me he couldn't help me and I have to find my own help. And if I left I get fired.."
good,I don't​ want to comment on this or any other jobs I previously held. I do t think this is a really good practice to have and may discourage anyone​  who may find this job a  good fit
good,"Family Dollar can be a fun and new experience to work for. Especially dealing with all types of people with different attitudes. It's a fast pace job but can have at least one slow day, typically Sunday's. It's not hard to move up at all with Family Dollar. The only thing is the pay is not worth the aggravation. Store Manager's do not care about their Assistant Manager's concerns or take their life into consideration. They will throw you at another store and won't even ask if you mind going. If it's a problem they will make it into a bigger problem. If i could i would have just stayed a cashier to avoid the agitation i had with the store manager's."
good,"my hardest part at this job was dealing with certain customers because of the location I was at but that's when I had to put my friendliness to action and to my belief, all my customers loved me."
good,I loved to come into the store and stock the shelves at family dollar because it was a laid back and take your time kind of job. I never felt rushed and I was able to do my job without stressing.
good,I learn a lot.. se al type if people deal with any kind of people.. i really like it but just some people that work there don't make me fell comfortable
good,typical work day consist of a list of things to do some days be by myself being the only cashier and one stock person . cant get much done during my shift cause i be at the register . Since a new manager came along had nothing but drama and no communication. The hardest part of the job is working holidays and no family time. nothing enjoyable bout the job anymore.
good,I became an Assistant Manager within about 4 mos.  Once I became an Assistant Manager I was required to work every holiday and most evenings (closing up at 9p)  To be able to have weekends with my children I had to work very long weekends (every other weekend).  When I was called and was needed to work last minute I was expected to drop everything and show up for work.  Being an Assistant Manager I was expected to work alone most of the time (at least until 6p) most of the time.  There was opportunities to work shifts at other stores.  The District Manager liked me and requested that I take the Manager training course they had several times a year at my store.  I went through it and graduated from it.  Anytime the system went down I was left to call and had to use my personal cellphone as well as continue to do my job as best I could.  Sometimes we had a lot to do and not enough time to get it done (if anything went wrong it was not completed).  I was off for a major surgery and was unable to come back until I was released 100%.  Nobody tells you that and the communication (from corporate especially was non existent).  Every operator tells you something different and no one knows what any one else was doing.
good,"This job was just a step stool. If you are looking for a career this is not it. Family Dollar is good for making extra cash, but you can not support a family with the low wages Family dollar pays."
good,"the store was a mess, the employees did not care , they did not respect the manager and she was great my mom always said I should write a book about the places I have worked because I have worked everywhere and worked with some characters ! The store was just a mess , customers would steal everything , no working security , was robbed at one point, customers trashed the store! I do not recommend it to anyone , they should just tear it down !"
good,Too much work and not enough pay. Higher management horrible when it comes to communication. Revolving door for managers and associates. High shrink levels and little to no support and help from higher management.
good,"Stock"
good,Did not offer raises annually as stated during interview. No vaction or paid time off. Hours were pretty good had to work 365 no days the store was closed.
good,"Great place to receive retail training and learn about inventory/stocking etc. The job offers areas to move within the company which is beneficial. However, long hours due to short staffed most of the time. A lot of theft prevention was needed and learned while I worked with this company as well, but the company was beginning to grow in that area when I was employed there. Management was great, but corporate was sometimes difficult, not seeing what was best for each individual store, etc."
good,It was ok i have a order for my triplets get them every other  friday manger worked with until things she wanted workin more hrs and started to change my schdule without notifaction
good,It was hard working there. I did not have my own transportation. The hours were crazy. The staff was cool. The customers were good. It was a cool job.
good,It just wasn't what I want customers were fine it was the employees to me wasn't right fair didn't wanna work come to work on time the store stayed junky not cleaned it stayed stocked sometimes just wasn't for me
good,"Fast paced environment, promotes within the company, customers in my location were always very friendly, management at my location wasn't very professional."
good,i hated doing freight and thats how i got hurt and that was the end of me working there which wasnt fun but over all it wasnt a bad place to work
good,I learned how to be a good customer service provider and cashier because so many people come through there thank u for good customer service
good,"Co-workers are hard working and love there jobs. They go out of there way to complete there task and get the job done!!!"
good,The work is easy to perform but must be done with a skeleton crew. There is rarely enough employees to provide great customer service while getting the work done. Favoritism is huge in this company. If higher up management does not want you in a position they will make it very hard for you to succeed until you step down.
good,good company good money good co workers very good benefits paid weekly . uniforms and not wearing my on clothes a big company with growth opportunities
good,"Worked 70 hours weekly by myself until 4 or 5 on daily basis,  given more and more work and less and less payroll , new district manager poorly trained, and drank alcohol with alot of cooperation workers."
good,"Manager would blame sales team for work that they (the manager) didn't do (when sales staff can't do it anyway), absolutely no compromise when it came to days off, no room for advancement, they would rather hire outside the company."
good,"well , I meet all kinds of people and some rude customers but I enjoy working with customers face to face. I like to know and see the satisfaction on customers that I have been able to help them."
good,"it was a very fast pace busy environment , that required strong customer service . co workers normally on a good day your getting help and can get through the day easy other times it feels like its just you and you have no social life. Overall its a job for the strong minded people who dont mind working long for little money"
good,The pay is not enough. There were also not enough hours to go around. Too many companies like to have only minimum wage employed at part time so they can avoid offering benefits
good,the work is heavy and there is less workers working in the store in addition to that the store is usually mess
good,The workplace was very upbeat and fasted paced but store and district managers were very hard to work with as well as communicate with and get a hold of. Store manager was rude to all employees and customers and hired family members against company policy.
good,"Family Dollar was a great fun job for me. I love meeting new people, helping them find things and just making their visit better."
good,"I worked from 9:30 to 4:30 every Monday thru Friday and I say that, as long as me and our A-team worked together on one accord, our day goes by smooth and fast. Our manager and asst manager put in the work with us. So that has shown major team work. We've learned  a lot about each other and how well we work together."
good,"I had some good co-workers at this job, some were caring people who worked hard, even in a stressful environment. this could be due the recent merger."
good,"no help, didnt feel like family, always had to stay later then scheduled time even thought I had another job in the morning."
good,"Family Dollar"
good,A typical day at work was always interesting. There was always something to do. The hardest part of my job while I was there was the expectation set by the upper management of the company and the contradiction of what the district manager interpreted it as. There was always a lack of communication between the two and the store would suffer. I had a great team of people.
good,"Manager becomes friends with some employees, then fails to discipline them for violations."
good,I worked for this company for over a year and advanced quite well. That was until after Christmas when all non minimum wage employees came in and found that they only got 6-12 hrs for the week while the less paid got 32+. When we confronted management we were informed that it would be this way for 8 weeks. Myself and about 3/4 of the people this affected left that day. After talking with some other people that worked at other stores I have found that this is a standard practice with Target after the holidays. They will keep on the extra personnel they hired for the holidays until March just so they can work for next to nothing while the long term staff has their hours cut to next to nothing. Once the long term people that can't make it on the few hours they are given leave they will offer the seasonal workers their positions once spring hits. Then it will start again after the holidays. I do not recommend working for this company unless you are in management.
good,"I was an asst manager. She was more concerned about her bonus at the end of the year, then anything else. She wouldnt even turn the heater on in the bck room in the dead of winter, when unloading semi trucks! Just so she could save money.... she was like this with all things.. even when paying her employees. "
good,My experience with Family Dollar was unique one. Unfortunately I was not with the company after they changed management.
good,On typical day of work scheduled it is very stressful & you have to be multi-task person @ all times. I learned that you have to start from the bottom & work your way up to succeed. Managment could be better. My co-workers we're just finr to work with.The hardest part of my job was to be multi-task associate.The most anjoyable part of the job was meeting all different kinds of customers.
good,I am an assistant manager at Family Dollar. A typical work day is filled with unloading freight and stocking shelves. I have learned to have more patience with upper management. The hardest part of my job is working with my store manager. The part I enjoy most is my customers.
good,No one wanted to work as a team. No security was available and our lives was in danger due to the area and we kept getting robbed. team members was never on the same page and manager and assistant manager were not agreeing with each other.
good,"I love helping people, having a good rapport with others, a feeling of ""I did something that made a difference for someone today."" I love my customers. What I do not like is the criticism of outside management and messiness of internal personnel, the feeling of being unappreciated. I also do not like how much insurance cost through the company, very expensive. The biggest upset with working here is the amount of time they want you to work for little money. We get paid a salary, but if you have to put a cot in the back and live at the store, they are fine with that. We have to work 52 hours plus but only get paid for 48. Then they remind you that you are salary and the store is your life and your home life is not corporates problem."
good,I love retail one of the hardest but challenging job that makes me what more. Hard work is the one thing that drives me to coaching and encouraging others to do so as well. Having a supportive attitude working in this field is also great to have.
good,I started at 7am most days because I was the assistant manager so I would open the store. when I got to work I would open the safe and prepare the drawers and the bank deposit. I would also help unload the truck when it came in but for the most part I would restock the store tag all the merchandise keep the store clean and help out with customers
good,"Being responsible for your associates, making sure associates know everything you know , learning to deal with different personalities"
good,well this is a slow paste job wit about 2- 4 people working there really isn't anything hard about this job unloading trucks an stocking thur out the day
good,"It was a fun job at first, but couldn't keep people working there. The upper management needs to be fired and replaced. Too many money hungry people that don't understand what their employees do"
good,"Employees working at the Family Dollar are responsible for unloading the truck, stocking the shelves, cashiering and assisting customers. We are also responsible for setting up signs for sales and putting out the new weekly flyer."
good,"Not a very fun company to work for, They are all about the money and can care less about thier employees. There is no such thing as family/work balance"
good,"This job was stressful and hard because the store that I worked at had a lack of communication so I never knew what needed to be done around the store, never knew what had been done. Management was not the best that I have been around. From this job I learned how to be a better role model for coworkers, I learned that not everyone has the same desire to do better in a company and help other coworkers reach the same standards."
good,"Working with the people was the best part of the job, but having to work a 1000+ piece shipment in 2 days with only 1 person on register and 1 person in the back is way too much to expect."
good,"field management expects managers to maintain high standards of store appearance with very little help to do it."
good,"Family Dollar could best be described as ""people eaters"".  I was there ten years, eight as a maintenance manager, and in that time they lost ten maintenance managers with me being number ten.  I was fired for poor attendance.  I had missed three days this year.  I was also not allowed to view my personnel records.  "
good,Work is usually a breeze but can be change by ruling costumers or un happy team members. Ive learned never to bring problems from home into your work place. Hardest part of the job in not being able to ensure your safety from robbing costumers or individuals period. The most enjoyable part is closing up and knowing i made it through another successful day.
good,"I've only been there two months and they've already gotten a new manager. We're not allowed to get overtime which is so crazy because not everything is able to get done. In addition, that was the only way I could earn extra money. The new manager gives majority of the hours to her friends that she brought with her from the other family dollar store which is unfair. The hardest part of the job is being managed by someone who doesn't know what their really doing."
good,"typical day would be spent stocking and working the registers"
good,"Everyday when I came to work I counted my drawer "
good,My review of working for family dollar is that it was one of the worst experiences I have faced in my life next to going to war while I was in the military.
good,Its was a lot to deal with when dealing with a lot of diiferent personality.I didn't feel like I was respect as an employee an will not recommende anyone to work there.
good,"It's an okay company to work for they start you out way less than minimum wage and it is very hard to get a raise. They expect you to unload the truck, stock the shelves, and run the cash register all at the same time. The staff was great and got along very well"
good,There was not adequate staff to function and take care of customers properly.
good,"A typical day would include me either opening or closing the store. During the beginning of the week we get a truck and that is when we work the freight to stock the shelves. I am responsible for different manager duties while still completing other tasks on the floor. This includes but is not limited to collecting deposits, getting stuff for customers that may be locked away. Others things I am responsible for is maintaining the sales floor and making sure customers are satisfied. Cashiers have to call me for voids and orders cancelation. My job involves dealing with a lot of different things and you have to be able to multi-tasks. Another key thing that I am very well at is communicating with my team members, having patience, using critical thinking and problem solving skills."
good,on a typical day i would pull and stock about 6-7 u-boats of merchandise a day while also performing a store recovery (pulling all of the merchandise towards the shelves to easily attract consumers as well as obtaining any expired items and exposing of them.
good,"The staff is great, the managers train very well to help further growth inside of there company, it's minimum wage and I've learned more about cash registering from them."
good,"No security"
good,This is a very physical job and the company does not provide district help.
good,"Family Dollar can be  good starter job for someone looking to make a career out of retail but the middle management and loss prevention arms of the company do everything in their power to mistrust and find fault with employee's. From blatant accusation to insinuation of wrong-doing. On top of that managers are expected to run skeleton crews throughout the stores operating hours. 1 manager/asst 1 associate due to payroll restrictions.This limitation is in place during busy times. freight times, holiday times etc. Advancement comes as people above you quit or are terminated. Advancing beyond the individual store level management is not very likely without some related degree. So there is very little chance of ever having enough hand son experience to advance beyond that position. While I personally did learn a lot working there, If I knew what I know now I wouldn't have taken the job."
good,Daily task consist of unloading trucks and making sure that products were correctly and placed in the correct locations while handling any customer inquiries
good,cashier and front products on the shelf's. the management was never around.
good,A typical day at work was most often slow unless it was a holiday. I learned how to stock shelves of merchandise and greet the customers. Management wasn't to helpful to me. The other co-workers were helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job was making sure some customers wouldn't steel the merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the jopb was working with the general pulic and assisting them.
good,"steady for the most part, tends to be slow at night."
good,clock in by 3 or 5 p.m and begin re stocking and/or assist at register if needed
good,"I loved working for this company because I love working with the public and I love working in retail. But I do have to say that upper management like district and regional managers are completely dis trusting and do not hold to what they promise, therefor giving false promises and never being able to trust in what they say makes this company a very anxiety filled place to work. If you consider just working as a cashier then it is an excellent fit. But once you advance beware of the politics at this place of business."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, the actual job of cashiering, customer service and stocking were very full-filling. The only problem with the job was that the store manager was very unprofessional and had no customer service skills or manors."
good,I have worked very hard for Family Dollar and haven't had a great experience.
good,"I would use my great customer service skills though out shift. I would go bye all safety guidelines though out the shift, Clean the building from top to bottom. Im trustworthy, Honest, and Always on time. I have a great people skills, and very Dependable."
good,"I don't know that I could give an accurate review of the company. I was hired to fix a problem store.During my time at Family Dollar the district manager was replaced a few times and eventually the regional manager. Soon after the new regional was hired 90% of the district store managers were laid off. The hardest part of my job was that I was constantly short handed (my salary consumed allot of payroll) but with hard work and ingenuity you can get the job done. I would say it is a great place to learn the ropes of Store Management and basic retail if you do not have allot of experience. There are many types of product from clothing to household furnishing, electronics, grocery, health beauty, automotive along with large seasonal promotions to name a few. If you are looking for experience and have a positive attitude this a good company to start with."
good,I learned  to work independently and productively with a short staff and long work hours. I was willing to preform out of my job requirement to get work done. hardest part is unloading 1500 piece truck. but I enjoyed the small staff and really knowing who I worked with.
good,"clock in, start stocking, make sure cashier is set and work hel customers, etc... really don't have much to say about this job preferred if was ask in person."
good,retail job good for student pos transactions stocking unloading trucks
good,"My job included helpig customers find items, ringing up the customers items, keeping the store nice and neat. My management was great. I had great hours. My co -workers were friendly and helped me out when needed. The hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers. I enjoyed helping my customers and making my store look great each and every day."
good,great employees. poor corporate. no one really knew what they were doing.pay sucked for being trained to run the whole store.
good,"I worked under one of the best managers, and was in a training store.  There were long hours and little chance of making more than minimum wage."
good,A job where you have to be a great people person. Not a very hard job  but will have its complicated moments.
good,"well , i come too work clock in get my register count my draw to make sure it is a 100$ , then the manager put me on cashier.i ring up for about 4-11 hours , i don't get breaks i be very tired and my feet be killing me."
good,"The most rewarding part of the job is the customers. I have recently transferred between stores, and the satisfaction of being ""tracked down"" by regular customers at the previous location is a real boost. Everyday is a learning experience. Every customer is different. To succeed in this retail world, one must try to accomidate all customers and save the sale. Retail is a fast paced world, one in which I thrive."
good,it has its up's and down's but advancement is very very slow and so are raise's but it is a job
good,"Family Dollar doesn't treat employees with respect, do not pay what the employees are worth. The Managers aren't trained well and do not train the other employees either. "
good,The hardest part of this job was unloading the truck because there is a lot of heavy lifting. I most enjoyed working with the customers.
good,Great atmosphere but pay is very low. Assistant store managers barely make above minimum wage and not enough security for the employees.
good, It is hard to get an advancement or raises. Most co-workers do not work in a professional manner. 
good,"just a temp job, needed the money at the time, plus the experience "
good,"Fast paced, very crazy, not for someone who wants to be lazy."
good,long hours slow a lot of drama not worth the stress for the pay
good,"The Managers I think is over loaded with work and stress out because they have to meet thier payroll every weeks so when they have to cut hrs they have to cut the employee hrs instead of theirs means some Managers work 80 hrs a week , I think its burning the Managers out and their stress levels are high and it reflects on the employees, I gave my two weeks before moving from Tampa To Clermont but will go forward with another company in the field that I enjoy doing"
good,"High volume makes the day go fast, very busy, however completing multi tasks is rewarding"
good,"Family Dollar was a good start off job for me, but im looking for something better that will allow me to grow with a rewarding career."
good,"I would check out customers. I would stock shelves. Help customers with any questions they have. I had to answer the phone and sign for packages. I would help the manager do whatever needed to be done like clean, stock, count money, take money to the bank, and help unload the truck every week. The hardest part of the job would be getting on the ladder trying to reach things in high places. Besides that the job was pretty simple. My favorite part was working with customers and talking with them while I checked them out. I enjoy talking with people."
good,"Good place to work if your not having a baby! Must be a people person with lots of patients,and understanding."
good,This company is not a very reliable company to work for and I wouldn't reccomend anyone who has children or is in school to work for this company.
good,"Steady days with customers, stocking inventoy, cashiering, store opening and closing procedures,safe control and deposits, manage cashiers. I learned inventory control on a pdt gun system, and placing store orders, extensive customer service skills, stocking. The employees are nice to work with, company in a whole, not very pleasant pce of employment. I really enjoyed working with the public of my hometown, it was very enjoyable. The worst part of the position was unloading the inventory truck weekly, by hand, from the back door to the carts, and then to the floor for stocking. It is a very physical position."
good,Meeting great people .stocking doing Report and cashier what i have learn how to be patience and understanding and helping people in need.I know i am a good manager reason is i treat and respect people as i would want to be treated...co worker i get along with them.There no hard part of my job some things that goes on you just got to put up with it...The enjoyable part of my job is my customers
good,It was busy all the time i learned how to grin and greet customers the management did their part in keeping the store safe and their workers and then here come some lazy co-workers and some that like to work but we all got along and worked together the hardest part of my job was not flipping out on the lazy ones and the best part was making sure that everything was going smooth for the rest of my shift that's was the enjoyable part of my job.
good,greeting customers as they enter store...utilizing video surveillance cameras...helping customers and associates with issue during store peak times as needed
good,friendly co workers did alot of customer service and cash handling
good,"Just work managers had their favorites,I learned how to keep my cool when dealing with irate customers,the co workers laugh in your face talks about you behind their back.The most enjoyable was certain managers and customers."
good,Developed Team Members on Family Dollar operating practices and procedures
good,"Family Dollar was a busy work place, I learn how to better my cash handling skills."
good,"Typical day is hard work,I have learn to cummicate and listen better,"
good,work frieght wait on customers not every customer is alike everyone has special needs and thats what is exciting about retail
good,Family Dollar is a great company for people looking for a part time job.
good,I love the work I do. This company could be better at training and retaining. There is no encouragement from management and the crew is not properly trained.
good,the job isn’t hard at all after you get a hang of everything that’s asked of you. Wish the pay was more but it seems fair pay for the work we do around here.
good,It was a rewarding career at first. New management came in and starting making ridiculoius changes. By the time it was all said and done five of us lost our jobs.
good,The store is in a good location set up for growth and prosperity. I've had some managers during the time I have worked there who have taught me a lot and have really brought together their crew giving us all a sense of inclusion and empowering us to learn new jobs and give better customer service.
good,"It was long hours but really enjoyed the customer interaction and appreciation.managment was ok, not really supportive at the store level but corporate level they really care about their employees"
good,There were a lot of concerns but I loved the manager I worked under. Security was not enforced and it was strictly women working. Very dangerous. My hours begin to get cut. I had to change jobs because of that.
good,"The job itself is a good job however having lots of turnovers and terminations it makes it hard for the staff to operate under normal conditions...."
good,"Not a terrible place to work due to the coverage of benefits for single assocites. No room for advancement and poor management. Would be a better company to work for with better management i think, the mentality is if you cant do it we will find someone that will. Its a dog eat dog shop"
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the regular costumers who came in. I didn't see it going into further advancement as far as a management postion was concerened.
good,good job for people needing extra income or looking for jobs in between time. could become more than a cashier but it takes time and a lot of work. all around decent job for all ages
good,"I work four days a week, frequently past my shift time. I had hoped this would give me more time with my family at home, but recently they've started mandatory extra work days."
good,Haven’t had a very good time. Do a lot of work for very little recognition. Have been dedicated since the day I started and every week the hours available to me are getting smaller and smaller.
good,You are now married to Family Dollar. There is no life at all except for thus company. Trucks are always late. It's impossible to make a schedule because of this.
good,"Family dollar is and okay"
good,The was adding time to her check and cutting people check n hours...But overall I loved the job but it was the store manager....and she didn't want to hire other people at the s tresvant location menphis tn
good,"Good place to work, fast pace and nice area. Store manager is not reliable and doesn't care about the employees. Assistant managers were excellent in training and with customer relations."
good,Typical day was trying to stock shelves and being the only cashier.  Being stressed about not getting enough on the shelves.  Sweeping the store after closing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and the customers.
good,It was a productive work environment. I learned a lot of new things about how to deal with customers and finding ways to get work done in a timely manner.
good,The pay is decent but the security is nonexistent.   I have been robbed several times at gunpoint and get threatened many times a week.  Not a safe place at all.
good,When I first started at family dollar I loved it. It was very easy as far as dealing with customers. You have to have good customer service skills and good memory.
good,"Very fast paced worker, love learning new things, easy to train , unload trucks,weekly payroll,weekly scheduling,stocking daily, working 50+hrs a week six days a week,"
good,It was difficult when you didn’t get paid for the overtime you worked and working part time but full time hours with no benefits wasn’t the best either
good,"Upper Management is stuck in their ways and if you don't do what they want they will 'Train you OUT'. in other words if they don't like you, they will pick on you until you either quit, or get let go. "
good,"FD was ok. It depends on what store/location you work at. I was being groomed to be Store Mgr. I had a great manager, but DM and RM ran stuff. A lot was out of her control. Lots of theft at store. Didn't like we can be reprimanded if too much shoplifting happens on your shift."
good,Our location is quite challenging. Our customer base includes customers from several communities including the southside and hill districts. Workplace culture is basic retail and requires you to be on top of your game with the employees as well as customers. retail theft is high and you must monitor constantly.
good,the manager was rude not only to staff but to the customers. Always saying if you don't like my attitude get out of my store.i was hired as a assistant manager and was put as a cashier.  Never given the opportunity to learn the manager position.  After 6 months I quit.
good,good hours no hardworking multi tasker fast paced must have good customer service  work around other jobs or school light stocking  and cleaning could be better company
good,"The company isn't a terrible place to work for. You don't receive any kind of benefits unless you are full-time and they rarely hire full-time. I had more trouble with my specific location than the company itself. Store 9352 in Daytona Beach, Florida. Constantly robbed, terrible management, always dealing with drug addicts and the homeless. Police are at the store almost everyday."
good,I started off as the full time assistant manager. Then about 2 months into me working there the store manager put in his two week notice and quit in the middle of the two weeks and I was left with no help. But I already knew what his daily duties were. I usually did half of them. So I took over his and my job and they would promote me or send another manger to help out from another store for almost two weeks So I quit because they pretty much told me they wouldn’t.
good,"If management had more of a work/life balance along with hours allowed  from corporate, proper employment training would be exemplary! Then as managers designate assignments to various employees, those projects would be achieved without waiver. Expectations would be completely fulfilled with very little to no errors. Thorough training has everything to do with excellent performance! Additionally,  throughout .employment training should continue periodically .training throughout employment"
good,It was a time demanding job u really didn't have a life out side of work always calling u to come in and cover when they were short staffed and if u didnt they would cut your hours
good,"Manager didn't follow company policies played favorites with customers and employees. Went home before insuring store was set for the next shift, i.e. no bags, not enough change for the weekend, not enough coverage,etc."
good,"If you're an ASM, you'll be opening the store by yourself, and you will most likely be alone in the store for about 4-5 hours, until your second-shifter is scheduled in. If they call in, get ready to work 14+ hours."
good,"If you work here whatever you do don't sign up for the insurance. It cost an arm and a leg and it isn't very good. You have potential to grow with the company but, once you become a store manager you basically live at your store."
good,No growth and no work life balance I enjoy working in retail and in the field leading teams of people whether ad a store manager or team lead but the company began to go in a direction that I felt there was not a future in
good,"Loved working with people and fast pace was really nice. Honestly kind of a stressful job, but if you work there for awhile it’s rewarding. I enjoyed working with the manager and most of the staff."
good,"It was good at first, but company would over work store manager, Wages for other employees was nominal. Shipping and receiving was a joke? They just kept shipping unneeded items or the same unsold items and expected you too keep backroom low on stock, constantly. More stress than than can be handled, alone?"
good,"The hardest part working for family Dollar. We were always short staffed and people were coming in the store, taking products and running out the store. They have no control"
good,"I started as a cashier worked my way up to assistant manager, manager, and store manager.i helped close down stores, worked at other stores when needed. I had my own store.  I worked with a great team, my district manager on the other hand was not very nice made work life very stressful. Had no compassion for our families."
good,At this particular location the higher management (store and district manager) were very unprofessional in how they conducted business with its employees as well as customers.
good,I wasn’t getting paid enough and there was bad work conditions. I’m seeking better jobs and better pay to help me financially. This job didn’t offer enough.
good,"It was a job I needed at the time, I learned a lot about retail and working with the public. The co workers are very helpful. Enjoyed the day's I did work."
good,"After 3 years you’d think they would at-least raise my pay, but no it doesn’t work like that. Not to mention how I’ve been there through 2 store managers, 4 cashiers and 3 ASMs’, but I’m still here."
good,Usually not enough people working the store. You have to watch customers to try to prevent stealing. Recover and front face store. Put up stock. Clean up spills.
good,I loved the work and the fast pace but I hated the unorganized process of workers and the store when we had a good system just unreliable workers and management
good,this job would be great for someone who has just graduated and is looking for their first job. there is no benefits unless you are full time. there is no paid vacation or time off.
good,Peekskill NY Main Street is the location I worked at it was stressful due to store manager expecting you to finish your work when you are the only one at work ridiculous and she gets to leave the store when she wants and yells at you when you call out more employees need to be hire
good,Corporate expects managers to work unreasonable hours. Dollar Tree has tried to run this retail like a Dollar Tree. Doesn't work and they evidently don't care. I loved what I did but upper management was awful. They don't listen to store managers. Sad that this company has went downhill. They should have sold to Dollar General.
good,Hiring security would make life a lot easier. Would prebent a lot of the theft and run outs. People would feel more safe when working there. Its gotta be something that can be done.
good,"Unless you have a good district manager and store manager, you are pretty much doomed to ""fail"" in some way. "
good,"It's pretty much as you'd expect. Dealing with quite a lot of other managers personal issues can be tiring. Having to cover for them, etc. Since the merger with Dollar Tree. More tasks, and policies are being included in the every day schedule. Dollar Tree isn't very good at communicating with it's employees. Which can lead to corporate issuing new projects at the last minute. Making the work load sometimes unbearable. Iv'e worked multiple 60+ hour weeks back to back."
good,"The pay wasn’t the best but the coworkers and manager were great, the store sucked it was always stinking next to the coolers and the store was always hot due to the ac being out during the summer."
good,"The manger at the time wasn’t that great, but the other workers were friendly. Scheduling was also very inconsistent. Also if you did something the manager didn’t agree with you would get your hours cut"
good,Family Dollar was a great place of work for until December 2018 . I say this because you do all you can as a Store manager to hire the right people in your store. And when you have untrustworthy people come in doing all kinds of things behind your back  like stealing and it leads to you loosing your job because they're looking at you like how you couldn't know that these people are stealing in your store but I'm working 7 days a week more than 52hours a week (which 52 was required a week) I was working more like 70-80hours a week for more than three months straight trying to make sure my store was stocked and cleaned my body was extremely tired an drained I never have been so hurt in my life because I worked so hard to earn my position and for a new DM to come in and take away from me like that hurted me it's been 6 months since I've been gone from the company and I'm still trying to figure out whats next because Family Dollar was all I knew.
good,Wasn’t a place I thought it was going to be the environment was deflated for some reason things were never on time. A lot of the time managers all over the place
good,"The place has some poor management, but some of the people are fine. I would say that my overall experience there was not the greatest. If you can try to find work somewhere else but if the opportunity is there then take it"
good,Work load daily completion.  Family time / Day off only if daily and weekly tasks were completed.  If not you worked 7 days a week starting at 6 am until.  Management is salary.  No overtime.
good,As with any big company it depends on where you are and how confident upper mgt is in their ability.   I would suggest this as a good starting job for anyone but think long and hard when and if the advancement opportunity comes.  Salary mgt is taken advantage of and hourly mgt is often the escape goat.
good,High school graduate type of job eay to get in no drug test but pays every 2 weeks.                                                              Its decent for second job
good,I didn’t like the fact that the company wasn’t understanding of people with kids scheduling them at horrible times especially single mothers unfair to us
good,This job allowed me to work and attend school and for that I am grateful. I learned a lot about people and working at a fast pace enviroment from Family Dollar.
good,They offered incentive pay for forklift drivers.  We couldn't leave until work was complete and with the incentive pay we normally completed it earlly.
good,I loved my job as assistant manager but key is your team you work with and teamwork but you do everything pay not great at first but if you advance fast then u bump up in pay is good
good,"The job was okay. The amount of work that you had to do, did not equal out to the pay. You was underpaid. The customers was okay, if you didn't count the shoplifting."
good,"Job promotes within but its by word of mouth. There's no security for the customers or employees. Very dangerous atmosphere at time, Store was robbed on several occasions, which made it dangerous."
good,"Small retail stores that gets filled almost everyday attracting almost all types of people, best and worst."
good,"Managers highly overworked. Salary not great pay when working 60, 70 hours a week.  Dm's don't mind interrupting SM vacation when someone calls in.    Company needs serious restructuring in customer service dept.  Seriously, how much service can be given when most of the day one person is all company allots to be scheduled, and store full of customers.  It's comical."
good,"Responsible for opening and closing of store.  Ordering, stocking shelves, bank deposits.  Cashier.  I left this job for lack of poor management.  I addressed the regional manager of the activities at this particular store location.  It was all overlooked, there after, the Manager cut my hours to 10 hours a week.  I then started looking for employment closer to home.  So as for the hardest part was leaving a job I loved because of poor management. But the most enjoyable part was learning the ins and outs of this job for a possible chance of advancement."
good,"Family Dollar is passable for one willing to take any income. But, as for me i seek a career not a job. A place i could deidcate atleast a decade to. Unfortunately Family Dollar is no such place. Though these criticisms are not directed at the store managers, who in my experience, makes the job worth holding on to."
good,This company has little pay for the work application of the employees. Hours are cut constantly making it hard to find help. Staff was great to work with.
good,Its a ok job. It's every day 8am-530am but its a physical job. But it's a satisfying job. You basically just have to look at the palates determine if they are good or bad and white blue or red and stack the palates one by one. You got to stack them so you don't crowd yourself. Keep all the trash and wood away from feet. It's just repetitive.
good,It was great just need a current schedule preference but couldn't get it but over all it was a fast paste job and I liked it and great customers and team to work with
good,workplace was way under staffed which caused production problems..then I was expected to fill in the gap and work extra hours with out getting paid for them or registering them
good,I enjoyed the customer and meeting new people but I had a really bad manager who who say nasty thing to me but the customers was the best they loved me
good,I am barely getting any hours and getting treated like a kid I feel like I have no control over my progression I never even got any real training pretty much everything I know was learned on the go
good,The job was a learning experience for me. I love the customers that shop at my store. I feel the company does not take care of their employees especially with the chance for promotion or raises. A good starting job but no long term career.
good,Pretty easy job around the holidays is when you'll get the most hours otherwise getting hours is hard and people were fired pretty easily very little job security.
good,"no consideration to the actual actions at store level. hr and field level sustain employment through friendship, not accomplishments. the leadership and results are secondary to the personal relationships with the upper levels"
good,Just wasn’t enough pay to keep a family up and going like it should be the people are good the work is easy just not my type of pay I need and not consistent
good,"A typical work day was making production. I learned how to right a center rider. the most enjoyable part was getting off work. understanding managers. Hardest of job was learning the order sheet, and enjoyable was meeting new people"
good,"Not a place for personal growth of self-starters.  Leadership tends to be over-involved.  As a result of the lack of trust and empowerment of employees, timeliness and details of projects suffer, often with double work and managers unaware of individual taskings of individual contributors."
good,"typical day at work: always busy"
good,Family dollar is a fast paced place . Always have to be on your feet because there's only certain amount of workers and the freight has to be stocked as fast as possible.
good,"Family Dollar is a Descent job if you have another job or if you looking for extra money to put in your pocket. I wouldn't say it is a career job. It helped me make ends meet. It is alot of work for the amount of pay. Overall it's okay, it make ends meet."
good,easy going not to busy friendly costumers wok days are like being in a meeting but everybody moving along daily in their own atmosphere to say the l;east
good,"This company is all about the bottom line, like most retail. They give managers very little hours to give employees and a low rate of pay. Managers are over worked and poorly paid."
good,"I enjoyed helping the people in the community also I  work for the company for just under a year.I have many years of retail experience and was relied on heavily to work the weekend/evening hours that other employees did not want to work. Though the manager was kind and understanding for the most part, I saw much nepotism in who received management roles. One assistant manager was even the first cousin to the store manager, granted by marriage but still related. I was promised and asked if I wanted the assistant manager's position on more than one occasion and then passed over for it. When I complained about it, others were hired to cover my hours and they were cut. Also, I was listed as a part-time employee, which meant I did not receive benefits, but for the vast majority of the time I worked 20 hours a week. "
good,You have to hand unload trucks a lot of heavy lifting and not enough wages you throw freight 7 days a week sometimes you work open to close no appreciation for your hard work
good,"It was good I like the people who work there and some of the guess who come to the store. I make sure the store is open and some time I close to,I do a little cashier check out to."
good,It's a decent and fast paced retail job with some opportunity to advance if you stick with it.Regional  management has some  issues and would be a three across the board otherwise
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar was boring, I've learned to talk to customers , management was poor, the hardest part was dealing with unprofessionalism, and the most enjoyable part was the pay."
good,"A lot of duties and responsibilities for low pay, and no available overtime. Always worked at least 6 hours per shift. However, shifts and hours varied every week."
good,It's was a dangerous place to work in very stressful on the daily basis you always had to worry Abt being robbed are customer that come in there on daily basis stealing
good,"every day we have to make sure that the store is organized, help customers with their needs, ensure that the product are placed right, count every cents to make sure that the deposit is correct. The hardest part of the job is organize the whole store before leave and deal with difficult people. The most important part of this job is having a nice team to work with and cares for you."
good,family dollar really didn't give enough work  hours for the job to be done..often there would be only one person working in the store at a given time...
good,Family Dollar has given me a terrible experience for retail. The company should invest into hiring security to lower the theft issue and robberies. The corporate office should also invest into over night stokers to eliminate the inventory being on the floor.
good,Very busy day which allows you to show great customer Sevice Skills the hardest part of the day was keeping customer check out down because the store stayed packedShort break
good,"a typical day at work for me was that i was there from open to close almost everyday."
good,"was a nice even paced work environment that contained a lot of bright pleasant customers, was not treated as an assistant manager and was more trouble than it was worth but paid a decent wage"
good,"No support or training from store manager. Hired as an assistant manager with the hope of moving up. Was sent to a disaster of a store. When ideas and attempts were tried to remedy this, I was told there was not enough hours to complete this."
good,I love this job.they couldnt keep a decent  manger who could hold the position .i was offered a few times but it was out of control to the point it took more than serveral different GM from different areas who came in and try to get it in.order
good,"Responsible for ringing up customers in a timely manner and guaranteeing high level"
good,The job was ok but there was poor management where i felt i was being treated as a child instead of an adult. the co-workers were nice to work with and an manageable job.
good,Family Dollar was an okay place to work. There were multiple issues with management. Many misunderstandings and miscommunications. At the time of employment the management was very rude.
good,"*Responsible for opening and closing the store and set the alarm on the door and ,"
good,"Typical day at work consisted of ringing out customers. "
good,It's all about who you know at this establishment. If you're not in with anybody then you're not in. If management decides to not like you one day be expecting less hours or no job.
good,"Unloading trucks , stocking floor, and making sure freight was cleared out would have to be the only hard labor everything else was a breeze! Greeting customers"
good,"For a part time job.it was ok, I have been there with very little effort,  my other job was better than that and it was more professional.  I would never work there again. I need a job that is what I need"
good,"Poor place to work. Horrible security, lazy managers, changing schedules, unorganized environment, no rewards or type of discount and no teemwork with the team."
good,"Working for Family Dollar has been a great opportunity. I have grown professionally while working at Family Dollar. I have learned how I want to advance in retail and be a District or Regional Manager for my employees. Being a respectful, smart working, dedicated, trustworthy manager is one of the keys to success. Working at Family Dollar has taught me to create the work/life balance needed to succeed."
good,I love to learn new things and I was able to learn a lot while here. I was lucky to be surrounded by many resources to learn the various aspects of my role.
good,Never got opportunity to advance. Pay was not good and never got any benefits. Had lots of drama with other employees. Was not very flexible when I came to my children
good,"Not my favorite place to have worked in my life, definitely not a future option. way too much negativity.  Managers were inconsistent and gossiping bullies."
good,Had a good time working for the company till i had a back injury working too hard while others hardly worked. I was prompted many time in my 4 years of employment with them. Just didn’t like the fact that no matter how hard you worked the store managers gets the glory when most of them we’re never at work.
good,"I was only there for about 4 months and had two break in attacks . Rude customers , just a bad location all together . Customers literally threatening employees."
good,"I applied at Family Dollar for a chance to work locally and pay my bills.  At first I thought it would be a solid experience.  Most of the workers are friendly and the clientele is generally fine.  But the management began to send me to help struggling stores in nearby towns.  In the beginning, I did not mind this.  The management agreed to help with travel expense, but when the balance of time shifted more towards outside work versus my hiring store, they decided to take that away without warning.  Moreover, they made arrangements to transfer me without any consultation.  I am currently working through these issues with the management, but am increasingly skeptical that it will work out.   Other workers have complained of similar treatment, so I would not recommend this company."
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work at if you like dealing with customers face-to-face. Family Dollar has an open door policy. Family Dollar has friendly team members and nice management as well.
good,"On a normal day, I go into work I count my register, greet customers, help them find items they are looking for, ask them about their day while checking them out, and tell them to have a nice day, then when I have free time, I go and stock and recover the shelves and clean up as I'm going and when it's time to go, I count my register off and put money in the safe"
good,"It's a good place to get started as a first job but that's about it. The benefits were none, and the hours were shifting what seemed like every day. Was expected to come in on my days off and work more the spot of 2 people plus a manager at times. The environment was unsafe and not up to where it should have been for that area."
good,People will come in an complain about everything.  I've learned to not be angry when they get angry about something.  There was no really enjoyable parts of the day.  The hardest part of the job is being patient with people because of how the react to things.  They other hard part is when you have to always be alert because there way alot of people that came in to rob us and always run out with carts filled.
good,Easy job and great work environment. Worked part-time and didn't have benefits.  Manager was great with rotating weekends and letting you have days requested off.
good,"cashier,stocker,customer service,and cleaner,worked nights and days and closed store.did not enjoy my job needed extra money .i did enjoy meeting new people"
good,it was a good job to help me through school i just needed better pay i didnt work there to long to build a 401k or anything but i just needed to move forward
good,Its an okay place to work just not my cup of tea. My manager is a long time friend but since working with him ive come to find out its not a good idea to work for or with your friends.
good,"They are decent size stores, with only one to two employees working at a time. We were require to be aware of what went on in the store regarding people stealing. But a whole store for 2 people, it was hard to keep track of who came in and out, and at the end of the day we were yelled at if someone stole something and we didn't notice it."
good,"Family dollar really doesn’t show there employees any gratitude, they don’t offer overtime only to store managers, their Human Resources has to be the worst one I’ve ever encountered no help whatsoever!"
good,Keeping the store neat.  Waiting on customers and putting up stock when a truck came in.  Sweeping and washing the floors each night.  I learned that the job was not for me.  I would really rather not give any comments about the management.  The workplace culture was varied.  The hardest part of the job was getting help when I had a line of customers and needed someone on the other register.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"Fast paced environment but little space for job growth opportunities. Team work environment, supportive environment. A huge amount of patience required to deal with hard customers. Overall my position required top effort. Very friendly work environment however, I got along with all my coworkers."
good,"I worked with an incredible crew during my time with Family Dollar. "
good,this is where I was first introduced to garnishments. my supervisor was a very good teacher. There were no room for advancement. I like that the company had a call center.
good,Family Dollar is a slow to medium-pace work environment. There are many tasks that need completed in order to make the company a nice and welcoming place for customers. Employees are good at balancing these tasks with assisting customers as well. The store is always neat and clean. Overall friendly atmosphere.
good,"They need a security gaurd. Very stressful enviorment."
good,I was threatened with being fired over missing one day of work for inclement weather just because the store manager did not want to work that day. Other than that the assistant managers were treated unfairly and expected to do just about everything under the sun and some more. They were expected to close then open the next day for two or three days in a row. I will say that the discounts were an unexpected surprise.
good,This is a good place for someone to start out or to work with limited options. If you can't be on your feet or lift do not apply.This is not a bad place to work. It is also not an easy place to work. Working here be prepared to work hard and have an upbeat attitude even when you are stressed. The customers are wonderful and expect wonderful customer service.
good,Treated unfairly. Was promised a promotion only to have it taken away. There was very little structure when one could've easily been set up. our store was also infested with rats.
good,"The hardest part of the job is work life balance.  Whenever you plan time off, something always comes up and you cannot take time off. Corporate does not support the employees in the field."
good,The customers are great  and I enjoy working with them. The team members work hard daily to achieve the goals and direction that is given to them on day to day bases. I enjoy helping get the team to the next level and helping with the success.
good,Good place to work for someone who's trying to make extra money. Management is ok and the other employees are friendly. It's a fast pace working environment and very busy.
good,"Was a great place to work. Mostly friendly employees and manager. Run the register, put away freight. Just the typical retail environment. Small town feel."
good,Working for family dollar was an experience. Wish that the pay was more for the amount of work they require you to do. Also would help if there was better management support.
good,"As an ASM working 35-40 hours a week,making only $10/hour, running the store while SM was gone just wasn't enough to keep anyone around..the turn over rate is extremely high for Family Dollar but all together the job isn't as bad as everyone thinks."
good,"Family Dollar is ok..They have been very loyal to me.  The upper management, just make it harder on the lower management. But they don't like to compensate for the hard work."
good,it wasn’t a bad job they were very nice the only thing is I had to move that’s only reason I left but I wish the pay was a little better but it wasn’t bad for the job had a good time working with the women there they were very polite and understanding when I had to resign .
good,The position is okay if you are looking for part time and no more than about 16 hours per week.  There was always inconsistency in schedule and no benefits for part time workers.  Needed more hours.  Looking for full time and job advancement.
good,"pay sucks , hours for management sucks, will kill your body, and higher management only thinks about their own pocket instead of their management.I have nothing more to say about this company dollar tree bought them and good luck to them and all the new team members that work for them."
good,I enjoy helping People & Doing Anything That I can prosper from! I jus Enjoy Working Helps Me Relieve A lot of Stress & also keeps me a piece of mind !
good,Its a fun job but a lot of stocking shelves the variety of customers was cool. My store had a high theft rateing. I worked 3 different stores sometimes 2 different stores in 1 day. No paid travel time. No discounts.
good,Best part of the job is working with a good team. If you all work hard and get the job done but also have fun it'll be a great job for you. Who knows you might advance in the company
good,I worked at the family dollar and my direct manager was great but the assistant manager was rude and nasty to everyone. Even through they had the same position as myself.
good,If I had to do it over again I wouldn't low pay non cooperative bosses and dam that never show up or answer phones in an emergency they say you are their family and u have no family once you start working for them
good,This company should take the word family out of their name. As store manager I worked up 16 hours a day six days a week for the last four months of my time there while raising a teenage daughter alone. They could care less about your family.
good,can not get enough hours to pay for bills but it ok. everyone was respectful and it was kinda like being in a family inside of family dollar with guys there.
good,"I dedicated my time to this job on call whenever needed, never missed a day or called in, helped her do her reset, just so much and I just think a company works better when everybody isn't backstabbing the next person."
good,"I enjoyed my job there and it was fast paced which I loved. Most of the people I worked with were like a second family to me.  I enjoyed the customers that came in regularly. Most of the customers I got to know exactly what they wanted. Many are very nice. The hardest part of the job would be trying to get all your tasks done before you shift ended on a busy day. As a cashier there were times I couldn't even move away to do my other tasks due to the high busy pace of customers constantly coming up to my line. I was very thankful for my store manager and district manager for awarding me with two rewards for great customer service. That is something I will always appreciate from my experience working there. The store manager can have her moments as far as mood wise, but she did work with availability quite well. If you needed to work around your schedule or needed a certain day off, she made sure you got it."
good,My experience with Family Dollar Store was over demanding for very little pay. And the most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people everyday.
good,However the stores in Waco and Robinson area are all buddy-buddy it's really who you know not what you know family members becoming managers at the same store when they don't even do their work
good,"a typical day at work was mad regular. come in to the store everyone complained daily about the store odor due to rats. the ceiling leaked the shelves always took forever to get stocked, we were short staffed and had a huge thief problem."
good,Kept store cleaned at all times. Helped costumers when needed. Handled the money at the end of the day and took it to the bank in the drop off. Short shifts. Tagged all clothing and put them away. Stocked shelves and handles the tills.
good,"Store manager can be uptight as well as very unorganized. I have found I much prefer working with the assistant manavers, because they don't yell at me whenever I do something wrong instead they explane to me how to do it correctly."
good,"Often management is left alone in the store and still expected to complete schematics while receiving vendors, stocking, dealing with customers and running register. No breaks and corporate wants you to sit in your car for a cigarette break...not possible"
good,Arrive at 7 am and count drawers for cashiers. Open at 8 am Check inventory and set up store displays. Sign for deliveries check in store vendors. Train employees.  Long hours during holidays. I
good,the job was very unorganized and i didn't like my experienced at the job but I loved the customers and some of the co workers that i had but the manager was not a very good one
good,Not a maintained store when I got there.  Had to totally redo everything.  Merchandise in the back stockroom was 2 years behind and all on clearance but never put out when it was full price.
good,Family Dollar does not take care of their staff. Location is always endanger. Some employers would jump into the job with no work experience and make more than you. Its only a good first job since the only people allowed to go full-time is the Managers.
good,"I was an Assistance Manager. I would open in the morning and be the only one there for a 12 hr. shift. left to do everything by myself. I lived 1.6 miles from this store, I was in an accident on my way to work, I  called to let the manager know and all she said was ""you are still coming in?"""
good,"Hard work is not rewarded but taken advantage of; advancement is rewarded to favored people and not hard working ones, as is hour distribution to employee's. Management is deceitful and will motivate by lying or threat of write-ups, usually both. Nothing more than a temporary job while you look for other things."
good,"I loved my manager at Family Dollar she was amazing. However The ""higher ups"" were terrible. Making poor decisions that effect us on the floor when they have never worked an hour on the floor themselves."
good,Family dollar provides flexible hours for part time workers.  Great customer service is key and making sure the store is recovered and stocked properly
good,enjoyed working there it was a very busy store stayed busy all the time running cash register an putting up stock.some days i would open the store an some days i would close the store the days i opened the store i would also have to go to the bank to make deposits
good,"An average day consisted of ringing up customers, putting up stock, recovering/cleaning up, confronting thieves. Doesn't seem like a lot listed but if you can't seriously multitask, you can get behind so fast. The pay isn't enough for everything that is required. No overtime, $.15 raise a year. People run out stealing all day, it's hard catching them when there's only 2 people working a shift."
good,This employer did not pay as scheduled. Took over 1 month to receive 1st paycheck due to management error. Corporate could not fix problem right away which caused me to be late with rent..
good,"Most days wernt that bad, but again the amount of hours that were recieved per week were rather low and with the additional staff being brought on that wasnt likely to be changed any time soon. The lake of pay advancement was also a rather large issue, a person would had been working there for 3 years would be making only .25 cents more than a new hire."
good,"Labor restrictions caused store managers to work long hours to keep store conditions presentable,working usually required six days a week, with open to closing required"
good,"The management at my store was not very appreciative of the all the work and time I put into the store. On all of my off days, I would be called in to help but when I would come in, I'd be the one working alone. You're schedule is all over the place and you aren't guaranteed days off if you are in the ASM position. It may have just been my experience, but this is not a job for people who have very busy schedules dealing with children."
good,Manager worked with my schedule. Loved getting paid weekly. Love helping my customers with their needs. Just hated having no breaks. It constantly was busy so my day went by fast.
good,I always ended up working 70+ hours a week and recieved no overtimepay. There was little payroll for staff. No oppertunity to take personal or vacation time.
good,don't look to make a living or pay many bills with this job. good for students or first time workers. hours are hit or miss but when offered its best to grab them.
good,"after working almost a year (with no breaks, ever) toward raises (after inventory), we were told in the middle of inventory that wasn't happening. And they didn't know when raises would happen. "
good,"A lot has changed since the merger. Positions, processes and responsibilities are constantly changing. The work environment is not the same, it's all heads down."
good,its pretty good company when you work with the right management and you are able to move up but otherwise its really not that satisfying. i like this job thou because you get paid every week
good,"A typical day at work starts off with me clocking in proceeding to count my register and I begin to start cashing out the customers. I'll ask them ""Did you find everything you were looking for?"" If they didn't I'll help them find the product they were looking for and inform them on any items on sale. In my free time, I'll work on overstock, McLane candy, repacks, and recover my zones. Right before I leave I count my register down, give my deposit to the manager, clean my station, return all my go-backs to their home and clock-out. The workplace is sometimes peaceful, relaxed, and quick-pace with order or without order. Some customers are trying to steal, kids misbehaving, or even customers trying to cheat the cashier. The hardest part of my job is between not being able to get as much product out as I would want as cashier since its so busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to enjoy the workplace with co-workers while we work and the customers. Just seeing a smile on their face warms my heart."
good,The job hours varied from week to week. I was paid $9 and I was the Assistant Store Manager which I found to be more than ridiculous. I mainly ran the register while the store manager put away freight and put up new displays. Usually its only management working and maybe 2 cashiers may work on busy days.
good,"There was much to be expected of you while working with this company. Theft was huge and the use of thousands of dollars per day while having no safe way to transport the money to a bank, was very stressful."
good,"As a manager it is mandatory to work 52+ hours a week, staff budgets are too low. If anyone calls off it is your responsibility to cover the hours. Things may have changed since I worked there."
good,"This job offers no work life balance,,,, perfect for people who are self-driven and who don't mind living at work,,,, the company will not get your back if things go south,,,, extreme amounts of advancement opportunity because of the lack of retention,,,, if you can suck it up as an individual, swallow your pride and work extreme amounts of hours with no extra compensation this company might be a good fit for you....."
good,"At the time I was getting payed minimum wage, I had to be cashier and also clean the store organize and stock . And one thing was out of place we would get yelled by the assistant manager who never does her job. Only one register only 10 min for break . One time I was called a thief and the girl who came the next day was off count and never apologized for their actions"
good,"the store i worked in was not good it also got closed down ,other stores i went in was not so bad .my rates was based on my store not family dollar company in all.the hardest part at work was dealing with the scams and also people stealing and theirs nothing you can do about it because there was no security."
good,A typical day at Family Dollar is like a roller coast. I can have busy moments with customers too slow dead moments for awhile. I learned on how to open and close the store and how to handle payment transactions. The management I had was fair but do not care about the store shirk problems. The work culture is fair on handling their customers questions. The hardest part was the dangers that the job had. A lot of robberies and employers stealing money. The most enjoyable part was closing time when you had to straighten up the store and meeting different customers.
good,Family dollar is a okay place to work just didn't like when I had to work one day out of the week for four hours for no eight dollars every week plus the manager wasn't on her job like she was supposed to me so I gave my two weeks notice cause I love to work and if the job isn't consistent I loose interest in a job I like to work something that's going g to keep me busy until my shift is over with and I can go home and family dollar was not the place for me and they lacked in organization
good,Management was very classless. DM over store manager wouldn't do anything about manager complaints. Store manager acted as if it were here business. Treated customers very poorly.
good,"Overall i loved working in Family Dollar. After being sent to the hospital from being over worked, while pregnant, I was treated worse when i returned to a different manager. Not only was she rude she told me to my face that it is all business nothing personal. I would rather work for someone who cares for their employees more than their products because it is the employees who are keeping the store together. specially my position as a field specialist/assistant manager. She even found a problem with me buying a water and taking my inhaler. Nobody deserves to be treated like a slave NOBODY!"
good,Overall it is a great Part time position for a college student or someone who doesn't have any real bills. I could never see myself retiring at Family dollar or working long term. It is a bust your butt kind of job and not too much worth the pay!
good,Been a difficult transition from a family oriented customer focused culture to a disjointed tactical culture. Dollar Tree has a lot teach but doesn't realize they have a lot to learn.
good,Working at family dollar was a good experience because I've learned how to manage money and the value of merchandise. I've also learned that you have to be respectful and have patience and tolerance.
good,I did shelving setup and stocking the shelves. I liked the fact I gained experience with the shelving installing. I have stocked shelves before with a planagram. I did like to stock the shelves. The hours kept changing based on their needs and they chose the people they wanted to work and offered them more hours. in the long run. many wanted to be hired on at the new store. but it was a secret as to how many they needed. but it was far less than enough to employ all who wanted to continue. me included.
good,some weeks i may work 30 hours then the next week i may only have 10 hours. on mondays we had to unload product from truck to stock shelves. i loved my co workers. if i  had more hours to pay my bills i would not be looking for another job.
good,I would consider family dollar as a starter job not a career. The hours are very limited. Some weeks you may not have schedule hours. It's a gamble no matter how hard you work.
good,Provided customer service handled cash for registers and guardian armour services. Open and close the store. Delgated tasks for team members. Made store orders and received them.
good,"Job was stressful at times. Employees sometimes wasn't a breeze to work with. Job enviroment could have been better. Job was fast paced, sometimes slow paced."
good,Job was fun. Getting to know your customers was a blast. The work is easy. Benefits are ridiculously priced. Those who do less achieve more. Have to beg for hours.
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"Family Dollar does not provide proper payment for the Job title you may hold here, especially Assistant Manager.  The pay is very low and the work expected is very high.  A employee would not want to do the work for the pay, unless they are retired or live with someone such as a roommate of some sort."
good,My biggest con is the security and care for the empolyee... I have been robbed 3 times in my whole life ANd they all happen within the 7 months of working here. I was fired for being robbed for 350 dollars and was told it was a liability for the company to lose so much money.
good,I enjoy working there because u get to meet new people everyday by help them with your service. The team i was working with had good leadership. I enjoyed my job.
good,Days are a must. They never allow you any holidays off. Assistants basically run the store. There is no job.security or anyone to turn to for help not even HE.
good,the main boss wasnt very friendly and if they where in a bad mood the entire staff felt it. they didnt give breaks when working 15 hour shifts and to much out of work drama going on
good,Sometimes you just have to blow things off;  like if you have a rude costumer that gets to you. You always stay busy and there's always so much to do.
good,"This job is great if you're a student and need a little money or if you're looking for something part time, but as a career I don't think it would make a good choice."
good,I loved my job and learned alot of things which moved me up! I am thankful for what i learned and my experience with the company. Being honest i had a rude manager who actually stayed gone elsewhere than in our store and i done her work and only made 9.00 an hour!
good,"My experience at Family Dollar was rather short lived, however while working there I found the  environment to be demanding, and chaotic. We had a small staff who worked hard to complete our daily goals, we worked together, and helped each other out when needed. Management fostered a strict environment, they allowed workers to experience the full range of opportunities the company offered. The hardest part of the job was having only one cashier, and the most enjoyable part of the job was working together as a team."
good,"I loved being able to greet and serve customers, open and closing shift! It was a Joy to learn new things including  Stocking and  Cashing out customers!"
good,many repeat customers to build a relationship with. knowing what they are looking for and ensuring the products are available. having customers ask how your day is and caring about you.
good,"A typical day at work would be making schedules, counting money, little time on paperwork, Stocking making sure everything is ready for the customers, and making sure everyone scheduled has shown up. Day goes by fast but if you are better than any other manager they will fire you and lie on you."
good,"Not a bad place to work, but nothing particularly special about it: urban retail situation with reasonable compensation for job requiring no commitment beyond the time scheduled to work."
good,I worked 5 yrs doing everything asked of me.. I went above and beyond my job duties but I only received 1 raise in 5 yrs.. It was $.75.. Yet I did everything for my store cuz I take pride in my work..
good,Decent place to work. Definitely have to be a hard worker and dedicated worker when it comes to doing truck and stock. They don't pay as good as some places but not a bad place to work.
good,"If you are looking for a good job straight out of high school it is the place to be, but not for long term. The environment switching depending on the store you are in. Unlike other higher end stores where the environment usually stays the same throughout all locations."
good,A regular day at work would be coming in and punching in. Sometimes I had daily task and others I had to find what to do. Ring up customers at the registers.
good,"i go in clock in and dont stop in to i leave but thats what i like about it it makes my day go by fast,its alway something to do,friendly customers in you will learn something different everyday ,why? I dislike working there because I run into some rude people I don't no when or something may happen"
good,Good days and bad day. Flexible schedule when there is actually enough staff. Hire as much as they fire. Operations. Needs to be analyzed and restructured
good,"It was an alright company to work for. My co workers were fun and my managers were decent. But the lack of decent training left me kind of high and dry during work hours, plus the insane amount of work as well as the drama and high school girl gossip for a work place wasn't worth the minimum wage on part time hours."
good,its not that bad but it can be better I guess just don't pay a lot and you don't get that many hours I been working there since February and I still have not got a regular schedule
good,"a typical day is stressful and management do not really care about your welfare but are only interested in the results and sales, but the people are fun loving"
good,"It is a good company to work for. A lot of people come thru everyday, I learned to read people and know how they were going to treat me, the manager was wonderful, ,the hard part of me job was stopping the people from stealing things. I enjoyed the people I meet everyday and the crew I worked with."
good,The management was bad the leads were not team players benfits suck it was just a part-time job for me would not want to make it a career they expect you to put in way to many hours for them.
good,"During my time at Family Dollar it was an experience for me to turn an empty store into to a Family Dollars. The managers were great, the coworkers worked as a team."
good,"I was an ASM at Family Dollar, with a job at Family Dollar expect to be underpaid and over worked. The stores are all understaffed and the managers are all overworked. Doing the job of four people for the wages of one, with little room for advancement."
good,No work/life balance or regard for it. The revolving door of upper management reflects down into the stores where high turnover creates unsafe and high stress work environment.
good,Its a good job very fast paced customers constantly come in and out .Truck day and the day after truck aare my two  favorite ...I like to stock rather then operate the register.
good,A typical day consist of meeting up with the team and travel to an assigned location and perform store resets. We would start by diving into to group of twos and start in different areas of the store. We would then gather out paperwork and read our schematic diagram and gather our material to complete the task at hand. Remove products from shelves and replace new products according to diagram.
good,the manager and customers are hard to get along with most of the time. The schedules are always messed up and with have been through three managers since I have employed with the company.
good,Working here gave me the opportunity to build the store from inside out and after that got a job as a cashier. I got so good at it they sent me to build another store.
good,"You barely get hours, I was getting good hours then they did a drastic cut. I was promised a promotion 2 months ago but have yet to get it. NO EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT AT ALL. Crooked higher ups."
good,"typical day - filling out and filing of paper work , tasking , setting up , cleaning , helping other's , working together , greeting people. what I learned how to enter in data how to file and how to work together. management - very helpful willing to teach and train. workplace culture very up beat and friendly. hardest part of the job - not enough help . store was not in the best of neighborhood. the most enjoyable part of the job was great customer service , was like working with family."
good,"a typical day at work is getting to meet different customers everyday."
good,"Working at Family Dollar was not one of the best jobs. Management were more focused on catching people stealing and not being kind to those who come in on a regular not stealing. I understand when it comes to retail you have a store to run and take care of but bad hospitality leads to horrible reviews so not only are customers upset about somethings being gone due to shop lifting, their also upset because they did not get the right service they know they should have.The only thing i liked about working at Family Dollar was the hours i was getting because we were so short help everyday i would work almost 50 hrs a week."
good,I try to stay busy but everyone doesn't have that same mine set when we trip with the customers Is the best part iit can be diffult to deal with some customers I always help someone if needed
good,"horrible environment, the location always got robbed/crimes. assistant manager was rude, but the general manager was wonderful and understanding. i received good hours, but was miserable working."
good,"I enjoy working for my money, I don't believe there's an easy way out, and that with effort and positivity hard work pays off. Your manager should be an excellent example of how the behavior and motion of the job should go. I enjoy when my dedication and hard work gets recognized and awarded with appreciation or promotion."
good,"Verified credit acceptance by reviewing and recording driver's license number; operating credit card authorization system,"
good,"Not much to say, retail was never really an area I enjoyed at all. The management was horrible, the hours were too sporadic, and there was too much demand for hours that weren't scheduled."
good,"A great place to work at. There, I held almost my first job. Well, they have a very interesting way to treat people. However, I've seen people literally walked out."
good,"very busy days at work "
good,It's an okay job. The pay is low. And corporate always changes things. I had two amazing bosses. I was fed the idea that I was going to get promoted and I never did and I wasted my time on that. I made a life long friendship with the other cashier. There is a lot of dramatic people that come in and like to talk so your pretty much a part time therapist. It was an alright first time job. But it's not for people with anxiety.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of stocking, cleaning, customer service, open and closing, theft prevention. Learned to work cash register and deal with customers. Management was decent. Hardest part of job was lack of manager communication. Benefit of working here was getting every week."
good,"It's a very fun work place, easy move up on positions... I'd prefer high school students mostly for this type of work... flexible work days, hours if you may need them... New company so they are still working out the kinks. Future bonuses I'm told. So that's a plus."
good,"Workdays are very busy, learned more about prioritization and time management. Senior management's expectations were sometimes unrealistic."
good,"My typical day at work included, clocking in to get my day started. count my draw to start my shift. Greet customers as they enter into the store, as I see what is on the tasks list for the day. I learned who to use a cash register, read product labels, how to read schematics, and set planet grounds. I showed great leadership and team work with my coworkers. The hardest part of my job was the truck unload, while the easiest part was showing good customer service."
good,"Easy place to work , they have good opportunitis , and some good management. Good hours for students and if you have a second job. Overall good experience."
good,Many of the employees have worked there for decades.  It has undergone a lot of changes since 2011. You are required to help out at a store during the holidays and keep up on your work.
good,"You get a raise every six months. I was employee of the month and was recognized to receive a gift card from the manager. My hours are part time but I'm a Grandma, I need rest time and moments with family. But when Im at work, anyone will tell you how important it is to me to make sure no expired food is on the shelves, and things look orderly and neat. Our manager works harder than us! Money is low but for some reason i am happy and like my job and our customers!"
good,Was the dirtiest store I've ever been in the manager was just an acting manager she was an assistant manager that I stepped into a position that she was not qualified for they were just kind of going with the motions
good,"small store easy to take care of,small staff. Hardest part of job was unloading the truck, the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"I think, Family Dollar is a great place to shop with many interesting people to meet, all from different walks of life. I've learned and have had to deal with different groups of people and the many different personalities and capabilities. My manager and Co-workers were a very driven hard and working, team."
good,Overall it was an OK place to work just wasn't treated fairly. I didn't mind all the work it just felt like I was doing everything there for me to just be an assistant manager.
good,"Nothing much to say. It wasn't much pay the customers where nice most of the time, people steal a lot from the store, you won't get much hours & you don't get any discounts for being an employee"
good,"My day typically consisted of cashiering, Assist customers in locating their needs and desired purchases to include food, clothing, toiletries, first aid, housewares, and all daily needs to include seasonal items. "
good,"The starting pay is not competitive and the hours are not maintained as promised. There are several tasks you are asked to complete and the job is vigorous, however you are not compensated for the amount of work you must do."
good,Miss working with company enjoyed my time here but after so long with company management was rude disrespectful to employees and customers I was mentally abused by management and corporate office did nothing they rather take there manager side than to listen to the complaints from workers and customers if corporate office gave me opportunity to meet with them and explain certain situations that occurred and to at least here my side and understand why I left
good,I generally loved the customers. my co-workers were often fired because of the work loads. The environment became unsafe when it reached night fall. The turnover rate was very high due to lack of raises.
good,My experience with The Family Dollar was a good one.  I enjoyed helping the customers on a daily basis and I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,"temporary position so I cant really review company, just set up new store and was done.Crew leaders were very nice and helpful.Very diversified group, most were very friendly."
good,It was a nice place to work because of the customers. Most days went by fast because there was always something to do. The hardest part of the job was stocking shelves
good,after we merged with dollar tree in January i have been wrote up 4 times for payroll they never gave me enough payroll and this is the first time i have ever been wrote up in 10 years
good,There was a lot of chaos and the manager of the store walked out and never returned witch left every ones hours list an the madness
good,Family Dollar cares very little about their employees safety. Their main concern is money. The company puts their employees at risk. One good thing about the company is they get a weekly pay check. The store are always short of staff and messy. Nasty and not a good place to work always in fear .
good,"Not much to grow or hardly any opportunities. No full time hours or benefits. Easy to learn and easy company to work for, but not a long term career choice."
good,I liked working for family dollar the manager was very nice and so were the team members i worked with . The managers training process was not good at all .I feel like your just thrown out onto the floor without a explanation of the rules and violations of certain actions. The communication isnt the best.But usually i work the floor so i make sure everything is organized the cash register area make sure the isles are clean organized all the price tags are in the correct areas help with customer service issues
good,Needs of the store were not met because of low pay and not enough hours. Which meant people were over worked and under paid. Not a job for a person who has family to take care of.
good,"Overall it was a good store, however the store would get robbed a lot due to the area.  Outside of that I did enjoy assisting with customers and providing outstanding customer service"
good,"I love serving the community with my customer service skills and abilities.  I have learned how to multitask and do several jobs at once, without hesitation."
good,"Learned how to manage business to maximize sales and employee job performance. Coworkers worked hard to learn there jobs nd do them to the best of there ability."
good,"work life balance not good as a manager"
good,"I enjoy working in my store and meeting many customers that have remained loyal to shopping with us. Hardest part of the job is knowing you can't relate issues to the District Manager. The most enjoyable part of my job I would say is, meeting people/customers and having a great time with them during their shopping experience and having them come back."
good,"Assist customers with daily transactions while stocking, cleaning, and acting as security guards. Management not the greatest but co-workers very helpful and a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was keeping the lines down with no help. The most enjoyable part of the job was there was always something to do to pass the time."
good,Worked part time in evening but had dificulty getting a ride home at end of shift. I physically had a hard time standing on my feet for 4-5 hours a night.
good,"This is a job for teenagers. They only start hiring at 18. Easy to get. Apply if you really need a job. They are always hiring. No one stays long enough, so you will get hired."
good,"I took the position with a very positive mindset.  Was excited about the opportunities the District Manager wanted to present to me.  Right from the start, they changed District Managers in my location, they did not honor the rate of pay we agreed upon.  They said their company was growing and doing very well.  I was with them over a year and all the sudden, employees that have been with the company over 20 years, was loosing their jobs and they said they was merging with the company Dollar Tree.  Come to find out Dollar Tree was buying out Family Dollar stores, shutting down over 200 already.  Loved my co workers and loved my clientele.  The hardest part of the job, was the labor cutbacks, so us managers often would have to work double shifts and be the only one at the store which made it impossible to catch a bathroom break.  Although it was disappointing from the start how the company was ran, I loved waking up every morning to go open the store for our customers and regulars. They are why I do what I do."
good,"A typical day at work would be taking care of customers. Stocking shelves. Unloading merchandise putting up merchandise on shelves."
good,"It was great working at this location, I learned a lot from customers to my co-workers. usually it was always busy, but was able to handle it at all times. Management was okay, some didn't know what to do. The hardest part was to do a lot of task and not get help from others when it was work for two or more people. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of the customers."
good,opening or closing the store greeting customers learned all aspects of running a retail store the hardest part of the job was dealing with an over barring dm abusive demanding incorrigible I enjoyed the team and the customers
good,I lived in texarkana so I was driving atleast 3 hrs a day round trip then I was working a 12hr shift I never had a day off. Before the changes in management it was great but the new district manager had a very different view as to how things should be done and was micro managing which in turn left no time to complete other things that need to be done she left very little time for customer service and made it difficult to run a business.
good,"The company is starting to change its mission since being bought out by dollar tree. Family Dollar is no longer a compelling place to work. I applied for an internal position. I interviewed and was awarded the position verbally. After making arrangements to relocate for the position, money spent, and announcing to my team members I received the position.....I was then told by HR a week later that the position had been cancelled due to the current employee that should have been fired, was still active in the role. I received no sympathy from HR and was told I should have not assumed the position was awarded to me unless I received an offer letter in writing. The entire situation was stressful. If you decide to work for this company...please ensure you obtain an offer letter in WRITING."
good,"I learned how to multi-task the most at this job. I was a cashier but my job consisted of doing so much more. I didn't have a problem with the fast pace and multi-tasking because I like to stay bus at work. My co-workers all stayed busy which was appreciated because I didn't have to worry about picking up others slack. However, the management was unorganized and we always seemed to be short on staff, which was not good during the busy holiday season. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with great co-workers."
good,Its a cool place to work as far as dealing with customers and learning the retail work experience. There is a lot of shady characters as store managers that create problems for the employees and customers.
good,"Growing Company with Dollar Tree. Family Dollar was a good company Long term employee"
good,"Busy, management sucks, the hardest part of job is the very disrespectful customers. ""The customers is always right"" please stop with that saying. The enjoyable part of the job is pay day and the hours I get per week. Co- workers are fun makes time fly."
good,"I'm working in US Project. The process is really great."
good,"Cahier, Stock shelves when there is no costumers at register, at end of day count out cash drawer and balance drawer. Part time job at ten to fifteen hours a week.  What I learned . How to be responsible for my drawer and stocking shelves. Management was good, Co workers were nice. The hardest part was if you worked eight hours you may not get a break and if you did. no place to sit down for break. Most enjoyable part. Meeting interesting people."
good,"You would most likely do either recover, housekeeping, freshness, freight, or schematics"
good,"I was hired as the Director of Loss Prevention for Supply Chain and was subsequently promoted to DVP of Loss Prevention.  Loss Prevention operation, budgeting, initiative management, project management, field support and BCP were under my team"
good,the position was pretty good pay was below average a couple manager the dc could be better off not having from a liability stand point
good,Honestly this is a job that will make you want to rip your hair out. Granted with the right management and team things could be a lot better
good,Working at family dollar had its ups and downs. I left there because management showed a lot of favoritism and made you feel uncomfortable gossiping and taking hours and pay to accommodate their favorite employees. They also had poor benefits and pay rates.
good,"Management is no supportive, they don't follow their own corporate guidelines.  At this company it is basically everyone for themselves and don't even bother with the Human Relations department, its a dead end if you have complaints."
good,"Staff family oriented"
good,"Overall good company, and would recommend it if you find the right leadership.  I hope that Dollar Tree's acquisition will improve their focus on training and developing their associates."
good,A typical work day is working very hard to service communities where customers are treated as expendable as well as employees.  The co-workers were awesome however management continuously gave broken promises.  Very bias company when it comes to management.
good,You have no way of advancements in this company. You are stuck once you get there. They brought in new management and laid off hundreds of people. You don't know if your job is secured or not.
good,This job was great for meeting the public. Unfortunately hard on the body with having to unload the truck weekly. Management was not and is not a big help at the location I worked at. Enjoyed the people that I worked with.
good,"Daily manager shift functions. deposits. P&L reading, total sales for the day, week and month. cycle counts, schematics set for new products, maintain cleanliness of store 100 percent recovery."
good,"Helping the cutomers with any questions about a product or helping them out finding a product. Given them a price check on a product. Always listen them and respect with a smile. I'm all about being a team player, it makes everything goes smoothly and the enviroment is pleasant and inviting."
good,the management here were in disburse about all aspects of the work place. the district management was rude. coworkers were pleasurable to work with
good,Due to always wanting to learn more and be active this job really wasn't for me i like to be constantly working throughout the day and most times i would be doing odds and ends jobs around the store just to be able to keep busy throughout my shift.
good,"asst mgr for a month, worked all kinds of hours but the mgr was demoted to asst mgr and I lost my job but enjoyed the retail part of it and meeting the customers"
good,"•	Maintained cleanliness in all areas of the warehouse and store including counters, sinks, utensils, shelves and storage areas in compliance with state and local regulations."
good,"I worked at Family Dollar on Long Island NY, I was promised advancement for good job quality and had to work on Christmas day to earn job quality, well worked Christmas day and missed family time and when the next promotions came up was passed over for less qualified Asst Managers and the atmosphere at Family Dollar is not great. Do Not Work For Family Dollar"
good,"Completed cashier work by operating a money till, and handled cash by giving and receiving change, received debit and credit cards, and checks for payments and purchases.  I also scanned and bagged store items."
good,Being on call to anytime being called to ask if you wanted more hours or other way around it helps build maturity and
good,"the management needs helps too many issues and not enough security hard worker s get abused and talked about then tossed to the side like yesterdays trash when the company is done with them,Its always something new happening there and the higher up need training and is all about self.More security and organization and value to there workers especially african americans are required!"
good,"Unpredictable Scheduling. Poor upper management, not allowing full control over store operations. Our store is a high volume/velocity store. Our District Manager doesn't allow enough hours to operate the store. No one stays in management at this store for a very long period of time."
good,Had a good experience and got a long with the staff until I got pregnant a month after I got hired. As soon as the manager found out she started cutting my hours and I had to let the job go cause I was too far along to work anymore.
good,"If you were not kissing the Regional Vice President butt every day, they would make your life miserable"
good,A typical day at work is fun and productive. We work together as a team and get things done for the store.
good,"This company seemed to be ever changing and quite organized."
good,"Family Dollar has provided me with the experience needed to be successful in my career, on the job and hands on training, and 100% dedication has molded me into the manager I am today."
good,"A typical day at work is I come in and immediately count down my register to relieve the first shift. We chitchat a bit but we know work must be done so even if we my tell a story or two we will split up and work our separate duties. I learned how to handle a demanding crowd by keeping my line moving fast and efficient, also to stay calm when faced with an issue i.e. technical difficulties on a busy day. we have recently received a new store manager and he is a laid back type but he also knows when and how to put his foot down. My co-workers are hard working and have nice personalities. The hardest part of the job is dealing with an irrational person. I also enjoy customers I meet sum of the nicest people so you take the good with the bad."
good,managers were easy to get along with. co-workers were fun to be around
good,"a typical day at work was alot off dealing with the customers, recovering all the shelves with product an keeeping the costomers happy an helping making sure they where satisfied with there shoping at the store."
good,"I would get to the store in the morning and count the money in the safe, both tills and the petty cash.  I would do all the morning paperwork and make sure that the store was ready to open on time.  I would assist customers with their purchases and ring them up.  I would unload merchandise off boats and stock the shelves daily.  I enjoyed working with the cashiers and assisting them with day to day stuff."
good,"Doing paperwork, running the register, stock, running the store by myself until someone comes in. I have learned all the retail experience that I have. Some of the managers that I had were very good, others used me as a scapegoat. My co-workers were mostly great especially the ones that I trained. The hardest part of the job was keeping busy when everything was done. I enjoyed when everything runs smoothly during the work day."
good,"I worked as a assistant manager for this establishement for a while and learned different things everyday dealing with inventory and stocks also handling financials and marketing iss making me a savvy employee within the buisness, my co-workers were great, however the most challeging part of the job was keeping the employees on task at all times to maintain to goals needing to be reached on a daily basis but was always respected by superiors and my other collegues, the most enjoyable part of the job was learning the markable portion of the job."
good,"A typical day a work can switch between tedious and extreme depending on the customers and the management. My store is in a poor neighborhood, so you occasionally have to deal with unruly customers. However, our customers can take things to a violent level more often than believed. My coworkers are generally average people with personalities that they bring to work; it usually never affects workflow. However, there is a history of past employees stealing or manipulating the system; this has caused issues across the board, making management not trust our integrity. The best part of the job can also best the hardest. Due to the history mentioned above, assistant managers and stores managers have come and gone in the year I've been there. The best part is that some of those managers were very good at communicating with their coworkers and end up laid off or leaving due to violence, thievery (not by them), and bad numbers. Overall, depends on many factors associated with me at separate times."
good,"Working with Family Dollaar was different I learn how to deal with customers complaints, money tranactions. family dollar is a fast pace working environment, because I feel working there provided me with a great experience for other retail jobs available."
good,This is a good company to work for. I have learned alot and I have been here many years.  The teams are wonderful to work with. Its a stable company
good,over all i learn a lot with my time working there ..over my time i meet a lot of people good and bad fun and funny mean and crazy ...the work wasn't hard at all really i gave 100% whenever i came the only bad i come think of was the people who came to start stuff other then the job messing up my pay...
good,"The district I worked in went through so many District Managers in the time I worked there I at least heard of six. The latest DM and VP and RVP would constantly threaten us all that if the store was not perfect the next time they came we would loose our jobs. It took a toll on us all and eventually working for a company who doesn't care about the fact that you have a family at home, your safety getting to work over sales and your overall wellbeing is unbearable. I worked last summer and the store was at least 100 degrees inside and they wouldn't do anything about it."
good,"a typical day at work would be me opening up the store and counting the safes and drawers and making sure all the duties of the pervious night are done. I have learned to be patient being in retail is not an easy job and if you don't have the patience then its not for you. management wasn't the greatest they never really did their jobs. they were to much of power tyrants. my co-workers were amazing. We all got along so very well. I loved them dearly. the hardest part was deffinately dealing with customers. some were rude and very mean, but it comes with the territory and I learned to work with them"
good,"I always taught my team, after the day is over - look back what have you achieved today, what difference have you made in customers or coworkers life."
good,My typical day was ok i learned to deal with rude customer they management team didnt know how to talk to us my co worker we all work well with each other the hardest part was putting up stock and keep an eye on the store and ring up customer at the same time.
good,"Worked with others, management, got along with co workers,  keeping people straight, Im a people person."
good,"Very small store to work in, stockroom is so small when shipments are received, freight has to be placed on sales floor.  Management has no communication."
good,Horrible Management. They make you do double work to save on payroll. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers.
good,Accepted position with the possibilities for advancement
good,"not enough money,not enough hours for all the job responsibility that are expected"
good,I learned a lot. Met new people. Gained new experience to help me in the work force.
good,"This position is not what I wanted long term. I prefer not to work in retail or grocery anymore, that is why I went back to school."
good,Company don't care about there people....management suck!....work overload
good,"Family  dollar  is  an  place of  business,  this  job  have  also  taught me  the  values  of team work.  Having deadlines  to  put  up  displayed with  promotions and  etc."
good,I learn everything from the manager I worked under. They helped me get  a promotion and they care about me as if I was one of their children.
good,it was a ok job  i learned things i didnt know. i would still be there if i had a steady schedule  i think if you never had a job before it would be a good job to start with .
good,nice place to work but dont give enough hours. cant maintain family on 20+ hrs a week
good,"A typical family dollar day consisted of (if opening the store) making sure money was taken to bank, money was right for the cashiers to ring up customers,  store was open on time (if closing) making sure store was cleaned up for the morning shift, cigarette count was complete,  safe was counted and money right"
good,"Everyday you have to deal with a lot of different people, you should never let anymore take a smile from your face. I love to see my customers happy and make sure they get all the help i can give to them. In my workplace my co-workers are very nice, helpful and work as a team. We all help each other when we come to something that we might not know how to do or work as a team to get the job done. I really enjoy my job and look forward to bringing my skills and help to a better workplace!"
good,"There was not a real ""typical"" day at work, everyday was something diffrent. I was an assistant manager so I was constatnly busy, but I feel that the overall managment did not care much for the employees.  Managers were over worked and underpaid and there was no Job security. enjoyed my co-workers and they made going into work enjoyable. It's  a great job for someone starting out, but not knowing the status of your job was the hardest part of the job."
good,"no place for advancement, raises based on everyone else, management is nice but plays favorites, benefits are good"
good,I enjoyed meeting new people as in customers but the people I worked with and the way the company expects your life to revolve around the store is too stressful. 
good,"We start in the morning to unload the truck on Monday, stock merchandise. I learned some company computer applications, scanners that are used at the store....  "
good,A typical day. I came in open the store ran the store until my coworkers got there. Each day was enjoyable do to the costumers. Working with other management was an experience. I learned to operate and run a store single handedly. I ran the store alone for 2weeks do to the store management was on vacation. The hardest part was some of my coworkers with attitudes and refuse to work on some days. 
good,"The people I worked with were great, just wanted to manage my own store"
good,Family Dollar is a good company with good benefits with great advancement possiblities. Unfortunately the particular store and upper management made it difficult to accomplish that
good,"Stocking shelves and cashiering. Co-workers were very kind and helpful. The most enjoyable part of my day were the customers, just trying to make them happy and give them what they were looking for, trust and honesty."
good,Helping customers with purchases and ensuring they get the best customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was our regular customers.
good,the job did not seem to hard to do. unloading packages was pretty simple. the only problem with the job is.......being on call on Friday(Truck Day) If the truck comes 4 hours late you have to make that time up on Saturday even if it's your off day. And the last but not least while i was working there we had weather so bad that the parking lot was covered with ice and snow. my manager stayed 5 minutes from the store. i live in another county instead of them looking out for the safety of there employees they looked out for the safety of there money and kept the store open. I ENDED UP HITTING A TREE ON THE WAY HOME THAT SAME EVENING. SO IN OTHER WORDS IF YOUR LOOKING TO BECOME A SLAVE WITH NO VACATION 2 DAYS OFF AND NO BONUSES FAMILY DOLLAR IS THE PLACE TO BE.
good,"the hardest part of this job is that there is only one cashier at front of store unless it's busy , and also unloading the truck"
good,It was okay environment the workplace was clean but the co- workers brought the drama to the job. It taught me to be a stern assistant manager.
good,It is a very busy both days and nights; fast paced; many people to deal with and need to be able to multitask; organizing money and shifts; stocking; customer service; constant training of new hires.
good,unloaded truck stacked U-boats it was fun bein that i had just came outta tha construction field
good,I loved my boss. She helped me understand the job to the best she could. SHe even tought me tricks on how to handle certain situations I wasn't mentally prepaired for.
good,Cash handling including opening/closing procedures and deposits. I learned how to merchandise and receive inventory along with loss prevention tactics. The hardest part of the job was finding good team members at the rate Family dollar pays. The most exciting part of the job was interacting with the customers.
good,It busy
good,a typical day at work will include recovering of store products
good,"Unload Trucks,"
good,"I greeted customers daily and assisted my co-workers as well as the customers, we were team players. I stocked, counted cash daily to balance safe."
good,performed all of the functions of the manager including:
good,"learned alot of skills. Enjoyed my job no matter how my day was, no matter what the outcome was."
good,Very relaxed place but definetly didn't get paid enough to do everything they wanted.
good,"helping customers,ringing items for customers. I have learned to stay courteous at all times. I Had a wonderful manager great with helping with questions fun to work around. the co- workers were just as hardworking and fun to be around. The hardest part of my job was after closing cleaning up the store putting all the items back where they were, all in a days work. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people every day."
good,Retail management-Manager/Training Manager/Team Lead
good,"although i did enjoy my duties as a cashier,however i did not enjoy the unprofessionalism of the other employess that felt like they didnt have to perform to the best of there ablities because the next employee was picking up there slack."
good,"you have to multitask, I learn how to work under pressure, manager are very demanding, we have to work as a team, the hardest was, somtimes you have to lift very heavy boxes. best part you have a floor planner to do you work."
good,"Working for Family Dollar is a great way to enter the job market for young teenagers or those looking to get back on their feet, but it is not a place to stay for no more than six to nine months. Management does not know how to effectively communicate with employees, the work ethic of the staff is an indirect reflection of management. and there is no true incentive for growth and advancement in the workplace."
good,"A typical day at work, clock in, get drink, speak to co-workers, start working. We were able to be laid back a little. We were able to enjoy the customers with in reason."
good,Always on edge. I have learned that no matter how hard you try to do what is required of you it is never good enough for the company. Management: DM is very intimidating and always calling me down over something when we have store visits. SM and ASST. Mgr. are ok for the most part. Co-workers are ok. Hardest part of the job is standing in one spot for long hours without a break. I have Diabetes and need a break to eat a snack and use the restroom. Most enjoyable time is when I get to go home. I don't want to seem un-greatful for this job I am just being honest. No-one should be treated unfairly. I am not the only one treated this way at my job.
good,The hardest part of my job was trying not to work 85 plus hours a week.
good,"I did really love my job here, at one point in time, after we got our new manager, things went downhill fast. He was/is very lazy, which we were told that before he came here. Many of us had complained about him to higher authority figures but nothing was ever done about it. He even told us that he shouldn't have to help put out stock because he is the manager. Every other manager we had did. Even the customers have called in and complained on him. I miss my job very much, the customers and the other co-workers, but him, I do not miss at all."
good,Company frowns on store associates trying to help customers. All they want is to get product on the shelves and ring ups on the registers. Money Money Money is all that they care about. They do not care if they LOSE a customer or not. The Greediest Money Hungry Company that I ever worked for. And I would not recommend them to my worst enemy.
good,I didnt like it to much just because I had a baby and had to be home at certain times because of babysitter. But It was overall ok.
good,"Dont get time, and time changed constantly. No security, was robbed in store near christmas."
good,I enjoyed working for the manager that I had she was flexible and fair. She isn't there anymore.
good,"lack of communication, management is ver unproffessional"
good,"As an emplyer they were ok, but it was not a long term company to work for.."
good,Horrible experience with horrible bosses. Never felt like I was a part of the team. Not very welcoming and everybody is inclusive besides you. Very fake people.
good,"Your value depends on location and management, as an assistant manager you do the job of 3 employees, pay doesn't reflect your input.  As a store manager, you benefit the most...it's hard to get promoted within, under paid position while working multiple positions."
good,The sales were amazing making the customers proud really stood out the management doesn’t show a lot of love too the employees for giving there all or reaching goal not a lot of recognition
good,Family Dollar does not offer enough hours.They are always cutting everyone's work house.Alot of the regular customers steel from the store.The cashier only gets bathroom break most of the time and thats it smh
good,I was a Customer Service Representative at Family Dollar the job was just a job the store manager wasn't great with work hours with anybody there was a high turnover rate at the store I was at and it wasn't diverse either
good,"The chain of command is so cowardly, the companies GM is very rude, they have flexibility in hours and you have to be physically fit. They offer you a lot but pay you very little."
good,Getting to know your neighborhood is a plus! Never dull when working with the public. You get a change to meet new people and learn new things everyday.
good,"I was forced to use my personal vehicle to go to the bank, was never compensated, was told that since I was on the clock,  that was compensation. The bank was 24 miles round trip from my location."
good,"Lots of theft did happen, sometimes confrontational. My coworkers and store manager were great, supportive, easy to work with. At the end of the day it was a job."
good,"The work is easy , ongoing, but it's not a job where I can grow . The money is decent , but I think i deserve more , especially because i'm a good worker and I'm always helping people if they need a day or two off ."
good,"Typical day was waiting on the customers, helping them locate products, and checking them out.  Stocking shelves and putting out new product.  I learned to more patient with other staff members.  The management was helpful and friendly.  The workplace culture was somewhat stressful.  The hardest part was trying to check customers and stock shelves simultaneously.  The most enjoyable the interacting with the customers and staff."
good,You have to self motivated. Willing to be flexible with your availability. Work in a fast paced environment multi task thought out each day and able to prioritize duties assigned.
good,"Last manager wasn't trained properly. She was always complaining no matter how much we did. Felt like you were not appreciated, no matter what you did"
good,It was a descent job but had no benefits or raises unless you became a manger. With that being said moving up in the company is not very difficult if you are hard working. They do give unpaid maternity leave for 8 weeks.
good,Extra security is needed for the the work at this location due to the customers and not knowing what reaction you will get at any given time. But overall good for the experience for the time being
good,Not to good of a place to work  seems like new shift managers are not trained in closing  also general manager breaks the rules that everyone else has to follow.
good,The upper management over the store was terrible and lacking in the proper skills to train and evaluate issues that were happening within in the store. When upset they would threaten you which is what happened when I chose to leave this store.
good,"I feel like I was overworked and underpaid, My manager cared about nothing but herself and because I was transferred to her store I made too much money she cut my hours and then fired me."
good,"Too much work too little pay "
good,A typical day at work is making sure that the store is organized. The management was good. The hardest part of the job is making sure that the store is well organized before closing.
good,The company has high set in place standards for job productivity when you work there.  Most managers are somewhat lenient about the work they expect you to be able to complete while others are very strict on the work and don't take into consideration having to help customers.
good,It take me about a week to know everything about material handler and I been working at family dollar for over two years period of time. I am equal to learn
good,"Overworked, not enough benefits and pay raises. However, they quickly will offer you a job advance. Management is constantly changing. Lack of communication."
good,Good Job starting off. The amount of hours they have you try to work is crazy and no time for family. If you have a family that requires your time then I don’t recommend this job because they want you to be flexible. No set schedules and always try to get you to work your off days.
good,"Managers were expected to work endless hours.  I worked an average of 80+ hours per week, which made me the lowest paid person in the store. Unable to hire and maintain employees due to low pay rate for the area. My District Manager was great, but he also got little backing from his superiors.  I had paid time of available and was told I couldn't take time off when I had a sinus infection, inner ear infection. My eardrum eventually ruptured, and I still was told I couldn't take time off."
good,I had the best hour that fit my needs at that time and my boss was very understanding n compassionate and he shown me how much he appreciated me as a person and work ethic
good,"The company needs to helps more the employees. They give to much work with no payroll. They don't have a control of the stuff that they are sending, even if we cycle counts they keep sending the same thing that's why we received a lot of stuff with no room to put it. As a salary SM it is not fair that we have to work more than 52 hours every week because no payroll to split with the TM to gets everything done for them.."
good,Working at family dollar challenged me in ways I didn’t  know were possible. I was able to build my work ethic and become a   Dependable hard working employee because they pushed me to limits that my pass jobs didn’t
good,Family Dollar is a company for someone who needs a quick and easy job. I wouldn’t recommend it for someone who plans to make a career off of the job they choose.
good,No room for advancement.  Mainly ran by females.  As a male they use you mostly for truck deliveries.  Store shelves are in a disarray.  Management can be stressed.
good,"I planned to make Family Dollar my career. I loved the fast paced environment. I wanted to move up in the company. Unfortunately my father got sick and I had to leave. Long hours, in the end I was making less than my cashiers even on a managers salary."
good,The hours were not that good. The management was not able to train properly. When someone has never worked retail before it would be good to train someone and who else to train but management.
good,"When I first started with this company as a cashier, I loved it good pay and great advancements. Not to mention the weekly pay. Well when dollar tree brought out the company everything started to go down hill. Pay raises decreased, opportunities were almost non existent, they started eliminating positions and hiring externally and switched over to bi- weekly pay. There’s absolutely no work life  balance if you are not above District Managers level."
good,"I learned a lot by working at Family Dollars, as in handling money stocking shelves, making sure can goods where up to date and having wonderful customer service."
good,I advanced to supervisor very quickly there.  Management just wasn't as organized as they should have been. I loved building the displays and reorganizing things.
good,"Productive and challenging workplace"
good,The company to work for is good it’s upper management that’s a pain in the sunshine it’s stressful management thinks people have no lives and is robots
good,A normal day I worked as a cashier and stocked shelves and etc I learned how to count and handle money I got to socialize with new people and the hardest part was unloading the truck every week and the easiet part is working mornings and putting everything away before the store opens and customers start showing up
good,This company does not care about you or who ever works for them. They do not even give an employee discount on purchasing items. Pay rate for assistant manager sucks. There are really no incentives on being a good worker here. You just go to work do your job and collect your check. You also get to pick up the slack of the lazy employees that they hire.
good,Wouldn't recommend it. Where I worked it wasn't the safest job in the world. You only get anything good if you work full time in which they expect you to close at midnight and open that same day at 7 am with about a half an hour commute time. People quit all the time and that meant workload got dropped on the people who wee stupid enough to stay like me.
good,A typical day at this place is very busy. There is always something to restock or clean. Hours are not that good. this job is great for a person who is in between jobs
good,"I love the friendly somewhat hostile environment, i love talking to and also helping the customers find anything that they might need! I love the steady but somewhat fast work flow."
good,"My opinion on family dollars, is that they can at least give all team members benefits ,n work around personal schedules. There is no flexibility scheduling. I missed 3 days of work due to no child care.. I told the store manager the first day I missed work, that I would not be able to find a babysitter for the next two days ,but that I was working on it.  I resolved the issue quickly . Asked to come in on a Wednesday was told that Tuesday that I was fired that Monday. a meeting with the person and let them know face to face"
good,They have no regards to their employees safety I was forced to work long hours most times alone in the store with no security. They rarely come in to help you and when they do come all they do is complain about what’s not done instead of complimenting what you had done.
good,"This job was okay but you have to deal with angry customers sometimes but the good outweighs the bad, you have to be hard working. the management was good to me and the hours were flexible."
good,Family Dollar wasn't so bad working for management was not professional like should. They really did not give a lot of oppurtunity for their employees
good,I had a good experience working for Family Dollar. I liked my job and my duties. Customers were difficult but we were well trained to manage. Work Culture could be better and management need improvement. They need to hired people with the capacity of managing other individuals.
good,This job is good for part time work. This job expects way too much for the pay! They expect you to do three different job in one day for only barely above minimum wage. And if you do not do the job according to their satisfaction you are fired. They expect ONE employee to unload a truck and then run the register in front of the store! How can one all of these things by themselves. That is why most people quit! I do not recommend this job unless you really need a job.
good,Working for family Dollar was interesting and intriguing I learning experience for sure  I've delt with a number of things from handleing money to providing excellent customer service.
good,helped me  better my customer service skills an stocking also showed me a lil management skills although the days varied with the good an the bad each day learned something to get me through the next one an life situations i might endure in the future
good,"It's a good starting job but I would say it's definitely not something you would want to see yourself working and long-term, although there is room to move up. I just don't fundamentally think it's somewhere you want to dumb all your hopes into"
good,Focus and stay on your own wave. Learn whatever training that's given because it takes you long ways. Stay consistent to the work & yourself. Makes the days go by
good,Its a good job if you need to work..the process is pretty easy...they don't offer alot of hours..just over work the employees..with little time to get the job requirements done..
good,"The job it self is an ok job. the structure to me felt different and was a little unorganized but, I believe that because Im used to a military structure."
good,"Was working doing security but they always had me doing a lot of things outta my job description. For example cleaning windows, putting back food in the aisle, sweeping n mopping the floor, etc"
good,"With a low store budget, your hours go down. Not enough time to get work done, not enough employees at night for safety, no security guards at night to protect the company assets."
good,I work around a lot of bad vibes. They rather punish you than show your the right way. On the bright side it could lead to a lot of good oppritunities for the future.
good,"The new manager is amazing, but the customers trash the store and make my life so hard working here, and there is not enough hours for me to live off this job alone"
good,Family dollar was an intresting workplace. It was fun to be able to interact with customers and get to know differnt people. What was not fun is having to come to work and not feel safe because of the robberies.
good,This job was very complicated for me.  The managers had to load and unload trucks on delivery days.  The job was unsecure because of the hours and time.
good,Love to come to work to greet the customers and to get the day started with positive energy.Had a great experience Works with coworkers they were never issues or drama and if there was a problem with a customer we resolved it the best why we can with manager Being involved It was a great teamwork effort working at family Dollar.
good,"Customers were a priority and we aimed for excellent customer satisfaction. One of the challenges experienced by upper management was when customers presented themselves with product difficulties, as upper management I would have to come up with solutions to meet the customer needs."
good,"While working at family Dollar I didn't not get the best training and when asked what I could do to work better,there response was to working faster. When I ask what tricks worked for others I got not good feed back."
good,"When I first started the hours were great, work was okay. As time went on I gradually got laid off or was completely taken off the schedule to give other employees hours."
good,The job enjoyable part of the job is learning the job learning management working with a team. The hardest part of the job is getting paid for 52 hours and working almost 80 hours a week.
good,I have learned a fair bit from being at family dollar. One important is that management can really determine the proficiency of things and make work more difficult than it needs to be.
good,"Women management was underpaid, staff was not properly trained. Management was inconsistent and there was to many issues with theft. It's a good company when there is properly trained. Allot of issues with being robbed and proper training to cope. Would be a better company if security was improved"
good,"It's a flexible retail job. You clean, receive and stock shelves. Most workers have cashier duties. As with most retail jobs, the customers are the best and worst part of the job."
good,"I’ve worked there a year and a half. The manager has been there nine years. Aside from me and her, no one usually makes it more than six months. The prior ASM was with the store for two years. We still miss her."
good,Alot of things can be approve but we didnt have security at all so anybodt could come in at anytime than its alot when you doi g everything by yourself
good,My experience with this place was not so good. Everything was terrible even all the way down to the management. I learn great customer service. The hard part of the job was the manager something was definitely wrong with her.
good,Warehouse work can be exhausting but the pay was decent and the people were friendly. If you need a job asap this is a good place they will hire quick.
good,you have to be able to do more then one thing at a time. They keep you very busy not only with your job but with you co workers job as well. overall it was a ok place to work.
good,"Good enough job that keeps you busy. Also great place to work if you need extra hours to work.  Laid back atmosphere, plenty of job responsibility if you don't mind the work."
good,Overall family dollar was ok to work for. Many times the company itself is what was bad about it. When we changed to dollar tree cooperate a lot of things changed.
good,i was only there for a month because i was informed that they had to do a budget cut and since i was the last person hired i was the first to go. i really liked it and was close to where i lived
good,"Productive"
good,I enjoyed working at Family dollar for the most part. I really liked my co workers and the hours i got worked good while i was in school. The only part I didn't like is sometimes customers were very rude.
good,You get a lot of hours and small pay. It was okay I liked stocking but I didn't get trained. The employees that I worked with weren't friendly and would be mean to me and bully me. I told the manager and instead of helping me she fire me cuz he didn't want that in her store even though it wasn't my fault. It was unfair.
good,If you enjoy merchandising this is a place where you can put your skills to work. Pay was decent but workload is heavy. Company tends to make cuts at the end of each quarter to make their numbers. This may have changed since Dollar Tree took over.
good,Work life balance not there for store managers. Salaried at 48 hrs required to work 52 plus. Work expectations are extremely unachievable. Hours get cut and manager is expected to work over and above to make up for the cuts since we are salary and free.
good,"Operating registers, bagging items, collecting payment and giving appropriate change. I learned how to operate a register. My manager was informative. The sales team was like a family."
good,"when I worked there I was an asst. manager the pay wasn't that good for having to close the store with me and another associate. I had to be a stocker , cashier  , administrative duties, make sure the store was clean and secure , ready for the next days business. I worked in two locations the first location wasn't that good the store manager was hateful and she did some shady stuff with payroll. Thus the reason why I transferred. the second location I enjoyed being there and enjoyed the people I worked with but needed better pay."
good,There are long days and short days but when you have to do a double shift if tiring but that like any other job you find is just that you get used to.
good,A typical day at family dollar consist after opening the store. Pulling certain paperwork and filling. Stocking will be the just of your job most of the day as well as changing planograms. Nothing is hard with this company. I just hate truck days. On truck day you will have to be be there all day until the truck is finish meaning processed and put to the sales floor. I enjoyed the regular customers they became like family.
good,"Hard to hire and keep employees  due  to low pay and no raises not very flexible with schedules , most the time only 1 employee in the store during most days upset customers due to long lines and a lot of theft"
good,"Better than fast food, but not a great place to work. They prioritize profit over employee happiness and (in instances that I've observed) physical and mental health. If you have and opportunity to work for this company and another, I'd probably recommend the other."
good,I have worked here for the company for two years. Loved working with some of my managers. But here lately i have been pushed to my limits and then my job in a way threatened.looking for another.
good,Had a great time working at family dollar. I had a great manager and great staff but the company it self wasnt to good. Too much stock which made us way back up. They dont check up on the store or their employees.
good,Working at Family Dollar was a good experience  for me. There a very fun atmosphere and i had a relationship with my fellow Associates.also there was flexible work hour.
good,Family could be much more better if there were security and more pay. I’ve worked for this company for quite sometime now it helps with shrink when thieves are accounted for their actions
good,There was fun customers to meet. I was able to grow within the company.  You are able to transfer to other stores in the area.  Inventory is every year.
good,"Family Dollar was a nice place to work temporarily . I enjoyed having something to do everyday getting things done , & being acknowledged for it . But people were so unprofessional here & the stores werea mess alot of the time & the more we fixed somehing the more things came in to mess it back up . Managers spoke innaprppirately to customers & staff & lots of bugs were present . They worked with my babysitter schedule so much they even let me bring my baby to work ,. They were very considerate & understanding i appreciate that so much ."
good,Overall this was not a bad job. It would probably be best for a young person or kid who doesn't have bills to pay other than a phone bill. It's a good start out job to get your foot in the door for work experience but not as a career.
good,"Not really a place to make a career. You will definitely need a second job, to pay bills and maintain life. But it has potential. If you don't have kids it's great."
good,Some customers are rude then others. They work with your schedule. Some days are busier then others. Have to be a fast learner. Good customer service.
good,"I typical day at Family Dollar consisted of either unloading a truck, opening the store aka setting up tills, counting the petting cash and doing general loss prevention paper work. I learned a lot as a training store manager I was able to train 20+ assistant and store mangers to become successful associates. As the store manager I lead my store in exceeding sales goals and going through successful inventories. My district managers and above were not very present as I was moved so frequently that they did not come by often which was the most frustrating about being moved so often. The hardest part of the job was being expected to train after taking on a new location that was not up to Family Dollar standards. My favorite parts of the job was the ability to interact with new and regular customers everyday as well as the training I've always enjoyed that just as much."
good,Working at Family Dollar has been a good first job experience for me. The environment was nice and I really enjoyed my co workers. I have enjoyed my time working at this place.
good,I can't stand the upper management everyone covers there in tale and leave you hanging. The DM are not there to help you at all I just don't get it but that's the family Dollar way.
good,"I was just happy to be working around the time I worked for family dollar. However, I was looking for a 2nd job to manage while working for Family Dollar company."
good,How the job fits depends on the person. I liked my job I did not enjoy my supervisor he was cruel and lied on termination papers he fired me for being pregnant.
good,I just felt that upper management was quicker to punish and dictate what was going to happen if we didn't complete tasks as opposed to reward the team when we completed it over performed what was required even though they were the ones the promise the rewards and the recognition that never came.
good,"The customers were at times challenging to please. Some co-workers didn't do their job correctly. We had to always be on the look out for ""customers"" stealing."
good,loading trucks in extreme temperatures. high turn-a-round volume. not for the weak and frail. temperatures in the summer rise to 120 to 130 in the trailers while loading. no time to rest. past out on loading dock a few times with heat.
good,"I unloaded trucks, stocked shelves, lead employees, ran the cash register, and took deposits to the bank. This job was highly physical without enough pay. It was enjoyable though."
good,"Family Dollar is where I got all my experience from in management. Family dollar can be very hostile, it's just what you make it. It would be a great first job."
good,"I spend 52+ hrs a week working to maintain my store. Regardless of who I have as my employees. When I am not stocking shelves I am catching thieves or recovering the store, which means pulling everything forward."
good,"Costomers are mostly great, long hours, not enough payroll to run the business correctly, employees calling in u get to cover there shift all to often"
good,If you are looking for an easy second job this is a great place to work at . Very short shifts . Very easy task and the shifts go buy super fast because you are always busy
good,You have to be very productive and fast paced at this job. Slightly understaffed so make sure your availability is specified. Must be a hard worker and be able to work under pressure.
good,"Most days at family dollar includes stocking and recovering. These are the two main tasks given to both cashiers and assistant store managers. The workload is high compared to the amount of money earned hourly for workers. Security is very low, with a large amount of shoplifting daily."
good,It's very hard to keep a store running smoothly w/o the proper hrs for the store. They say it's getting better but it's getting worse. If family Dollar would have More hrs for there team members store will be better with family Dollar you have to work a total of 52 hrs a week.
good,The environment is okay. You meet new people and have fun sometimes with the customers and other employees. It can be a great place to work depending on the manager you have.
good,"Nothing much to it, just had to work at a fast pace. Team up with a partner and unload 48' trailers. Most consist of RPC and plastic pallets. Return any merchandise recovered from trucks to loss preventions."
good,The company overall was not bad. As a store manager I felt as if I should’ve been paid more or worked less hours based on the pay. Management did a good job no complaints there
good,"Working as the assistant manager, I learned how to run a chain store. From opening to closing, training cashiers, daily reports and deposits at thee bank, and of course customer service. Its been a great learning experience"
good,It's alright place to work needs security more workers more meetings workers should communicate more with costumers have lunch breaks have uniforms also need outside cleaners on a regular basis trash cans need to be emptied they need housekeeper's they need night shift workers experienced supervisor's lot's of security
good,Very slow and not helpful likes to clutter employees with tasks at one time doesn’t allow you to go on break until your job or task is finished very stressful.
good,"I did enjoy working for family dollar, but I sometimes felt stressed and rushed to get everything done, I feel that for the work that I do, my position is a bit underpaid, and my department was understaffed, which meant that me and my coworkers were working a bit to the extreme to get everything done that was needed to be done"
good,"This place is fast going, always running back and forth, around the store, helping, lifting, packing, un packing.. the work criteria itself is okay I would day.. little bit of hours a day , little bit of hours a week, get paid every 2 weeks for a low amount check, low hours ect... I need/want a job where I'm constantly working( always something to do) great pay , MORE hours and a actually set schedule"
good,People steal a lot and not having security it's scary. Being alone until noon you're not able to get things done in the back. But I do enjoy the people I work with.
good,This is a great place to work if you want to bust your hump for VERY little pay and no appreciation for any of the work you do. I Would not work here unless you want to be treated unfairly and make very little pay.
good,My experience for the most part was crazy!! Sometimes it was just females closing at night with no security or male employee. It seemed as though management cared more about numbers than employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with shoplifters. The most enjoyable part was some of the customers and my employees.
good,"Not a bad place to work for clerks who only want part time hours and minimum wage. Hours would vary from 10-40 hours a week. Assistant Managers do not make much more than clerks but have somewhat of a more set schedule and 32+ hours weekly. Store Managers are paid a set salary and must schedule 52 hours per week but at the large busy stores end up working anywhere from 54 to 70 hours just to keep the store running properly. When taking into account what an hourly paid person would make for working 40 straight time and 12-20 hours time and a half, managers make about the same as the assistant managers make hourly but working many more hours and much more stress."
good,"The initial exposure to family dollar was that of a lie by the district manager. Promising a location of Mom and Pop size and having me commit to that salary then putting me in an urban location three times the size and revenue generating for the same MOM and Pop salary. After three years of profitability and Small raises I left for another store, smaller but just as profitable. In this location raises were not negotiated. The minimum was given even when the Manager (me) increased sales  dollars and reduced shrink to less than 1%. Promises or obligation are weak words and even less meaning to those who made an improvement to the stores they managed. Family dollar would let you take a bullet and ask if you will be in the next day or threaten to replace you."
good,Its a very stressful job. You have to be fast paced with flexible hours. Also Able to be reliable incase you're needed. Required to be able to lift more than 50lbs and able to be a quick learner.
good,Your store manager is always stressed. We never see our kids and salary is stupid when i know the manager is here more than 52 hours a week. The place is hotter than hades in the summer. And im pretty sure hypothermia almost set in over the winter. Nobody wants to work here. I've been here 9 months and have seen 6 cashiers and 2 assistant managers quit.
good,It is a ok place they need to know to keep people in the company . When I work there it was you have to work hard because they never have a lot of people to work so you don’t get a break because you working hard all day
good,"Like many places work environment greatly depends on management.Overall the corporation has went through changes over the last 3yrs  ,some helpful, some not so much for the people actually working in the store.If you are in a high volumn store you will be pushed and pushed to work more than what a small crew should be made to .Work goes unappreciated , good workers get pushed to do more and more .I learned a lot with my years there but its not a career to flourish in."
good,Would be a better place if managers would be more helpful. Most managers do not know how to talk to employees. Instead of asking for input they talk down to employees.
good,It's a fast and slow paced environment. You meet lots of people who build your performance in different ways. You learn something new everyday. Can be a fun experience.
good,I worked 3 different times for this company and each time I left the company because of the people who worked for the company and not the company itself.
good,Managers are poorly trained on how to treat employees.  Unprofessional management style.  Physical expectations on management team are too great.  Time spread very very thin
good,I would recommend this job for high school students who are trying to build experience. It was lots of work for very little pay and the customers were usually always rude.
good,its a nice place to work. the management could have been better. The job was easy and I learned really quick. Its a nice job for a high school student that is just starting off in the work field
good,"I'm currently a manger w this company  they do not offer raises periodically but instead do it once a year  this job is very physical and the pay isn't good.  they offer no incentives discounts or bonuses.  the paid holidays consist of Christmas, only if you work and Easter."
good,Customer service rep is definitely not for everyone you will need to move fast and will be on your feet all day  you may want gloves and good shoes...
good,"working for this company was quiet stressful since there was not enough of employees at the time, but overall everything was fine, a typical day at work was mostly very very packed with customers , always had to check the rows for thief's but they never got away with items."
good,In working at Family Dollar once someone trained you  properly then you would how the flow of things work. If you trained with someone with no skills on training then you didn't have the knowledge on providing great service to customer's.
good,your salary per year at the time I worked their was about $10.00 an hour and you worked 50 plus hours per week. great management and retail experience.
good,Overall family dollar is a good place long as you have a good dm that will listen to your concerns. The customers are friendly and the hours are good the pay is not.
good,You must learn to balance family and work life.  Or can be very stressful at times.  The RVP can be very nasty and arrogant.  Doesn't show appreciation towards employees.
good,"The position I held at the start of my employment gave me the ability to greet customers and help with their shopping needs, also to do loss prevention."
good,Over all it was a good job and I will go back if I had the chance. Their were flexible hours if you needed or had anything to do. I loved working & comunicatuing with my customers .
good,They are always under staff and the work load is very heavy all the time I end up working for them 7 days a week during my employment with the company. Sometimes I would work my entire shift without a decent lunch break because the store remains busy.
good,"in this position; it was get it done at whatever cost meaning hours"
good,The store went under a lot of changes especially in management.  I was looking to find more hours so I moved onto the school.  It was very fast paced and you were required to stock and watch the counter this was very difficult if you were in the back of the store.  I feel they could have used a training program.
good,"i just stocked things , cleaned after every night and cashier. i saw new faces everyday , meet new people. i helped people find what they was looking for."
good,use to be a great place to work and I learned a lot...but in the past few years the company does no longer value their workers. Which makes it hard to have to go everyday with one day off.
good,"The people are awesome, but as a company they don't pay their employees near enough. As an assistant manager I only made 9.00 an hour.  Regular employees only made 8.00 hourly."
good,The store was unorganized. Not enough hours were available.workers had attitudes.Managers were not taking their job serious.To many people were fired. Company recently closed.
good,"no work life balance, DM's work 7 days a week? staffing in stores too low for workload, extremely high external theft and not enough bodies to monitor all customers. SM working alone in stores not able to complete all required tasks while having to be cashiers until 2;00 and later in most locations. constant late truck deliveries causing frustrated SM and team members schedule adjustments.. ASM's not able to get 40 hours based on scheduling requirements and amount of hours are allocated. Bottom line if you have no life and choose to work 90 hours a week than this is fine fir you. This company has no loyalty to their employees and only cares about the bottom line and what you did for me yesterday. They will terminate dedicated employees regardless of all your hard work and dedication if you cannot me their expected daily requirements consistently. Never be comfortable in your position as you will be terminated and constantly ""threatened"" for your job ongoing."
good,"• the hiring process needs some work"
good,I do not think I could make working at family dollar a career. The pay isn't good for the labor you have to do. The job builds character but it is not a place I would put as an ideal top job
good,"It's not the greatest place to work. If you're able to put up with inconsistencies for scheduling, deal with irate customers, and agressive shoplifters go for it. Proceed with caution."
good,"Old school company, old school ways, those that did good work got MORE work, those that did bad work were allowed to stay on and get paid, management knew and didn't care because their turnover numbers were so ""good"""
good,"When I was there, the management was poor. Unpaid time off was based on seniority. the store wasn't as organized as it should have been. The company trains you thoroughly for spills and robbery."
good,"It is a pretty ok place. But I feel as if its not a real job. I believe you can't even do full-time. Thats what I applied for and can't even do it. So yeah, I'm looking for a real full-time job."
good,Very easy going place to work small work space with not to many breaks. Also can get crowded fast when loading items on selfs. Very good with time management and scheduling
good,if your looking for your first job this is where you should start its a good place. they teach you how to stock and unload trucks plus also how to run the register.
good,I take it as it comes it would be a lot better if were always working together I'm a hard worker and i expect everyone to work at him or her expections love to work but enviorment could be better
good,the store was very unprofessional every other day employees would be in verbal altercations . Always an issue with something or someone a very tense place
good,Loved the customer base and building relationships with the regular customers. However left because my needs were not being met finance wise. Company is now owned by Dollar Tree.
good,"Working at Family Dollar was a good job. Since there were only about 6 of us, we became like a family. Until the last manager came in and started pitting us against each other. She was gone about a month after I left."
good,not a bad place to work. they do need to practice better safety percaussions and not force employees to still serve a guest if said guest had robbed them in the past.
good,The managers basically had me doing a cashier's job and their's as well.I had two lazy managers and I was the onlycashier so I worked hard and a lot and it wasn't worth $8 an hour. Maybe if I had different managers it wouldn't have been so bad.
good,In my opinion having a place where you can enjoy working there is a great way to have a person stay their and also having like a gaming room / loft will allow people to cool off steam and relax if the work gets too stressful.
good,i like working there i love my other staff we work well together i enjoy going to work my team supports each other we help each other to make sure we get the job done Im constantly learning new things everyday I also enjoy meeting new people i really enoy my job as a sales associate i just need more hours to work so i can continue to support my family and pay bills although its a wonderful place to work  I need and want more
good,Time flys by because your always moving. Fast working area. Need to have good customer service to work in this type of place. Easy to catch on to things.
good,"Never home, always working.  Salaried and having to put in 52 hours a week.  Typical corporate atmosphere.  Demands alot with little time or personell to do it."
good,The hardest part of the job would be maintaining the store. There was a lot of foot traffic and inventory that didn’t allow for every part of the store to always be maintained.
good,"very fast paced environment, managers very unresponsive, great place to work if you're in school . 18 and over. drug test and computer classes must be completed monthly."
good,"it was okay, it wasnt very many hours or much pay but it was a job and it want that bad. we pretty much unloaded trucks, stocked and worked the cash register. simple work"
good,"company is striving in the right direction to become better, but many things still need to be addressed.  It is a nationwide company but seems to me the east coast and west coast are run different."
good,if you didn't speak Spanish you were automatically bottom of the totem pole. I left here due to belief differences  in common decency between the manager and I
good,Other employees lacked in customer service skills. Management lacked in scheduling properly and effectively. Organization lacked. Cleanliness of the store was very pleasant.
good,"Family dollar is a fast paced work environment. there is alway something to do around the store, wether you are cleaning, stocking, unloading truck or cashing out customers. there is always something to keep you busy."
good,Bad management unorganized and manager has anger problems even towards customers. he barely was at the store but was scheduled to be in. he runs after thefts and one time he jumped in his vehicle and pursued a teenage boy almost causing a wreck customers exited and left the store because of his antics
good,"great environment with incentives.  Not too early and not too late shifts, there are down times to get cleaned up in some stores.  Not a lot of employees so always on call."
good,"It could have had benefits to dental plans or health care, work wasn't hard,n it was nice meeting friendly new people,the break area was good n they work with u in more hiurs"
good,"It's hard physical work, with often times unappreciated customers. I had several supervisors that all wanted thing done differently from before, providing a stressful work environment."
good,"For someone learning the ropes of holding a job and learning skills this is a decent first job. I only left because out of my time there I advanced quickly but wasn't worked with on time off, had been working 50hrs a week only being paid for 40 & hadn't had a day off in months but a new hire was granted a 4 day holiday weekend a week after starting but everyone else was banned from requesting holiday time off. I was the Assistant manager only allowed 40 hours a week but was having to donate extra hours to get required things done due to lack of employees on top of training and hiring new or 'borrowed' employees from other stores. The Company isn't managed very well but it's not necessarily the specific stores fault but corporate management's."
good,its not a job that you will get to stand around at. you definitely always have something to do. the job is easy some days but it definitely has a lot of busy moments more than slow.
good,"complete daily store operating task such as opening the store, closing the store, cash and sales, paperwork. complete weekly task including receiving trucks.etc"
good,Had to be mindful when upgraded to the cashier position because you have to constantly watch for suspicious activity in the store. Some managers took their role to the extreme with their position given. Input from other employees was dismissed or pushed to the side. Associates are asked to check each other's bags due to the fact that they did not trust any of the employees including management.
good,I enjoyed the job it was just the people I worked with and the theft from the customers. I didn't like how people would allow there children to steal and do nothing to try and correct the behaviors.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of handling credit/debit card transactions at the cash register, and handing back correct change to customers. I learned valuable customer service skills so that my customers would leave the store 100% satisfied. My management was quick to tell me if I needed to correct a mistake I made, overall prompt and honest with me. The workplace culture was all about teamwork to tackle what we had planned for the work day. The hardest part of the job was reaching the back of the top shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the regular customers."
good,"Job work life balance needs help. Job security is not good, always wondering if you should be seeking another job. More training needed before you are asked to do a job. It is a Blue culture facility."
good,"The best part of the job is dealing with customers. Fellow employees and subordinates are usually easy to deal with. Managers, District Managers and Regional VP's cause the most difficulty and stress. Work culture is good depending on manager. The biggest problem I found during my tenure with the company was the lack of consistency at the District Manager Level which led to the same problem at the Store Management level. There were also constant changes coming down from the company and the Regional Office that were inconsistent with other regions of the Country."
good,if you want to grow against the odds and get to know what real costumers service is about well is a good place as long as you keep being strong and a fighter
good,"It's like most convenient stores around. You learn how to deal with people, multitask, and customer service skills. You learn to organize items. Easy to work for."
good,Relaxed laid back environment met new faces everyday the work was the easiest got along with everyone would love to have went back but it was just too many better jobs
good,"Five day operation that doesn't hesitate to require weekend work at the last minute.  Staffing is always an issue. Turnover is an issue, but not an excuse for not making production goals."
good,Fun people to work with. Easy going environment. Simple tasks. Hardest part is having to work in all isles & get everyone at the register promptly. Some people are way too impatient.
good,Family Dollar is a nice place to work at when I worked there. I think that this location is closed and has moved to another new location I think. The one being in the short north.
good,"I enjoyed the store managers that I worked with and that taught me everything I needed to know about the field.  I had a serious problem with the District Manager that after promoting me to store manager, failed to tell me that I was just going to be in a holding position and so I was the holding manager of 3 stores in 4 weeks.  I worked 68+ hours a week and he was a very unpleasant person to work for."
good,"A typical day would be very engaging between us and customers. Keeping the maintenance up within the store, keeping supplies filled to the maximum, speaking/greeting each customer. Assisting the customer's needs if called upon. I learned how to be a team player, how to interact with customers and proper procedures. The work place was very active and live. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with peers of the same age group. The hardest part of the job was trying to assist everybody's needs at once."
good,"This is a very fast-paced environment, where employees have opportunities to learn lots of new skills and roles. Benefit packages didn't enthuse. The hardest and the most stressful part of the job was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part was communication with coworkers, learning business and professional skills."
good,"Greet customers, money handling, stock merchandise, unload delivery trucks, reface products on shelves, loss prevention, inventory, money drops to bank, merchandise exchange/return, answer phones, customer service. Management needed some work as far as communication with the staff. Hardest part of the job handling loss prevention duties as a cashier. Enjoyable part of the job it was fast paced & there was always something to do, not much down time."
good,"Working with co-workers is a lot of fun, but some managers and customers can give you a hard time, but me personally can deal with. Where I worked at, after my hiring manager left and a new store manager replaced her, he had brough the store down into the dirt and he wouldn't listen to the assistant managers."
good,"Store setting, greeting and assisting customers with quality care and assistance. Required to run register and keep the store clean and organized at all times."
good,"store is dirty, corporate doesn't care who is employed as head manager. My only rule was don't steal. as a cashier for about 4 months I may have only gotten 4 lunch breaks while being there. the job is for someone who doesn't like a challenge. it is very boring"
good,Working at family dollar was just  go between until I found something more permanent. The pay was typical for a part time job as well as the hours. If I had to I would work there again.
good,"Great company poor management."
good,"A nice working enviornment where you meet new people by the day, learning work place. Helps build dofferent statigies for different stiuation inside tge work place also for different work experiences."
good,"Working in Family Dollar was a great experience for me. Customers were pleasant and my managers were very helpful as well. The hardest part of the may have been unloading the trucks, because of the lack of employees in the store around the time. Also the store has no security nor bars. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, because they were every nice and enjoyed talking to me."
good,"A fun place to work, you can make the experience positive if you want. Hard work makes the difference. You have the opportunity to grow within the company if you want."
good,"Basic cashier work, stocking, cleaning, working with customers. Where I worked was a very bad part of town and I didn't really see myself working there any longer then I did"
good,"Underpaid for too many responsibilities in management. Understaffed most of the time and expected to have unrealistic amount of work to,be done working alone."
good,The company's starting pay for a Human Resource Representative was $10.00. I only recieved a .15 cent pay increase after 90 days. Hard to advance!....
good,"Opening and closing store, paperwork, getting ready for truck and unloading it the rest of your day, took time and passed the time away. I challenged myself to see if i could get so many u-boats done a night."
good,"Family dollar was a cool job ,the customers loved me, always on time for wrk.."
good,"The manager at that time didnt know how to do her job after i left she was fired for poor judgment., but over all the company itself was fair to work for , no issues with them. they were very supportive"
good,The manager is very rude and nasty he has no respect for employees or customers he does not give us breaks and does not let us use the bathroom and he does things out of spite
good,"This job is stressful, your work life balance is non existent. I would recommend for a short term job but I have heard good things since i left. I was still grateful to be employed by them."
good,Its an easy job to do and they start out with an ok pay. It doesn't take long to move up to a General Manager. The customers can be overated from time to time.
good,"Work was good when you had more than two staff. When it was just a cashier and I, it was hard to get stocking and cleaning of the store done. Its especially hard to open the store in the mornings and have to get all of truck put away when you are the only person in the store. Family Dollar is a great place if you want to get promoted quickly and have poor training from the start."
good,"Daily work was not overly challenging.  Not enough work to stay busy for 8 hours a day, but job was close to home. Learned many aspects of the operations and was promoted after many, many years of service.  Hourly associates have it better then managements does.  Took away many skills that will help me find a new employer to work for."
good,"Being an employee of Family Dollar was an enjoyable experience overall. I gained a lot of exerience in customer service,  inventory management, freight/stocking management, as well as merchandising. I enjoyed conversing with my customers, and developed a great relationship with some of my regular customers and vendors. I was given the opportunity to manage the store for several months, and gained a lot of experience in store management, sales, and inventory/asset loss."
good,Family dollar workplace was ok. Management was pretty cool but they want the employees to work too hard. Customer was rude and complained. The worst part is the organized of the store after your shift is over. Never knw how long you reallreally going to be there. But it was fair and ok.
good,"I opened and closed the store in one day. That made a long day. I recieved orders and put them away. Completed the classes the company required. I learned there computers, I pulled murandice that needed to go on sale. The easiest part of this job was working with the customers, I like helping people."
good,Its a okay job to start out but to much bs going on you got four days one week next none i think they need better management and fair hours for everyone
good,The majority of my job is throwing freight.  I have to work 2 nights a week and 6 days a week.  I have to make a lot of decisions regarding merchandising and give direction of what I need done each day.  They are always adding things to do but not giving you the tools to get them done it is just expected.
good,"A typical work day for any new employee at this family dollar includes:"
good,"For the most part I liked my job, but it needs better management & more staff. Truck days suck, they expect you to finish stocking merchandise while handling register when it's super busy!"
good,Although I loved my managers position at multiple stores. The amount of hours did not work out so well at the time for my family and I at the time. Would liked to have seen more understanding and caring out of corporate.
good,Although I didn't work for Family Dollar I work for a company that they hired to dispose of pallets in the warehouse. Working for them was not a great experience but it wasn't the worst.
good,"Days were long often worked until 1pm by myself.  Cashiered as well as all the maagement duties. Often understaffed, Budget not always enough to get all exspected work to be finished. "
good,Work days consisted of 12 hour shifts. I enjoyed the work environment as it was friendly and the people I worked with were great people. I was able to develop my customer service skills.
good,Was a mess when u started. It's a lot better now. New store manager turned the store around totally. New store manager friendly and well organized. Need to get air conditioning fixed for summer and furnace fixed for winter.
good,I've worked at 2 different family dollars in the past 2years and Iove working there the people are friendly the you get personal with the costumers and get to know them very well and they will make you laugh if you are having a bad day
good,"Not Enough payroll for the amount of business. No room for advancement, Did not promote from within, No security for employees or the facility, Plenty programs but no funding for them"
good,"For a part time job its not bad. Basic retail duties. Was a pretty relaxed place to work overall. Cashier, Stock and Rotate, Unload Truck and Clean..."
good,"Depending on the size of the location management could be working by yourself, waiting on customers, balancing paperwork, resetting weekly ads, and stocking shelves at the same time for up to 8 hours."
good,Meeting new people keeping my area clean keeping my shelf stock up greeting people as they walk into the store hanging up my clothes and putting up my shoes
good,"The benefits were good.  The warehouse was a new facility and there was a lot of chaos at the beginning.  Management seem inexperienced.  I was responsible for overseeing the movement of all overseas containers.  I was also store support.  We were trained to do all jobs in the department.  I didn't enjoy the workload inconsistency, feast or famine.  I also had to work most Holiday's. I really enjoyed the people I worked with and I enjoyed working with the store managers."
good,"At the Family Dollar I worked as a part time worker in customer services, cashier, and stocker. A typical day working would be stocking every Tuesday when a truck delivery came in for merchandise. We would set moving U-boats to organize our products into sections to stage later when stocking. During days on cashier you are in charge of recovery in nearby aisles by the register. Also helping the customers with questions and concerns to make it an easier environment when shopping. The employees of Family Dollar were always very communicative. The best part about this job was team work."
good,dead end job no chance of real advancement. Small pay matched with small hours and hardly any man power. Days of unloading full trucks alone made for a tedious day
good,Its was a job that was like whatever u made it at the end of the day.Many things were good about the job and many things were bad.Theft was one of the ongoing prblems
good,"A typical at the job would be clock-in count your til, help customers, stock, and clean. I learned at the job that you must be very courtesy to customer if want the business. You must keep a clean a store and management must help. The management at that time was great for my first three years. After the previous management left they brought in new management who cut hours and was very rude to the customers and employees. After leaving there after in 2008 the management had the store looking nasty. The hardest part of the job was the district manager being a racist. Also, trying to put out of the stock even though it wouldn't fit on the shelf. The most enjoyable part was my customers who was always sweet."
good,Some stores are different but all are the same really. Time I worked there they loved the way I worked. Always compliment me on my work. Even offered me an higher position.
good,My experience at Family Dollar hasn't been great I expected a lot from the managers to guide me through the things I needed to know and didn't really get that at all. This is my first job so of course I am naive and i definitely feel like I wasn't respected when I asked questions to things that was new to me and just dealing with very impatient people.
good,"extraordinary workload with no staff, great place to work if you have no life outside FD.   mandatory 6 day work week and 52 + hours/wk"
good,need to improve on store security and work on holiday pay. overall it is a cool work space and management is tolerable. It is a good job for a teen looking for income
good,I hated my job. I would be alone for 8-10 hours a day to unload stock and make the store look good as well as deal with customers. I had to make bank runs and open/close store. Upper management (corporate) didn't care one bit about its employees.
good,Family Dollar can be fun but they tend to make you work like a slave sometimes with no consideration to your personal life and family they just think for themselves
good,Well your job is based on your production level and at times can be hard to maintain even at 80%. I would recommend very athletic men and woman because as far as the order pickers the job can be challenging at times at the same time fun to the right people.
good,My experience with Family Dollar was alright. The pay rate is horrible for the long hours and for all the work that you do. Family Dollar doesn't care about its workers if you are having back pain or having to go to the hospital the management does not give any care about you and fuss at you.
good,Family Dollar is a nice place to work. You can be promoted very easily but they need to have better training for employees. Need security in all stores and starting salary needs to be changed.
good,"This place is a good place to work . It is laid back , but they usually do not give you full time . My advice is just to find something else while you work here ."
good,"Started out great, took a step sideways and had to prove myself to new bosses and that was easy. Very structured on what you learn and you get the support needed."
good,This is a great job for a person to start off at. They work with your life/school schedule. There is nothing hard about this job.
good,"Working here was enjoyable except when working with the manager I had but besides that, I enjoyed working as a cashier and helping customers with their purchases. Being able to help others makes my day even when I have some bilingual speaking customers. They always have something good to say when they see a Hispanic woman helping them. There's not many women who speak spanish where needed."
good,It was an okay first job. Being a small company sometimes the employees could be overworked.Could hire more employees and probably would keep them if they paid more. Too much work for how many employees they are allowed to hire at one time.
good,"A typical work day at family dollar consist of providing customer service to customers, unloading trucks and stocking shelves. I learned how family dollar unloads trucks and now I have experience in the stocking job field. The management was respectful but also very serious about what they wanted. My co-workers at family dollar were social and always got the job done. The hardest part of the job was meeting 1 U-boat an hour rule. The most enjoyable part of the job was staying busy."
good,Management was often inconsistent. There were many no shows and large portions of work to do with little time in the store. Management often would not finish work they were told to finish by the store manager and store manager was lenient with tardiness and lack of work ethic amongst assistant managers.
good,I loved my Family Dollar Family.  New management not so much.  A lot of changes once company merged with Dollar Tree.  Got along with all of my co-workers.  Love helping others.
good,It was great and i enjoyed myself over there. The time i was there was perfect and the food was too. Encountered a family issue and that resulted in me leaving tje job soon.
good,Watch your time very closely. Mind your own business. Watch the management. I am currently working there and having slight issues.
good,This company was my first job. Everyone from management  co workers GM supervisor all nice people. The store i was located had alot bad customers. Store  was getting robbed alot and customers stealing all the time .
good,I believe Family Dollar is a good company for high school students or first time employment. For a person who has a family it is not suitable because you do not get enough hours and only make minimum wage.
good,"Opened store, set up both register's, to the deposit to the bank. Upon my return opened one register and operated it until a co-worker arrived usually in either 2 or 4 hours. Provided customer service as needed, assisted co-worker's as needed. Unloaded truck weekly, stocked shelves, reset displays. Made sure store was clean and ready for the next morning."
good,this company over works there employees don't not care for safety of employee and makes a person feels like nothing they do is good enough
good,"Typical day was just work, work, work..  Learned that my passion is Merchandising, Sales & Customer Service.  Management was a work in progress. Hardest part was going thru at least 8 DM's within a year.."
good,Sales Associate position. Customer Service Skills required as a cashier. I stock store and inventory control was key issue. Assisted with loading and unloading trucks and other duties as required.
good,no security had many issues with customers stealing. did not enjoy the over long 10hr and 12hr shifts. most of the time i would only close with 1 other employee including myself trying to recover and cash people out.
good,"The environment was amazing, upper management was sometimes a issue but corperate often resolved alot of the issues among our work place. I hated leaving but it wasn't offering enough hours."
good,Working at stores is very hard you do a lot and get paid a little. work as a cashier but end up running around all the store to do other duties. Not complete more than 30 hours
good,"Though I liked this job and my co-workers, management did not handle situations properly and I no longer thought it wise to work there. Under different management it would have been a great place to work."
good,"It a hard job, but it did help me to learn about how to manage employees If retail is your career this might be the place for you, it is a great place for high school to get their foot in the door, for employment opportunities"
good,"All holydays I was at work. Nobody wanted to work on those days."
good,"Very hard work, felt like they overwork you for such a minimal pay. I learned to manage a cash register and stock shelves that is about it. They really have no training prior to you starting to work so you do have a hard time adapting. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude costumers all the time and perhaps unloading the truck weekly. The most enjoyable would be receiving your paycheck but even then their pay is minimal."
good,Good management and wonderful people! Work schedule just changes way to much! When you think you have a day off you probably don't. Great people and sometimes a good environment to work in.
good,I can say my overall experience at Family Dollar was okay. I love the my team members and I had fun with my co-workers. I learned in management that you have to be the best boss you can be to the store no matter what!
good,As a recruiter I placed people to work on a day to day basis. It has been a wonderful experience. I love to help people change their lives.
good,"I work at two locations do to the shortage of hour availability, and I'll tell you, the two stores differ like the different sides of the Berlin wall. On one side I can depend on the management to help me out, have my back, and be reasonable. On the other side I can't get anything done anywhere,"
good,Just not a good place to work unless you have good mangers working with you. I feel as if the company doesn't really care about their employees.
good,In store management was very helpful but the improper training for advancement made it hard to perform daily job requirements. The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable ie: customer service & satisfaction.
good,"I learned alot about sales, the importance of customers relationships, and the importance of team work. The support of the staff kept me going and pushed me to pursue my aspirations."
good,"wait on cusomers, unload trucks put up merchandise answer phones, made bank deposits, store orders, made change orders...the in store mangers were great,  the higher up managers were terrible. I got along with coworkers well  Listening to customers cuss you out.  Helping people was always nice."
good,"Like many other companies, they are all about ways to make money. Usually only two people working in the store at once. The store I worked at was robbed a few times in the three years I was there, and they did not do NOTHING about it to make employees feel safe. The company has such an extreme turnover rate. I feel like they do not pay any of the employees (cashier, assistant, or manager) enough for all that we have to deal with. Unloading trucks once a week was a drag, especially in the summer when it could be up to 120 degrees outside. Since there was only two employees at once, you could not call off at all. Don't get me wrong it is an okay job to get by with in the mean time but not something to do forever. I learned a lot while there. I do think that the company needs to pay more attention to employees because it seems like they do not care about them at all."
good,This job was a lot of fun and had weekly pay and i got to move up extremely fast to management so that was cool. Got to know some big spring people from regular customers.
good,"I enjoyed the environment, and how we provided   customer service, but never provided services for their employees, like sick days, and vacation time."
good,"I would say to people that want to work there, that a typical day at Family Dollar is fast paced with a not so bad  pay by hour, but demanding to do lots of work, if you can't keep up , you will be called out. IF you become friends with the team, it will be better and you'd like it more, management is always good if the manager is a good and smart leader, hardest part of the day is when all customer come in at once, and they want to destroy you so you can pack their things and go"
good,it was a cool place to work. great co-workers and manager. worked hard and enjoyed doing it. got great customers service skills. flexible work schedule.
good,"Hours were never stable, was quite difficult to get 40 hours on an average week for full time employees, staffing was always lacking and poor cooperation from upper management."
good,"This company provided me with great work experience. The environment was fast paced and productive, friendly work environment."
good,"I was handling cash and costumers as well as stocking and cleaning. I learned how to properly stock and organize inventory. My co-workers were friendly but the assistant managers that I worked along side did not provide instruction on the job or any structure. The manager was the same and rarely dealt with his problems with his employees, instead leaving unclear notes and talking through his assistant managers."
good,"loaded/ unloaded trailers,worked in a timely manner with a sense of urgency in a fast paced environment. An exceptional group of hard working peers who helped out each other."
good,"They work you hard with mandatory overtime and tons of product to ship and morale is low, tons of people call in or no show everyday."
good,"this is the sort of job where you cant imagine the amount of money earned is actually worth the amount of things needed to be done, maybe its just my store, but this is definitely the type of job for someone with no experience."
good,Was a challenging constant changing environment. I enjoyed working with the vendors and associates in the store. The store I worked in all the customer were really appreciative to be able to have the store in the area.
good,"A typical day was door to floor, schematics,scheduling,setting ads and customer service. The hardest part was getting everything done that was required and being on salary was usually about 60 hours a week. I enjoyed being sells competitive."
good,Worked here for at least 8 years and the hours suck. The only time you get hours is if someone full time goes on vacation. Most of the rules are not clear. In my opinion this is just another job that uses you up and then spits you out
good,This was the first job i ever worked in and i got to say the job has it's moments. Interacting with customers and helping them is no problem but the store was always getting robbed and made it a dangerous place to work at at times because there is no security. The managers were good and also really careless at the same time.
good,We are usually very busy between duties and customers. Loved my manager/co workers; hardest part of day is the morning and most enjoyable was evening rush.
good,"I personally enjoyed my time at family dollar.   The company needs more experienced managers.  Be prepared to work 7 days a week, at least 70 hours a week."
good,Productive workplace with supportive team members. Flexibility and growth were positive aspects of working here. I enjoyed working with the customers every day.
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. I felt that we all helped one another and had each others back when things got hard. The most enjoyable part of the day was when it was busy.
good,12 hours shift. I learned ADP payroll system. Attend serval management seminars. Enjoy work the co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job. Getting to learn and attend many continuing education to be successful as a manager.The most enjoyable was having cooking for the employees.
good,"The first 3 1/2 years there were a great enpowering experience, but an injury to a manager lead to an increase to costs resulting in some manament employment ending"
good,"Very good establishment to gain experience but poor work environment causes for lack of confident employees. I think an establishment that hires workers should ensure proper training so employees can have a better chance on maintaining their positions, rather they be entry-level or management."
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar is opening the store and ringing up customers,  I was a an assistant manager so I had to watch over cashiers as well as do money drops, exchanges, refunds, and bank deposits and change runs.  If we had stock from the truck we had to get it out of the stock room in a timely accurate fashion and make room when no room was available on the sales floor.  The hardest part of the job was time management the store was small for the volume of items we were receiving and we would have lots of overstock we had to squeeze on the sales floor before our next truck was coming.  I did enjoy the customers I met and that the store was next to the beach."
good,"The work place was a working progress, it wasn't perfect but we always had the store cleaned and restocked for the next morning. Now i believe communication could have been better."
good,They work you very hard and you are always in pain they do not do a very good job at communicating and gets very overwhelming to find out at the last minute.
good,"- Open the store for business on time with the maximum staffing of 2 employees including management."
good,"A typical day was cashier or unloading stock, it was my first management job and it taught me a lot about people and myself, management did not stand behind what they said at first, my co-workers where easy to get along with and work with, the hardest part was unloading the trucks, and the most enjoyable was the people I worked with"
good,"If you are people friendly, this is the job for you :)"
good,Fast paced environment with high expectations. Learned to be self taught and independent while trying to be part of the company. Also learned corporates first concern is money and not the well being of its team meembers.
good,"Assistant Store Manager"
good,Could be a better place to work.  Lack of communication leads to inefficiency often.  Employee turnover is high.  Employee morale is low.
good,Family Dollar is an UNSAFE work environment. I was held at gun point on one occasion and merely robbed repeatedly. Police officers even disapproved of the lack of care a security for the employees and merchandise.
good,I love helping people and I would do that here all the time. I liked answering peoples questions. I enjoyed helping costumers with their needs.
good,"Fun customer service,long hours little appreciation but an incredible expierience.A great team of coworkers trained and dedicated. a joy to work with."
good,"Overall, it was a stable job to have. The environment as well, but the the management was horrible.  "
good,"At family dollar a typical day at work was team members show up to work., What I learned that you have to give stores management the  tools in  order run the store ., For example better wages for team members so that stay with you .,that was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable was the customers who where always keep come back become like family to you."
good,Typical day is store manager opening store alone and working until afternoon alone overseeing all store responsibilty and customer satisfaction. No balance. Long hours just to get things done and low payroll
good,"typical day at work would be steady paced, a little bust on truck days"
good,"I liked the job. It had some advantages, was a good first job. Didn't get many opportunities. Never got bored while working there."
good,I would work 40 hours a week. Sometimes if another store needed help they would send me there. If it was my weekend to I would work 15 hours on Saturday and 15hours on Sunday. I was all ways on call if the truck came. The one thing that I learned was that this store never closes for no thing. I ended up working every holiday there was in till my last day. The hardest part of the job was I got sick more then I have in the last 8 years there due to the items we sold there. The only enjoyable part of the job was when I was off I was off.
good,"Working at Family Dollar has brought me a lot of opportunities to learn new things. I've had the chance to explore different positions within the company. Having the opportunity to travel to different stores to accomplish projects to better the store makes my job exciting. Also I have also been able to observe the more corporate side of the company as well. For example, going to meetings that discusses losses within a store and how we can make it better. The main part that I enjoy is being able to provide a service to the customers in a safe clean environment."
good,"...Interesting, Low pay, Horrible management, Rude customers with no Disciplinary action towards shoplifters, no security cameras"
good,"the best part about my job were making my customers happy and made sure they always felt welcomed , and having good team workers"
good,"I had to work too many hours for the pay.  I did all aspects of running a retail store.  My job included customer relations, employee relations, scheduling, inventory and ordering, merchandising, cleaning the store, packing out products, receiving truck weekly, hiring and firing."
good,Fairly well work days. I learned more about being patient with people. Certain management officials had attitude problems. They expected you to do things right while they were doing things improperly. The hardest part of the job was having to move and have so many things done in so short of time. Most enjoyable part was being able to help the customers.
good,6 Day a week job requirement. NO LIFE / WORK BALANCE. High demand with little payroll and intense pressure from upper management to the top.
good,"A typical day consist of greeting and talking to customers. Door-to-shelf, meaning the time of getting products from truck to shelf. As management I had to properly arm and disarm the store as I opened and closed it. Getting change for my cashiers along with making change orders to the bank. Constantly watching for theft. Cycle count and exceptions had to be done weekly, along with damaged products. Co-workers were fun people to get along with, very warming people. The hard part of the job was time managing because corporate doesn't give the store enough hours to properly get things done the way they wanted it. What I enjoyed most was the customers, especially the regulars. They can make your day go by a lot faster."
good,"With this particular job, the most enjoyable part was working with the customers on a day to day basis. The customers made my time here more memorable. I learned how to multitask well by stocking inbetween running the register."
good,working at family dollar is good if you are in high school and starting to get into the work force.
good,Not enough time allotted for scheduling within the work week to accomplish required tasks throughout the store. Most of the time there was only one employee on premises which is not safe!
good,believed i was taken advantage of because i was young at the time
good,Working for this company was a very ok experience. sometimes in certain situations i was treated unfairly but one things for certain i made sure i was on top of my game and i always did my job no matter what.
good,"Helps store and corporate management ensure retail outlets functions well. I helped raise store profits by attracting more shoppers, providing better customer service and selling more goods."
good,Nothing is typical. ($2.6 Billion in sales for fiscal 2013 with approximately 8000 small-footprint retail stores and 11 Distribution centers)
good,I really enjoy working with my team.  The job can be stressful at time.
good,"After my first three months of being a hard dedicaited cashier, I was promoted to being the Store Assistant Manager, with that came higher pay, and more benefits"
good,"Physically demanding. Extreme multitasking sometimes without the proper assistance as well as misleading directions. All the while continuing to be able to meet the demands of customers. Being held responsible for employee training, store orders, stocking, recovery of the store, cash reviews, item shrinkage. Ultimately I learned consistent patience and how to become a leader without expectation."
good,I learn a lot in Family Dollar. I really enjoy how to assist the clients.
good,"Great as a second or part time job other than that, I wouldn't recommend. Management and co-workers are cool, but its honestly too much work and not enough pay or benefits."
good,Need a lot of energy. They have a great open door policy. Yes you can get full time hours but it is hard to get the full time status which means no benefits.
good,"*A typical day of work only consist of a few hours. Maybe 3 to be exact. I was thankful to have a job. But they didnt provide the hours I needed. "
good,"Family Oriented and Customer Service is our number one priority. I learned that providing excellent service benefits the team and the  customers greatly. Working hard to keeping a clean and safe work place is  of major concern."
good,Family Dollar was a small environment with not many employees but a large amount of customers.
good,"working at this company wasn't bad. I didn't so much enjoy the work itself, but I enjoyed working with other employees and liked to see our regular clients. I learned alot about inventory control and stocking in a high paced environment. The hardest part of the job was picking up weight of other manager. the most enjoyable part was interacting with clients."
good,my review dosn't go for all family dollars i liked the job other than not getting paid time and half had a nice manager that made sure everyone was doing something never had a complaint besides one thing
good,most customers always put a smile on my face. some of my co-workers were awesome where as others had me questioning a numerous amount of things!
good,"store ,doing everything  that the company need .good place to work to learn about the busness"
good,"My responsibilities include stocking the store to capacity."
good,Even though i was only a cashier i was also my own boss. Even when both manager and assistant manager where on the clock i was doing all the work and had to find my own objectives to complete
good,"Consistent high pressure culture.  Very little positive feedback, excessive constructive critisim.  High turnover in all positions."
good,I learn how to better prepare for the work day ahead and handle customers.
good,"runningregister, serving customer needs. easy job. stocking and organizing."
good,First going into to work there was always something to do. I always had to make sure the store was clean at all times. Even when you didn't have anything to do you always had something to do. The hardest part of this job was to try to keep the customers from leaving the store if there was a long line. Some of the time I was the only sales clerk that was working and the manager was always doing something so everyday I had to get faster and faster.
good,"Learned great customer service"
good,"Pay is minimum rate for most employees. There needs to be more security inside stores, for employees' and customers' safety. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Some of the employees above management had very rude attitudes and acted as if they were better than other employees. I enjoyed my job, most of the time. Not a bad job for a first time job seeker. A typical day included: cleaning front of store & register area, recover front end, stock shelves, help with freight, tag clothes, assist customers, answer store phone, work register, countdown register, prepare deposit for bank, complete housekeeping checklist, record deposit in log book, verify deposits."
good,the hardest part of the job is truck day. you have to get freight out while taking care of the customers needs. overall it is a good work place it would be better if there was more payroll so that there could be more worker on the weekly schedule.
good,"Always a busy place to work . Time flies by. I learned to be more patient. Coworkers were very helpful. Loved helping the customers."
good,I enjoyed the time that I got to spend with the customer and how the recovery process is done.
good,it was hectic but i made the best of it. management wasnt steady so it was new rules almost every time i came to work. my co-workers were fun but they kept quitting. the hardest part was management.
good,I started as a cashier and gave myself a goal to become an assistant manager and so I have achieved that goal and now I would like to become better in the work field to better myself career wise and make something a long life career.
good,"Ensures positive customer experience delivered by all stores in assigned area by working with Store Manager to ensure that store operating procedures and processes are in compliance with Family Dollar Store standards. When directed by Store Manager, assists with door to Shelf Functions, staffing audits, inventory preparation, store processes, loss prevention, and retraining Team Members as needed to correct Operating processes and procedures. Assist with Mystery Shopping as needed and all other projects and duties as assigned by Area Operations Manager and Performance Manager."
good,the hardest part of the job is communicating with customers in line while focusing on a shoplifter.
good,"Assisting customers with product selection."
good,Worst job experience i ever had. My first job i ever had. Managers didn't know how to handle coworkers which caused complications.
good,This was a nice place to work at least I thought until they went under new management. Because of this they were later screwed over.
good,I was a cashier at Family Dollar and when I asked to have more hours and to help out more I was told no even when they were very short staffed they refused to teach just threw u into work and wanted it done management was always goofing off and talking on phone with friends and not working or helping staff when we would get busy
good,i liked the job. the managment was a joke there was always something to do so the day went by fast...
good,The job is a bit on the demanding side but the customers are friendly and can make they day go by quickly.
good,"Great customers, not great boss. She had little experience being a boss and she wasn't good at it. My other co-workers were great to work with. I learned a lot of the office end of the store."
good,"My day consisted of spreadsheets on the computer, making sure Incoming and Outgoing products was being done in a timely manner. I had a great  relationship with my co-workers and with my Supervisors. We also had a holds spreadsheet which was a big part of my job, I had to try to get the products off hold to move in and out of the distribution center, which was tough because you are working with Vendors to have actions to do so! I thoroughly enjoyed my job, was sad when I had to leave due to a disability."
good,"Loved working with the customers, but as a manager you are required to work 52 plus hours, 6 days a week. Leaves no time for an outside life."
good,family dollar is a fast paced and busy place to work but offers little advancement.
good,A typical day at family dollar was rather boring to me because I didnt learn all things required to do the job which made working for me complated because the store manager didnt put me through any training before I started to work.
good,"I worked here for almost a year. I was fired for having morals and being a mom. Family is NOT number one on their priority list!! Holidays with your family??? Forget it! Are you sick??? FORGET IT!! As for the employees you work with..awesome, as for the upper management... MORONS!!!"
good,My job is very fast paced .I work with the public and that is my most enjoyable time at work.
good,"Generally speaking the other workers were fine, never had a problem with anyone. But as far as the company as a whole, it really just really felt like they wanted us to just work and didn't really care about much else. Wages were horrible and there really weren't any opportunities for advancement. It really just felt like there was all work with no benefits besides being employed."
good,-unloading trucks
good,not really much to say good place to work with the right management
good,well you have very minimal hours like 20 -25 hours week they only pay minimum wage and no matter what your experience and paid every two weeks you would get about 300 dollars.. they do not train very well to do your job but then they complain when you cant do it...and have to ask them several times to come help you
good,"My time at Family Dollar has been short but mixed. It all depends on whether the store you are placed at is a high volume store that gets very busy customer traffic or a low volume store that usually consists of regulars and customers in the neighborhood. I started off at a low volume store that was great! Awesome co-workers, an okay schedule, but overall not much stress besides working the register and unloading a few boxes to stock shelves. Payroll i at Family Dollar is something to keep an eye out for, as my store had limited pay roll and too many employees for such a small store, so hours were cut. I eventually transfered to a higher volume store and have more hours than before, but at higher volume stores you literally work for your money. I moved away from cashier and on to stock, and the endless waves of unpacking boxes nonstop did not welcome anything. Cashiers struggle to balance the tasks of unpacking small boxes while maintaining the register, its a back and forth game that never ends. Pay is unreasonable, low volume stores pay minimal wage, yet high volume stores pay a bit higher."
good,I've been with the company for a year. at first it was fun but i knew i had to let go when i was almost written up for not wanting to come in on my day off because i had school. Not to mention there are no guaranteed hours i had to fight for my hours at one point and i am management working full time so i'm suppose to have 32
good,Thought I would be actually workin then told no only while store ws fixing to open then was to blet go
good,"Fun and Friendly place to work, not alot going on, Managers are wonderful"
good,"A typical day at work is to open the store by yourself,take in all vendors and put up stock while giving great customer service. most of the day shift the manager is by themselves. Your store is limited on hours weekly and there are times when you work a 12 hour shift by yourself to stay within payroll.The hardest part of the job is to keep your customers happy with the lack of help you have in the store.I feel that the customers dont get what they need.. I am great at what I do and need to work with a company that needs someone to give great customer service."
good,"Nothing to say about this one,working there for 5 months have drove me to the edge, everyday your boss hammers you in the ear about your performance and thinks your doing something wrong and when you do it the way your told he goes on again and said it's bad....What?"
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar was that the start and the end were always the same, it was what happened in between that made a difference. I learned that if your given something to make change that most likely your total atmosphere will change along with you. Managing stores really gave played a big part in how much I enjoy being a huge part of making a difference in a customers experience. The hardest part of my job was enduring the amount of shrinkage when the store was first handed to me but, in the end turning it all around. The most enjoyable part of the jobas I mention was putting a smile on the customers faces and making sure they had a great experience."
good,A typical day is 7-3. Management is okay. The co- workers are great to work with. Team enviroment. The hardest part of the job is leaving ear ly when they run out of work for you to do. Spending time with with friends during work is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Usually busy environment involving register duties, stocking merchandise, daily projects and recovering the store while taking care of customers. Responsible for opening/closing procedures, payroll, scheduling, money responsibilities, shrink duties, vendor services, merchandise ordering/ handling/ receiving, inventory, conference calls and delegating tasks and duties, ect. Management and co-workers work hand and hand to get deadlines met. You must stay busy at all times because there is a lot to do. Being a service to customers is enjoyable and completing tasks."
good,"A typical day here was a challenge because of the many hats you have to wear. What i learned here was to do many jobs, have a smile, and provide customers the best in customer service. Co-workers came and gone. The most enjoyable part was assisting customers and seeing them return because of the great service provided."
good,The store can be very busy at times. while working there I have learned how to deal with people and their different ways of life. manangement is ok but i feel there is room for improvement. My co workers are good to work with. the hardest part of the job is not having the hours or staff need to perform the daily task completely. the most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the public i like talking with or helping our regular customers.
good,No Family life or personal time work 80 to 90 hrs evey week with no improvement on payroll given by corp.
good,"A typical day a work would be me enjoying and assisting my customers. I've learned that you can not please everybody.Management can can be unfair sometimes but you learn to deal with it. The hardest part of the job is not being appreciated. The most enjoyable part would be shown respect from you co-workers as well as customers,"
good,"opened and closed the store, made deposits, put away merchandise."
good,this one did 2 different jobs all the time not enough hours in a day to do all that needed done but still liked the job very fast pace very busy
good,"Family dollar will teach you a lot of skills and train you in many different areas. I liked working there, but the management was not good at all. The supervisor was power mad. She abused her authority"
good,Well a typical day family dollar you had to deal with managers that was not professional all the time.Co workers that will laugh in your face then talk about you behind your back.
good,"My job at Family Dollar was challanging yet I enjoyed it. It was a heavy work load for not alot of pay, but it was worthwhile just for the people you met every day. I was in charge of opening and closings, cleaning, truck intake, stock, cash handeling and customer service and care. I handeled bank deposits and change orders. Some days were long and weary, but we kept our customers satisfied, and that is what mattered."
good,"A typical day at work would be to enter the store an hour before any of the other employees to complete the previous day's accounting information and transmit that information to corporate office. To prepare for cashier tills for the day, inspect the store and stock room for products that need to be moved to the shelves on the store's floor."
good,A typical day at Family Dollar is Very hectic.
good,OK job lacks structure in mangagement. The company does not pay enough to its employees and advancement is very limited.
good,"A typical day at work would be making sure that the store is clean, stopping shoplifters, and customer service. The Hardest part of the job is being on your feet for long hours and restocking shelves."
good,Its often busy with minimal staff. A very fast paced and demanding job with low pay for the duties required of the employee.
good,Overall managing store and team members while organizing and stock freight. The hardest part of my job was being robbed at gun point.
good,"Typical day was making sure everything was ready for customers upon opening. Enough money to make change and enough product on shelves. I've learned from working at Family Dollar is to be very patient. You come across some very irate customers and i know how to handle any situation professionally. I was apart of the management team as an assistant. Although Store manager wasn't always fair, i still made the best of every day. There was really no hard part of the job. Although there were some days where employees were not doing what they were suppose to do,and were dealt with in a professional yet stern manner.Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers. Making sure there shopping experience is as pleasant as possible."
good,I would go in and check people out at the register. I would stock the shelves and sometimes I would be in the deli cooking food.
good,I liked the job because i had lots of hours and the location was bad. We got robbed almost every other day
good,Family Dollar was a fun place to work as a teenager. They helped instill some values and responsibilities in myself. I left them after a short while because i could not find a common ground between work and school.
good,"You can find great values at Family Dollar, but at the expense of the employees. They required you to work many hours per week as a salaried Store Manager. When business hours were increased, they asked management to work EVEN MORE hours to compensate. Their yearly shrink levels are always very high, but that is due to having limited # of employees in the stores. We were required to answer the phones, run the registers, stock the shelves, unload trucks, and be the security all at once. Just too much to handle for one or two individuals alone."
good,"The hardest part of the job is having  to stand all day through our your shift , expecting you to do everything even if you’re the one to be running the register , also pay is not all that great"
good,"Hello"
good,The kind of manager you have determines the kind of employees you have as well. Everyone should be respectful and considerate of ALL employees.. not shorting my pay because I declined a request to come in on my off day.
good,"At first I loved it but then as I moved along I started to hate it, the managers above the store managers they don’t care about you they quick to fire you and hire somebody to replace uou"
good,They will have you doing just about everything in the store. It’s up to you if it’s worth 8 an hour. In my opinion it was not . I felt as though I was being over worked and unappreciated. Also the management was extremely lazy and unprofessional.
good,This place does not truly value its employees. Supervisors and managers will take the easy route to take care of issues rather than the correct route.
good,"There was really nothing hard about that job."
good,Family Dollar use to be great but it is going down hill. Lacking the support for the employees which cause a lot of stress. People working alone is unsafe and the company just keeps cutting the hours.
good,"I liked making sure my customers happy when they left the store. Getting them in and out. I like to be on one shift, so that was rough changing out from night and day. But I enjoyed, just not enough hours"
good,"-not much room for growth in company "
good,"If you want ok pay and a good days work... Awesome. No excuses. Work hard and there a good chance you'll stay where you are."
good,This company was a lot of work but I loved helping the customers. I started as a sales associate then they asked me to become a part of there management team so I did just that.
good,"Job was fun very friendly and very understanding and urself because of the location , they wasn’t understanding to family issue was mainly worried bout u showing up to work, they were only worried bout themselves"
good,overall a good experience and I have learned a lot that I will take with me.  there were a lot of great memories and amazing customers but I didn't fit the criteria.
good,I loved my job I worked hard and was never late always came in when needed to cover other employees shifts I worked holidays I just had a rough ending there.
good,"Need better management. Family should not become a problem, when it is a public store. Stop hiring family as co workers . Hiring other people that are not family."
good,A lot of work for no hours  and no money I enjoyed  the people  I met every  day and the crew members  were okay manager  was alright I really wasnt into the job  just  needed the money
good,"Very long hours 6 days a week, Can be fun at times, My customers and team members were the best part of the job. Truck days and Christmas were the worst."
good,"The job was ok... Something was going on higher up behind the scene, my store couldn't keep a store manager they kept quitting. Appointed me ""holding"" store manager but wouldn't actually give me the position."
good,The work place was a little all over the place because it wasn’t a stable manager in none of the stores so I was bouncing from store to store. But in that time I learned a lot
good,At 1st I liked working there. But due through the dangerous situation South as strong arm robbery s an hostel customers. Without room to advance was is just alittle over whelming.
good,"manager was a real jerk seems like he was outside smoking a cigarette more than he was working plus verbal assaults, seems like he was hi..& not interested in working or managing the store"
good,It's an okay place to work if you just need a job to pay bills.   They have manager roles but they pay and work does not match.  You work much harder.
good,"Can be fast paced. Alot of transactions daily. Very busy store. Alot of stocking. Easy job, competitive prices, large inventory, promotions, easy job, friendly customers."
good,It's a okay place to work at just yet again had an experience with another poor management that was lazy drinking alcohol on the clock horrible just horrible
good,"In this position you learn how become a good Store Manager, hard work following basic instructions and rules. You can learn as much as you want to success."
good,"As a teenager, I enjoyed the job. It was slow-paced and easily adaptable. The only thing is, I outgrew it. Being a person who loves advancement and learning, I began to not like the workplace. My coworkers and managers were fine people, but it was very stagnant. I didn't learn new things once training was over."
good,"Great to work execpt for the DM in area. Very unprofessional, prejudice. Hours for salary are horrible supposed to work 52 but work 80-94 hours a week with one day off every few weeks. No hours for scheduling help and employees job always threatened"
good,The workplace environment was very comfortable the customers were always kind and my coworkers were amazing to be around till management changed then it felt different and not so friendly.
good,The pay and benefits sucks it's only good for a second job for extra cash . But it's very relaxed and easy. I love my time working there meet some great people and had the best managers love them
good,"It is pretty much the same thing everyday. You go in and cash customers out, restock the store and cleanup. Nothing exciting really happens, management is okay. the most enjoyable part would be the amount of recognition you get if you are successful in your work. Hard work does not go unnoticed."
good,"No work/life balance. Working at least 6 days a week, 10 hour shifts, usually not getting a day off due to lack of hours offered by the company. Being stuck in a high volume store for hours on end alone."
good,nice clean place they expect a lot out of u for small amount of money but overall I enjoyed it. If it was paying more I would love to go back but its not enough money.
good,"No summary to speak of, but since you insist. Typical job. Pay was not enough. Hours were limited. Co-workers are always late, if they come in at all."
good,"Good pay and hours vary.  Work is very physical and back breaking.  Must be able to multi task times 100.  You will unload trucks, stock freight, be accurate counting money and be able to open store and close store at a moment's notice.  Must solve any problems either with equipment or with customers.  Very stressful environment."
good,Family Dollar is a good beginners job for people looking to get work experience. One of the down sides is that at times it can get very competitive with other stores in the same area.
good,Just don't take advise from fellow employees and stuck to how you were taught to do things. At all times all stores are ran differently. So just beware of who you work with
good,"Management when I worked was poor, I was a part time worker, working most weeks 39 hours, the days I needed off I'd sometimes get off. With a kid on the way, and a wife with heart problems I needed a few more days off than most for appointments, and check ins. Problems with the schedule were never dealt with, cliques were very present in the work staff."
good,Workplace was good. I learned how to manage a store and a crew. For the most part working for Family Dollar was a good experience for me. For the most part work was busy so we had to learn how to keep up the pace to keep the store clean and make it visually nice for the customers.
good,the one i work at now is decent. the pay is real low. but nice environment . for the most part management is good. decent i must say. i still need a second job though.
good,Family Dollar is a very useful and helpful. The Family dollar store is a store where you can find just about every and anything you may want or meed. From Household items to automobiles. You can find everything you need there. If they don't carry a specific item. They will find another store that will.
good,"As a cashier at family dollar I enjoyed my shifts because i would always have something to do thr oh ughiut my shift whether it was cleaning up the store checking out customers or stocking items, it made the shift eventful and go by fast."
good,The job paid the bills. Sometimes do to low staffing numbers you will work open to close if you're a manager. No one to cover lunches. Will give you management experience.
good,"Under staffed leaving a large work load for the employees. Good entry level or first job. Wear comfortable footwear and jeans or slacks, breathable clothing bc it get warm in the stores."
good,Okay place to work. Not much is advancement due to in being a small store. A lot of shoplifters so be prepared to deal with those situations. It's better to come in the morning and work the early shifts.
good,Family Dollar ovee worked us and under payed us they don't appreciate their employees they expect us to do without having proper merchandise and without any paperwork showing what needed to be done
good,I have enjoyed working for Family Dollar for almost 3 years. The company is constantly making changes and advancements are easy to come by if you work for them. At this point in my life I feel that it is time to make a change for myself and my family.
good,the only complaint i had with family dollar is the pay rate and hours. both are very low. i also wasnt able to work in other parts of the store. i loved my manager. she was very kind and helpful. if i had any questions she would happily answer them.
good,"It’s not a bad place to get a first job and get some money, but it’s not a really good place to stay. Even at high management they are underpaid and overworked."
good,"Reviewing as a former second-shift worker. Second shift is ""advertised"" as four ten-hour days, but you're actually going to be working 11-12 hours a day. Also, mandatory fifth days are almost always on the table, so don't be surprised to find yourself working 55+ hour weeks."
good,"Not sure what the hourly pay is now, but when I hired on back in Dec of 2015 they were only paying 12.75 an hour.  We were constantly sent home early and this job was one that kept you extremely busy with no time for error.  Free health insurance was a huge plus if your single.  Not sure what the family rate is."
good,"Fast paced environment. The days went by quickly because there was always something to do. Did not completely agree with the management routine until I became Assistant Manager, did not feel as if my voice was heard until then."
good,I ran the cash registerand stocked shelves including the cigarette case and phone case.i stocked shelves helped customers and recovery.at nite I helped close the store which included cleaning floors taking out trash and cleaning bathrooms
good,"It's a good place to start off in the customer service industry despite some of the rudeness of customers, but in customer service you will see a lot that you wouldn't dream of seeing. Its unsafe to work there because Family Dollar doesn't proivde their own security besides interface live security and that's not enough. The pay is too low for the amount of work you would have to endure 7-9 dollars isn't worth it. But personally I had an good experience, maybe because of my Manager made it better. LOVED HER !!!"
good,It was a very stressful environment and at times it had a negative vibe between coworkers. It was a heavy workload and often times more when  workers didn't do their part of the shift responsibilities.
good,"Worked me like a dog, barely anybody that wanted to work night shift besides me. One night it was me and my manager the whole night I was on the register all night tiring. Overall it's ok but I wouldn't really recommend it for real."
good,I enjoyed working at family dollar. It helped a lot with communicating with the customers. Its a fun work place if you knew how to make it interesting.
good,"I so enjoyed working for family dollar! "
good,Family Dollar is a pretty decent place to work if you have no life and wanted to live at the store. I worked an exuberant amount of hours.i was constantly covering everyone's shifts including the store managers. I never had a free moment in life. It was like that store was my child. Over worked and under paid.
good,"Management was inconsistent about time and making the hours, I like working with some of the people but the fact is that they picked and choose who was favoring and also the fact that if you we’re least liked they never gave you a real schedule, only would call you in for when they needed you"
good,Poor leadership within regional and zone positions during recent changes in leadership. No work life balance. Salaried employees are expected to work extremely long hours. Stores have extremely poor payroll budgets that leave store being ran by one person most of the time.
good,Family Dollar would've been a great place to work but this particular area wasn't that great. The customers were the best thing about working at this location but they didn't pay me for hours worked and after the third time I quit
good,Working at family Dollar there's lot's of responsibility for a manager.  Making set schedules verifying that ever employee is able to work the hours they were scheduled. Unloading trucks and stocking shelves at a timely manner.
good,"A typical day at work was I would work the front half of the store doing cashier and stocking, while my supervisor worked the back end unloading boxes. Management was good at first then after about a month or so of working there it just got worse."
good,"I usually do truck and stock "
good,"Some location are great and others or horrible. So it all just deepens on the location. The company dose not give the payroll to do the job."
good,"I started out at Family dollar as an cashier, within no time I was promoted to assistant manager position in which it was easy at the time. Eventually things began to get harder because of the paperwork, but I've always been easy to be taught and a quick learner. Family Dollar is just giving me full-time after working for them for three years and I finally received a raise. Family Dollar is all for favoritism, and promotes who they would like to. As a black female in America, things are made harder anyways, but its entirely too hard being at Family Dollar."
good,Good starter job for a college student to obtain customer service and employment experience.  Also help you learn teamwork and work with flexible schedules.
good,The work place could be fun. Health and safety didn't always seem most important. Refused to provide security to the stores that really need it. Break rooms were minimal. Expected to to most of work with less hrs and payroll
good,When i first started working there i was very happy because i didn’t have a job & i needed one to help my mother around the house. After a while it wasn’t really cool anymore because we had like 4 managers within a month then it was pests problems which are still there now.
good,customers had no respect for the employees. management did the normal treat you like a number in the herd of cattle. but work itself wasnt to bad though.
good,I would clock in and count the drawer I was assigned as cashier. I would check customers out and put away merchandise in between. I also helped unload truck on Fridays. At the end of every shift I swept and cleaned before closing with my closing manager.
good,"As a Store manager: You have weekly/monthly merchandising deadlines, daily reports, unload weekly trucks, perform weekly cycle counts. I loved merchandising the store. The company gave you a guideline for the sections, but also gave you the freedom to ad items needed to keep it full and refreshed. I also loved the quick pace of the job. I like to constantly have things to do. If there wasn't stocking or merchandising. There was always something that needed to be done. Such as reports, cleaning, and recovery. The hardest part of the job was the truck delivery and making sure all of truck was completed in a short time frame. That the store stayed clean and recovered during this process. The trucks are unloaded by each box being sent down on rollers and sorted to a uboat or sales floor. Once the truck was unloaded my goal was always to clean the boxes off the sales floor. Then we would process the rest per company guidelines. "
good,"Management could have been better organized. Communication was not done as much as I would have liked. Wish they had more benefits for employees  "
good,"They would work one manager all weekend shift 13 hour days. I just got burnt out after 6 month of working weekends. "
good,the way that office clerks would talk to you. they talked down and treat you like a toddler. i wasnt told about all the mandatory overtime and could plan for home life.
good,The job was nothing special and i worked there to just make money. I needed cash to be able to pay for food at home so i took this job to be able to support myself.
good,They can do better when it comes to management and scheduling  benifits only by moving up. Overworked not a great pay great place only for a part time
good,It depends on location but all in all it was ok for the time being. Was flexible on hours depending on the work load. Job is really not hard it’s just a matter of wanting to learn
good,"This is a difficult place to work at. It’s fast paced and there’s hardly no teamwork here. Some of the managers don’t  step up and help out or speak up for his/her employees in meetings. This supposed to be a 8 hour shift but since I’ve been here, I’ve been working 10-11 hours a day plus Saturdays. We’re always shorthanded because people be too tired to show up to work the next day and they can’t keep nobody because people are always walking out and quitting on them."
good,I got to see new faces but the distance from home was further without the option of moving closer to home. I rode the bus home and there many times my manager would hold me back later at closing maki g me miss my only way home.
good,"Aside from the unrealistic expectations set by District Mgmt and higher for Store management to accomplish tasks while alone on site, the environment is fun and pleasantly fast paced"
good,"Family Dollar is a great starter job with room for advancement if you work hard and show a desire to move up. As a manager, there was no work life balance."
good,"managers would leave the store for hours when they were suppose to be working, but other than that it was a laid back job, people could work here for a while"
good,It was okay job. Store close down. Had to close and open a lot. People quit a lot so it was hard getting a day off. Had a lot to do for the day most days and somealways had to be done.
good,"A typical day is faced paced filled with greeting and helping customers. Handle money, store counts, inventory, and employees. Mange store receipts, phone calls, emails, customer complaints. Complete projects and store deadlines."
good,"Customer service, stocking, helping with the team, cashier , assting customer on an everyday balance, trsinh to become a manager, doing shematics, and g"
good,"Great pay, extremely poor management from corporate, (they had me walk with a bag of thousands of dollars to the bank?? and no security which there really should have been.) The best experience was the relationships I had with the customers, who were always friendly. I always worked hard and stayed overtime, went the extra mile to make sure everything was done properly, despite the lack of associates (usually just one cashier and one manager). I liked being challenged and improving myself as a person and a manager at this location, however, it was simply a poor setup. There was too much responsibility and unrealistic time frames and expectations to get work done. Constantly doing multiple tasks at once, with no brakes from start to finish on long work days ranging from 12 hours to all day shifts, then opening again the next day. I remember staying late, sometimes until 2 or 3 in the morning, clocking myself out at 12 to stay and work FREE, to make sure my store was clean and ready the next day. I give all the credit to the cashiers willing to stay that late with me at times. There were times when the bathrooms were down for days at a time, and because managers aren't allowed to leave we had to use plastic water bottles. There were cracks in the floor covered in duct tape and cardboard, leaking water from the ceiling, the extremely strong odor of chemicals (like a chemical fire) where there was roof work being done. I'm not sure how things are run at other locations, but this one seems like they only care about how much money is coming in, not how fairly the workers are treated."
good,It was an ok job. Could have been better though. The pay could be better. The hours are ok. Need benefits though. In all I would recommend this job to another person.
good,"I stocked, clean, secured items and customers. I was fast on cash register so my manager loved putting me on the register. I loved my customers hated the pay and raises."
good,Wished that the management team was able to communicate better. There was times were rules omly applied to those who wanted to enforce them and not follow them.
good,"Not bad if you are in school, high school or college. The work is not too hard. Pay is obviously not too good but worth it if you just want to make a little extra money."
good,"top notch coworkers, but not much room for advancement. flex hours, no lunch breaks, no paid days for cashiers. otherwise, good place to work. depends a lot on manager, I just lucked out"
good,One of the best jobs i work at but has low pay for the work you do. I loke the teammate the manager they where great but i got out for the yhe pay you do to much work for the pay your getting
good,"Had to deal with the feeling of never being good enough due to the unrealistic goals set for us. When those goals are not achieved you get in trouble. Worrying about losing my job was a constant thought as an assistant manager. The work environment was very unprofessional. There was also some sketchy stuff going to with clock outs that I won't get in to."
good,"As assistant manager I was responsible for all aspects of running the store when the manager was not there. I ran the register, cleaned the store, re-shelved items, took returns, unloaded the truck (assisting the manager) and stocked the store."
good,"No comment! Just did my job and went home! It was fine under the old management but when you have a DM that curses at you, it's best to leave! Then you have an employee that's a no call no show but he's mad because you have plans and can't stay but want to fire you for that and not her!"
good,"working at Family dollar pays a decent wag, but being a salaried employee, there is no homework balance.  Stores are not allowed enough payroll hours to  maintain a decent crew, so thereis no rom for someone to be sick or have any type of missed work. you spend  great deal of timealone in the stores while remaining e=responsible for operations and loss prevention."
good,The environment is trouble.. the store been robbed too many times.. people's steals out of the store too much.. no security and higher management don't want security
good,it an alright job its just a lot and can be really frustrating. truck days or a hag and there forever last 2 days and depending how you are speed wise you could be doing it yourself.
good,"Must be willing to give up family/home life.. they dont accomedate for emergencies.. Must like working with difficult and sometimes angery people, rude coworkers"
good,Very flexible with work hours. If you leave you will not be paid for any PTO time you have. Work load is heavy at time and when someone leave the company expect the team to pick up the extra work and may or may not replace that person.
good,"I worked for this company for 2 years. I believe I was extremely lucky with the team I was apart of. If it wasn't for my coworkers being so kind, loving and understanding, I wouldn't have stayed for so long or even accepted the offer to become assistant manager. The job itself is easy. The tasks are easy and straight forward. But, the time in which you're given to complete certain things isn't reasonable if you're not willing to completely give all your energy to this job. DO NOT apply to work here if your schedule ISN'T OPEN and if you are easily bothered by plans changing due to getting called in or the schedule changing a good bit. These stores don't usually have a lot of employees so each and every person showing up and doing their job is important because whatever doesn't get done by you has to be done by someone else. If someone else doesn't do their part or calls in all the time, then it affects EVERYONE. I was also very fortunate to work at a store location that the customers were wonderful. It was rare that I had to deal with unreasonable and rude customers. My main issue with this place was the schedule. I didn't ever get to do anything with anyone anymore. It felt like I lived there. If you live to work, then this is the place for you."
good,Working at family dollar seems more of a pass time then a job. It's a temporary job for those looking for another job. It's a good place for a first job for high schoolers.
good,"Many shifts worked alone due to very little payroll given to stores. No breaks, company is obligated by law to (suggest) breaks for how ever many hours worked that shift. Decent for a short term job not so much for long term."
good,Family dollar does not gives overtime nor do you get full time hours. only when shipment is coming are the days you get most hours. The pay is minimum wage or slightly higher depending on experience.
good,"I loved working at this place.  I unfortunately had to quit because my school schedule for college didn't Allow me to work the hours they needed.  The pay was great, I loved how the other coworkers were to me.  They were extremely nice."
good,Family Dollar was something different when i first started working there didn't expect it to be easy only part that was a little annoying is the stocking . but i got it done
good,Did cashier duties and inventory open and closing the store. had to maintain cleanliness of store. train new hires overall this work experience was just because i needed a job never what i wanted to do for a living
good,productive and busy workplace with fair nice co-workers the hours were not very flexible but the environment was laid back and easy to learn the managers were very understanding most of the time. The hardest part of the job was making sure the shelves were stocked correctly
good,fir me this is a young persons job. you barely get any hours and your checks sucks and it is very unsafe place to work. so if you value yourself don't work there
good,"I have no comments to make on this. It's a job and can be tough with much time only one in the store. Stocking shelves, climbing ladders, customer service, cleaning, moving shelving and product,  lots of lifting and on your feet all day long. Not much time for breaks."
good,It's a good ace to wook. Just not  a lot of long hours .have to have a flexible schedule. In management you're required to give up you family life to make your team happy.
good,"it's okay not the best. not enough hours. enjoy the customer experience. hardest part is getting the work done in the time limit they want while having so many customers to deal with, with little help."
good,"same as Duke.  hired on as a contractor.  There was not enough work to keep us all busy so they laid off a couple of people.  People were also great there, the ones that I met."
good,"Stressful not  much of a work life"
good,As a company its a good place to work. As a store it depends on who is running the show. I think they should pay mpre tp there assistant. We have a lot of responsibility and a very heavy load of work.
good,But once you get a team of guys that work with and came to work to work everything else was kind of smooth sailing I had to make me a team that came to work and wanted to work
good,"Easy to advance, to hard to balance personal life.Need security in most of the stores. One day off is not enough for a manager to take care of their personal responsibilities."
good,"You can be over worked, for less pay sometimes you could be left by yourself in the store with no help or with truck.But on the other hand you can have some cool co workers."
good,"I gotten to learned different aspects. I got experience money experience, customer eservice, management, to help and advise the new employees. The hardest part is keeping up the fast paced environment."
good,Family Dollar would be okay if there were more hours and more people helping it's really not a bad place to work that's actually cool I just need more hours that's my main issue MyPay
good,It’s not bad when you first start but the second you get comfortable they stop helping you. I’ve asked numerous times for a few changes and I still havent seen any change or actions being taken to fix the problems.I definitely feel like it’s a Man-run company.
good,"Good company for young adults to start as their first job. If you're a shy person, this type of job will help you break out of your shell or be social."
good,"Enjoy working ,and meeting new customers."
good,People I work with are amazing but the pay isn't at all okay especially for an assistant manager nor are the hours .!! Corporate needs to give more payroll .! They are losing good people due to poor pay and poor hours given.!
good,"It was a ok part time job, but not enough to make a living.There  is  always only two people working and long lines.The company is more concerned with cost than customer service"
good,Working in a fast-paced environment and learning how to handle cash properly was huge adjustment for myself. Stocking canned goods and other miscellaneous materials was also a nice experience.
good,It is a great job as long as you have a good manager. The customers are the best part about the job. They do not give you breaks as the should and it don't matter how long you work for in the day no lunch or breaks.
good,"The job itself was easy fast-paced comfortable, breaks were reasonable but not always given ,no room to grow .The pay was reasonable but not having enough hours made it miserable only managers got good hours/pay."
good,"Overall I truly enjoyed my time as a part of the management team at family dollar. The customer focus was admirable, and the team I worked with strived for excellence."
good,Family Dollar was a decent place to work. There were short hours available. Co-workers were friendly and engaging. The store manager just kind of throws you into the wolves without showing you really how the store works.
good,"Be sure to come to work on time, and willing to work through your whole shift.Be accountable for your cash drawer and all paperwork.Make sure to greet all customers entering store."
good,"It’s not mainly the work place that most issues come from , it’s location . Staff works well together , freight gets worked , and lines get handled at a timely fashion ."
good,"the average work of the store manager is enjoyable"
good,"Performed daily activities such as cash reconciliations and store opening/closing procedures. Assisted customers in selecting merchandise, answering questions, and quickly resolving concerns. Greeted customers, ordered store inventory, and stocked merchandise. Performed day-to-day cashier supervisory and administrative duties. Assisted with the merchandise replenishment and the flow of merchandise from the stock room to the sales floor."
good,Enjoyed wprking with Family Dollar but when the merger happened with Dollar Tree I came back and was given a store without a two week training or in store training.
good,A typical day at family dollar was mostly just stocking the store and checking out customers. I would clean the store as well. Management was strict but the job was easy to do.
good,"Decently lacking leadership, though the customers were wonderful."
good,"the majority of the day is fast paced and busy, you have to do mulitple things at a time through out the day, you are constantly helping customers and the employees, you have to be good with money, patient, solution oriented and courtesous"
good,"Trying to keep the store clean and stopping the people from stealing, it would be a nice place to work. Very busy store. Hard to get quality employees because of the neighborhood the store is located in."
good,"Working for Family Dollar was an eye opener. While i enjoyed some parts of the job, for the most part the bad out weighed the good. I started working before the store was renovated. When the renovations started,  instead of closing the store they had us work around them and had customers shop around them renovating. Even though most of the heavy moving was done at night while the store was closed. No one knew where anything was. I don't think that pay was worth the job. Even as an assistant manager (was only making nine dollars hour).  We would get a 1000 piece truck and have to have it put up and be done with in 2-3 days. But we could only two people working at a time. (unless if was the day we got truck ) Assistant manager did have to work open to close on Sundays. A lot of time is spent working by yourself if you opened the store. I haven't worked at Family Dollar since 2014, so maybe something have changed."
good,This is a place to get your foot in the door if you plan to make a career in retail. The pay is below poverty and the hours are few. Management pay is even worst if your not the store manager.
good,"I absolutely loved working there, I got hurt, they refuse to paid work workmen comp and hired a lawyer and was ask to resign. Other than that I would still be there. the only thing I hated about was the District manager was just one of those manager you could not make happy no matter what you did..."
good,"It was an easy job with very little duties. Management was not great so the store wasn't all that tidy, but don't know if that was exactly their fault because there wasn't enough employees staffed to keep up. Never enough payroll to keep employees. But, as a temporary job to stash a little money this was an ok place to work."
good,It was a fun place to work at if you’re just gaining experience. Great experience over all. Not much growth opportunity with the company. It’s a good temporary job.
good,"I was with Family Dollar for twelve years. There are good things and also bad things, like with most jobs. It’s certainly not easy, but if you’re driven, it’s the right choice for you."
good,It was a great place to work until a new hire came in and wiped out the store and management went down drastically. Choices we not though out in a store manager way.
good,"its hard to operate a store with limited payroll, as the store manager, I would have to be the only person on duty to be cashier, stocking and wait on vendors so that my payroll was used for trucks days"
good,What I learned the most were the management duties of being a key holder in a retail situation and I really enjoy interacting with the customers and giving great customer service.
good,"I've worked in retail and customer service for over 15 years so I am used to the fast paced, stressful and competitive work environment. That was never a problem. The management in this company however, left something to be desired. The pay for the job you do could've definitely been better. They will over work you into the ground for peanuts. The real ""hire ups"" are the only ones who truly benefit from working for this company. I.E. district managers, loss prevention, vice operations, etc. With that said, it is not all bad. I worked with some particularly good individuals and made some great connections. You can network and there are room for advancement within the company, but I would say if you don't have a degree, returning to school might be a good option because believe me, they will pay you accordingly."
good,I loved my job and time at the family dollar. I started off as an cashier and worked my way to Assistant Store Manager in a matter of months.Its pros and cons to working there.
good,"It was a decent side job, but they never gave enough hours to pay for half my bills. Only worked there briefly due to lack of hours and willingness to give more."
good,They expect you to do a lot of stuff during your shift but you dont have the hours to give your employees. So while stocking and doing cashing you must also do paperwork and hang signs up and fix all the problems that others created the day before.
good,"Was a stressful job, but the work got done...started out as a cashier and then became an assistant manager...the pay was very poor for an assistant manager...overall the job would be perfect if the pay was better for the work that you have to do"
good,"Family Dollar is a great place to work. Management was great as well as the employees. Even though the environment was fast paced, there was only a limited amount of employees so you had to manage your time."
good,The fun part about working at family dollar was my manager and workers we all got alone and I've learned how to merchandise and make bank runs. The best benefit is pto
good,"Fairly easy job, work as a cashier and stock when you have time."
good,i go in and do my job i get along with everyone there the customers can be a little rude but overall ive had excellent expirence with my customers..I just dont agree with the pay.
good,"Its normally a cool, calm, and collective day but, every now and again you'll have those rude costumers. I learned everyday doesn't  go how you want but, you can't let it ruin your day. Family Dollar isn't for everyone they expect a lot for little pay. It to see how hard your willing to work and stay loyal with little pay but, it pays of in the long run."
good,I loved working with the public and assisting them in purchases. I learned that they didn't trust anyone. In management it was somewhat stressful because you couldn't please the district or regional managers but understand they had someone over them too. Hard part of the job was often working alone best part of the job was the customers. As far a the work culture they needed more people working in the store to handle the volume.
good,"Good working atmosphere with management, store was hard to keep clean due to lack of enough employees, we always were behind the 8 ball, hours cut from 40 to 10 due to purchase by Dollar Tree and I was not told before being hired."
good,Family Dollar is a good place to work as long as you have a good store manager that is dedicated to the store her or his store that want their employees to succeed unfortunately I left  Family Dollar at the time that I received a good manager she was young she was bright and she wanted her employees to do as well as she was doing
good,Management not grand not enough employees and drama behind each others backs did seem like there was a team effort didnt seem like climbing cahin camand easy
good,"A typical work day would normally consist of me arriving on time in the morning (if on opening shift),  before the store is open and count the safe to make sure it is at the set amount. I would then be responsible for pretty much whatever goes on in the store due to the schedule being just a cashier and myself most of of the time. If need be i could also do cycle/exception counts or set schematics throughout the store, but on a typical day i would do some freight along with assisting customers and making sure everything at the register and in the store is being properly maintained. If i was to be on closing shift i would then have to count cigarettes at the end of the night. I would also have to count the safe and the cash that would be intended for the deposit while getting it ready to be sent to the bank. Working at family dollar allowed me to better my communication skills by talking to employees and interacting with customers. Also due to complications with management i was able to get a feel for how a few store managers would go about running a store and how putting emphasis on certain things could outcome. I am ready and willing to better myself in other fields as well as my current one."
good,Not a good job for advancement within the company usually running the store with yourself and one other person most family dollars in my area are in poverty stricken communities so it can get a little dangerous.
good,"Productive and busy workplace with hard working workers who be dedicated and very helpful. Now for the company as a whole they, have growth for any individual who wants to ex-span but for as an  corporation it needs a lot better direction and appreciation for their real good workers."
good,Its was ok working for family dollar i meet alot of good people there but there was alot of manager that i feel dont need to be there and alot of cashier
good,"Good place to work,  expectations are high but are obtainable. Merger with Dollar Tree has been slow and lack of communication has hider the operation"
good,"Typical Summer Job - wouldn't recommend staying longer than a year unless you intend to advance to Store Manager, General Manager, District Manager, etc. "
good,I had fun working there but hated the fact that I mostly worked alone and had to consistently run a register. In doing so I didn't get any floor work done or stack on the shelves.  The pay was meager but considerable for most other stores.
good,Work was pretty much fast pace so  time flew by except when the head manager  was closing i never left on time with that individual   they were completely unorganized but  besides that  it was a good job.
good,"long working hours, one day off, work 12 hours of overtime for "
good,"Family Dollar is a good job for people who are just trying to get on their feet but after a while, it turns into a dead end job. I worked here long enough to get a car now I'm ready for a better opportunity job."
good,"you wont be seeing yourself getting promoted without some luck, and the pay isnt great for how much youre supposed to do, but it's not a bad place to start for someone needing a part time job."
good,"Typically it was stressful some days would be more relaxed than others, a lot of the work policies need to be updated. I received my first manager position with the company so I learned lots of important information. I feel as though the upper management could play a bigger role with involvement with the stores. the hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers. As far as the most enjoyable part of the job was being a manager and being able to help satisfy customers and talk to new people and learn different aspects of what people feel is good customer service."
good,"Upper management has no concept of what goes on in the stores. Never enough staff, work load too heavy and management does not support or appreciate their front line staff."
good,It was a decent place to work often stressful because understaffed and underpaid. Everyone unloads trucks and everyone stocks. Theft or shrinkage is common in all of the stores which undermines the company's desire to pay decent salaries
good,"I worked at Family Dollar for a couple months. Over all, I enjoyed working there. The regular customers were awesome. The work environment wasnt to well. The team didnt work together which made things harder. Its a one for your self type job. Just do your work and get out."
good,"As I worked at Family Dollar, I was getting the feel of the customer service position. I describe the job as poor management, because I experienced working with 4 different managers in 4 months."
good,"Great location to work in, always busy and great company to work for. Customers are nice and manager is really sweet and very flexible when working with you"
good,Poorly run company. The DM plays favorites in choosing store managers. Previous store managers are threatened of losing their jobs. Payroll is short. Lack of employees causes the store to look terrible for recovery. ASM's do all the work.
good,"handle tender"
good,had a good job experience at family dollar. I learned so much from them and I thank them for all the training they gave me. I enjoyed working with all our customers and was extremely happy on helping everyone.
good,"Enjoyed provided customers with a clean and wonderful set up store to shop in, and employees to great them with kindness as they entered the store...."
good,Could never get anything done because the store was very busy the customers were unruly and would tare apart the store as fast as you would fix it I learned that the stores never have enough people working at the time when it's the busiest and didn't care the management that they brought in were good and fair until the end before I left the company the management was extremely poor the workplace culture was competitive and you never knew what to expect per day the hardest part of the job was working with the customers that came in to the store the most enjoyable part of the job was running the register and getting the customers out of the store
good,Don't get me wrong family dollar is a quiet place of business until it gets packed more hour would have keep more employees. You have no security at all.
good,"Okay job, can get stressful at times. Have to learn to work register, work freight, and help customers. Pay could be a little more. Team I worked with was good"
good,Ok job easy work really no stress until truck day slow pace i had good management. Love working there on holidays. Really good place to work as long as there's good management. Not enough hours or pay
good,"On a typical day, you put away freight, cashier, help vendors. Although when an assistant manager, you have to do all of this while you are alone in the store. Then you have to figure out how to provide the best customer service, and get everyone out of the store and still in a good mood, or try while they are in line to make sure people understand you are going as fast as you can, but not compromise on your customer service. Most people in general were accepting of the fact that the company is short staffed, and as such, when the store gets busy, it may take some time to get people out. Upper mgmnt, can be very difficult to deal with. As this company is owned by DollarTree, Inc. So family dollar is still adjusting to the way the owners do things. And can cause a headache for the lower class employees. Overall I enjoyed working there, until they got a new district manager in there. He's a walmart employee, and was there for many years. He still tries to do things the way Walmart did.. Cant do that.."
good,The pay for the things they expect you to do and complete and sometimes other people don't pull your work so it makes your work load a little harder because if you don't do it and nobody's going to do it and nothing's going to get done but at Family Dollar everybody really is like a family.
good,Fast paced and frequent deadlines. Always had competitions between stores by seeing who could sale the most of a select item. Always had online classes to take during the holidays and around the beginning of different seasons.
good,"A typical day at work is to unload totes, run the cash register, and provide friendly fast-paced service.The hardest part of the job is the various attitudes you come across on a daily basis."
good,"Very demanding I don't believe they pay you enough for the work out forth which makes it hard to have insurance, and you have to work to procure vacation time"
good,"If you're a recent graduate from high school or full time college student looking for a small job that isnt too demanding, then this is the job for you! If you are looking for a job to make a career and advance in then maybe choose a different job its a little difficult to advance in this company if you arent already an assistant manager. but it is a really upbeat environment and fast paced."
good,"Hectic, Always short staffed. Management was all over the place. Expected to work open to close shifts with no breaks and hardly ever a lunch. Customers are fine and can be fun but other then that not so much."
good,I had to do extreme remodel labor for two new stores just to prove my ability to work as a cashier. I was not to excited about wasting my time. But teamwork with my co-workers was pretty motivating.
good,I recommend it as a temporary Job. If you’re going to school it will work with your hours. Always make sure to speak up when you don’t understand something.
good,My typical day at work is assigned with weekly tasks to maintain a profitable store operation whether stocking merchandise or handling customer transactions. I've learned the idea of maintaining a productive business with the help of advice with managers experience. The workplace culture as a whole is very vibrant with many individuals with different backgrounds. The hardest part of the job is to ensure you keep up with the retail pace. The most enjoyable part of the job is the multiple activities and coworkers you meet.
good,"Limited staff and working hors,  Much work force falls onto management due to lack of staff and allotted hours.  So minter task falls on to management such as taking out garbage sweeping floors on top management duties"
good,A good job for a retail job.  Room for advancement and flexibility on hours and clean work environment.  Mostly female dominated job. Helpful but younger employees.  Middle range turn over rates.
good,"Its a layed back job until something goes wrong in the store."
good,"It's a ok job, could be better, too stressful. No security, too much loss at Family Dollar. There is always people stealing and no one there to protect the employeers"
good,Would not recommend as a work place with a future. Horrible hours and work every holidays. Often worked alone until 2nd shift arrived. Scolded for not getting things done when no help was available
good,"I enjoyed working there but the company has a bad"
good,This job takes a lot of dedication. Especially if you are in a management position. You as a manager have to be dedicated to the day to day  operations of the store. But it also takes a dedicated team.
good,"Honestly speaking, working at Family Dollar wasn't the most ideal role I wanted, but after being brought on and learning the ins-and-outs to the company and made me realize that working in retail just wasn't for me. However, in addition to coming to that realization, I also came to the conclusion that Family Dollar isn't ideal for anyone with my credentials for that matter. I was grossly underpaid, in my opinion, and underutilized. So, unless you don't have much work experience or are desperately needing a job, I wouldn't apply to work here."
good,manager favoritized other employees so much so that I chose to resign.overall it was an ok experience. I had familiarity with the customers because I lived in the area which helped as well
good,"the store was located in a questionable neighborhood so we had a lot of problems with theft, but were not allowed to confront any customers about shoplifting.  Truck days were rough as there was usually not enough staff on hand to help unload and shelve the product"
good,"The job can be fast-paced at times and very slow at other times. Most customers are nice people, but occasionally you have customers who shop lift, and some can be argumentative"
good,I learned how to manage very well. I have very good days working at family dollar. All the customers like me and tell me that I'm respectable. I learned how to establish myself and job stability.
good,"Job requires too much work for little pay even as a manager, sorry but the average family of 3-4 in the US cannot survive off this kind of pay. This is for highschool kids"
good,Family Dollar is a very successful company and it was my  a good experience to work with them I have learned a lot there.I have worked there just for four months but in these four months I really learned that how can we apply our knowledge in practical. I enjoyed these four months just because of the proper management and good working environment at Family Dollar
good,"For almost 6 year my typical day at work would be for me to clock in and take the bank deposit and get change for the day or weekend. Opening and closing the store with security and safety. I normally worked as the manager on duty, so when the store manager wasn't there, I was overseeing the store and employees. I scheduled employees around truck deliveries and helped unload up to 1,500 pieces on a single truck load in a day. Stocked and organized shelves under a limited amount of stocking time. Answered customer's questions or concerns. Ran the register, checked in vendors while working alone during day time shifts."
good,"was a hard job with many learning experiences,learning customers needs and helping them buy the right products , good experience with registers and cash handling deposits, petty cash, ect."
good,"I have an awesome team. I am lucky to have a great boss that fits my needs with my school schedule and sometimes on short notice. I have learned a lot as far as filing paperwork, doing invoices, checking vendors. Some of the hardest part is having the patience to deal with the customers. Also having to deal with shoplifters and a high turnover. It may be different in other areas but I live in a rough neighborhood."
good,Too much work for little pay.i worked over 40 hours and was considered part-time. I always stayed past my clock  out time. Never left on time as my schedule  is given.
good,The job was okay. It had good moments. There was a destination and goal however irrelevant forces took precedence resulting in not reaching the finish line.
good,"Pretty much laid back for a warehousing job, although everything is on production. Second favorite job I've ever had. I'd go back if I could. Just like any job you will have ""those days"" and some managers have ""their favorites"", but that's to be expected."
good,"There were constant changes made by the regional manager which meant as a store manager, I could never create consistency with my employees and customers.  The district manager at the time was great but stressed out and that trickled down to us store managers."
good,"There is a disconnect between an in store employee (ASM) and out side of store employees. This creates a lot of frustration and dysfunction at times. With that being said, the job can be rewarding at times. This happens most when you have a strong team in place in each store!"
good,"It is just like any other cashier job but they give you way too much to do for minimum wage (stocking, remodeling, cleaning, front and face and restocking on top of cashiering) The customers are often rude and impatient, the managers are often too busy working themselves to come help you."
good,"The job is fun because of the employees and some of the customers. I was a assistant manager, so i made sure everyone needs were met. The enviorment was not the best place to work.  Too many rehab people that came in and most were mean. I didnt have anything hard about that job."
good,It was a fun place to work at first but slowly went down hill.This is the first company i have ever worked for that needed 3 assistant mangers just for 1 store.
good,Great company to work for if you want to move up fast and build your resume. The work can be challenging but offers great experience in problem solving skills.
good,"upper management really pushed to save as much as possible, cut hours, and payroll which not only put alot of stress at store manager level but also made it difficult to provide customer service."
good,the most enjoyable part of the day would be talking to the customers. Good customer service is always important when running a business because that's what they remember the most.
good,They want you to do a lot of work for little hours and little pay. No breaks stuck at register for long periods at a time.............................
good,There is a lot for cleaning and restocking things. The truck with  merchandise comes to the store every single day. You will unload every day and restock the shelves.
good,"to this day family dollar stores still download their trucks by hand."
good,"the corporate was not too nice, there were a few terms and conditions that were either lied about or not brought up to us as their employees, the store  manager was very lazy us assistants and cashiers had to pick up the slack."
good,"A good and calm place to work.... Not heavy at all"
good,I hated this place I worked there in one area where I was safe and then I got moved to the middle of the hood and when I asked to move back I got fired this company is the worst and the district manager are completely unfair
good,"It really depends on the person.  If you dont mind being away from home and family alot, then its the job for you.  There is plenty of room for advancement. Thats a plus."
good,Its a fast pace job. I learned how to be more patient and understanding when it comes to our store. Management is fine until you start flagging on a register meaning when a customer wants to return an item under your numbers you get in trouble for that.
good,"Although I have enjoyed working for Family Dollar, there is no balance between work and family. I spend more time at my store than I do at home. I earn a nice paycheck every week but at the cost of spending time with my family."
good,Prepare to have 0 life if you are management. Unload a 800 piece truck. Recover all day. Skeleton crew and payroll very low. Pays well. Move up quickly.
good,Family dollar is a store I enjoy managing. The culture can be a high energy environment with a nice selection of varies merchandise and free style merchandising. Merchandising is a strong point for me and I enjoy having the floor space to be able to set the standard for the store. Unlike Dollar Express the schedule doesn't balance your work time with your personal life. I feel Managers where required to work unnecessary work hours.
good,"A typical day includes doing a lot of cleaning and stocking while being the only person on the register. Customer care is the top priority, but as with any large company, you are expected to take care of them and get all of your other duties done at once, even during a rush. I would not recommend working with this company."
good,Loved my job..had good  people I worked with. The store manager was a good manger. They could give more money to there assistant manager's they also could give more hours to there employees
good,"Scanning consumer items and handling money. Stock and cleaning responsibilities. Lackluster training, basically thrown to the wolves the day you start."
good,Company does not offer much payroll for managers to work with so most work is done by managers.   Company does offer benefits even if part time employees.
good,"it's very stressful and overbarring"
good,"I like the job, just wish I didn't have to pay so much for my insurance. It's a good place to advance in but nobody really gets any paid time off except for the store manager"
good,"Family dollar I did customer service, cashier, stock, and allocated store interior and exterior. "
good,Very hard work to say the least it usually were 2 men unloading 1500 piece truck or more which was difficult at time but co- workers with laughing & joking made it more enjoyable.
good,I loved my customers they made my job very fun as well as my co works.it was a home away from home. my team was more than just workers we were family. being a manager  was a very multitask job it challenge me daily and gave me hope for growth.
good,"Always dealing with customers rude nice you name it, never knew what you were going to get everyday. You stay very busy. Cashier's responsibilities are the front end of the store."
good,Responsible for cash handling as well as working with merchandise and customers.  Work schedule was always changed as workers don't show up and worked many double shifts on short or no notice. Managers were not constant and had various managers over few months.
good,"The management was constantly being replaced therefore it was disorganized. They don't have any employee discounts, or any  incentives. The staff is friendly but don't feel like there is much room for advancement."
good,Management's standards are too high and unrealistic.  Our former District Manager was very impersonal and didn't send stores help when the store was behind on stock.
good,"Scheduling was pretty workable far as working around your personal life. The biggest problem was when the big rush crowd comes in, you're basically at the register by yourself."
good,I feel like if im an asisstant and my boss go on vacation i should get paid more. Thats not a easy job and the benefits suck!!! No pto time or no paid maternity leave. The only good thing about this job is getting paid weekly.
good,"""The overall work experience in Family Dollar is relatively a positive one but along with many companies, higher management is always a disorganized mess. With no compassion towards any employee, they run rampant, dictating everything with an iron fist."
good,This was a very good part time job to work. They work with your schedule as much as possible. They were very friendly. The training was good and they taught me a lot.
good,"As a store associate at Family Dollar, I operated the cash register, and provided customer service, I enjoyed working a this employment, it was a fast past work environment that's why I enjoyed it"
good,"very busy i enjoyed the busy work, learned to stock shelve, ring a customer up, take payments, do returns,front face and recover, how to blow up balloons."
good,"Great people to work for an lots of business, stays busy all the time, time consuming, 30min breaks an easy clean up...great place to work nice and friendly people"
good,"as a cashier you were required to check out any customer, keep your drawer balanced maintain change and about $100 in the register any more had to be dropped into a money box. as well when there was no customer the cashier is responsible to stock all the shelves closest to the registers and loss prevention."
good,A day at work would consist of customer service I would work back stock and recovering merchandise. I learned how to make executive decisions that management would leave to me to handle. The hardest part of the job would be when the manager would leave me short handed to unload the truck of merchandise. The best part of the day is when it would be time to go home honestly.
good,"I loved my job, but when payroll gets cut your in the store by yourself until 2 o clock when your scheduled to get off at 430. no time to get work done."
good,The company is ok to work at! If you do not like to be physical and like being lazy do not apply for the job. Otherwise most of the people are really cool to work with. Keep the store up and you'll enjoy it.
good,um so far i have mixed feelings. some other love this job some absolutely hate it. it really depends on where you go. when i first started i loved my crew. everyone was so nice and i got along real well. i grew with hem too.
good,Its a good job to have got hrs for stockman the manager terin lazy it can be long term they need people you got to work at 6 in am on Tues
good,Very easy simple job. Management sucks. Wouldn't consider going back to work. Does not provide security assistance. Great pay as store manger.
good,Family Dollar was rude and didn't allow me to take off days in order to see my son when he was hurt. They didn't accept doctors notes. The store was always messy and the management was horrible
good,"The management will often say that they need you, but its a one way street as far as you needing them. The environment depends on the store your working at, but I liked the people that I had the chance to meet. the pay rate is bad... even the amount of weekly hours, but if another store has open shifts to offer... you can get your desired amount of hours. I bounced between 6 stores and they appreciate hard work."
good,"there's always something to do, because a truck comes every monday so majority of the week we are handling the truck. Due to low staff it takes longer then they would expect us to take."
good,Very family orientated as a customer service representative. A awesome job to work at while in college. Only negative about working there was they made me choose the job over my college education.
good,"Needs to come into the new milinium with management practices.  Very obvious some of management is prejudice towards women  and minorities."
good,"Very simply tasks and great customers , family dollar is a very stress free environment but still requires hard work. Simply tasks are appointed to you, hours are decent, manager pretty good with working with your schedule"
good,I really don't mind working here but its not just the place I want to be.. I need a job that I can make a living on. I just don't think there isn't any real incentive for me to stay here and there not much room for advancement
good,I Learned Management Skills And Gained Customer Service Skills. The Hardest Part Of The Job Was Not Having Enough Security And Employees In The Store At All Times.
good,I despised working there the staff were immature and petty. They complained to much about what they had to do to run the store as opposed to actually doing the work
good,"I learned how to talk to customers and be respectful while trying to help with their needs."
good,I worked for Family Dollar as both assistant manager and store manager. Very low pay and expensive benefits for hourly employees. As store manager the pay is good but the hours are endless.
good,"Working in summer was HOT. Early morning meeting was informative but time out would change and you couldn't make plans. Sometimes you might get off on time, others you would work 10 hours or more. Got crazy when Dollar Tree took over."
good,"I meet all kind of personalities which I enjoy. U just have to learn how to handle each one. It teaches you a lot of discipline. Interacting with my co workers and customers is the most enjoyable part of my job. I also learn a lot as far as merchandising, structure, finances,  and loss prevention. I love my job."
good,Good place to start your manager training. Not the best of benefits not great pay. Helps a little more with  organizational skills/ janitorial. Made deposits and counted ciggerets.
good,"The company is a good place to kick off a retail job, strongly recommend this if you have no experience in retail criteria."
good,"Great place to work great people learn alot everyone was fun to be around."
good,It's A Very Good Job For Someone Whose Fresh Into The Job World Circuit Like first time jobbers but to an experienced worker it's not an option that you should consider because family Dollar doesn't have any benefits no discounts or anything referring back to saying it's only good for a first time jobber just to gain experience of the work life
good,"Family dollar is okay for a first job only. Fast learning experience for retail store. Needs a lot of improvement, because no security low pay. But mangers are flexible on schedules."
good,I enjoyed my job here but I was moving to a different state and they do not have a family dollar here. my only problem I had was they only gave you enough labor to have two workers in the store at a time and that was including the manger. so we had a lo. of theft
good,"I worked here for a while right when I graduated from High school. It's a great place to work, however, the management refused to work around my schedule."
good,Great if you want to improve people skills also good for first time workers. Fast paced job so being energetic is a must. Lack security so there's sometimes theft. If you're not a team player this job is not for. The faster you learn the faster you get promoted.
good,"Working in retail you have your likes and dislikes. I worked as the Cashier, stock, maintenance, and freight and shipment. I did a lot that wasn't in my job description and it made me a better person and it totally change my outlook on the world of Retail."
good,No structure always cutting store hours so expect for weekly hrs to decrease.   There is no room to move up in a career as they have several in district that need to be demoted or let go. They don't fire you they force you to quit by cutting hrs where you cannot support yourself
good,"Not really a family oriented job. Working 52 a week with 3 kids is too much, but in order to get good pay you have to work it. I worked there for too long and didn't make enough until I got my Manager postion."
good,"It is a pretty good place to work.  People are nice.  Family Dollar does not have full time positions for non-management.  "
good,"Work is like non stop and if you like to be busy then this is the job for you, there were not enough hours for part time position but the management was good."
good,"The pay wasn't worth the responsibility. Work/life balance sucked too. Most stores I have seen are in bad areas too. Overall, I wouldn't even think about going back."
good,Its was ok cause I really needed a job to take care of my kid but the pay was horrible I had to cashier stock and unload the truck and the were only giving me minimum wage that was not good with my experience
good,Being a cashier at a dollar store is exactly how one could imagine. I grasped the concept of a large corporation and progressed my own skill sets within the customer service business.
good,"When we first opened this DC, Management was fully engaged.  We had awesome interaction with all aspects of the Production team.  All Departments worked well together for the ultimate goal of getting the place up and running.  Then the company got bought out and we became ""too busy to care""."
good,Working for Family Dollar for the past seven years has been a great experience I feel for myself though I need to be challenged in other areas and so I must move on from this company
good,"Worked in a environment understaffed, no breaks, management changed on a weekly basis. No raise, and no room for advancement. I did enjoy meeting new people and helping those customers."
good,"the store manager was one of the best people i have ever worked for but the company doesn't leave much room for advancement and do not give much in raises. "
good,"This corporation is fast paced and fun. FD gives opportunity for advancement. Job security is not always guaranteed, unless you are a hard dedicated worker. Most weeks are full, and leave little to no time for personal time."
good,"This is hard to meet production in the time allowed. It was really good for exercise, no need for a gym membership. The company makes it hard to move up."
good,"At Family Dollar I engaged with a lot of people daily. The hardest part of the job is taking care of the store duties and handling customers at the same time. It can be every inconvenient to do so on a very busy day, or on a holiday."
good,I really can't say much about this company as things have changed since I last worked there.  It was an ok company to work for.
good,"I really enjoyed being employed by Family Dollar , My team members were very supportive .My only concern was the supervising staff & the lack of unprofessionalism when it came to placing employers to job positions that were NOT ALREADY SECIFIED.I would recommend a MORE RESPECTFUL, PROFESSIONAL honest Supervision team. More so SUPERVISORS THATB TAKE PRIDE IN HELPING THOROUGHLY WITH THE TRAINING OF TEAM MEMBERS...Not in RUSH lacking in patience for their job.."
good,"The most enjoyable and sometimes the hardest part was the customers. The coworkers that had been there the longest were very close and you sometimes felt out of place. They made their job their life, which is not always a bad thing, but when you have a family and an emergency happens or something unexpected they are not willing to work around it."
good,"Alright place to work, just like any other retail store. Always moving, on your feet. Always opportunities to move up. Managers work with your schedule. I think the pay should be more."
good,"Family Dollar was my favorite job that I've had. I liked being able to provide people an affordable, well stocked place to shop. I found in my time with this company, that corporate is completely dethatched from their stores. All the higher ups care about is maximizing profit. While the front lines of the company are barely given the payroll budget to cover the hours of the store."
good,"team effort all the way, a lot to do all the time, never a slow moment there, most team members are part time so they do not get benefits which is one drawback to the company."
good,"Coworkers were fine and interesting, the store was disorganized, nothing was particularly difficult and i did learn how to stock, and organize my time when it came to solving problems. My only gripe was the constant changes of house with little notice."
good,"I had no training for my promotion and had to learn things as I went, but being the most senior manager at my first store, it wasn't good enough. But my old managers and district manager helped a lot, knowing the circumstances, and I did eventually feel comfortable and confident running a store."
good,"a good start off job for kids in high school or coming out of high school. learned a lot and got to experience the different type of work load, while i became an assistant manager"
good,"Chances for advacement are very high. There's a very easily path for advancement pay is okay, but not enough. Work/ilfe balance is pretty bad. Most holidays and weekends you have to work."
good,"working at family dollar its a steady job I just wish they pay more and offer more hours, no benefits for those who need it with families"
good,"Since the Dollar Tree buyout things seem to be getting worse, our hours are getting longer, workloads are getting heavier but payroll and our pay rates stay the same. Not the same company it was a year ago."
good,"Learned while working at Family Dollar:"
good,"Typical day starts at 7am until 10:30 pm"
good,"A typical work day at Family Dollar would be greeting and assisting customers, restocking shelves, receiving freight and practicing door to shelf with products. Family dollar is a manageable place to work, although pay is not a great as i would like it. The hardest part about working for Family Dollar is the budgeting; Myself or the assistant work 5 to 6 hours alone with close to 100 customers before there is another employee scheduled to work. The most I enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers and some of the customers."
good,"A typical day at work consists of gathering the truck load of the items that are in the aisle and unloading them until there is no longer any boxes. Everyday, walking around the whole store and seeing what is needed on the shelves, or looking on the floor of the aisles to pick up any trash that is on the floor. Then listening to customer complaints while keeping an eye on them while they shop. "
good,Although Family Dollar provided lots of work for me it was very hard to work for them. The years that I was there the store had 6 managers. As soon as my shift ended I constantly had to be called back in that is not a problem but it would have been nice to have a break once in awhile.
good,"I enjoyed being assistant manager for this company and I learned a lot from the experience. I wanted to be manager of the store since basically that Is what I was doing when we had no store manager. After running the store for several months, I was then told that I wasn't ""qualified "" to manage it yet had been doing it alone for months. I was basically done after that time. The DM was horrible to work with and didn't even know how to run the cash register yet wanted to be the one to explain all the in's and outs of running the register. HUH??"
good,"The company would be good if the store managers wasnt two-faced ,and the store managers are more childish than children .i didnt like it there at all"
good,I don't really have anything positive to say bout Family Dollar so I really don't want to type anything about this company.
good,"Overall it is not a bad company to work for. You know in advance what is up coming for projects for the week. I have learned alot more time management as you are alone for a majority of the day. "
good,I didn't enjoy working for this company as much after my first manager left to fix another store. Working for a female store manager  was not the best because she would have every employee come in after store hours to work off the clock when it wasn't company policy.
good,"* Customers are well if you treat them as such."
good,Working as a cashier I balanced transactions at the end of the day stocked merchandise. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new peers and working with others.
good,"A typical day was I greeted customers, cashed them out, helped with questions and stocked  specific areas of the store when I was not working with customers. The hardest part of the job was the dealing with the rude customers. The best part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,typical day at work was all around great I loved to interact wit customers management was not as expected tha hardest part of tha job was interacting with rude customers tha most enjoyable where the friendly customers
good,"Gained great experience in multiple positions within Family Dollar. The company is in constant growth and I am grateful for being part of that expansion. Each day provided new challenges and opportunities for development. Within my experience under inventory management, I continually learned the value of proactive communication and cross collaboration. As a manager, success was defined by investing in my team and seeing them succeed both in projects and position. Teaching total ownership in each position is the toughest part of my job. I enjoy collaboration with other disciplines within the company and learning from other peoples interest and passions."
good,"Most enjoyable part of work was interaction with my customers, and team members.  Meeting budget goals and exceeding sales expectations. "
good,"the typical day was very routine. i enjoyed when i got to do my job as described to me but when pulled away to cashier, i didnt enjoy it much.  not to mention it was a unsafe place to work. management was unorganized"
good,"An average day would entail me opening the store and proceeding to replenish store or do inventory on our merchandise."
good,"It was well organized, the managers ensured everyone had enough hours to work if not more. it was enjoyabe to work there."
good,like i said before job was decent just need a better job thats full time and has decent money im a great worker and great at learning things quickly always put 100% in my work
good,Its an o.k place to work. Hard to plan anything with the work schedule if you have kids. I think it all depends on the store manager because some are better than others.
good,great place to work but job not promised from today and tomorrow high theft environment and very high demands for pay but enjoy working with customers
good,"I had a great time working at Family Dollar. Everybody worked as a team and did what they were suppose to do. It was always a hectic day, always something to do a none stop day."
good,"This was my second home . i would always see our Regular customers everyday , the more i saw them the more we got to know eachother . this store is very affordable and customers were always satisfied at our store . great attitude and hard work  is what i like to see everyday at work."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers on a daily basis. I became close to the customers because everyone who shopped there lived in the nearby community.
good,"family dollar is a good company to start off a career."
good,"Hours are volatile and can vary from 30 to 50 hours a week. Company culture is very good compared to other similar environments, but the management team is inexperienced."
good,"poor management, its always hot the job it not that bad just poor managment....no agreement he isnt fair....he makes the job hard ...he ran the whole crew away...witch was a good cew im the only one standing...looking for better opprutunities"
good,A typical day at this job consist of dealing with returns. Helping guest find what they are looking for and also suggesting products. Checking customers out in a fast timely manner while also making sure their  needs are met and they are satisfied leaving the store. I also check in our vendors order stock and merchandise for the customers who have a special request. Cleaning the store daily and doing all the paperwork necessary. The hardest part of the job is having my schedule changed at least twice a week. My most enjoyable part of my job is communicating with my customers who are regulars and talking about what is going on in their lives at the time and offering help and advise and just being a listening ear for those who need it.
good,"Presenting products in store and managing operations profitably.                                                                                             Store associates deliver excellent customer service.                           Stopping store shrinkage with limited budgeted payroll hours.             "
good,"There is much to complain about and very little to respect. I find that the business itself is a great place to work, but the store manager is not a great person to work for."
good,I enjoyed the fast pace work environment. There is a lot to do to occupy time. There is a high turn over that can make schedules difficult.
good,Working stock is an everyday task as most items come in full cases.  I have learned to manage people better to accomplish all the tasks required.  The hardest part of the job is keeping good employees.
good,"Manage CSR's, Receive Truck and check in vendors, Handle voids and returns, handle customer and employee concerns, Run register, move merchandise from stock to shelf, open and closing paperwork, safe handling and bank runs, opening and closing store, keep a clean workspace, loss prevention such as watching for theft. The hardest part about the job was micro-managing lazy workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was completing tasks and knowing I'm the one who did that."
good,This is an ok starting job.  You can learn how to run a store and get the experience. Although they do not advance people on very often . You can also be overworked .
good,For the most part the job was decent. The customers and co-workers were great. The company is willing to promote workers from within the company. The was a wide range of personalities to see each day.
good,"training could of been better , the manager was a very nice person but as a manager not so much she expected us to move as fast as she did, didn't bother to properly train me dealt with all problems by ignoring them"
good,after clocking in i would wash up and check the line to see what was low. next i would check the drops and make sure there was replacements for whatever was low. then work on cold prep(which was any vegetable that stayed cold). finally i would take my place on the line and work through the lunch rush replacing items on the line as needed. finally after the rush was over i would restock the drop water and the cold cabinet. also i was in charge of receiving trucks and putting away supplies.
good,"This was just a job to meet financial needs, but I was thankful...My work days would consists of normal retail duties such as that of a cashier...The job was rocky at first, but at the end it became very gratifying (I met and helped a lot of people)...As I said on the onset I'm very grateful and thankful for the experience and would do it again!"
good,"great place to work ,they just cant work around my school schedule but over all a wonderful place to learn and to grow and to utilize the thing s that you learn"
good,The hardest part of the job was truck day when we received a ton of new shipment. There was never enough space for all the new product. Hours for employees would be cut often.
good,It was an ok job but the managers were not really there a lot. They also did not seem into there jobs and really were kind of rude to some of the customers. But I did get to be 3rd manager and a little of these problems ended.
good,"I had such a hard time working for Family Dollar. Constantly lied to, and always criticized even when something was done correctly."
good,"greeted costumers, rang up merchandise, handled certain costumer problems and concerns, told costumers to have a great day when leaving."
good,"Working for a local neighborhood Family Dollar store has had it's ups with the local customer, i have grown to learn and know alot of them on a personal level, as to what they need and want before they even come into the store, you really need to be a people person and always willing to listen to their needs. My mangers and I get along great. since i don't have any children I'm the one that mostly work all weekends plus the holidays, which that doesn't bother me, i try and make the best of anything and my managers sees that. family Dollar has a large turn over, because alot of people think this is a candy job and it's not. a job is the best and easiest if you allow it to be."
good,Store reset and all most wanted to do was sit around on their buts and not work.  When they did work they complained about it.  I was injured on the job and I was told to walk it off.  The management with this company was the worse I have ever seen
good,"Opening the store early morning sometimes staying there till closing because i was the only assistant manager working there with no manager for a month or 2. I learned how to do bank runs for change and deposit the end of day money from the safe, how to manage cashiers and stockers. Management was horrible at some points there was no management besides me as the assistant manager. My co-workers were mostly hard working but a couple were lazy and i had to stay onto of them their whole shift. The hardest part of the job was the very long hours which resulted in very little life outside of work. I don't believe there was an enjoyable part of working there!"
good,"If you like a fast paced job this is the place to be. The customers are great. "
good,"Not a bad workplace if you get along with your coworkers, Management seems to have unreasonable goals for store managers, makes for a stressful environment at times. Otherwise it is a stable workplace with some benefits for full time team members.You will do anything from operating a cash register to setting new schematics to unloading the truck weekly. Some days are very hectic and busy but others can be very slow indeed depending on customer flow in your location."
good,"Typical day at work for Family Dollar is open store, count till drawers make sure they are accurate, I learned that even though you get impolite customers you can not be impolite back to them. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when you catch someone shoplifting and have to confront them before they leave the store."
good,"Going to the bank, running a register, managing employees, I've learn to adjust to my circumstances. Love the people a lot"
good,This a very good job people who are trying to get a feel for where they want to go in life. But overall the company has very good promotional oppurtunities.
good,"Duties;"
good,I could not explain a typical day at work. There was not such a thing! I learned many thing that I wish not to put out here. Management is a whole different ball game. Co-workers were just that!
good,family Dollar use you for your aide and then send you on your way. Majority of the cashiers are lay and don't like to do their job.
good,"Accepting cash and credit card payments from customer’s."
good,You have several projects a day. Everyday is eventful and different. Can be stressful at time. Family Dollar is a good company to work for.
good,"Most employees get around 17 hours a week max. If you become a manager realize that the jobs that would be departmentalized in a big store are now all yours. You put up the prices, run the paperwork, make the deposits. And if your employees don't have enough hours you get to put the rest of the truck up. Plus put up displays and run the cash register. I do not recommend this place."
good,Family dollar was a busy workplace that always had something for you to do. Management was understanding and co-workers were easy to get along with.
good,"As an assistant manager the typical day was opening the store or closing the store, dealing with all customers, cash registers, merchandising, product ordering, unloading trucks and stocking.  End of day reports to include all banking."
good,"A typical day would be opening the store, counting petty, draw cash for cashiers, cleaning windows, and welcoming and helping every customer. Stocking store items constantly and doing deposits. Using my imagination whenever i could to promote store displays."
good,"I did learn many skills from the company, but middle management can be unfair sometimes."
good,"Co-workers were fine"
good,There are a few things I don't agree on as the company is ran or that the managers do and let some employees get away with. I learned a lot working there and I enjoyed it for the most part because I got to work with the community and help customers meet their needs. Most of my co-workers were great they worked hard to make sure the store was ran as best as possible. Other co-workers not so much. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the impossible to please customers.
good,"As a Store Manager you are responsible of every aspect of your store. Your are encouraged to run your store as if you own it. However, it is expected that you work 52 hours per week, minimum; nevertheless, you are encouraged to work no less than 60 hours a week to get your job done. You find yourself working so much because you are not given the resources to conduct business properly (such as payroll, staffing, etc.). So you find yourself doing the job of 5 people even though you're only 1 person."
good,Wish there was more opportunity The hours were horrible. I hope i find better luck at my next job.
good,family dollar was a good job to work at. flexible hours and greet co-workers.
good,"It is pretty much self-explanatory. I clock in and get prepared for whatever comes my way. My co-workers... I had a cashier that had an issue with authority figures but that settled down.. Besides that everyone was cooperative.. The hardest part,well the most annoying part, was the thieves.. Fixing money issues was annoying also but manageable."
good,"Fun because I worked with friends, we did are job. But we made it fun for the customer and ourselves."
good,"Its a hard job but anyone could do it. The job security is a joke. If you are competing to be the best you will be fine. You are fearing for your job on a weekly basis. Most enjoyable is the bond you make with some of the guys. Its a friendly environment, its still a horrible job."
good,A typical day in repack would be the morning meeting then working hard while working with people that always had something to complain about.
good,To start the day off we count the safe and get our register ready for our shift. Then we go over what work needs to be done and work on it. We all have to work together to make sure that everything gets done. The best part of the job would have to be the customers and taking care of them. It's a really good feeling when you have customers that come there just because your there.
good,Also a this job helping customers with item perchase orginzing the store sacking. I love working there also.
good,I liked my job. I was really good at it. Sorry they went out of business at my location.
good,"This was my Original employment with this company when i left my store i left a great group of girls fully trained to run the store,  I felt like I left a part of me there"
good,"My typical day at work, begins with asking the store manager of what to do.  By either continue to stock merchandise throughout the store, or to begin in unloading merchandise off of trucks; I would also be an assistance towards customers for if they need help with anything. "
good,"Opening the store I would get ready for customers."
good,"Family Dollar is a fun place to work at, my co-workers are amazing. it is always a good place to grow at."
good,"Assists with all store functions including scheduling, ordering freight, and all day-to-day store activities as directed."
good,"a typical day at work was to manage employers, delegate daily task of work , manage safe and cashier draw"
good,It's very easy too make management but the hours are very long for the little pay. Climate control is a problem you will freeze in the winter and burn up in the summer. Corporate wants you to put your life at risk to save their products
good,Family dollar was not a good working environment. We had management that made the regular employees do their job and try do our own tasks while they did nothing.
good,constant work on a dailey basis.L:earned diffrent aspects of different reports used to find shink.
good,"The work day for management consists of 12 to 15 hours of physical labor.You don't have a life outside of work because you are always at work.It's a learn as you go enviroment,little to none in training.I loved my employees and most of my customers."
good,"It was a great place to work til the end of my employment."
good,"Enjoyed assisting customers."
good,"A typical day at work your dealing with lots of different groups of customers, its a great job for learning communication skills and learning about retail. I'm in training at the moment for assistant manager.This I have learned, schematics, building en-caps, ordering funds for the store, catching shoplifters. My co-worker are very outgoing individuals, hard workers. The hardest part is trying to please every customer but I try my best to get a smile out of them.The most enjoyable part is learning to new things to get me closer to the position I'm trying to accomplish."
good,very busy to work for if u like retail this will be an idea place very people friendly
good,Come in fix all the shelfs..answer questions thursdays and sundays were truck days so we unloaded an loaded trucks an shelfs.sunday was by far the best day.
good,There were always things to do that never seemed to get done. The crew there didn't work together and there are always huge turnovers there.
good,"Typically I would arrive at work knowing that there was no cashier but me until 3 or 4PM. In the time I was alone in the store I would be expected to continue to put out stock, recover the store, set displays, watch suspected shoplifters, and provide a compelling place to shop for my customers. Because of the budget dwindling every quarter I was forced to get less and less done and hire fewer people. It has been very frustrating for not only me but also my co-workers. We are all professionals and want to see the store in the best shape possible but have not been able to do this because of the budgets. I love the customers and the way the store is set up. It fills a need in almost all communities that it is located. It could be so much more."
good,higher manager staff sucked but it was kind of stressful because Family Dollar try and save money so they cut hours leaving all the work up to the Assist Managers
good,Family Dollar was a very create learning experience. I got a chance to interact with many different personalities.
good,"While working at Family Dollar I had a lot of regular customers and they were great.  My original boss was flexible and worked with my schedule.  We had an employee who broke a lot of rules and was allowed to continue to work for the company.  That employee would not do anything while he was at work so that left a lot of work for myself and my two other supervisors.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with an upset customer after a while that seamed to get easier.  I did not see a lot of employee appreciation and their was no discount for employees, the company did not show a lot of employee appreciation especially for store managers who were expected work alone and over 50 hours a week."
good,Good work environment with customers but staff did not always work well together. Manager was not consistent in giving tasks to workers in a fair manner.
good,"to many immature workers, not enough people trying to get the job done and to many immature managers"
good,"A typical work day at Family Dollar consists of constantly greeting, helping, and cashiering for customers. As well as stocking shelves, make sure that customers don't steal stuff, and trying to get a full cart of products out within an hour all at the same time."
good,"Loved working with the customers, I love to meet new people. My co-workers were great, we got alone fine. But they keep changing Managers and they were not happy and made the work place miserable. Customers complained daily and it was a stressful environment."
good,"Unload trucks using palate jacks to move case fright, Assist customers locating specialty items, verify prices, check out items (operate POS system) for purchase and issue correct change."
good,not much to say. it was a seasonal job management was ok. a typical day at work involved handling cash transactions and cleaning the store at the end of the night
good,"i work here as a high school junior, you dont get a lot of hours and its basically a high school job"
good,family dollar a bad place to work! no kind of help or organization.
good,My manager as well as coworkers were fun to work with alll together.
good,"Open and close the store , making sure that all of the tills in the safe was correct, bank deposits, unloading truck and inventory count. Stock shelves, manage employee's, interact with customers to make sure that they find everything that they need, returns ,refunds and credits. I Learned How to Run the entire store with the proper training. I loved my co-workers that came in with out any supervision and got the job done, the hardest part of the job was trying to cover all shifts of employee's that did not show up for work and also the ones I had to terminate. The most enjoyable part of the job is that I love working with customers and It keep me bust through out the day so it went by quick"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in late because of the  slow computer system. Loaning in on the register, and start ringing up the customers items. Usually the managers would have me unload the u-boats while the store was slowing down, even when i had customers, so that means i had to ring a customer up, quickly run to unload the u-boats and keep going back and forth. I've learned a couple of things, such as using a cash register for the first time, learning how to maintain a store, how to exchange and return items, how to work under pressure with an angry customer. The management was below average, everyone loved working with me because i would complete their assigned tasks. My co-workers were nice to work with, i would be able to have a good conversation with them while working, they would help me on  bagging, etc. The hardest part of the job was when the lines would get too long and it was only me at the register. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing those upset customers leave with smiles on their faces."
good,"Cashiering, putting freight out and assit customers.  Merchandizing.  Assistant manager for three, then I moved here.  Co-workers got along. Nothing hard.  Customers were the most enjoyabl part of the job."
good,"It was an ok job. The only thing I did not like was the management. You did not get picked permanently for the job by your work ethics. You was only chosen if the manger liked you, (for whatever reason). Also the store was built in a poor area, where theft and burglary is at is highest! not to mention the low pay, even management positions get paid the same as cashier!"
good,"Giving great customer service"
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar was always staying busy. There was always work to be done no matter what day or what shift. It could be unloading the truck, putting out the freight, resetting schematics, or customer service. The co-workers become like family. The hardest part was the schedule. The hours are hard to work around if you have children. I mostly enjoyed the customers. You learn about so many people and become acquainted with them."
good,"A typical would be meeting friendly customers, ringing them up and stocking on down time. It was a very busy since the location was in a plaza. I learned about different products, and more experience with cash handling. My co-workers and mangers were nice to work with. The best part of working there was helping people and meeting new faces."
good,"I orderfilled cases either onto a conveyer or onto a cart everyday in a hot warehouse. I would sometimes go upstairs and be a Jammer for the day and fix cases that get stuck, which help up the flow of the shipping. I learned how to move consistently at a fast safe pace. To work alone for long periods of time and rely on myself to get the job done. To communicate with my co-workers better."
good,"I would open and close the store on my shifts. My job consists of stocking : food, clothes ,dog food, automotive stuff etc. I ran the register , handle the deposits. Help keep the store clean mopping , and cleaning of the restrooms."
good,"bad management. their was a lot of side choosing, assistant manager has more power then manager"
good,"Typical day was working with the customers and able to meet them make them smile or just help them find the smallest thing thro out the store . How to work in retail was my biggest take back from this job. Management changed alot some managers was nice and over willing to help others didnt care  enough about the employess or customers.Hardest part was leaving due to moving , worked with a good crew management had a few good hard working members , most enjoyable part was seeing happy customers leaving with smile on there face and enjoyed shopping at the store "
good,"I worked for family dollar for about three years. I started out as a cashier and moved up to assistant manager. It was alright for awhile but once I had to change my hours and step down my DM, was not understanding at all. He kept bringing up the fact that he had four kids and I only have one. He was not cooperative at all,  long story short I ended up quitting."
good,"a typical day at work is learn customer service, managing money, and stocking mechandise. the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet, greet and interact with new people daily."
good,I learned about placing merchandise strategically in an effort to attract customers. Management don't really provide much support or leadership. Co-workers lack ambition and motivation. The hardest part of the job is relying on management's help and support. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customer satisfaction and friendly interaction. A typical day can be somewhat boring and unappealing.
good,Just unloaded freight trucks and replenished the freight.
good," Working with the public is not a easy job, and thats what my job consisted of here. I had to deal with theft on a day to day. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, that was the most enjoyable part of the job. The job was not hard at all, and was just the pay was to low for me to stay."
good,"A typical day would be steady, stocking checking dates on items. Always greet the customer, provide assistance. One of the hardest parts of the job is dealing with unsatisifed customers."
good,"Family Dollar is a company with no plan, and no leadership. They have minimal profit margin and not enough payroll dollars to provide the customer service and well kept stores they promise investers."
good,"Your day was always different, had to unkload truck, stock, price changes and run register."
good,The company has good pay but the hours were horrible. I was working 60 for 52 hour pay. Over worked & under paid.
good,"Cashier and returns daily, Truck once a week to unload and stock inventory. Supportive environment"
good,The hardest part about this job was memorizing all the aisle for the products. Some of my enjoyable times was working the store real late and just memorizing and fixing products that needed to be stock by myself.
good,"While working for Family Dollar providing great customer service to not only customers but all around staff. Making sure the store is up to date changing label prints, schematics and pricing. One of the hardest jobs could be detaining merchandise from customers and keeping shoplifting out the store to have little shrink on budget."
good,I liked working here because I was able to interact with people from all walks of life whom shopped in my store. I learned that being as helpful and understanding as you can to a customer goes along way. In the end they will always be loyal to your business. Customer service is Key.
good,"I handled the cash register,and also kept store clean and organized."
good,"The most enjoyable parts of this job, are the customers and the constantly changing inventory. As long as you are willing to adapt to change this is a good place to work and learn."
good,Associates on hourly wages have limited time so management must work 24/7 to maintain a store.
good,"Worked alot of hours 70- 90+ a week. I worked for the company for almost 5 years. I go in some mornings at 6am put up stock, unload trucks,help on the register,check in vendors,made scedules,did deposit daily and took deposit to the bank."
good,"Expect the unecpected. Dealt with robbery and lots of shoplifting. Very unsafe place to work. Early morning stocking, cashiering, customer service. The worst part of the job was it was not safe at all and the most fun part were the customers. Cool people to work with."
good,very stressful it seemed like we could never do good enough for our DM
good,"I worked at Family Dollar for almost 5 years. I enjoyed my job and had a lot of fun doing it. My boss was the sweetest most caring person I think that I have ever met. She was an extremely hard worker and would often put more on herself then she needed. The job was medium paced (except for holidays). We would have to unload trucks, put our own stocks away and so on. For the amount of work we did we should have gotten more pay then what we got. The pay at Family Dollar was horrible. As an assistant manager i was only making anywhere from 7.75- 8.50. God forbid you needed to take a leave of absence such as a maternity leave. Your job isn't guaranteed for when you come back and you have to apply for short term disability 2 years before you can have the baby. Like most people really plan on their kids. This job is better for people who are just comming out of school or in college."
good,Great for beginners coming into retail. Needs to be a little more organized. You have to work everyday like it truck day.
good,"A typical day at work for me is usually fun and excited, the customers are pleasant and the people i work with are really nice. ive learned basic managment skills while being their, knowledge of having good customer service and knowledge of pricing and signage. Their isnt any hard part about my job and Family Dollar."
good,Overall it was a good place to work for. I'm just not sure why that don't have professional classes or workshops held for management. Most of them are very unprofessional. The company took away bonuses and the yearly raises were barely 3%.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Family Dollar. The customer were friendly, and responded nicely to me. I had issues with finding babysitting since I have three young children under the age of 10. Those issues cost me my employment..."
good,"Family Dollar demands a lot from managers, and for those with very flexible time schedules and total commitment to the job, it is a fast-paced and fun place to work."
good,"In the begining it was almost to good to be true. It was an enjoyable place to work and a very fair work envirement all the way around. A short time later however that all changed. The departments were all short handed so they were competing with eachother for the people they used, no one could get a day off, they started taking away needed benefits, and they were writing people up for wrong reasons."
good,family Dollar is a nice place to work.My day start with the store deposit run.Then I open the store. I greet every customer that come in that's important to me. My co-workers are nice and very upbeat and funny.I learned how to manager a store and the hardest thing about this position is truck day.We get from 500 to 900 boxes a week.My customers are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I learned much about the soft goods retail world with Family Dollar. Their approach to the very short life cycle soft lines merchandise has within their stores is interesting.It's a well oiled machine that sells and moves out the product. Their labor dollars are kept at a very low level, often coming into clash with cleanliness and security needs. It's a choice they openly make. FD supports their DM with acquit field merchandising materials, but not any dollars to maintain the physical structure or it surrounding grounds. Add to this leaky roofs and lack of modern security equipment and it presents a DM with several security challenges. The DM must rely of their people in place to be the eyes and ears 24/7. The relationship they build with their store teams is their only line of defense. It through working with these management teams and crews that I met some great people, who had much undeveloped talent and desire to improve and succeed. With proper direction, guidance and leadership, several of these people went on to enter management training in this organization or that of other companies."
good,"not the greatest, i hated this company, i did all the work and my bosses"
good,"A typical day at work I enjoyed helping out customers, suggestive selling on sales items, stocking the store, taking on new projects, stocking, and maintaining store clean."
good,Family dollar is a compelling place to work the average employee makes about 10.00hr (management) outside of store manager.
good,"There are multiple tasks that need to get done each day, which has helped me learn new ways for time management. I would have to say that the most enjoyable part of this job is learning new management skills that I will be able to take with me anywhere. I have learned quite a bit of information in a short time at this job and with the help of my manager and district manager, have learned that I have what it takes to manage others. The hardest part of this job has been the work/life balance. Being a single mother of a child just about to start pre-k, I've come to realize that the work schedule for this type of environment is not the most ideal nor realistic for someone in my situation."
good,"I would start the day off by opening the store I was the assistant manager there. I would set up all the drawers for the day. I learned how to do cycle count inventory, make deposits, set up end caps. The management alright they made sure the store was always clean and the customers were happy. The hardest part was the thieves recovering things they stole. The most enjoyable part of the day was making people smile."
good,"My scheduled day usually consist of cash handling, stocking merchandise and sometimes cleaning the floors. I learned to take my time when counting money. The manager were fair. The co-workers were team players. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irrate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers happy."
good,"Family Dollar makes you work to your limit, but the compensation is very little compared to the amount of work a Manager has to do and you never know when a gun might be pointed to your head."
good,"This was a great place to work the only thing that I did not like was when my store manager went out on leave they did not send a fill in and I had to work open to close, 7 days a week until they sent someone 6 weeks later."
good,"I was management for 10 yrs. A typical day for me was opening the store at 8am, by myself, and work till 3, by myself, and still have to get everything done. Don't get me wrong loved my job, just that do not pay enough for what i did for them."
good,"You would basically unload freight, stock shelves, deal with customers, ring register, recovery, clean, and help with team members."
good,The work load is considerably heavier then the compensation in pay. You will never see a 40hr wk. Assistants can not leave to take a break unless another manager is on duty. Many days I have not taken a break to eat or drink. The average employee at FD losses 20pds after the first three months.
good,Family Dollar was a great company to work for. The MAngement team needs improvement
good,Have to be available for them at all times. Distrct managers very rude.must be able to unload a truck in very little time.
good,"We did not have a schedule, I, as well as other employees had to call the day of to know if we were going to work later that day. I did not get off at the time I was told. The manager was very unorganized, and made me feel uncomfortable when working alone with him."
good,Family Dollars was a very fast paced hectic working enviornment. Very vigilent to customers concerns/complaints.
good,Scheduling was done by store manager and never out on time. Being assistant manager didnt work with my school schedule when I attempted going to college. Tried to step down and they quit scheduling me entirely
good,Overall nto the worst and not the best. They are no longer in business how ever if I had to do it all over again I would have left when they got bought out by the dollar tree team.
good,It was fun while it lasted the manger was very disrespectful and did not want to help me none seen i had a line to the back of the store you thought she helped nope and got mad my computer froze up on me❗️
good,Company is money hungry. They really don't care about you or ur wellbbeing. They don't allow light duty so basically if u hurt urself ur out of a job.
good,"Overall decent company to work for, employees are generally nice and energetic, customers are friendly and appreciative, mangers help guide you through day to day tasks."
good,"I worked on Northern so the job was interesting. I had regular customers that I really enjoyed, but the constant shoplifting made the job hard.  The management immediately above the store managers proved to be the most dishonest and sketchy people Ive ever worked for."
good,It’s a good job if your still on school but it’s not for anyone looking to get a bunch of hours or make a lot of money. But the work isn’t to hard the pay just doesn’t match
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to go to work have to do list on board do my duties make money and go home straight to my family what more else can I say
good,Es una empresa de oportunidades pero con muy baja cantidad de horas para laborar
good,90% women or gays / pay not near enough for what I did and warehouses are accidents waiting to happen constantly / unloading trucks a FN nightmare / how they HAVE not gone to the way DG does their trucks just dumbfounded me
good,currently short staffed but recruited new hires recently. Family Dollar is a great place to work and good with hours. you can ask for more flexible hours if you have school or kids to take to school. Coworkers are cooperative.
good,The only reason I left was it is not safe no security gets real bad holiday season cause of the stealing and robbing you don’t get any lunch breaks or rest you are under paid for the things they want you to do and I was pregnant and didn’t know and was sick and not eating for 8 to 10 hours smh
good,It was an nice place to work . I met some good friends through working there. I was there 6 years . I would recommend it as a decent job . Learned a lot from working there
good,Isn’t a good first time kind of job. If You don’t have retail experience it maybe a little difficult at first. Working hours are not consistent and you will work different times of the day. I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone who has smaller children and want to be at home later in the evening with them
good,"This is a decent environment but the overall company doesn't treat employees very well. Doesn't pay well for what the job entails and the raises are terrible, no benefits, etc. It's fairly well organized though and depending on your coworkers and the area you're located in it can be a somewhat enjoyable place to work."
good,"I was a cashier and I had to be able to talk to people. I had to restock items, clean, count money. I had to answer phone calls sign boards when new items come from to the store. My hardest part of the job was when I had to look out for people that was stealing. Other then that I was good and a great experience for me in rental"
good,I would say they just need the right staff and they would be a ok company to work for as a college student or single. I didnt like the fact that i had lots of paid time off but could never use it and if your sick you can't find people to come in for you.
good,"I find working for Family dollar, boring and mundane.  I would not recommend this job to anyone. There are far better retail jobs out there and I suggest you try a different company."
good,It was a okay place to work at. I enjoyed helping the customers. The hours were flexible. I worked part time. It definitely wouldn’t be a job that would pay all the bills.
good,I learned many different things . such as what it is like to be a store manager i learned to be more responsible . management was not great but it was acceptable . The hardest part of the job was dealing with thieves . Most enjoyable part of this job was the customer service and learning new things .
good,"Have to help customers "
good,"It's always a pleasure working at Family Dollar. Although, due to the pay rate and lack of employees I'm am looking to live better with a better salary. Overall, it's a good experience"
good,It's a nice part time job you get to meet many people sometimes it works hard the people are nice the management is cool they give you a certain amount of hours they can cut them or they can give you more schedule is always change day after day
good,"The work place itself is okay, the work isn't hard, but you really gotta be careful on which location you go to. My current manager didn't even have me finish my classes and she is giving me 1-2 days a week. And she expects me to work fast-pace, but how can I without working and learning the flow of the store? I love the company, but the manager at my store is awful."
good,I first worked at starke location. I loved it there!  but then my store closed and they moved me to a store in Gainesville with bad management and a dirty store. Since then I have been trying my best to clean this store while the management destroys everything I clean/. Family Dollar is a great place to work. Its this store that I would never recommend anyone to work here.
good,Benefits  are good. Management  training  was very disorganized.  Staff mostly friendly. Company located  in a bad area. We are located in a high crime area where drug dealers and addicts are constantly  standing in front of store.  We have been robbed 2 times since i have been there. We have no security.
good,"Customer service, daily projects on portal, place ads, open and close store, count down register, check in vendors, unload truck and stock shelves, answer customers questions and concerns, authorized returns and exchanges,"
good,"Always busy. "
good,"Working for Family Dollar has been an experience. It can be very fast paced, a little bit stressful and you have to sometimes deal with rude people. But it can be a fun job."
good,"After not being at family Dollar, store has gotten worse with store cleaninest, merchandise not put in right place, not organized and no appropriate greeting when customer walk in door or not being asked if need anything in particular...."
good,The people I work with are great and are like family. We take care of each other all the time. Store mangement is great but beyond that doesn't really seem reliabe.
good,I feel like being an assistant manager is just a title I feel like I’m a stocker with more responsibilities I cant make management decisions with out my boss under cutting me he make decisions on his off day from at home not allow the managers he out there to do there job only do what he ask u to do n
good,It's was okay I was pregnant so there was little to nothing for me to do. Just restock be a cashier. The manager that was there she was so nice she even paid the homeless to clean up
good,"On a daily basis you will have to deal with customers that are NASTY, rude, hateful, and just down right mean. If you cannot handle people being snarky, or you're just too shy, then I would advise you to not move up in the ladder."
good,"The store was mostly busy, but we were usually understaffed except for delivery days.  Most customers were respectful.  I found that treating customers with respect built that atmosphere.  Most employees were respectful, and 3 of the 6 managers were also.  We had shoplifting issues, and we had several robberies. I was never present during the robberies."
good,Love the work i do but the hours are long and the staffing is minimal. Only 100hrs a week to give out to employees and manager mandatory 52 a week but usually more. My DM is great but if there is an issue with the store its near impossible to get anything fixed.
good,I was in store management which we all know is stressful. Working for family dollar was a experience. It is fast paced so you have to quick on your feet.
good,Slow days drag and busy days are difficult because your the only cashier.. Also you need a manager to get cigarettes you can't and there usually no where to be found in the store
good,I love working there at my store we work great all team members  together. The store were I been for a year its closing  doors permanently  so I need a job
good,Family Dollar is a good place to work. The pay for an Assistant manager needs to be more than what it is. There also needs to be two people working at all times in the store and not just during the evening hours  or when a truck comes.
good,It was dangerous but they had strict hours which i really liked. You had 2 different shifts one in the morning and at night. Good for a first job to get experience.
good,Manual labor with production standards. Was given a timeframe to meet quota. Worked with wireless headsets. Was randomly checked to ensure correctness of work.
good,"I worked there for 3 1/2 years I learned a lot from managing money merchandising setting displays but overall the company Needs better communication between the staff and manager ,"
good,"it was an alright place to work but a lot of toxic people in management, too much infighting between differnet managers from different stores and too many good managers getting fired over the littlest things."
good,Didn't make as much as you should for the amount of work you do as an assistant manager. So my main consern was the pay or lack there of. Too much working off the clock to try and fix your store because you arent given enough hours to do so
good,"I work there for 5+years I learn a lot, helping customer, receiving. Just nees to be careful when you work with others. Some they don't work. Being lazy and helpful. It's like you have to do it yourself."
good,Working at family Dollar has taught me how to better incorporate my people skills and allowed me to push myself to succeed in my district. Also the work hours helped me balance school and etc.
good,I have personally had no good interactions with upper level management. Company has ever rising expectations while cutting employees and hours as sharply as possible.
good,Management was great and worked with me when I needed time off for various reasons. The hours sucked at times. Overall I enjoyed my time at Family Dollar.
good,the jobs is fun and manageable so far. All the employs were kind and generous with the tips and examples they showed me to be able to complete the task before me.
good,"company could do better for its employees safety. you are required to work by yourself when you open til your relief arrives, youget treated as if you dont know what you are doing in you job, even though you have been doing it almost as long as you have been alive."
good,"At Family Dollar, you're the cashier, janitor, stocker, and the floor sales employee. I actually enjoyed the stocking part of the job. It became stressful at times due to there being so many responsibilities at once with little help from coworkers. I think the worst parts were my coworkers, the stress, and the people from my town that came into the store. If you don't live in DeMotte, you might have better luck with the customers. My managers while I worked there were great; they were very helpful and friendly. They were always willing to help you if you had any questions. In my opinion, there should be employees for each job rather than one for all of them. I feel like the store would run much smoother, however, they'd have to pay more employees. Which of course is the last thing they'd want to do. I'd only recommend working here as a last resort or if you needed something fast and temporary. Also a good place to get some experience under your belt if needed."
good,Family dollar was an okay place to work besides scares of being robbed it was fun working there. Got to meet new people daily I would just recommend working day shift if so
good,Managers are not paid well for the hours worked. Salaried managers are required to cover shifts because their time is not compensated after 52hrs. Never enough staff on the premises making the euro environment unsafe.
good,They are great in deciding to promote from within. They are fair and equal with opportunities giving to those employeed. Great place to obtain skills for any job.
good,"The customers were great! Especially the regulars. I liked working there but the General manager was lazy! She was always on her cell phone or outside smoking cigarettes! She took advantage of her assistant managers! Store #9218 is really busy and your day goes by fast. Nobody wanted to clean, restrooms were extremely dirty, trash inside and outside of the building was always piled up. Break room was always dirty. Microwave was gross, there was mold in the coffee maker, parking lot had trash everywhere. I was the only one who cared enough to try and keep everything in order during my shift. A person can only take so much I finally just quit."
good,they have a lot of work to do in terms of leadership. the hardest part of the job is having to be cashier and putting up merchandise of the shelves and all of it has to be done before the end of your shift. do the go backs and clean up the area before leaving.
good,"lot of work for little pay."
good,"I started the position as an assistant store manager. I would often close the store or open it. Make sure my safe is accounted for, make sure my scheduled employees are in on time. Complete all task on task sheet. Check emails and comply with emails, put up sale ads and take them down when they are supposed to. I loved the job overall the store manager however was not so hot."
good,"Enjoyed the work and people, only down fall was having to work 50-70 hours a week as a store manager. didn't get a day off for 6 months when I was trying to run 2 stores at that time to try and help my DM get through a rough spot. Got good bonuses for my inventories though too."
good,"The job in itself is easy. The problem is favoritism, certain employees get away with everything, while others make the smallest mistake and get in trouble for it. If you ask the DM for help, you won’t get it. You don’t get paid enough for the work you do. This all depends on your store manager, but most of them are the same, they just care about their paycheck. They let you work full time hours, but only leave you part time so they don’t have to give you the full time benefits."
good,"Depending on the time of month it is either fast-paced or really slow. If there are more than 4 cashiers or Assistant managers, you will not get a lot of hours per week because ASM and Mangers get priority. as a Cashier you will be standing for a while depending on the rush of customers. It is a chil job if you have a good team of coworkers. Every store is different, so it depends on the manager honestly."
good,I was trained to be a cashier's but den started training for manager position I handle money and kept da shelves stocked and clean the store and I got to meet ppl
good,"Loved the work environment & loved the customers. But, the schedule was always a mess & was always made last minute. I was also left alone for 8 plus hours in the store with no break, almost everyday."
good,Job allows you to feel a sense of accomplishment when done right but tools to do job right are sometimes not provided. Staffing problems including quality of help to complete job are a huge problem. Overall responsibility of all aspects of job require the ability to be flexible and patient. Have to overcome obstacles daily as things do not always happen when scheduled. Good job at teaching things from a fixturing and merchandising perspective. Job seemed to get more difficult after Dollar Tree buyout of Family Dollar as differing points of view seemed to create vague communication to the field as to what was expected and direction company was headed. There is still a sense of two banners not totally united within the department which causes resentment and frustration in the field. Enjoyable people to work with and build lasting relationships with.
good,Overall a good company. They need to have more people working in the stores if they need to turn-around the company. The place has some great people and managers. Perks are almost none or minimal.
good,i learn a lot of different things as a cashier met a lot of nice people build my confidence from my customer service experiment. i was able to keep myself busy
good,I enjoyed working customer service for this company but the treatment of the mangers was unbearable. There was never any help when u needed it. Sometimes I worked 16-17 hours a day. I never was at home only to sleep.
good,show up to work at 5 a.m. Help unload the truck then start to restock shelves in the store also in the back of the store. helping with customer serves and check out items for the customers
good,Family dollar is a good place to work for younger people or someone just looking for extra money it doesn't pay enough to live off unless your the manager and those jobs are few. But the environment is friendly and overall a good place to work.
good,"Due to our location; we were busy most of time.  I enjoyed working with the customers and providing suggestions as requested."
good,"I worked as a cashier here for 10 months. The local management is good, regional management leaves a lot to be desired. They run a skeleton crew at every store, 4-6 workers TOTAL. 1 to 2 on shift at a time. Hard place to be."
good,"Working for Family Dollar had its moments. It definitely taught me a lot about managing employees. The company had a huge turnover rate. (I myself survived two entire store cleanings, where everyone was fired, including the GM) Thanks to Family Dollar I am a strong manager with many different employee handling skills. Loss went down 2% from average shortly after I started there. Family dollar taught me to be great at time management and diligence."
good,Typical day included a pretty laid back job environment the store was very community oriented. Fair hours and wages. Open to hiring within and outside into management roles
good,"You create your own flow while working there, and if you're lucky, you'll have great coworkers to converse with while stocking the shelves. "
good,"a decent job as far as a retail store is,not extremely busy,laid back,but dollartree needs to change there policies with what amount of hours that they give their employees.Alot of business but store really never looked good.To keep up having the store looking good,i feel all pt employees should get a minimum of 30 hours."
good,Nothing to tell its s great for students attending school the people you meet are great and friendly and i like helping people with concerns & questions
good,Family Dollar was okay.  The management sucked terribly. The turnover rate was crazy.  we couldn't keep employees for some reason.  But overall if the company had benefits for their employee it could possibly be a nice place
good,"For most of your day, the task will be individual. A cashier is to ring up the customers, greet and assist customers, and make sure that the store is in acceptable manner. The only thing to be conscious of always is the time. There is always many things to be done in a store where things are constantly in motion so time management is key."
good,Good pay hard work manager not so well but it's ok place to work at. You get 2 15 min breaks a 30 mins lunch. I think the increment wold be alot better in it was more staffed
good,Family Dollar overall is an okay company to work for. Just feel like the company can be more family oriented. Employees need more time to spend with family.
good,Poor Management Team - Company works too many Saturdays without any comp. days. Benefits are horrible. -----------------------------------------------
good,"The culture is laid back and that can be good and bad. If you trying to do work, though, its bad. But there is all kinds of opportunity to shine because of the melon-collie atmosphere."
good,"I have learned a lot at Family Dollar but these has changed since Dollar Tree bought us three years ago . We are undergoing relocations, layoff a the moments ."
good,"We were not allowed to work overtime, and a lot of our efforts were deemed not good enough even though most, if not all managers, works about 10-14 hours a day and busted our butts to make our stores up to par with what we thought was the correct way. Our management team was not proficient in any means. There was disagreements that lead to gossiping and even lead to lying."
good,"Great start off job to learn communication skills and customer service skills."
good,"dealing with customers, employee issues,and other circumstances that are out of your control  upper mgmt does give enough hrs to get the job done in most stores"
good,"I loved my job, I just wished that they gave more positive feedback instead of always finding the negative. More encouragement and training hands on is needed."
good,"The job was exemplary of a retail environment.  This job is better for younger people who want to gain retail experience on a smaller scale before larger volume stores.  Overall, I would work there again, if not for changed career goals and the need for a larger salary."
good,Simple work place to start as a first job easy to learn how to cashier stock up the store. A decent coworkers to work with. Only problem is it depends on the area you work in.
good,"A typical day was like everyday except on truck day, slow but always busy. I learned how to deal with mixed emotions with other individuals. Their really wasn't anything to really enjoy there besides certain people I was on shift with."
good,Working there was totally different from another place would say it a great second job to have enough time for you to have a life and still provides a great service to the community
good,"Love the work. Just too much exterior tension inside the interior of the workplace. Fast paced in the stockroom and to prioritize merchandise. "
good,"A good summer job for someone out of college and looking for some money, not a long term job that you should invest in, not enough benefits at all. Not a good job for someone who has a family to support to be honest."
good,"I have learned that if you are not part of the clique of managers you will soon find your way out,. Always having to look over my shoulder or constantly listen to everything i was doing wrong when other store were worse than mine and still kept their jobs."
good,not making enough money to support a family without help from other people or going and working another full time job. everybody needs the skills required from this place
good,"This job is very faced paced after you ramp up from training. If you fall behind repeatedly, you will be acknowledged of this by your higher ups and eventually moved to a different position. Once you show you can make high production rates, you are expected to do so every day."
good,Enjoyed working here the pay was not bad hours were long had to do double shifts on weekends didnt have extra help during truck days had to work cashier and stock
good,"Daily balancing, phone orders, weekly merchandise delivery with unloading and placement in store.  Long hours with small amount of manager training. District manager always available."
good,"I have to work a mandatory 52 hours minimum every week. I am often times the only person in my store working freight each week. I am the only person who resets schematics and end caps. Not that I'm complaining about the work, just that I feel like I work harder than I am paid for."
good,Could have been worse. Hours were decent but inconsistent. Upper management were unprofessional at times and customer employee relations needs to improve.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of receiving products from various venders, pushing that product onto the sales floor, and maintaining a clean and safe working environment.  It also required the scheduling and management of several personnel throughout the day. The hardest part of the job was working 12-16 hour shifts 6 days a week, and not being provided with the resources (hours allotted for additional workers) needed to be successful in the work place."
good,"overall company is a growing experience. treat management unfairly on daily basis. expect to work 6 days a week at a minimum of 50 hours a week. if employees don't show up district manager does not offer any help for them to solve issues. becomes the sole responsibility of the store manager to cover. so store managers are working 80 plus hours a week. they will promote whomever they can just for coverage, which is not a good business move for the stores or the company. when expectations of an assistant manager are higher than the district manager there is a problem. Always made excuses for everyone but never wanted any excuses. showed favoritism on promotions."
good,I learned a lot from family dollar abou being a manager. I learned how to be assertive but not rude or vulgar. The manager that trained me was great and very helpful.
good,Upper management does not care about employees. Not enough payroll to run the stores. Salaries managers are expected to make up for lack of payroll. Cashiers and assistants do not make enough money for the amount of work they are expected to do. When you go to upper management about problems within the store they don’t listen or really care what’s going on.
good,"too much expected with not enough resources. working well over 55hrs with not enough labor hours, but still expected to perform at max and surpass expectations at that"
good,Label boxes and place on the conveyer belt or stack on pallets to ship to stores. The hardest part of the job is keeping up your work rate. The most enjoyable thing about the job is the people you work with.
good,When I started at the company we were given goals and had a fair amount of freedom in achieving goals.  I was permitted to be very entrepreneurial in running a business. I learned a lot about product development and sourcing. I was exposed to extensive global travel and was very successful. With changes in management and processes the culture became more controlled and rigid. It became more difficult to achieve goals and not an enjoyable place to work.
good,It was an ok job to have didn't really care for the manger at the time it was a pretty busy store not a lot of workers would I go back yes and no but its a jb
good,"I was working an average of seventy hours a week and only got one day off a week.  Every day, I was alone in the store for at least three hours.  It was unsafe and no security.  Unfortunately, some customers knew that and would come in and steal merchandise because I would be on the register and could not be on the floor.  I worked at four different locations and always had to clean up the store they sent me to manage.  After I got the store where it needed to be and increased sales, they would send me to another store to tix it too."
good,I use to love my job but as i see the favouritism im not with that. The rules should apply and be the same for all. Management doesn't know how to treat or take care of their employees.
good,It's a nice place to work especially for older people looking for extra money. Mostly offering part-time at times they lack employees so you can possibly work full-time if needed.
good,"My first time applying for jobs in was hired as asst.manager I worked closely with the store manager I was learning the daily paper work that needed to be done. I was learning to oversee and work closely with the employee's, learning to open and close store without manager present. But the job became dangerous to my health"
good,Dollar General like any other place has it pros and cons. its a place where you know you can go to work but not place to advance and grow.  I would recommend t for first time job seekers
good,I was a cashire at familly dollar in jaffrey nh. I really.liked my job. I love the ppl i worked with anc i didnt want to leave but have baby sitting issues. I liked working with my boss....hes a really nice guy. I loved working with the assistant managers the most. I however do feel abd think that the comapy its self need to be understanding of there employees and the issues that may come up and i think that 9 an hour to start for nh needs to change. I am a single mother of 3 kids and i can afford to support my self on that let alone me kids. Also. In the winter the store was freezing...because we couldnt turn the heat up past 65 i think it was and in the summer its soo hot. The ac and heat are controled out of GA as i was told and it just dosnt help the working environment there. If the heat was turned up that would be great. But overall i really liked working there. But again the starting pay really needs to be raised to at least 15 an hour... And thats even gonna be a struggle.
good,"I worked for this company for over almost two years, and I realized that their motto is the customer over all meant that your work meant nothing and employees are  disposable."
good,"Enjoyed the work I performed at Family Dollar and the employees in which I supervised.  Customer satisfaction was our #1 priority. Workflow was constant and never-ending. Keeping our store stocked,  clean and in an orderly manner was another one of our top priorities."
good,It was a preety good job to work. The people were nice and easy to get along with. The days went by pretty fast because there is always something to do. No just standing around which is nice.
good,It a good company but the company change there minds so many times that it hard to be manager there and they expect to much out of one person and the hours not that great
good,Family Dollar for the Non-managerial positions consists of a very high turn around work environment. Employees tend to last for atleast six months. Its great if you need temporary employment. Do not plan on staying long term.
good,"Family dollar is ok, I am just ready to explore something different, it’s a bit challenging but all you have to do is be a great leader, the turn over rate is really bad"
good,"Being a cashier at family dollar isn’t a hard job by any means, when I worked there it was under different management. The manager they have now seems to be a lot more into her job."
good,Family Dollar is a good place to work for everyone ranging from no experience to highly experienced. As a Store Manager its my desire to create a friendly and pleasant working / learning environment because I see everyone as potential leaders needing only the chance to succeed and I want to help you do that.
good,job was good management was horrible. very high school.  a lot of gossip. good hours. but management was very rude and not a team player at all.would return  with different management is ever in the area again.
good,Family dollar store is a nice place to work the staff all came together to make the job easier. Breaks was giving at a decent time. The overs job is pretty cool
good,Working at family dollar was busy most days. I learned good customer service and i learned how to be patient with the customers.  My work place was peaceful most times but I did have some customers that had problems with the store.
good,Not the best company I would say. But it's a job. Management is kinda bad based on my experience the job performance is poor. Funds are always short t
good,Store Managers need to stay consistent. More staff meetings should be enforced in order to keep the store running on one accord. Interacting with different people helps to build strong character.
good,"I enjoy working at Family Dollar.  It is fasted paced. Can be very stressful. People can be very rude to you, while others can be very nice and polite."
good,Executive leadership is rough to specific members of employees.  Hard place to move up for specific people.  Corporate company doesn't allow specific backgrounds to go through on applicants but at times is not consistent in HR practices.  They do have employees with backgrounds.  That seems unfair.
good,They expect a lot for a little.  You have to multi task and get a lot done.  You can get a lot of hours if you work at multiple locations but no over time
good,Everyday is relatively the same. At first it may be overwhelming but eventually you get use to the responsibilities. The best part about working there is the experience in customer and cash handling skills.
good,It was a pleasure working for the company.management is poor but overall the job was fair.when I do decide to go back to the company ; it would be a different district
good,job is for someone in school who needs income I don't recommend this job for people trying to raise a family if so u will definitely need a second job the pay is too low
good,A typical day in Family dollar consisted of greeting customers creating a well welcome environment to shop in. Through this process I've learn to become a quick cashier check-out and all about inventory count. I've learned to work as a leader to make sure that our store meet certain inventory goals and well kept clean. I can say it was a fast environment to work in and that is what I enjoyed the most. My favorite part about working with Family dollar was the different store competitions we had.
good,"On a typical work day, I would perform effective customer svc, maintain cleanliness of the facility as well as making sure all shelved product was had proper front facing for customers to shop efficiently. During my time as a manager at Family Dollar, I've learned to stay professional at all times.  Management: Management is a title of unity.  Within mgmt., you have to mold/enhance your employees work ethics to match the corporations regulations.  The work place culture at Family Dollar was a fun work environment as well as an environment to enhance you customer svc skills.  The hardest part of my job was the report systems, unloading the truck of products and maintaining a reliable staff members.  The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new products, meetings, and challenges of store to store sells."
good,I loved my job here but there is a lot of issues this company as a whole needs to work on. I enjoyed being a part of it but doesn't follow labor laws and doesn't treat employees with respect.
good,They are just very poor in overall collaborative working methods from the top to the bottom. They lack in actual people understanding even when it comes to the End customer.
good,"it's ok as an first job for a teenager, but no a career. the pay is very low and the management was very unprofessional. The only good thing is we got paid every week."
good,I guess it was the store I choose to work for so it was slow only time it was busy was around holiday times. The area was a lot of older people. The store was very clean I kept it clean and it was well organized I made sure it was just boring because of the lack of customers because of the area
good,the job was great the money was great but the issue was the lack of man hours we were always alone and expected to do 16 hours of work in a 8 hour shift by our selves because of how short staffed we always are.
good,"Pay is average, customers are great, management is poor. Very physical, no time for social life, mom life. Hours are Random, no set plan, hard to schedule appointments."
good,"I have been with the company for some time I started in 2015 till now......I feel under payed for things that I do....I would like to move up in the company as assistant manager but they don’t think I’m good enough.....I think I would be I have great customer service, I’m really good with people... I follow directions, I do what I’m told....always on time, never called off & I get over looked....."
good,"Nice, clean and friend environment and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is thinking about pursuing this line of work. Great team to be apart of."
good,Family Dollar is a place where you get the training and skill to be a good manger or co-worker and you move on to something else but its not a bad place its just ok.
good,"Great customers love to interact with people so it's fun,the pay wasn't that great but it was good management experience,i don't approve of the way those types of stores are ran,overall good experience."
good,"Is really a job to help build your resume.The job can help you build skills with customer service, cash experience, loss prevention depending on the area."
good,"As a store manager there was no support from our district manager ... Everything fell on the store managers shoulders."
good,"Coworkers are really easy to work with. The customers and assistant managers tend to be a bit rude at times but that's retail, overall it wasn't a bad job. I worked at a Family Dollar that was always packed with not enough registers open so that was something I didn't like about the job and I was ALWAYS at main register because everyone hated doing it"
good,There was a lot of work for the store manager. The hardest part of the job was clearing the back room of all the product that comes on the weekly truck.
good,Ok business manageable working environment. The days go by fast. Hardest part is night when it's time to close. Management really didn't know how to run the business.
good,Work 9 to 14 hours a day and often 60+ hours a week - often 8 hours with no other employees there.  Spending so much time on register made it difficult to get other duties done. I enjoyed getting to know our regular customers and also training and coaching employees.
good,Go in two hours before store opens take care of paper work from the night before. Go to the bank drop off deposit and pick up change order. Go back to the store set up cash register. The hardest part of the job was having only myself and one other person on the job all day
good,"overall family dollar is a great place to work for a single, no children"
good,I worked at the company when it was Family dollar and before it was bought out by Dollar tree so I can't comment on the culture and experience of what it is like working at Dollar Tree.
good,"Don't Work here , boring , poor management , unfair treatment . Very fast paced and hard to work . Must be intent at all times and watching everything and everybody"
good,"I would have to make sure the store was well organized which it was one of the most organized stores I knew of, I had to count my $$ drawer before each shift and after each shift. Directed customers to areas they asked for."
good,As a Store manager you receive bonuses monthly for implementing
good,I was excited with my first manager position.  I did what it took to make my job successfully but the DM was not helpful and made the job stressful all the time.
good,"run register and work stock as well as assist customers and staff."
good,Work at your own pace. Learn time management. You can be one on one with the customer. Quiet environment. Good neighborhood customers make friends quick
good,The job was not hard. I didn't like that sometimes my days would be long and other times they would be short so my hours would vary. I also did not like that you got paid based on the truck. Some days you may not have but one truck and that's no money.
good,"The salary employee store manager had set hours worked 52 plus a week and was in charge of all the employees.hiring, Ordering, truck, customer service"
good,"working at family dollar was ok, the neighborhood was very bad and sketchy. there were no safeguards in place for employees,no security. but overall it was a good job its just that the manager would steal and try and blame an employee."
good,An ok job for maybe somebody that's still in high school hours wasn't to good but pay was horrible for what was asked of you management didnt seem to know what it tok to make store great
good,You do not want to work here.  This company does not give you many hours to work with.  They are unethical and take too many liability risks.  They have unrealistic expectations for management.
good,This company expects you to stock and cashier at the same time. They supply very little help to get the job done. There are times that only two people are working and other times that a manger may work by themselves for at least 5 hours . A full time worker is never guaranteed 40 hours or sometimes not even 30. They expect a person to survive on very little pay.
good,Family Dollar is a nice friendly atmosphere and company. But at times it can get overwhelming if your not level headed. But it's a bittersweet opportunity to work for this company
good,"I only work at family dollar part time because I was Pregnant. Overall, family dollar is not a good place to work because of the lack of security and it has a high loss prevention rate for theft."
good,Train and developing of new on boarding Managers and Assistant Managers. Take each through daily routines of Family Dollar. Review proper SOP's of daily operations of store.
good,"As a cashier/asst manager, the job wasn't terribly difficult except for unloading trucks and such.  Customers tend to be a lower class of customer, but considering the very nater of the company, that was to be expected"
good,"A good job to start off with, but plan to advance elsewhere. Great co- worker. Customer sometimes get hassle and threatening co-workers.Great place to learn about retail."
good,I had always like this store until I worked there and the experience on the most part was okay however the general manner need to be out back in place
good,I liked working there is was a fun place to work. The manager that I had was very fair and fun to be around. I leaned a lot from working there. I just left because I had a child
good,I liked the job just relocated at the time being .manger was OK no problem with him .loved my co-workers and also job was only part-time we were just clearing outvone store and putting another one together they were relocating from where the other location was.
good,Every day was mostly fun. It was the most non stressful job ive ever had. The days went quick and my manager was super cool and would work with you on scheduling so you could do the things you wanted outside of work.
good,"Good job for young adults. Hectic work environment with minimal supervision. Expectations are ridiculous and impossible to attain. District manager stops in, barks orders and leaves. Just a stressful place without any positive reinforcements."
good,I learned how to work in stressful situations. But overall I had to deal with customers that were very combative & were threating you if you said something about them stealing merchandise. This company needs to protect its workers.
good,"Learned how to check inventory ,stock store with señor device on them the most enjoyable part of the job was to work with the customers who could not find what they was looking for."
good,As a cashier at family dollar I had to deal with thieves and rude customers a regular basis. It was hard to enjoy my day while feeling unsafe. I the employees I worked with were not very hard working but they did what they had to do to get the job done.
good,I worked about 60-70 hour a week at 52 hour pay. A lot of the day I was the only one in the store which made it hard to get all I wanted done. My district manager was not always there for the managers.
good,not to bad of a job to work temp until you find better yes you could advance as long as you do your job customer service meet a lot of new people ....
good,"Family Dollar is a productive and fun workplace. The key is giving your customers great customer service, while keeping your merchandise up to par. Keeping this up will boost sales and your customers will want to come back for more merchandise."
good,"Family Dollar was not a very good experience for me. The company as a whole is very organized and runs a very good line of business."
good,We always had to stay busy we couldn't  slack off. Management always  doing there job. Hardest part was trying pick up heavy objects. I'm short so it was difficult for me
good,"When you finish your first year, consider getting another job because it can get really bad after awhile. Some stores are different than the one i work in, but to be honest just get another job after your first year. If you are looking for experience, not a stable job."
good,Working here was just something to help out the local store I shop at and I had to skills that could be exercised in between my shifts as a truck driver.
good,there should be an option as to whether or not i want to do these stupid surveys... work is work and I'm just trying to find a job. this is freaking dumb.
good,"Working for Family Dollar was one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had. There is no good work/life balance. Being a manager it meant you worked alone most of the time. The turnover rate for this company is really high due to long or short hours, depending on your position and low pay."
good,"I opened the store most days working alone for several hours. I learned how to problem solve on my own a lot, which can be a good thing.  I also knew how to do all of the job responsibilities in the store.  My boss was not very encouraging. He liked to threaten to write you up if you couldn't complete his list instead of trouble shooting with you, which for me meant long hours.  The hardest part of  the job was never feeling you did enough.  The best part was helping the customers."
good,"this job sucks, the pay is terrible, most of the time it's just you in the store they expects ONE (1)  person  to unload a full truck while running the register, and stocking and restocking shelves. No need for a gym membership, one because you won't be able to afford it working here and two because you will leave drenched in sweat everyday."
good,"you just do not stand at the register.  You are cleaning, stocking and "
good,Company overall has changed for the worst when it merged with dollar tree. I also feel like they under pay the store manager as well as the assistants
good,Open/ close store. Daily paperwork and deposits. Change order. Unload weekly trucks. Put up freight in a timely manor. Recovery of store nightly.  Sweep and mop. Complete project manager sent to our store via email. Stay under alotted  payroll.
good,"Overall, an OK place to work. Co-workers were great, as well as the customers. The job requires much more than what the workers are paid. The management is overworked and have to deal with too much stress."
good,"There is not a lot to say negative about this company. At times the management can be promoted too quickly, but for the most part, generally a good place to work for."
good,Typical day on the register assisting customers while fixing stock nearby or fixing stock and assisting customers. Hardest part of the job would be picking up on a co-worker's job who did not show up.
good,I lost my job because my medications made me sick and I could not tolerate heat.the aircondition in the store did not work and i had to bring my own fan to work.
good,The company was a alright company to work for. However they seem to not really care about our well -being. If you got hurt they still expect you to come in.
good,"Great place to grow in your career. I was able to move up from stock worker to assistant manager in about 1 year. However, there is always a line with over 10 people."
good,"A good place to work, especially weekly pay. The ability to move up is slow do to the volume of the stores in the district i worked for. Overall a pretty good job."
good,Very physical job.  I have learned a lot about the culture in an urban market.  The hardest part of the job is managing the inventory in a high theft area.  Robberies and scams are far too common.  Management turnover is high and heavily impacts results of the store and teams in the stores.
good,"Most of the time when working between upper management changes the experience working will change drastically."
good,"A typical day at work as an Assistant Manager will either have you opening the store by yourself for five hours while attempting to get work done while also ringing up customers on the register, or at night you will be working stock from the back room while responding to pages from your cashier to override their register for various things such as loading money cards, processing returns and exchanges, or handling difficult customers who don't know how to read."
good,great manager. got a new manager and he had to turn the entire place around. I got to meet new people day in and day out. family dollar is a great convenient place to shop.
good,Family dollar is a great store to work at to meet new people.  It is a hard job to manage with a family when you are the manager.  The hardest part of the job was making sure that I tried to meet budget for all the work that needed to be done.
good,I really enjoyed working with family dollar and if I receive the opprotunity to work there again I would gladly. I love the vibe cooperate give us and I would recommend all to apply and gain the experience.
good,"If you just want a part time job as a cashier family dollar isn't a bad place to work.  You will stay busy and the store's problems are not yours to deal with.  If your looking for management or advancement potential it is definatly there.  But as a manager you are expected to do EVERYTHING.  You are HR you are Payroll you are hiring you are shipping and recieving you are front end you are stock position EVERYTHING.  "
good,"The people were great and fun to work with, but the hours I worked for the pay I received made the job less than desirable. Also, the benefits package was great, but they took most of my paycheck for it, so I would see roughly $400 for base pay, then after everything came out, I would have barely over $100 for the week."
good,Come in 30 mins early to an hour to open the store make sure the safe and the registers money is correct before you open the doors. Once that's done open the doors where you greet customers and assist them with anything they may need help with make sure the cashiers is doing what they need to be done by them if a truck come in that day you have to check in the truck while making sure your cashiers are straight and your customers make sure your stock workers are putting product on the shelves. as in closing the store you do the same as opening but at night make sure the safe and the registers are straight and the stock workers put up they u boats and clean the store before you clock out.
good,typical day would be doing stock and running register.   WE stock most of the  time and  do store recovery  as well as  run register and help customers
good,"I honestly think the District managers should communicate with all employees on some terms just to hear other inputs ,because the store manager is just gonna make themselves look good and there the ones who are taking and setting everyone else up for failure."
good,"Delivery days could get hectic but the customers always made it worth it. To be able to help someone else and see them smile gives a great pleasure. "
good,First job and wasn't really a good experience. First time cashier and it was great had rough customers but learned how to dealt with them by being calm and knew what to say the next time it would occurred. Small environment but either way was a learning experience.
good,On a normal work day i come in at 5 pm and everything is usually nice and calm. I clock in and start my shift i usually start behind the register taking all customers.
good,"It wasn't that bad at family dollar but that a jib for someone who is independent no children or someone without to many responsibilities , the pay is minimum"
good,"Family dollar is a fast and ever changing  moving environment. In order to be successful, you have to be committed and have great work ethic. This is a job where is not for everyone even though anyone can there."
good,Need to have more than one person in the store at all times. Workers cannot get things done if they constantly have run back and forth to the register. It is not safe to be alone in these stores now a days.
good,"A typical day at work for me is running merchandise and juggling making overrides, returns, refunds, watching the camera, dealing with customers complaints, giving breaks out, answering the phone, checking out vendors, and making sure everyone has put up enough inventory for the day....And of course end of day, start of day, making sure store is cleaned at closing correctly."
good,"the experience with the  employee  was amazing to learn new think about the experience and was hand on it took a lot of work and hard heavy items / product that you have put in each line where the product is but then when you get done with truck ,"
good,"An extremely challenging environment with low pay, minimal benefits, and high turnover. A great place to have a first job and get some experience to kick off a management or retail management career."
good,Loved working here due to the amazing repeat customers. Management could use a little work. Manager is great. Both Asst managers butt heads a lot though and it can get annoying.
good,"My experience with Family Dollar and their employees was very satisfying. The branch that I worked for was very organized making it easy to work on a daily basis. A typical day at work was just like any other day, smiling faces walking in and out the door every day gave my job a purpose. I am very appreciative of the opportunity that I was given to witness first hand making customers satisfied as they leave our store. The family Dollar family take their job very seriously and do their very best to make sure they give the best costumer service possible every single day, and I am proud to say I was once part of that team and still do my best to help people every day. Working at Family Dollar was a big unregrettable step in my life."
good,"The hours aren't bad, but it's really time consuming work. Not to mention, that it's very boring work. I didn't have a great experience with Family Dollar."
good,"Great place if you like fast paced work and hard labor.  I was assistant manager and I think I worked harder than the cashiers. Very rewarding as far as work is concerned, but the pay is lousy and the upper management could really care less about anybody underneath them let alone their customers. So even though time goes by fast, it's not a place for someone that has experience in the real world managing people.  They lack common sense and lack of respect for others around them.  I would not recommend some of the stores to work at but then again, if you have a good manager that knows what they are doing, then it wouldn't be half as bad.  I do have to say that the training manager was by far the best. She knew what she was doing and she ran a tight ship. She should be the district manager"
good,Was ok boss was descent to us hours for full time was around 30 hours per week truck days though we're on call at times advancement is very fast but turn over rate is very high with this company. They start at min wage and you go up from there. Salary for managers is descent although a store manager has to work 52 per week and work 6 days per week most of he time it's well over 52 hours.
good,"overall its ok , its not the best but its not the worst . i believe they still have work to do on the structure of operation on how the work day flows."
good,no culture or structure but could be financially beneficial. The time I worked there Family Dollar was hiring anyone to fill store locations and this was when they were getting robbed continuously.
good,I've enjoyed my time while at Family Dollar and have learned a great deal.  The people are amazing and drive for results.  The culture is positive.
good,"cash out customers helped, was a light atmosphere with a great boss. everyday was something different. from the people, or the products we would get in"
good,A typical day at work is when i come in. I work as the cashier for two hours alone in the store. I have learned how to be a leader in the job though. Management doesn't really reward you for your hard work and dedication. Have not gotten a raise in over four years of working there. The enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people.
good,"Family Dollar is a nice company to work for. They are fair and respectable. A typical work day includes stocking shelves, interacting with customers, and answering any emails set forth by the DSM."
good,"I absolutely love my job, my co workers and the majority of my customers.  It can be very challenging at times, as if I need four of myself.  That is when I know that I need to take a deep breath.  Patience is something you have to have when working in retail.  The most difficult part of working in management here is, if you're not careful it will consume your life.  It is extremely rewarding when you travel to other stores and your customers follow."
good,I did enjoy adding to my skill set. I was able to learn marketing and how to set a schematic. There was a lot of physical work which I was not made aware of.
good,"As an assistant manager:"
good,"Working at Family Dollar made me realize how much more I wanted out off life. The job required more than the company was wiling to give and was not flexible. However, the people I meet and relationships I built made the job enjoyable."
good,"My experience with Family Dollar was okay. Poor management from the higher people. Turnover rate was really high. Family dollar does not care about it's worker the more you do they weren't satisfied. One person had to do 7 different job or more. Our job was always held over our head,because of this the stress level was huge. The pay was horrible for all the work you had to do and the long hours If you have more than one child.this job isn't for you. I quit my job because of personal reason and my new boss was a trouble maker. I haven't worked since I quit my job. I'm not looking for management jobs anymore. The stress you have to go through isn't worth the headache and low pay.If you're not a manager you only work part time ranging from 19-25 hours a week. You can not pay bills with that. I had no trouble with co workers under me..everyone got alone until we got a new boss..There was opportunities to advance. I worked as a cashier for 6 months and became an ASM..so the fact that there are chances to advance was Awesome!"
good,I really enjoyed going into work and meeting with new and old costumers. Putting a smile on the costumers face and knowing that i have met their needs makes me feel great at the end of a long day.
good,"If you come in and do your work thinking that you will not be invovled in the office foolishness guess again, Some supervisors and managers need continuous training."
good,For the most part the days are quite relaxed as long as there are no emergency situations that arise in your particular dept. The co-workers are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is having too much on your plate to actually be as productive as one desires. The most enjoyable part of working for Family Dollar are the people you work with.
good,Busy busy job always on your feet . i learned alot of things how they wanted to front face the store how to return items closing and opening store .management isnt so bad everyone works hard . co workers are great work together as a team to get the job done . the hardest part of my job was to handle customers and when they didnt want to purchace the item . the enjoyable thing there is when everyone has a smile on their face and working hard .
good,"Days at work were majority relaxing but yet hard working. Everyone knew what to expect coming in to work. All of my co workers got along for the most part, if there was a problem i never affected ones work"
good,"1. My typical day at work usually is tough dealing with the public and making customers happy "
good,I started as cashier and worked my way to store manager. I worked hard to grow within the company. And reached my goals. I handled the day to day operations and executed the company goals.
good,"Working together as a team , helping out the customers guiding them to what they are looking for.  Being polite, always keep a smile on your face. Clean up a hazard spill as soon as possible so that nobody gets hurt."
good,Easy place to work but no support and corporate keeps changing direction on decisions. If you don't mind staying in one place and constantly doing the same thing and can handle a lack of support from corporate staff not a bad job.
good,"I was blessed to have an amazing manager and district manager to work with who made the job more bearable while I was there. The problem is corporate and their inability to see or fix the problems that cause this not to be a great place to work. The work is tiresome, repetitive and the hours are bad, not to mention and ever changing schedule. If you have good mangers and good coworkers you can make the job a great place to get experience in the work force and in customer service, but this not a place to look at for a career or long term work."
good,"A typical day at work is draining. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on in this work environment. I never got the chance to advance in the company because I was not a ""yes"" man. My work speaks for itself, I would come in early and stay late if asked but yet there would be people who just started at the job move up before me. Certain managers are very helpful while others abuse their authority. There is nothing really hard about the job, mot of the work is fairly easy. The co-workers there are enjoyable and we help one another when needed."
good,It isn't that bad so far. I'm currently the only cashier. I'd like to hope I can move up in this company but I don't know how that's going to go. I work hard but there always seems to be something that goes wrong.Yes I've had my days where if was tough to take care of something but that's from being tired.
good,Its ok when people show up for work other then that your doing everyones job. A lot of the store get robbed and nobody wants to work. Customers are rude and employees dont care.
good,Hard job with little balance between home and work life. Most co-workers are great and work hard to get the job done.Can get a lot of help from next level of management but the Corp. office can be slow to help out
good,Work with staff and store inventory.  Cashier and assited Store manager in daily duties.  It was challenging maintaining a clean store due to the constant flow of customers.
good,Working for Family Dollar was okay ... had a lot of good times working there and made a lot of connections with amazing customers
good,"It was a great place to work,you are just over worked & under paid."
good,"A typical day at work for me would consist of:"
good,"your over worked and underpaid 80% of the time. your very rarely appericated. and they keep a tight budget where your there for about 4 or 5 hour alone. not very many enjoy parts of the job. it would probably be stocking shelves is the most enjoyable thing to do. Hardest part of job is doing everything by my self. and not being able to move up in the company,"
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work but there company is very sneaky and you have to watch yourself because they will accuse you of everthing
good,I didn't have ample opportunity to really get very comfortable with this position being a temporary employee. My transportation was not as reliable as I would have wanted it to be considering that it was a 45 min to an hour drive 7pm-7am. It was a little tough to balance work and an at home lifestyle balance having a one year old at the time.
good,The company was going through a drastic change with being brought out by another company which did not secure any ones position. Overall the store need more employees to help serve the public in a good capacity.
good,"Long hours left alone working due to budget cuts"
good,"Ive learned a lot from my employment at Family Dollar,i am grateful for everything they have given me.i will miss all the great customers and even more thre great low prices"
good,"I like the job just  looking for a job with higher pay "
good,"Family Dollar customer service representatives meet and greet customers, assist in sales, and answer questions about products and services."
good,"Basic Retail Management duties which include but not limited to the daily function of customer services, employees daily work function and schedules, inventory and etc."
good,learned a lot about the retail business and enjoyed learning to help customers. I loved to learn how to unload the freight and merchandise all the product.
good,"Opportunity to work in Corporate America. Gained experienced in package design, branding, style guides, teaching, directing,"
good,Working for this company opened my eyes to how a family dollar that just open stocks its product. I saw a company start from the ground up.
good,the store was always busy but the location was not safe at all. they did not have many hours available so it did not benefit me much. also it is not easy to get promoted and there was favoritism.
good,"The company needs to be more understanding of emergencies that employees may have and assist them with coverage. The company also needs to provide the store managers with extra payroll in order to run a store instead of over working their employees,"
good,when i worked there the manager seemed more into finding who he can relate with more than actually doing work. dude would go around talking Spanish and the first person that wold respond would be his best friend.
good,"A work day would be concerned with completing projects based on planeogram "
good,Typical day at Family dollar would be completing transactions for customers and to stock the store. While also maintaining a clean store. Management was strict to work for and to have help with customers. Hardest part of the job would be to tell customers they did not have enough money to cover the food they were purchasing to feed their families.
good,"I believe it is a great job for young adults or people just getting into the workforce unless you are a manager, but overall not a bad part time job."
good,"i enjoy working there, the shift im on has a great group to work with,"
good,I learned invaluable information and skills while working at Family Dollar. I also learned that sometimes even hard work doesn't mean your job is secure.
good,"Was informed at the beginning of shift about tasks at  hand,designated tasks if out of norm. Enjoyed my work when we all were able to work together and stay busy,i was fortunate to be part of a great team.Will miss the job and especially the people i was only their a short time best group i have ever worked with.Management cared and i believe in the business of it all cared."
good,"They cut payroll constantly expect the maximum amount of work,whilst management works 50-80% of the day alone trying to put our merch while also doing projects from the project manager resets freshness checks and other clerical tasks all while dealing with customers."
good,"A typical day at work i would go in for 7:30 open the computer system. Then i would go through the computer log, i would count  the safe along with the cashier drawers, i would get my cashier set up with a drawer as well as myself. i would unload the truck every Monday. i can check in vendors, put up stock, clean the store, and assist customers on a daily basis. I loved the people i worked with. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers."
good,Work afternoon shift. Management is very selective. the family dollar i worked for had mostly friends and relatives working there. There was only one cashier (me) all other were assistant managers or manager. Co workers were very clique like mentality. Hardest part of job dealing with management and favoritism. Most enjoyable part was seeing the happy customer that i had served.
good,"Cash and Sales Audit consists of daily checking the stores cash receipts with actual bank deposits, and making adjustments/edits to make all numbers align. Work is assigned by regions, and typically auditors are assigned anywhere from 3-4 regions, which roughly equal 1000+ stores across the United States. As an auditor, in addition to the what is listed above, you also are in charge of identifying and reporting any known cash shortages immediately to Loss Prevention for investigation."
good,"Re-stocking shelves, running the cash register, unloading a weekly truck, handling phone cards, dealing with vendors on a weekly basis, etc..."
good,"days at work were easy"
good,Nice job to work at but the management could have been better. SA typical day at family dollar was ok at time but you had to deal with problems and there was times I did not feel safe. My coworkers were very nice and good to work with. the hardest apart the job was dealing with the mangers over me.
good,"Primary responsibilities include setting employee schedules, delegating work, hiring and training new employees, stocking shelves, balancing registers, bank deposits, daily inventory, and ensuring superb customer satisfaction."
good,"Due to the nature of this retail business. Upper management thought it best to use think of employees as a controllable expense even at the cost of good customer service. Managers had to run the store at times as if it was a "" one man team"". This is a retail business that kept a lot of busy work such as resets, weekly sales, manager specials etc. Operations such as logistics and overall day to day demands for the most part was done by a skeleton crew. Many errors were made due to poor staffing and allowable man hours. Alot of dirty politics between employees and also in middle to upper management. This company was not a joy to work for."
good,This company does not care about its employees and it's hard to get enough hours to actually make a decent living unless you are in management.
good,"I moved up that ladder at this company. I will do cash register to cleaning bathrooms. Store manager unload trucks, do ordering and assign job for the employees to do. I have done job fairs on my own to hiring and firing people. I try to train to make a person better at there job then losing. I love the creative part of my job. I love doing MDS. The hardest part of this job is not falling behind. If you stay on top of things its not a bad job at all."
good,"To me it is a job, its not a job I'm necessarily happy with due to my pay and the lack of benefits. I believe the management at this specific establishment could be more professional, but that's just my opinion."
good,"This job was a good experience while it lasted, but i gained nothing from working there. I did however, love the management."
good,I ended up quitting because I felt like they were mad at me for being put on bedrest for my pregnancy. After I had my daughter they wouldn't put me on the schedule even after asking multiple times.
good,Days insisted of many tasks to be completed which you have to know how to prioritize and delegate in order to achieve daily tasks. You had to be capable of knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each of your employees in order to help them achieve their goals for further advancement. Communication was a big thing so everyone knows what is going on. Upper management was sometimes difficult to get things done that would need to be done.
good,A typical day is when I went in opened cleaned register and rung out customers at register. As an assistant manager was not great in the middle of my training my store manager quit. I had to hurry up and learn in 2 days because no one was there to open. The associates were nice and work was okay. But hours were not being evenly divided among managers. I didn't get benefits it was okay for fast learning management training course.
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar distribution center consisted of a fast paced constant work style and work load. What I learned is to work more constantly and consistently in any situation. Management was fair and seemed to be genuinely concerned in the employees and the employees' input. The co-workers had differences of opinion some did not always want work at a high level to achieve our goal for that day, and they also had a lot of negative attitudes."
good,"enjoyed working with customers, with work place being under staffed it made it hard to break down truck load in 24 hrs. Otherwise got along with co-workers"
good,"Typical day at Family dollar consist  of a 10-15 hour shift, managing a team of 10 people, being able to delegate my time in a properly manner to make sure that not only is the store effectively running, also to attend the needs of the customers, checking in vendors, able to multi task in putting up freight, closing store projects. Attending to the needs of the associates, helping with Voided transactions, returns. Working in a safely matter to make sure that all the proper procedures at the job are taken in effect on a daily bases. Working other stores to help them out in the event that they are short handed of staff."
good,It's hard to keep an eye on the door when you are so busy stocking the store and only one person is handling the register.  Most days there is no time for the employees to take breaks.
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work for someone who always wants to stay busy and moving around. It is a good place to meet new people each and everday. If you love assisting others and making their shopping experience a little easier then you must work at Family Dollar.
good,"cash handling stocking shelves,taking care of customers , interacting with customers. cleaning and stocking and or setting planograms."
good,"Family Dollar is a great place to work, with lots of opportunity for advancement. Training programs for individuals promoting are top notch. Security and safety are highly rated, and an emphasis on building strong teams that provide excellent customer service are priority."
good,Overall good experience in retail sales. I appreciate the opportunity I enjoy retail sales jobs. They could take better care of their employees who devote a lot of time.
good,"it gets very busy but its a wonderful atmosphere, the customers are very nice and patient when were short of staff as well everyone treated each other as family"
good,..They are ok for a first job. The pay was minimal and the work plentiful. On a typical day the store was understaffed.My tenure was very short lived. I did gain experience in the work field.
good,"Its a OK job hours was a OK , real flexible about my schedule. Lot of favoritism. Co- workers was OK to get along with the most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks. Very low volume store was slow most of the time"
good,A day when the dialer goes down. You to look though different paperwork that everyone on your team has did reports on and still try to collect making sure you are not calling to someone to early if they are in a different time zone.Also make sure you are not calling someone that was just call earlier that day.
good,A Company that likes to promote within. Good pay. In at 630am alone in store until about 12pm then stocking cleaning until 7pm if lucky to leave. Love dealing with customers the best thing about the job was helping others.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of many different functions, at first from pulling orders for the stores, to working in Quality control.  I had great department managers, but the overall center  managers were not so great.  Met a lot of great people in the years I worked there. The hardest part of the job was being overlooked for promotions.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet different people from all walks of life."
good,My work consisted of helping customers find products and checking their items out at the cash register. Upselling products in our promotions and make sure my area was clean and look presentable.
good,"Cash handling, Inventory stock, Store Recovery and Morning and evening duties (Cleaning). leading customers to merchandise, assisting with returns, questions,help,etc. Credit transactions"
good,It ok to work there but you have to stand for longs hours if you like that and then you have to do 3 or 4 things at one time. And you would have to stock shelves and fix or put back merchaise that is left behind by customers.
good,Fast paced always busy. Had very many different rolls you filled. not enough associates to cover store shifts. Nice products good quality
good,Coworkers are wonderful. Enjoyable Customers. Overall Good work environment. Always being sure to stay busy and happy with all work that is required from me.
good,It was Ok. Management was ok. The co Workers were great to be around. The hardest part was Closing. Best part was getting pad every week
good,"they expect 1,000 pick or more per day which you almost have to run to accomplish it."
good,"Upon arriving for a shift at work a daily deposit from the previous day had to be driven to the bank.  Procedure following was to open the store system and registers. It was also necessary to stage Uboats of stock to be worked while providing Customer Service and cashiering duties at the unlocking of the store doors for business.  These prior duties were performed within one half hour according to estimated payroll time."
good,I was unable to have a consistent number of hours and believe my departure was not fair.
good,"Hours are hard to come by. I have to work two to three stores to get reasonable hours. Some days, I have to drive up to 30 minutes to get to a store. The people are hard working and are very nice, but the job is very time consuming for very little salary."
good,"At the time I worked with an awesome team of people and equally amazing manager. We often had get-togethers after work hours to blow off steam and I was fortunate enough to stay with the company long enough to get to know the customers. Looking back at that year now, I think it was great compared to the things I have to deal with despite all the drama and bad days at work."
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced. I learned how to stock items as well as operating a cash register. I also assisted with returns. Management was okay, but could have been more productive. Co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was when our staff was limited, which meant there was an excessive workload. The most enjoyable part of the day is when we stocked product."
good,Working for Family dollar allowed me to utilize my customer service and problem management skills.
good,"Working with the Family Dollar company is one of the progressive jobs I've ever had. A typical day at work would be me on the register and hard tagging the clothes we received on our Sunday delivery. From my previous jobs I've learned a lot so coming into Family Dollar everything was pretty much already known. The managers and the rest of my team are pretty awesome. We all share the same interest we know how to have fun and be focused on our work to accomplish our everyday goals. When it comes to the hardest part of the job i believe it would be processing the freight from the truck. Its a lot of work and the company expects the unloading of a truck to be done in  2.5 hours with only two people (you and someone else), knowing that these trucks can be up to 1500 pieces or more. But the most enjoyable part is knowing that its all love in the store and nobody want to fail, so we work together as a team and we take care of each other like a family."
good,Fast paced workplace.People seem to get hurt alot.The jobs keeps me busy I always find work to do after my production time.
good,"Long days, hectic schedule, very enjoyable with right staff"
good,Pretty simple work day stock inventory and maitain the cleanliness of the store and greet  and check customers out at register.
good,"Family Dollar can be a fun place to work. Being in management however, has it's ups and downs. It's salary pay for  hours a week. During holidays such as Christmas when you work over it doesnt change."
good,The daily routine was much in tact not really changes throughout the day. Mostly servicing customers and stocking shelves.
good,"A typical day at family dollar in peekskill starts as I open the store.  My second and third steps would be to count the safe and the register in that order, then proceed to either pack-out or replenishment the store.  A mid-day routine routine would include shematics and replenishment.  I would then end the day by bringing all of the clearance merchandise from outside of the store to the inside.  I'd continue on by allowing my cooworker to count out her draw in preparation for the closing of the store.  Then I'd count the cigarettes then document the figure on the computer datatbase.  The very last thing I'd do is count the safe and my register as I did in the opening procedure."
good,Family Dollar Stores are great for people with good customer service.  Management were fair and employees are easy to get along with. This store happened to be in a dangerous area.
good,"Responsible for overseeing the entire store operations, Balance cash drawer and petty cash management, established deposits, Maintained appropriate cash limits, Perform cash management, customer service, Keep a record of excess or less cash at the end of shift, Manage total store level operations, including staff hiring, training, evaluation and work schedules, Handle budget planning and tracking, accounting and payroll, Coordinate inventory control, receiving; merchandising (plan-o-grams) and store maintenance, Worked with store managers to ensure merchandise changes aligned with sales patterns, Worked directly with vendors to confirm and verify shipments, Managed all aspects of merchandising, window displays, and stocking, Ensured excellence in customer service and resolved all problems at the store level."
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar depends on what shift I have. If I'm working in the morning I'm using either doing stock or ringing up customers. If I'm working in the evenings, sometimes I'm doing stock but most of the time I'm organizing the shelves (or recovering) and ringing up customers also and at the end of the night I have to make sure the front of the store is neat and clean. What I've learned working at Family Dollar is how to interact better with customers and and handle myself better in stressful situations. My coworkers are all great to work with and have great personalities. They are very patient and helpful for the most part. As for the management I am not very pleased with the management. The hardest part of the job is that it seems that there are a lot of tasks that are put on one person. Family Dollar is good at keeping you busy, but I think it would help if there were at least two associates and a manager working in the store. What I enjoy most about working at Family Dollar is interacting with different people and being able to make a customer's experience pleasant."
good,it was ok but very poorly managed the only stressful part is having to work twice as hard to help the store run better.
good,"A typical day started by arriving before dawn and waiting for the weekly arrival of your inventory. While unloading the delivery, also having the store opened and dealing with customers and finding a place for all your inventory before stocking the shelves. The days can be long and physically demanding depending also on weather conditions.  What I have learned, is your customer base will depend on the location of your store. The better the neighborhood the more pleasant the experience.  The management has to deal with the bottom line and the many issues involved in the retail environment. They may not have much say so if they are dealing with a corporate environment that does not have the best interest of their employees."
good,"a typical day at work as a store manager is very busy, accepting of vendors, receiving merchandise in a fashionable and timely manner, reviewing payroll and staying within budget, etc. what i learned was how to manage my team effectively and always keep positive in sales. The hardest part of the job was not being able to follow your schedule because as a manager the District Manager would require you to make changes to your schedule weekly because the district would be going over in payroll. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn something new every month to help your run an effective store and provide excellent customer service."
good,I enjoyed working with customers on a daily basis. It was always one manager and one cashier to keep a good work flow.
good,"A Typical work day for me, is unloading truck, stocking, and cashiering thru out the day. Being here has allowed me to gain knowledge in different areas such as schematics, some management skills, and great customer service. I work well with my manager, and co-workers. There really isn't a hard part about my job, because I like to challenge myself with different task. The most enjoyable part is knowing that I achieve some much within the time I am in the workplace."
good,Opening store and checking emails is always the start of the day. You meet many types of people working with the public. No one day is the same.
good,"I interacted with different types of people everyday, which allowed me to expand my people skills. I enjoyed pretty much everything about this job because I love to keep things in its place, very orientated."
good,manager i worked with let me go by saying i edited the time clock. I did no such thing and called HR about it and they stated that i didn't edit my time. I waited for a response about getting my job back and unfortunatly they sided with that manager. She is a compulsive liar and gets innocent people fired for no reason. the company was good to work for.
good,Overall the job experience was okay. The Management was wonderful but the customers and work that needed to be done was sometimes overbearing.I learned how to push myself to get things done.Co-workers were nice.I enjoyed the weekly pay.
good,"I was expected to do things that were against my morals and "
good,i started family dollar as soon as i graduated a yr later i was promoted to an ASM it was fun til my hours began to decrease because of payroll good pay for what i do cause usually ASMs are supposed to be paid 8.25hr but i got 10.00hr so im lucky but that doesnt help if you dont get the hours
good,"Fun place to work, friendly people work there, hours are not consistant"
good,"Zero payroll, working 6 days a week 60+ hours, and being micromanaged."
good,I Like Working For A Company that Productive and nice management
good,Certain locations have things down more than other locations. Some managers just aren't educated enough to handle the job they are given.
good,"Culture is promoted as a 'family' environment.  After 3 layoffs in 3 years, it is looking more like the Bank of America of retail!"
good,"ASM"
good,"Family Dollar was a great place to learn and start my career in middle management. It offered me lots of hours of training and development. However, it lacks the balance between work and home life. A typical week for me would consist of 70-90 hours of time on the road between stores. I would not recommend this job to anyone who values home life as this job will inevitably ruin your personal life."
good,a typical day at work was assisting people to chose the right outfits for different events. I learned to run a register. the managment was ok. and my co-workers were stuck up.
good,Family Dollar is an alright place to work. I enjoyed working there just couldnt get enough hours. I would work there again if i was guaranteed full time.
good,Family Dollar is a great company for advancement. The hardest part of the job is that there is not a lot of employees so if someone called in there is no one to replace.
good,Typical day of work consist of constant movement. Dealing with customers with all types of personalities. Learning how to pace yourself and stay focused.
good,Didnt like this company at all. It was to much of a hassle. We literally had to fight people that steal so when inventory gets here we wouldn't get fired for low inventory.
good,"I seriously dislike this job.. it is very unorganized, poor management"
good,"I love working at Family dollar interacting with customers, management is involved in everyday operation. My crew is great we work well together as a team,"
good,A typical day at this job site was interesting. My day begins by counting down all cash registers and stocking shelves.
good,"A typical day for myself would be bank deposit, walk through the store customer service."
good,"The customers were kind, funny, and I treated the great majority of them like a second family. I enjoyed the overall work but the people are what make it worth all the stress or long hours. Family Dollar was small retail department compared to most retail environments like Walmart or Target. The conversations and people skills are more individual based if one would learn to apply them. I"
good,A typical day of work as a Assistant Manger was very fast paced and detail. Open or close. I have learned how to run reports such as: inventory and sales reports. I loved learning my co-workers personalities. The hardest part of the postion was truck day Mondays unloading and loading merchandise on the floor of a truck.
good,Employees where easy to work with and everyone was cooperative. It was nice to be counted trustworthy and allowed to open and close the store.
good,"I love the part where i am interacting with customers, however two head  workers have very disrespectful demeanor"
good,"Lack of retail hours for staffing leads to extreme amount of hours worked by store managers. Higher salaries are put in place to attract new management along with a steady 52 hour per week pay. The bad news is no manager works close to 52 hours per week, more in the range of 65-70 which doesn't calculate into the salary equation. Not a bad company, but new structure needs to be put into place to help store level employees, not just managers, to become successful in daily retail operations."
good,"stocking shelves, calming irate customers, excellent manager, most co-workers are slackers but are cool people. the most enjoyable part of the day is when its over."
good,"customer service"
good,"no appreciation,no security i do not feel safe working there,"
good,"For the most part my job was boring but i made the best of it."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was working with wonderful people and heaving nice customers
good,"supervised co-works, completed tasks, and stock that need to be done for that day, also assisting customers with questions."
good,"Stressful job,little time for family life outside of work."
good,"Many different task to complete, keeping the store organized and shopper ready threw out the day. A good part time job."
good,If I opened the store it was a pretty productive day. I made sure everything was complete in a timely matter and everyone had a task to complete for the day. I liked being in charge responsible for the turn out of the day.
good,Working with customers and employees is enjoyable. It was a chaotic working environment .
good,"Overall handled cash. Greeted Customers as they entered and exited the store. managed and handled cash, checks etc."
good,"Inventory management, money handling, customer service and part of a sales team"
good,It is kind of boring. The rest about what I did is in my resume.
good,"Family Dollar had many ongoing customers daily and always a busy store. I learned patience,To be people friendly,how to work a register,keep the work place clean,recovery, and learned to no matter what keep a smile on my face. I loved the people i worked with they kept my day going.There really wasnt a hard part about the job but the easy part was making sure the customers left the store happy."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers but sadly the district manager did not care about her team.
good,"Running the cash register and greeting and helping customers."
good,"Most of the work time is completed alone. Very rare that you would work with someone else unless working at a large busy location. Hate cleaning the units, feel that company should pay someone to do the cleaning. Units can get very dusty. Management is OK, I have been threw 5 district manager in 5 years. Will have to do some local traveling daily to bank, post office, or other location for meeting. Not much room to grow in company, because they do not promote within the company pass property manager. Deal with customers whom are stress about moving or being evident from their homes, so customer service has to be strong to deal with people with attitude and cussing because of issues out of your control.  "
good,As assistant manager in the store there was a power struggle going on and lot of mistrust.
good,A typical day at work was mainly keeping customers happy and making sure that all the work duties were done and store was ready for next day. I Loved working with my co workers. Each individual came from a wonderful background and each person brought something to the table. The hardest part of the job would've been getting off late on Sunday and return the next morning early in the am to unload a truck and then stocking what came in all while doing customer service and maintaining store duties. Even though it was the hardest it was still a Great job. The manager we had was a good person but she lacked decision making skills. All in all Family Dollar is not a bad place to work.
good,"Data entry, communication skills, management skills, inventory, stock, cashier."
good,"Although, his job is not one I would choose under normal circumstances, it helped to fine tune much needed leadership qualities such as patience, communication, and dependability. "
good,"Due to placement, you will rarely have any downtime. Very busy stores.The managers are as hard working as the employees. Rarely is there enough coverage so at the end of the day you are exhausted. I was brought in at 10dollars an hour, which is rare but there is the opportunity to make double digits per hour. There are many horror stories one can tell. A lot of people quit early on. "
good,This position allowed me to utilize my interpersonal skills and use my customer service skills.
good,enjoyed going to work where everyone didn't mind doing their jobs.
good,Family Dollar has taught me a great deal of retail managment
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar is coming to work, punching in and starting by ringing up customers, then moving to stocking shelves, set end cap if needed, help any customers that need help, maybe get a break, clean the store, front face all items on the shelves, close the store at 9:00 p.m. Count down the drawer, count petty cash and close the registers. I learned at this store to just go with the flow. Be open to learn new things about running a store. My manager is AWESOME. She is very flexible and will do just about anything to make sure you are o.k. at work. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with the customers and some of the co-workers. You can't please everyone, but you can try your best, and some customers don't understand that. Some co-workers can make you think twice about how they have their job and how they continue to keep it. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure the store looks good and that people keep coming back because of that."
good,A typical day at Family Dollars stores would be energized work. I did not really learn anything I did not already know working here. The management was really nice. However you can not become friends with someone who is supposed to supervise you. The hardest part of this job was dealing with unruly customers. I enjoyed working for Family Dollar Stores because it was a job at the end of the day.
good,"A typical day included cashier duties, cleaning the store after closing and stock on Wednesdays. I taught myself how to build displays and how to currently set up new promotions. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet and greet customers."
good,Customer service
good,"co-workers are the only good part of the job, some of the management are under skilled"
good,"It was a great first job. It was in a slow town but the store got busy on holidays. It was a nice transition from having not too many customers, as I began, to get ready for more customers in the store."
good,somethings are ok but not a work place to advance.
good,"Learned alot about merchandising. Assisting customers in finding products. Training staff, performing administrative work."
good,My dutues on this job was to attend customers with their questions of any other needs. i was responsible for keeping the store front part of the store presentable for the customers. on truck day i was to be multi-tasking between stocking up murchandise and attending the cash register. i enjoyed meeting new people that came into the store.
good,"Great way to consistently interactive with customers, have it peak moments when you are constantly busy, and it slow time, when you can't get away from the registers"
good,not too hard to be able to advance to managerial positions if you work hard and keep on management
good,"It was a fast paced environment, however the team work with co-workers was excellent. I enjoyed the people I worked with, they were like family. Everyone worked with well together and always helped each other."
good,"Family Dollar isn't a bad company to work for. It was just a job for me to help make ends meet. When I found out I was pregnant I gave the store manager a heads up about what was going on. The doctor told me he was most likely going to put me out on bed rest and the store manager told me if I couldnt fulfill my management duties then I would need to step down. I couldn't afford to drive back and forth to Chester on a part time salary. Part time hours at Family Dollar were 15-20 hours a week. But I did enjoy working there, it was a good experience, taught me what to look for in future jobs."
good,I worked as a store manager with Family Dollar i really enjoyed taking care of my customers and making sure all their needs were meet. I usually go in at 6pm and and get off at 11:00pm. I learned a lot working as a manager and I enjoyed my employees also. They knew that i didn't play when it came to keeping my customers satisfied. The most enjoyable part of my day when I have customers come to me and tell me that the store has improved since I was put as a manager.
good,I came in and counted the safe did the paper work went around and made sure the store looks presentable for when the store opened. After that we had to either stock sheleves or re design the store for more product. Then when it was time to close we did our closing procedures.
good,job was cool and somewhat fun.
good,"Constantly on the move. Helping customers and employees. Stocking, cleaning, cash handling, pre-counts, pricing and price changes. Checking in vendors and merchandise. Floor sets,end caps and schematic changes. changes."
good,"I started working at Family Dollar with full intention of becoming a manager as soon as they would let me. I understood that therre was a time frame that I had to adhere by but made sure frequently that my manager and district manager were aware. After being with the company for about eight months, I was allowed to sit in with a neighboring district's managers' meeting to see what they did and it was never taken any further. In the time that I worked there, our sales went up at least 30% and our shrinkage was the lowest it had been in five years. I enjoyed working with the staff that we had and there were never any issues between anyone because we were all willing to help eachother."
good,"As an associate of Family Dollar you learn just about everything there is in retail. As an associate you check, stock, unload trucks, and provide customer service."
good,i enjoyed working for this company but hated work pest(RATS!!)
good,Each day at Family Dollar is a busy day for a store clerk. its never a dull moment for you. You will always have to multitask on a daily basis and provide good customer service
good,I supervise 6 employees. I account for all daily sales. I perform (P&L) audits. I make store deposits.
good,"never ending to do list, always changing to match culure, enjoyed emplees and mangement,"
good,Great value shopping for customers. Convince with locations all over. Fast and friendly service.
good,"i liked working here but some benefits sucked, we were robbed one day and the district manager at the time thought it was funny"
good,I don't mind hard work. hard work never hurt anyone. I do like to be notice for my hard work. They tell you one thing and do another.
good,"I assisted customer and my co-workers with various things. i learned how to bank deposits, schematics, and many other valuable tools for furthering my retail career. i really enjoyed working with the public. the hardest part of my job was unloading the weekly truck."
good,I choose not to complete a review on my current job we agree to support our company when we choose to work for them.
good,Although the pay and benifits weren't great it was a pretty interesting place to work and a chance to meet people form all walks of life
good,I get to work manager gives the order and I go and complete what has to be done in the store I learned how to stock and use register and customer service good overall place
good,Good place to work at if ur young and have no kids. Everything is cleaned up everyday and stuff has to be well organized if not one has to go back and do it again.
good,Excellent place to work as a part time job for extra income. Very flexible and work with you.
good,"Need to be a hardworking, conscientous, self-motivated person to work at Family Dollar and able to follow tasks to completion."
good,Working at Family Dollar was a very good place to work at. Management and coworkers were great to work with. Team work and great communication was used in our daily job assignments making work flow great and allowing us to provide excellent customer service to our customers.
good,Manager was two faced and talked badly about her employees. Even the ones who took on assistant manager roles quickly. Pay was not compensated until I said something. Worked as an assistant manager for minimum wage.
good,"typical day is really busy , short budget hrs to run the store , the freight , the schematics , costumers, specially the theft people,  and normal beneffist"
good,I learned that there is most to working at this kind of store. I mean that to say you are responsible most then just the cashiers you are responsible for making sure things run as smooth as possible.
good,Very great company to work for. Room for advancement if you meet the requirements. It was my favorite job I ever had. My manager was amazing. Really..
good,"Family Dollar has been good to me over the years ..I just need a change"
good,worked here for a long time and loved it till new management came on board and cut hours. at this point i was also scheduled for only unloading the weekly truck. from 48hrs to 12hrs
good,"Very diverse people wprk here, and have a great time at work. unloading inventory and being a cashier is important. having great customer service is required."
good,"It’s fun , good , hard learning experience . Everybody gets along , there are times where the manger want everybody to do something all together as a whole to built a team"
good,"There is an atmosphere of fear that is very creepy. One day a guy from upper management was talking so harshly to the manager of the store I work for, a customer wanted to physically attack him."
good,The team members are what stands out to me.. They have some really good team members who work really hard but never get recognized for their work.. They also have members who work really hard & are not paid for what they are worth. The most enjoyable part of the whole job is the customers & some of the people you work with.
good,This was an experience. Family dollar is a good company to work for but you must be careful of the location. I was taught about opening and closing and had a positive experience.
good,This job was the real tester. Having to deal with respectful/disrespectful customers was a task you had to learn to keep quiet and continue to do your job as descriptive. It was very challenging but I conquered it and did my job very well.
good,"Pay Rate $7.25 a hour , advances with time and experience"
good,Family Dollar is the place to start in customer service and or retail. It's smaller and a bit more manageable than other larger retailers. I love the interaction with customers and employees.
good,I learned that I can get right to work without any training first. Eventually I had enough time to start and finish the training. All in all I had a nice time working for family dollar for the short time that I worked there.
good,"As a store manager, you are expected to work 53 hours a week minimum. While working at FD I worked 60-70 plus hours a week with little to no staff, in a high risk store. I enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day but I struggled to balance family life and work life. Working at FD took all of my focus and time. I was on call 24/7. It was hard with 3 children and a husband at home but I loved the job itself.  Not recommended for a young family."
good,"If you have a manager that cared about her employees and store, it would be a lot nicer if a place to work for. It is great a place to learn a lot of new things and to help you grow."
good,I liked this job. Family Dollar is a very customer friendly based company. My work ethic translated very well in that work environment. Job duties consisted of unloading truck and stocking store
good,"The company itself is great.  It depends on who you work with and under manager. But the business is very wealthy ,careful and nice. I appreciate the time there."
good,My experience working at family dollar was very pleasant at first I wasn’t sure I would know how to work the cash register but once I learned how to do things and learned where everything was it was easy to me . Also my managers took their time and showed me how and where things went . The staff of people I worked with were amazing and they made it feel like a warm environment more like a home then a job .
good,Individual must be able to focus on the people coming into stores and identify shoplifters scammers and work w/staff in how to handle certain situations
good,The only bad part is the team work performance because it’s never enough people working on a shift putting more work on one person than team work in I don’t think it’s worth the pay
good,"job is a pretty fast pace activity , i believe it was a fun exsperience the customers keep you lifted with a smile. The work place is very easy to accommodate."
good,I enjoyed learning about my customers and helping them whenever I could. Very physical job often with no help so that was very challenging. Very little training time.
good,Hard to get hours and you move a lot from store to store . I feel I was underpaid we stocked shelves and unloaded truck plus did cashier for 9 bucks and hour
good,Don't expect them to have any sympathy for you if suddenly a manager quits and your workload doubles. You might as well kiss your family and life goodbye until someone is hired. And don't expect them to help with that either.
good,There are some time when someone will come in being disrespectful and u have to bit ur tongue the mangers try to help but most of all toy have to keep a good attitude
good,This Was A Good Job. Personally I didnt get along with one of the managers but that was because the store had a problem with employees stealing items from the store.
good,Family dollar is a place to work to stay active. There is always sometging to do. Whether it be stocking items or checking people out on the register.
good,"I love the work I do for Family Dollar. I am able to make my own schedule per their schedule guidelines. I am able to merchandise to a certain extent of how I think a customer would like the look of it. I am happy to say that I have a great management team above me, guiding me."
good,Employees in some cases are not given adequate training. Trainers are cutting corners to get training pay along with incentive pay. Too many procedures to adhere to so that deadlines are met
good,Looking for something more. Sometimes it felt like I  had no help. Worked by myself a lot so not a lot of help. Management was ok but sometimes we couldn’t get on the same page
good,They did accommodate for my medical and physical issues.  It was close to home.  Pleasant coworkers and customers.  But they closed the wrong store in my opinion.
good,The stores are never fully staffed and if they are the company does not pay the employees enough that they will stay so most of them either stop showing up or quit after only a few months or even weeks.
good,"A typical shift during my employment at Family Dollar consisted of Assisting customers in locating items, restocking shelves, sweeping and mopping floors,"
good,Its a good job overall I don't have to many dislikes about it it's a great part time job its pays well for the time being the employers treat u very well
good,"The workplace was alright, but the location with some customers were ridiculous at points. Main issue there was the pay. I just also feel like that was never a job I'd stick with for a long time, so it was time to move on."
good,Working there was cool. Sometimes it was really busy other times not so much. I enjoyed the customers. Had to ring people up and restock if there was no one paying.
good,I was working steady. Then they cut my days and hours dramaticly to 2 days a week. I love working there just can't do 2 days a week. Manager is great.
good,It’s a fair company but I need better pay! And I want to go farther! I have a daughter and I’m a single parents I need more! I’m use to more pay and money!
good,If you need something to do part time or just extra pocket cash this is the place for you. Expectations are not too high And they will always work you.
good,the managers of the job were not as friendly as they seem to be . I am i college student and was told that i would be able to return to work for Christmas break but my requests to be put on the schedule was ignored .
good,"I wouldn't mind goin back if I had the chance,I have nothing bad to say bout family dollars ..they feed you for your appreciation,good benefits,good people and  good pay"
good,They alot of things to do but you can work hard and get things done and have support and will get to know alot of people and they have wonderful things in the store and have a great time
good,Family Dollars Is Actually A Better Job Than Dollar Tree. The Trucks Dont Come With Everything Everywhere..The  Merchandise is on pallets.. At Dollartree Every Box By Hand Unloading
good,"What I've learned from working at Family Dollars was to always make the customer happy even if your not, greet customers and to always be on time and make them feel welcome."
good,Family Dollar Distribution Center does not encourage workers to advance.  There is not a career path so you must make your own way.  There is a lot of turnover due to this.
good,i arrive at 6 in the morning to unload the truck i meet with my team members to go over the agenda for today i fully stock the store with new products and assist with cashiering wen we are busy
good,Everyday there was a different task to be done so no day was the same. There were plenty of hours to take on in the store and  management was understanding and helpful.
good,"Either open or close the store was NVR a set day "
good,Its an ok experience just not something you'd want as a career. The pay is good doesnt give any overtime. Give flexable hours cant realy complain... Its a good job
good,"I enjoyed working here as my job training it was quiet everyone was friendly."
good,this was a pretty decent place to work for. although it got very stressful from time to time I was given help and resources to maintain a healthy mindset and push through.
good,"A typical day included opening the stores, training employees, inventory control and intake, merchandising, scheduling, payroll, customer service, money handling, cleaning of the store, vendor interaction and closing the store."
good,As a cashier i enjoyed my time i was also pregnant and was the best cashier there. I would love to go back. Everyone has a mind of their own just how i wanted
good,Depending on the store manager you wouls be ok. Some of them are good others not so much. The first store manager i had was amazing. Once i transfered to another store the store manager was horriable.
good,"I wish I could get more hours............................................"
good,You get to know the people you work with. You become to know what the people who you work with like and dislikes.  We share family recipes and bring each other food too share. We give gifts for each others. So to me is was like a little family and we all worked together to keep our store the best and when we would get new people we always made sur they were wecolme.
good,"This company is a great place to learn retail, and get your foot in the door. However, the long term is not what you want, store managers are overworked and are held responsible for things that are out of their hands. The pay is decent but this is a very stressful job, the clientele are always rude and i have seen them get physical."
good,"Work life balance does not exist within this company due to the business model.  However, it is similar to any discount retailer business model.  A great start for an entry level candidate looking to start a career in retail management."
good,"Days could get long if it was slow. there is a lot of standing and being on your feet. when you're not dealing with a customer you're either restocking or sweeping or doing something else for the store, you don't just sit around."
good,I enjoyed working for family Dollar. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers that I seen on a daily basis.  I love how convenient the store was
good,"company was going through ownership , the store I worked in lost a manager for 5months they did not send a replacement and expected the two asst . do a managers job with no compensation"
good,I enjoyed working with the women there and stocking shelfs and also ringing up customers and it was peaceful work enviroment .. so i would say apply there.
good,"The problem was that every time I would get a raise, minimum wage would go up as well. That meant people coming in new were making the same pay as I was even though I had worked there for years. Unless you get bumped to management the pay isn't great."
good,I was only on the schedule for 4 - 8 hours a week. When i was giving more hours the manager take it away from me and bc they went over payroll. They need a better way of securing the place.
good,Once company was sold to competitor everything went down hill I fully expect the  distribution to be closed down in the near future before them the company was awesome to work for
good,Ok place if you don’t have a family to support. Working different hours every week. Unloading trucks and putting up freight by yourself. The pay was no enough for what you had to put up with.
good,i got to meet really nice people their the  work environment was great i got to learn alot of things how to value and how to become a bettedr person..
good,"Starting pay is low, raises are low and assistant managers don't get bonuses. Hours are irregular. No distinct job description. Pressured to sell items of the month."
good,"pay lower than expected and pay ncrements were also not as good as expected, only one raise per year and only three percent compared to actual salaryy"
good,This position is only part time. The manager I work for is very flexible. The company is not so great as there are many dangers to be aware of. I was able to advance in little time.
good,"Greeting customers with a smile,operating a cashier machine while handling cash from and to customers that shop in the store,very easy,fast-paced type of job,management is great.Hardest part of the job is lifting heavy big boxes by myself sometimes but got through it, it was a challenge for me."
good,"I have been and still am a manager at FD, I love my job but here lately I have been assigned DM task and I’m not being compensated for the task I have been handed. I am holding 3 stores now and no extra pay working 17 hr days. "
good,"I learned how to manage other employees. Making deposits, unloading truck deliveries, stocking shelves, planograms, organization, customer service, conflict resolution"
good,"Its a very repetitive job.  If all does what needs to be done, then its becomes a very easy day and job.  The workplace is set to be very customer friendly."
good,It is a dangerous company to work for you have to stop shoplifters and run a store on bare minimum hours for your employees and they also want you to be super staffed at the same time
good,Worked only 30 something hours ..managment didn't understand type1  diabetes and constantly put me in a  unreasonable dangerous situations where I was not being allowed to check my sugar or eat something to bring my sugar up when I'm loading trailers and it constantly going dowdowndowndownndroppingffrowormfroworking  to attat
good,"It's hard being in retail but you can easily move up the ladder as long as you are responsible, don't call off and work hard. Can be short staff on a regular basis."
good,"On my first day at work, the manager yelled/screamed at me with rage for asking too many questions about what the job I was hired for.                        "
good,If you need a job this is the place to work for. You cannot stay forever because in order to stay forever you have to kiss people ... but is ok if you need money.
good,Loved the job at first but has just become to much.  Enjoyed working with some of my co-workers and my boss.  I enjoyed  my boss she would help whenever need.
good,"I enjoyed my time at this store, but it was not enough money for me to be able to provide and support my family. This is a good entry level position for someone entering the work force."
good,"I leaned how to manage my time better and how to organize schedules, shipment orders and everyday tasks.  I grew to better with different dynamics for customers on a day to day basis"
good,Good place to work if you have patience and have a good work ethic. Hours tend to be long and you don’t really get overtime or any free time. It can get boring
good,"Really cool job I loved the managment got along with everybody , I just wasnt all to happy with the pay,I felt like they could of done better minimum wage doesnt cut it for a living"
good,"Like the place I work at. Need better training. Like some of the customers that I get to see everyday. Feel like some employees need to leave home problems at home,"
good,"Fair pay, good hours. Store manager was clueless with mental issues. (Not a personal slam. Just an honest opinion)"
good,This is a job for a person that likes to be on their feet I would work your again if the store I was working and was clean they gave me a good amount of hours
good,The Job is great until management tries to use and abuse hard workers they turn good workers into slackers due to the lack of unity in the store its called Family Dollar but there is no family.
good,I handled cash made change of large bills assisted customers with dicision  stocked shelvels put in wanted items back helped keep the store clean etc.
good,I don’t have much to say.. family dollar is a fun and great place to work for an first job. The staff and customers are the excitement of the job and they make it very welcome
good,That company is okay depending how you handle your work and home life. I have gain a lot of knowledge while working for FamilyDollar. You move up fast but it is alot of responsibility in your every day job there.
good,"I stocked,cleaned and recovers along with putting up schematics and throwing ALL frieght including food and chemicals . I think the people who work there are very friendly and well work oriented ."
good,"Was a good company for a starter. Didn't have no experience, so it helped me gain some kind of expierence. The co workers were great and got along with them all. Only thing is management could do better."
good,I the job was ok but poor managing I got my freight stuck in the racks I reported it but didn't no it had to b put on paper told me I couldn't drive in 24 hour so i told them I was going home went home come back next day and they fired me no damages was done
good,overall is a good company had its issues with painting proper work site some stores where just gross but other then the good working environment managers have all say over most store so it was very easy for company to play favorites on bring and promoting along with hours
good,"It was fun and exciting. Was only for a few weeks. Pay was good. Wish would of been full time position. Employer was nice, and helped us when needed ."
good,The good thing about family Dollar is you get paid every week. And they offer benefits. You do work hard here it’s like an everyday workout.They could pay more bc it’s a very strenuous job.
good,"A typical day at work will be, in my case, do everything. Cashiering, cleaning, recovery, backroom inventory, getting new merchandise from truck, etc, "
good,"Family Dollar is the typical ""good old boy network"" kind of job. Either you know someone or you have been with the company long enough to retire. There is no room for advancement. Cashiers become Assistant Managers, which is just a Head Cashier with keys. Overall, this is a job for the ""teenager with acne-my parents still pay my phone bill"" kind of job. If you don't get hired as a manager pass on this company."
good,"What I learned working at family Dollar was patience and how to stalk more supplies on the shelves, how to love working. It was a decent job I like it."
good,The work experience here depended on the team you were around. Half the staff didn't want to work. Customers are rude. No security. The pace was nice but when staff don't listen and you have customers going off on you because management doesn't listen either it's chaotic.
good,It's a great place to work at I came from working for fast food place for ten years and it was something different but the only thing I didn't like is people come to steal and I personally think they should have securites.
good,It's a very fast paced job that has you constantly going. Management has absolutely no clue about what is going on and it is very disorganized. I wouldn't recommend this job
good,One day there was a customer who had a issue with the price of a object.. I calm her down and insist to call my manager up and explain to him on the issue and the problem was solved.
good,"Nice entry level retail job with room for growth.  Fast passed and often busy, makes the days pass by quickly.  Team oriented work loads, no one left behind!"
good,"A great place to work, everybody is focused on safety, pay could be more competitive, benefits and are average. Overtime usually happens late summer through January and is usually mandatory"
good,"The job had some chaotic moments but not to a point where it was a train wreck, the pay was fair but the hours were abysmal. The store had theft on a daily basis, security wasn't so much. The customers were pretty decent but not too friendly. The job was so-so at best."
good,Starting out as cashier is tough but if you can make it to management it has ok pay the work load is tough but a fair job. The load they put on their manager is crazy.
good,first job promoted within.  higher associates did not respond when you dealt with a racist/sexist manager driving me to quit absolutely loved retail and merchandising
good,It was a good place to work . Close to home . Scheduling could use some help and more fairness but overall not a bad place to work. Would work there again
good,I loved my job working there for some odd reason I was wrongfully terminated for another employee stealing and me not catching it. I tried to fight it and go to the district manager but he only called the store manager to tell her that I told what was going on and I was let go. I've been working management since I was 18 and never had a problem before. I won't say that it was the company I say that it is the store manager who manipulated her way into getting rid of every person of color so right now I am fighting a case that is seems like I may not win
good,Decent job to start out with. You do a lot of cashier work and typically work on totes to put out in the store when you're not busy. Hours may be short but it's good for those who want to work part time.
good,Management is very poor and your told one thing and then they expect you to do more co workers just there for a pay check and not willing to help one another just after others jobs.
good,"I stocked the isle's with product. I worked cashier, did paperwork plus open and close the store. What I liked about the company is some of the customers."
good,"I loved work,  hours constantly cut , pay horrible, employees were  high all the time, rarely showed up never carried load. Terrible management. Theft"
good,Family dollar over works you and under pays you. I really have nothing else to say about Family Dollar. Please just let me confirm this email so I can get a better job!
good,"Really a hit or miss on how flexible they’ll be with ur schedule, changes every week or depending on ur boss mood. "
good,"quick paced and competitive. Typical day of work for me was overseeing other employees, making out the schedule, assisting the store manger with daily store task, working at the register."
good,"i only worked there for two months and it"
good,When it's raining the power goes out but you are still required to stay until the end of your shift. I have had co workers who brought their family to the store while they are working. so it's like you are also babysitting.
good,"A typical day was to come in earlier in the morning and open the store. Every Friday was truck day , so i was chosen to help the unload the truck. I would restock shelves and Zone. I also was an Cashier and greeted customers as they entered the store. The  management was great and very understanding when it came tp special holidays or wanting extra hours. The hardest part of my day, is when a customer isn't satisfied and i tried my hardest to fix the issues. The most enjoyable part of my of is when every thing runs smoothly and my till is all counted for."
good,My very first job and I absolutely loved it couldn’t have asked for better people to work with . Very understanding and always there to help when you needed it.
good,"Pay was okay but hours were horrible, being sick and having a dr note was told to me not to be an “excused absence” even if I was contagious.  You’d bring up an issue and it would never get resolved. It was okay because I liked my coworkers but if you want a better store then corporate shouldn’t be stingy with the hours!"
good,I think this is a excellent place to work amd shop with very heplful and knowledgeable staff. The store mamager goes above and beyond the job description.
good,Good company great people always working with you making sure ready for promotion making sure ready to tackle any task giving making sure complete on time
good,Too many people got away with stuff. Some people got away with somethings and others would get in trouble for somethings. Just not a very good place to work.
good,"You gain a lot of info.."
good,Gave me plenty of customer service experience with minimal effort.  I enjoyed the public interaction working alongside my manager at the time. Very competitive pay for the position held.
good,It was pretty good but too much controversy between management supervisors. Plus the supervisors in the home office would not listen to ideas that you had to save the company a lot of money
good,"usually the day start at 7:30 AM for the Store Manager Assistant and he should be finish account of money and open the system before 8:00 AM. and then should be open the store at 8:00 AM."
good,Family Dollar is a good company you can transfer to any other family Dollar in the state at any time as long as they have a opening. When family Dollar is hiring they look within the company to transfer employees before hiring outside so if you a cashier you can be a asst manager are store manager.
good,The management was okay but everything else was very stressful the hours would be cut you will be lucky enough to work 30 hours if the hours were available
good,They schedule was always different by the week. You are an unloader stocker and cashier so they should pay more. Other than that its on ok company to work for.
good,I was an assistant manager at family it was great just not enougg pay to support my family of 5. The boss is great she a hard worker. I did cashier I did truck I cleaned
good,"The reason I left was due to poor management and bad scheduling. Be ware of similar managers. I was going to school full time at the time and requested days off for my classes, yet my manager repeatedly scheduled me during my classes. It wasn't worth it."
good,"Working here was easy and fun. Everyone had fun working,  you could stop and talk as long as the job was done in a good time. And management careed and actually talked to employees like people."
good,I didn't like that I was calling out for help and didn't no one respond quickly enough.  I working over 70 hours at times but only got paid to work 52 because I was salary. Sometimes I just felt used.
good,"Working at Family Dollar wasn't something that I can say was fun, but it wasn't the worst thing in the world. I'll always think back on it and remember the good time, despite how little they might be."
good,Needs better management. Environment should be professional. Customers are also a big part of your work experience. Majority of them are nice & mannered but othere tend to get mad over little things that associates have no control over but you do your best to fix the situation.
good,When i clock in I login into the register to cashier. Then I help stock Through out the day. Most days just ringing and speaking to people as they enter or leave out.
good,I disliked working at family dollar. Because of the people i worked with. I was constantly picking up everyones slack. Hours were horrible at times. There was even a summer were our air units were out of order and we contacted corporate several times for it to be fixed and it was NEVER resolved.
good,Good for people looking to gain customer service skills. Not so much of a place to become a career. I don't think they value their employees as much as other companies I've worked for.
good,"Family dollar paid low wages, inconsistent work hours, also insufficient staff. Lack of staff caused the environment to be more stressful than it needed to be. Management seemed to care little about the working conditions."
good,"One thing we didn't do was just sit around.There was always something to do..between the customers ,recovery,and working frieght,cleaning..the perfect job for those that like to stay busy"
good,"I worked in a small town, so business was slow. However, management was great.I stayed busy by following a daily list of jobs that had to be done and keeping the check out area clean. Only two workers a day except for on truck days. I had to be busy the whole work day. We are not allowed to stand behind the register unless we are cleaning or checking customers out."
good,Required a lot of working hours due to a lack of employees. The job as a Manager was very demanding and under payed. I gained a lot of knowledge working as a manager and customer service.
good,"I really enjoy working at family dollar txdc, learned alot . Most managers had great communication with associates. HR manager had lack of communication skills with staff."
good,"Good place to work, pay sucks..they do not move up from the inside, they outsource..good place to get experience. Benefits are ok, never get 40hrs a week"
good,"Its Ok, its something different everyday.The schedule is flexible however the hours can fluctuate from time to time. The pay could be better especially when high theft is involved."
good,Very nice people to work with but the customers made it very stressful to give them great customer service. The company needs to step up their supply orders to satisfy the customers more.
good,"Instead of watching videos or asking assitant managers, the manager will jump to conclusions. May cut hours, my provide hours. Depends on how hard of a worker you arw"
good,"Family dollar wasn’t a bad place to work at hard work but got though the day pretty fast with the work load stocking and cashier was my duties Cashier "
good,I feel that i had a strong team with whom i was privileged to work with. The customers were always friendly. I loved the fast paced environment and the daily challenges to help maintain and great store.
good,a typical day at work there was normally fast paced you only got 10 minute breaks if that. you dont learn much cause they dont really teach you anything they expect you to learn as you go but its still a company to get lead way in retail business
good,Expect you to break your back for a job that isnt worth it. They work their best workers too hard on a daily basis rather than distributing the loads to other people who work their as well.
good,"work most the day non stop, away thing to do.  at the of the day check and make sure registers would balance . and make store was organize. and loading truck was completed at all times"
good,Over all a great place to work as long as you dont work with a bunch of jealous drama queens. The only thing bad I have to say about them is when i quit I gave a 2 weeks written notice and theys till cheated me out of my vacation pay I had saved up.
good,"Hardest part of the job..unloading truck, working sales floor and register at the same time."
good,It was like a bitter sweet situation i like working there but it wasnt enough hours plus store was always crazy they had to many people managing the place
good,When I worked at Family Dollar I had a lot of fun. I got alomg with the other employees and the customers. The managers were nice and friendly. The training i had was amazing
good,Family Dollar is a job for people that want to work part tie and get paid minimal wage. The direction of the company is great and the managers are cool and will help you if you need it.
good,The customer whom kept me motivated an driven to over come some expectations. I would say it's safe to mention I am extremely well with people an enjoyable to work with all types of folks.
good,"It was a laid back enviroment , more of a job for a teenager . Dealing with rude customers and unexperienced employees was hard . It was not a good work place for me ."
good,I had to unload trucks and put away product and had to be a cashier and make sure all paperwork was all files for the day before and make sure all employees are doing good
good,I had a rough experience at the store I worked at. Generally I did well at my job when I was given a specific task to work on however we where short on staff and I was asked to change my task often to help with other areas that needed attending to. therefore my beginning task was left neglected at times. The Family Dollar I specifically worked at was not as kept to par as others. I had the opportunity to experience working shifts at a brand new store close by and experiences the dramatic difference between the two stores.
good,"Cool place to work, I only left because I relocated and the drive was about 45 minutes to work, one way and at the time I wasn't working that many hours for the drive."
good,"As a store manager you have to work 60 hours a week. Because upper management would give so many store hours for your employees, Every team member was part-time. the store manager was the only full-time employee."
good,"I like getting the seasonal looking awesome, and shoppable for customers to see all the cool stuff for the particular season. customer love shopping the different seasons once I'm done."
good,"I enjoyed working there a little stressful at times depends on which Family Dollar you're working at other than that I would recommend it, I enjoyed my experience there I feel like a real leader there when the cashiers in the stock crew did exactly as I asked with no hesitation and I think that was mainly because of my personality"
good,Family Dollar is overall an okay job . I learned that you would have to sometimes leave your attitude at home or it’ll get you in trouble . The hardest part is trying to maintain the register and stock at the same time .
good,It was ok place to work at. I like the schedule that I was given. I was not pleased that I had to work at a different location from time to time. Other than that it was fine
good,Wasnt something I loved but what i brought home paid the Bill's and that was just that no extra money for anything  really but a job is a job wouldn't really recommend it
good,"I worked for 4 months here, nothing stood out for me to remember exactly. It was my first job out of high school and basic training. Cannot provide an accurate review."
good,"Most days I arrive at work early maybe 7:30 r 8 am. I work stock until it’s time to open at 9:00 am. I’m there alone from 9 until 2 pm. There’s a schedule template we must follow and it really doesn’t  work for us. If you don’t have a great team the district manager expects for you to stay there to get the job done. As a store manager I work freight, work monthly schematics, change out monthly encaps, make sure store is clean.The worst part of my job is working 70-80 hours per week but only getting paid for 52 hours. I enjoy my job especially talking with the customers. It’s just that I miss out on a lot with family. It’s almost as if I’m working 2 jobs, it would be better if I’m paid overtime."
good,this was a good place to work kept you busy all day was just too long of days. but was enjoyable to unload trucks. and enviroment was busy but at the same time enjoyable and at times laid back.
good,"Its was ok to work at, but th pay was low and lots of work is done. People get robbed too often and are too scared to work there or they rather not work there to avoid it."
good,"Great place for those who want to work.  Manager has too much responsibility with low pay.  I enjoyed working working at the fast pace.  Very hard to keep staffed, not having a good applicant pool."
good,They didn't have to many meeting or for that matter they were mainly through phone. Not to bad if you have time in your hands easy job if you are and active person
good,"If they trained everyone properly, and had the right leaders in order, family dollar could be top 5 shopped store in america. They don't ask all employees for their input, just one man/woman. Communication builds trust, that's in all aspects of life."
good,It was an ok place to work at times. Very stressful. Didn't have a lot of payroll to work with to build a good team. Most of work was done by myself. Corporate only cares about the dollar and not employees like it should be.
good,"Its a nice job to work but I wouldn't full time, you don't get days of and even though you are sick with something they make you come in, they will make you come in on your days off, they will keep you after you shift hours (even when I had school and sports going on)."
good,It Was A Good Seasonal job but I don't like when people try to be competitive for the same position but I love working at their workplace to meet new people
good,"It's a great store to work in, but don't expect much in terms of advancement. I would definitely recommend it as a temporary, supplemental or transitional job, but expect to be living with EBT if you're using it as your only income."
good,"Fast paced good worker's"
good,"Management was very helpful when needed, co-workers were friendly, assistant manager was great at teaching me the store layout, welcoming atmosphere,  clean store, hardest part was standing for long periods of time, most enjoyable were meeting different types of people"
good,How good or bad it is depends on your location and the DM. Some locations have enough people working and is not so stressful. Benefits are ok. Management is expected to do most of the hard work.
good,overworked and under paid. the advancement was very quick from cashier to store manager but finding reliable workers was the biggest issue. The district managers could be way more helpful
good,"I stock and pull inventory from the back "
good,"Company has fantastic potential if they can just fix the treatment of their store managers. The pay is fair for the schedule they ask of you, but you rarely only work the 52 hours asked of you. I averaged over 60 a week and often over 70 + a week. Company requires most of their managers to work by themselves and in high crime areas this can be very dangerous. I had my car stolen and was robbed at knifepoint and gunpoint several times. The last time they stole my personal iPhone and a customer’s purse. My DM was too busy to come fill out the incident report. "
good,the company as a whole is not bad they could however do a  little better with pay schedule and overall movement of employees. also a little employee appreciation is needed every now and again
good,"I enjoyed working at Family Dollar as the assistant manager for a couple of years. I learned most of what I know about customer service working that job. I was given the most responsibility at Family Dollar and I always made sure everything was in order, the store and all the necessary numbers."
good,Bad management horrible Choice stores is in bad structured. Someone needs to implement a different plan or source where they can guide everybody three effectively with all types of training
good,"Work hard ,pay attention to details, follow the rules, always be on time, consider others , follow directions,pay attention to safety guidelines,show up early"
good,Family Dollar was a good learning experience. I appreciate the experience and the opportunity. It's a job I would recommend to anyone. It's a good place to build from.
good,"Low pay.  Whether or not you stay might depend on who your manager is.  My manager liked me, because I was one of the only people who actually put in effort.  However, she left after I did, and she was replaced by a more petty person."
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work especially if you are interested in interacting with others on face to face. They are flexible with schedules..
good,Only real down fall is that you dont make enough money to support yourself or family without having a second job. Learned how to be more organized. Management is good and understanding. No benefits.
good,Because your running the register and your zoning items customer steal and talk bad at u .some ate just to rude and don’t care just say wat the want to you .
good,My day at family dollar It opened me up to more management skills it was very steady work not a lot of help short on hours so I had to be very flexible with my work a lot of multi tasking witch I enjoyed it helped me motivated me a lot.my hardest thing was the unloading of the truck ant when I had call outs and I had to do the truck myself management was good I enjoyed my job there just did not like working alone a lot doing everything by myself did not have hours to hire enough people
good,I really like the job sometimes I didn't really like the people that was in the job but hey when you working somewhere you can't make friends you just have to do your job and that's it and that's what I did at Family Dollars I did my job.
good,Some things should've been done differently. The management team should've all been on the same page with the other employees instead of letting them get away with certain things that shouldn't have been allowed in the work place
good,My schedule was inconsistent also but it was a laid back job everyone just didn't do job how I was trained to do the job due to that I had to leave.....
good,"•Manages performance through performance management, coaching, appraisal and disciplinary efforts."
good,Company expected optimum store performance while providing minimal payroll for staffing. These circumstances put heavy weight on Store manager and assistant. The pay for customer service reps and assistant managers was too low for the work expected of them which led to a very high turnover. Store managers however were paid well.
good,"very poor management, you don't get discounts, making you work crazy hours for little pay, always busy, break rooms are a mess, you cant learn much with poor management"
good,family dollar is a good place to work. you do have to deal with people not wanting to work assigned shifts but they were understanding with family issues
good,I liked my job most of the time.  They really work you hard there.  I had to stock shelves and straighten the store.  I had to help unload the truck when it came in sometimes.  It was hard because you had to cashier all the while too.
good,"I learned a lot as an assistant manager but didn't enjoy my time with the company as the other employees were not into their jobs and wouldn't get motivated thus making my job very hard. Also, my location was extremely high risk for theft and bad location. Too much stress when you're barely 20 yrs old."
good,Productive and fun workplace great co workers and each day was different. Schedules did change and were not consistent but overall a good place to work
good,"Customers are great , people are great , jobs great hours are short depending . Needs improvement but its not the worst job ever i just cant make a living off of it"
good,"It was a fast paced experience. In family dollar 1 position means you do everything  cashier, stock, unload the truck, sweep, mop, everything outside of managing store."
good,The team there was not good at working the environment gets hostile uneasy ... It makes the job seem harder than is. The manager was not good at managing and working through situations but the job itself is easygoing
good,I would only suggest this if you're in college or just need a quick stepping stone towards something else. Not a place I would personally recommend one make a career out of.
good,"Great store , bad individual store security. Needs to keep up with the wants of the population the store is in.  Needs to be remoldeled for security reasons. Employee safety should be Loyal."
good,I loved my job.. The regular costumers were amazing and toward the end of my time there they were the only reason I was still there.  the manager was awful so I left.She started to pick favorites and talking poorly about other members of management. She wouldn't take responsibility for her own poor actions and the last I heard she is under investigation.
good,"It was a fast pace environment. It taught me how to stock items in designated area, how to unload the trucks of inventory and keeping the store neat. I liked it."
good,Our store was in bad shape. My manager was a new hire as well and the previous manager wasn't doing his job. I don't believe I was trained properly. The people I worked with all worked together as a team
good,It was a very simple job. The boss was just lazy and poor at completing his task as the store manager. I refused to cover for him if he couldn't do what he was assigned to do.
good,"overall a good place to work, fast learning, working with the public, positive attitudes, friendly work place, team players was overall good , managers was great also"
good,i love my customers i love what i do. i work well over 50 hours a week and their is no work life and home life balance. in order to be more successful you must be happy at home or work.i work most days from 10 to 15 hours a day. the most rewarding part of my day is to make my customers happy and make sure that they have everything they came for.
good,"The cashiers have it soooo easy but get paid horrible, "
good,"It was okay I jus had bad experience from family dollar it’s okay when you start it jus take you awhile to move up in the company, besides that it’s a okay job to start off in retail."
good,"well overall this job was not what I was looking for. it was not that helpful for me. The benefits are somewhat nice, but for the hours I worked the money outcome was not to my liking."
good,I have not worked at this company in well over 10 years im sure they have made changes for the best interest of employees. Great place to start out as a manger and to work your way up. You just have to watch what areas you are in they are not safe and during the holidays it is very unsafe.
good,"Corporate would give you a list daily of things that needed to be completed, wouldn't let you schedule enough people according to the job & then punish you when things wouldn't get done."
good,I can be a great place to work when yours store has the right/enough help. Some days i work 10 to 12 hours days right now because we don't have enough staff. It can be hard getting the right people in place..
good,Was a good place to work especially if you want to advance and better your career. The work environment was pleasant and most employees stay.Sad that the DM drove away a lot of good workers.
good,Busy work day always doing things. I learned how to be an assistant manager. The manager i was under was not that great. I enjoyed talking to people during my day.
good,"It was a cool job only offered part for me, I couldn't work over time , but other than that over all I don't have anything bad to say I moved out of state."
good,For the short time I was there it was very interesting. I was excited to learn but I think I was to slow for the manager. I mainly was a cashier but didn't get many hours.
good,Family dollar is a good place to work to move up in the company. The location i was at was fast paced with high theft rates so managemnt was not easy there.
good,"Family Dollar was a great place to work, it had good hours, even with being a lower paying job I was still bringing home about $300-$350 a week which was fine at the time. There are two set shifts so you were either there from 8-4 or 230-1030. Only problem when I was there was the store manager, while having many family issues of her own, wasn't at all sympathetic to others. After working there for a year, talking double shifts and coming in whenever they called me in even while heavily pregnant I was eventually forced to choose between my son's safety or my job in the end. Luckily that manager has since moved to a different location and their new store manager seems to be very polite"
good,"I really liked working during the holidays. Excited to see what the trucks are bringing to the store. I was very happy to see they sell food now, which can be cheaper."
good,"Overall the job wasn't to bad I quickly went from cashier to asst. Manager and after a couple years a store in the area needed a manager and I stepped in.  Payroll was terrible, often I worked 6 10hr days, and unloading truck was also a requirement."
good,It was a fun place to work at times. But the new management I feel has lost some if it's drive and customer service goal. They don't like yo give raises to you. And they work the good workers to hard and let the bad ones get away with everything
good,"Working for this company is very challenging, only the strongest will survive. Took lots of hard work, blood, sweat and tears to finally get a promotion. At the end it was NOT worth it. To much work for a low pay."
good,I would have to stock the shelf's.Unload the truck when it came in.I would help customer's find item's.Collect cart's that customer's left in the parking lot.
good,Its a very low paying. If its your job its really not that bad. The pay is horrible for the amount of work that you have to do. You are over worked almost every day.
good,"It was slow, boring, and uneventful. You would make sure the items were faced up and when you heard the bell you would have to go up front and ring up the customers."
good,I enjoyed the knowledge I gained from working with family dollar but as a single mother with  young children the hours I was expected to work at the time were hours I could no longer commit to.
good,It was good place to work good people and good money. Got breaks. The co workers were nice bosses were cool. Extra shifts were always up for grabs....
good,"it all depends on where you work and whom you work with "
good,"This was my first job right out of high school.  My manager was great.  The pay was terrible, but I had a good time working there. Easy place to work."
good,"I met a variety of people working for this company, but never had a bad experience. All the way up to District Management level, everyone was kind and friendly."
good,Family dollar doesn't pay enough and make it mandatory that you travel to other locations to help them out.  They do not give managers lunches and it only allows 1 person in the morning to open the store.  They do not have enough hours for the 5 people employed in the store unless it is a training store.
good,"Manager at this workplace constantly gave busy work and would make us work on projects that wouldn't even be implemented into the store. I learned a lot about customer service but I feel like if the environment was more relaxed, employees would get a lot more useful things done."
good,Needed a job so I could get on my feet I was struggling had no house no where to live so I needed a job to get back on my feet and a roof over my head and some money in my pocket so I could do better in life
good,Listen to your employees concerns when it comes to different ideas. The store I worked at didn't supply floor mats for  cashiers. Standing in one spot can be painful.
good,"It was an ok experience to learn stocking and learning how to work with the register. It taught me alot on how to pick up slack but other than that, poor management."
good,"Greeting Customers "
good,When I work here you meet new people everyday and that is rewarding but none of the CDR s are full time you can only be full time with benefits if you are management
good,productive place if it had proper management and if theft was not part of your everyday work having to deal with the same people stealing and no action was being token
good,"If you're looking for a small part time job, this place is just right for it."
good,"Not enough pay for the amount of work that is being done, Standing on your feet with little to one 30 minute break. No holiday pay no discounts very the job is very fast paced but the people are great"
good,it has been a while for working for this company. I do not know what they offer at this present time. the company was a decent one when I worked for them
good,Would be better if Managment was better . Flexible hours when they can . Management just doesn't know how to manage is the only problem with the store I was working at . but other then that it was amazing .
good,"It was a good job good coworkers but it just wasn’t for me , The income was just to low for me It wasn’t enough for me to take care of bills and take care of food in my house."
good,Family Dollar warehouse is the first place if they ever let me get to drive a forklift that's where I learn to drive a forklift and they also got me certified was loading trucks with pallets and unloading truck
good,"All managers are over worked and under appreciated"
good,The company need to hired better manager and assistance manager in the stores.and people need to learn to work because the work is not the hard.they like standing around talking instead of working.
good,"Very productive work place meet and greet customers, assist in sales, and answer questions about products and services.Good place to be employees for part time or full time work."
good,Its an okay job for students in high school or college. Could start the pay at $10.00 at least. That would be more suitable but its apretty easy job just a lot of standing of course
good,Ok company to work for if you like working retail.  Hard to get upper management to help get you back working after being on medical leave.  Not very helpful.
good,A good learning experience  just not either risking my life for on a daily basis this job had people that come in to steal rob and hurt the actual workers that are there and they will boot get security
good,"Too many hours not enough pay for managers. Very inconsistent hours for management, regular employees better positions but bad pay rate. Work too hard to the money they pay you"
good,You must stay on top of your job duties. Customers service is number one in the establishment. Keep your personal life separate from your work life and everything will be smooth sailing.
good,it had its ups and downs what I liked the most was the employs they were all down to earth and I loved working with them but the negatives about it are that I wasn't aloud to advance it the work place after already being promised
good,"not a happy environment, very stressful, long hours, no bonus. "
good,I worked with people that were very helpful and friendly. we all made it fun to work together and always got the job done. we also grew to be very good friend and one of the ladies that I worked became my best friend
good,not too much to say about family dollar.the pay was not enough to live off of even when they gave me fourty hours a week.it was a busy and steady job but no advancement
good,I worked for family dollar for five years and it not a place where you get good benefits and they don't threat there workers fair just my opinion but its ok
good,Family dollar is very one on one with the customer. You will have to deal with some that are rude and others that just don't care about you profession.
good,"What I like most about the company is the opportunity for advancement. If you work hard, it will be noticed because the company will always promote from within before seeking outside employees."
good,FAmily Dollar Was and okay store to work in just the location was pretty ruff and alot of people stole out of that store but it was a great place to work in besides the mice and rats that lived in the store
good,"Have not worked for them in awhile. Long hours, not staffed properly, provided no security to prevent theft, Lifting unrealistic timelines to get stock on shelves with minimal help"
good,This is an okay place to work if you are looking for a part time job. The hours were all over the place. There weren't a lot of hours to go around and they were understaffed.
good,"Worked for company for 11 years as a store manager. Is very challenging at times and fast paced during holiday seasons. Benefits packages are good and option to purchase company stocks. Felt like Upper Management really isn't concerned about employees, as long as stores open and cash register's ringing they are happy. In the 11 years my stores had been robbed 6 times including a friend of mine who was killed in robbery. Don't feel adequate payroll is given out and in many instances the manager or assistant managers are working by themselves alot and running unnecessary risks. Therefore I would not recommend friends or family work for the company as too many safety issues at store level."
good,open close balance registers as well as reports and schedules and training each associate that is hired. and keeping with occurances with the associate to set on the right path.
good,The one that i worked at was pretty good. I felt very welcome with my store manager and i enjoyed it there. I left only because it was something temporary for me.
good,"A typical day was good me and my teams made sure we finished all the assignments during the day, so at the end we could just be finished and have the store ready for the next day."
good,"Constantly moving. Unloading truck everyday ,making sure I store look nice . I was in charge of schematics and recovery of the store making sure everything is in their .know how to use a cash register and good customer service."
good,working here was very stressful. you had to be well aware of your surroundings because we were always dealing with aggressive customers. management was very poor in helping with employees
good,Poor management no controll management pick on who they know not who best of the position. Other than that its alrite flixibe hours clean and friendly.
good,"Manager gives out work schedule with a days notice, didn't let me go to doctor appointments for my kid, complained when I would use the restroom. Co-worker gets 10-20 minute smoke break but I can't be in the restroom more then 5 minutes because i'm a guy."
good,okay place to work when looking for employment. good with scheduling when you have a second job. only bad part are the benefits and not being able to be full time
good,"I enjoyed working there most of the time, but it is a very stressful position as a manager. I had to work long hours and it can be very physical. It is a job for someone that doesn't mind hard work, stress and putting in long hours a week."
good,"This was one job I just didnt really like. I was part time evenings. I cashiered. If you had to void something out, you had to call a supervisor every single time, which was counterproductive."
good,"I was hired as full time employee however, I received part time hours. I often asked my manager about additional hours and he would give me some excuse."
good,"Family Dollar is a ok place to work, cashiers are to ring up customers and stock from the truck.  They expect the truck done by Tuesday when it comes on Mondays."
good,"I liked working at family dollar. I didn't like the fact I wasn't told I would be part time , or that I wasn't going to get any hours. I would have stay"
good,great place to work. really bad neighborhood.  a lot of homeless/poor come in to steal .store was robbed three times. two of the time was in the same year
good,"I only worked part time but enjoyed it. I was working two jobs, family Dollar being one of them. Had to only work weekends but my manager only let me worked one day."
good,It was an okay place to work. I was only part time so I don’t know too much of the company but in my short experience it was pretty decent. The manager was very nice.
good,Family Dollar was a very laid back company. You start your shift and stock shelves most of the time you assist with the customers needs and when it was time to go you would close out your drawer and clean the store and leave. The workest thing about the job was the fact that your schedule was always changing.
good,You were required to do everything from running the register to unloading the truck and stocking. No matter the position you were hired as. I'm not saying this as a bad thing but it can be for those applying for just a cashier role.
good,"I did love my job for the type of work and for customer interaction, but I felt that corporate did not hear us when we had issues. I also felt like they do not pay Assistant Managers and Managers enough for all that we take care of. I started at $8.00 an hour but left (as an Assistant Manager) with only $9.80. For someone who worked hard to get promoted quickly, I feel like I was not appreciated by corporate."
good,"It was a busy, face paced job faced with many hardships and hard labor and personally, the management never recognized the hard work put in. As much as you tried to fulfill all their requests and demands, it never seemed enough for them."
good,Very fast paced during rush hour. The co-workers make you feel like you are in a family. It's a good way to get your foot in the door for a management position.
good,"My experience at Family Dollar was really short, my typical day was building shelves and stocking them to help set up their new store that they were opening up."
good,all three managers was wonderful to work with an for they made sure you was took care of . They would always help put out stock. They are one huge family. if you needed time for family emergency they  were understanding
good,I loved working there however management was not good at all. But that's life I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot. The customers were great at supporting us.
good,I helped put the store together. I enjoyed working here because management was excellent. I lived close by and the hours were good. The other employees were team players also.
good,Family Dollar is a relaxed place of work that pays weekly. The management team made it easy for work to get done. It's a easy job. Sometimes the job can get hectic
good,Family Dollar Allowed me to learn how to stock. Also I was able to learn how to unload truck and perform cycle counts with the company. It was a great experience
good,Always on feet having something to do. I enjoyed working with other employees there and my supervisor knew and understood my situation.  Unfortunately I could not relocate.
good,This was a great job to teach all the beginning tools needed for a career in management. I was taught how to handle different employee situations. Very flexible hours
good,"I've learned to be more open. I've learned how to make the best possible decision for me and my customers. Family Dollar taught me how to become more attentive, courteous, and more responsible."
good,"Operated cash register efficiently, with no error.  Closed out register at end of shift and all balanced.  "
good,"Everyone is under paid for the amount of work that is required. All stores, except training stores, are also understaffed. There are not enough hours given to store managers to be able to effectively run the business."
good,First job after being stay at home mom. manager was great and even though it was part time I was able to pick up hours at other stores and work full time hours
good,"Typical day at work included working with new stock, over stock, and making sure the store was in working order. Keeping up with all the paper work and if the store it self needed anything such as maintenance, or any other in store things. Talking to customers and helping them find anything they might need."
good,Was able to pick up a job and find another job while working this job. Easy and carefree without the stress of some retail jobs. Wanted to move up but did not stay there enough to do so.
good,its a good job. Especially if you want to be an assistant or manager because the pay is good. But a normal employee is good to be a student or someone who does not have much responsibility.
good,They dont pay you enough for everything they expect of you to do not only are you the cashier you have to stock the merchandise and take care of the customers all at the same rime by yourself
good,"The stores don't have enough hours to schedule more employees, it's under pay for work load. I learn how to put a store together, re-banner, and work schematics.."
good,It was nice working there at first but things started going down hill when i was there for a while things were comming up missing and people blaming people.
good,the hardest part of the job was doing by your self most of the time because the managers didn't want to do there job because they was to busy on the phone .
good,"Long. production. Management. competive. Having to work mandatory overtime. Going Home. It was a challeng to work in production maintenance. In the future, I would prefer to work in work setting that I have a choice of overtime."
good,"Regular fast paced retail environment, not a lot of time off, salaried so the requirement is a 6 day 52 hour work week, this job is not for the meek, a lot of walking, bending, lifting, stocking, retail Management 101"
good,"This job was okay, hours were decent, but very unorganized. No real training. No set breaks. Customers were rude. But I was able to keep positive attitude."
good,It was a good job with nice pay but truck days did not work for me personally. The workers were easy to get along with and the customers were not bad. The location was good.
good,The job is what you make it I enjoyed it until we kept getting robbed they never sent security and no one ever checked on the store afterwards I wish them well a great  place to work
good,I loved working with the people there. I loved my other employees. I think they need to be more organized with the general management in them all. They are very organized with their stock and scheduling.
good,"It's a good job to have, an ok company that's doing pretty good. The work isn't really hard but it can get aggravating at times. You will to watch out for thevies."
good,Very fast paced and very corporate feel at this company.  Great company to work for and they believe in promoting within instead or hiring outside the organization.
good,This place was always friendly. Supervisors were awesome and supportive. There was never a dull moment. I really enjoyed working there. Benefits were good.
good,"Loved family dollar store, my manager was awesome and very flexible in schedule.. we got short staffed and i had small kids at the time so i had to quit."
good,When I first started I was a LP after that became a  Assistant manager no training no nothing is stuck me their I leaned by trial-and-error  The district manager find me for no reason because a store failed inspection when that happened the whole so caught fire I think it was unfair to do so
good,The people have a lot to do the dishes next time you can also get the chance that they are the same guy who will make you a task for a new me to snatch your off of me 5if you don't hear me now
good,"A good job if all you want to do is gain extra spending money  but dont expect it to be liveable wage. Its a pretty chill environment to work in, just only a few people should make it a permanent thing."
good,"Retail is a difficult occupation and it requires a certain person to be able to make a career of it. Especially, in a ""high risk"" location such as this one. A typical day would consist of seasonal sets, planograms, recovery and being harassed or even assaulted by shoplifters."
good,"Family dollar is exactly in the title, Families come in all thw time for household or personal items. Very ""home-oriented"" kind of store. Family dollar is for the family ans i recommend."
good,"Family Dollar is good for a career change but compensation is not sufficient for Cost of Living. Not to mention it is not competitive and it is likely the reason we are constantly short staffed and doing IT, HR, and a little Payroll all in one position."
good,At first i was single fresh out of high school but then i got married and all my life was just work I did't have any time to keep up with my personal life.
good,workload heavy back breaking work with no help no bonus ever rewarded no raise ever given. great culture of people leadership questionable always new management
good,"I liked working for family dollar. I interacted very well with the consumers as well as other employees, management was very helpful and concerned about our work experience."
good,"working at family dollar gave me a very good insight of what daily retail was all about,its an absolute joy to be working wit customers on a one an one basis,just seeing how genuienly happy u make a customer is worth being at work.A typical day at work means making sure u store is clean well stocked and ,staffed."
good,"Working at Family Dollar had taught me many valuable things. I have moved up since beginning here. I learned leadership, organization, and communication skills"
good,I’ve had a bad experience with family dollar . I believe it is because the store manager I worked with. I made it aware to the district manger there was a problem but nothing was done to resolve it.
good,"I never felt safe at work, there were physical fights in the store between customers. I saw weapons and drugs on numerous occasions. Constant heavy lifting 50lbs or more. The location was no good. Customer service, money management, daily cleaning and light paperwork."
good,I liked it there but the major downfalls were payroll or lack there of considering the amount of work required and the amount of physical labor required (taking in truck).
good,"I advanced pretty quickly in this job. I loved greeting customers and being able to train the oncoming employees. Management department could be adjusted a little bit , but overall, they worked with my school schedule on the important days."
good,You have to be able to work and think fast due to the constant change in customer volume . good customer service skills are also important in this work place.
good,Family dollar is a fast paced environment. My days were spent receiving deliveries and stocking the shelves. When it got busy I was required to cashier.
good,I enjoyed working with customers an liked the deal of a clean store it was managerent issue inside the store such as unorganiation in the store their was no type of structure inside the store.
good,I love working at Family Dollar because of the joy the customers bring. I love helping and assisting the customers on the floor. I really enjoy my management team because we all work together as one. We all help one another get the job done.
good,"Enjoyed working there "
good,"I put up stock on the shelf in the mornings,  also I clean my work space when work is completed. also cashier when needed dealing  with customer  purchases."
good,"They have unreasonable demandsof their employees, don't want to pay you for the extra they expect you to do and then wantto cut they're employees' hours every couple of months"
good,There usually aren't enough employees. The store is always dirty with boxes on the floor and backroom full. Managers take to many vacations. Won't transfer you to another store but expects you to work there when asked.
good,i liked working here because there was always something to do. we were always busy with something. downfall is that my boss at the time was really hard to please and i felt like i couldnt do anything right half the time. i ended up quitting because i wanted to be at home with my son and because i didnt feel like my boss really wanted me as an employee anymore. it just turned into a really negative experience towards the end.
good,"Cashiering, front stocking and cleaning the areas around me attending costumers, making sure we were stocked with the items of the week. unloading the truck on some days .replenisahing our stock around the store."
good,I did not have any major trouble there I had a good manager who worked around anything you needed the best she could and who treated you like family no complaints
good,I started out helping the district manager at all the different stores and then ended up getting placed at a store being cashier and stocker. I was unloading trucks and also putting out merchandise
good,Not a very good company to work for the company is hard to get the corporate office to cooperate and help keep the store in tip top shape as well as not much room for advancement
good,well my boss was a drunk she missed work i had to come in when i wasnt suppose to i opened and closed the store i did paper work and the money it was fast paced i like my job till they cut hours
good,"Very busy, quick paced, need lots of knowledge with the sore and its products. The hardest part was the work schedules. The best part was the customers."
good,"Good work experience for my first job, learned how to handle customers and greet, learned and did many hands on activities, did not receive merchandiser hands on but was a stocker as well with working the register"
good,with my experience there was no support from corperate office. It was just figure it and do what ever they were not there to give any answers or even help to find solutions
good,Overall a good company to work for. Could use better security for safty reasons but good benefits grest workers who wanna advance. Possibly could use higher pay
good,"It's a job, it helps out with putting a couple dollars in your pocket, but depend on it, I wouldn't everything about the job, the store, the structure is fine its just not enough pay to support a family"
good,okay place to work. fast pace especially on holidays and truck days. the environment was a good one when you have great managers that will work with you when you need time off.
good,I have not been there long enough to write a reviewI know people get hired on and they leave they are always short staffed plenty opportunity name and they don’t like overtime for you to get overtime or care or manager of our store quick and we’re pressed be getting a new Windsor so I’ve been working all the hours that I can work even a lot of overtime
good,A typical day at Family Dollar can be fun and exciting and also some days stressful. Management is there when they choose to be. You sometimes are required to work many hours alone in the store without break. The customers can be great some days and trouble others. I enjoy the job itself and the work that comes with running a retail store. I just wish there was a little more incentive to work as hard as they expect you to. They are flexible with hours and you do receive a paycheck.
good,"The typical day of work consist of labor friendly work, and greeting customers and providing top quality customer service. Good management training to prepare you for the next level, while providing an opportunity to hone customer skills as well as have opportunity to advance. The most pleasurable part of the job is the relationship building with the customers, and networking to help provide future possibilities and great professional connection."
good,It was okay a lot of sudden changes but overall decent company. Fast paced for the most part because of the area I worked in. High theft area so that made it a little harder. I got to meet a lot of different people that I grew to love.
good,this job is a ok job my experience wasn't so great i didn't get trained properly but its a ok experience for anyone looking for retail and is ok at working at a fast pace
good,Management at the location I worked was rough. I enjoyed working there otherwise because it was close to home and they worked with my college hours well. I didn't have any issues with any of the other coworkers it just seemed to be management.
good,"At Family Dollar every thing's pretty slow. We have days were we may receive little or no customers at all. The most enjoyable part about the job is, having people around that are just like you. They could do better with management, but overall the store is okay."
good,It's not enough employees. They don't grant enough hours not even on truck day. They don't really care about their employees. All hard work gets over looked and unappreciated.
good,"It was a learning experience, help get my feet wet in the management field, co-workers and management was good to be around. The pay was not the best but weekly pay made it ok to get by on."
good,Punch in count a till. Run register for a few hours then a cashier comes in. After they get on a till that's when I get started on my daily tasks. Really there is not a hard part of my job.
good,I liked working here however my brother in law got beat to death and i needed time off as it hit my family very hard and fast. they refuse to rehire even though since then i have increased my knowledge dramatically.
good,"I have worked at several different family dollars, all was great except the only issue was when we had a turn over with managers. And they had brought their own employees from a different store, therefore they weeded out the previous employess. Other then that, family dollar had been a good place to work"
good,I learned how to interact with different people. I learned what customer service was and how to handle cash. I learned how to stock and keep store clean and organized.
good,Working for family dollar is great to meet different people and establish a customer relationship with.  Family dollar is a good place to work if you like fast pace environement
good,This was a good stepping stone for me into management.  I always enjoy meeting new customers and helping them find what they need.  It was a challenging work environment and close to home.
good,I was management and i would never do it again. I felt like the management team was a joke and didnt really care about others. The DM was great though just my boss wasnt.
good,They have a lot of ups and downs with in this job. You can go far but the require a lot of your time and hard work for a lil pay. This job is really a fun job if you are placed at the right store with the right people.
good,"As a store manager in Family Dollar, it was an experience. My day mainly consisted of being lead cashier and stocking, as well as being security. I was every in that store. Corporate was horrible. No room for advancement. But the pay was excellent."
good,All Family dollars are fast paced. So if you are looking for a fast pace job this is it. Family dollar is a good job for short while. I would not recommend this job as a career.
good,a typical day at family dollar is really stressful. so much work is put on one person such as unloading a huge truck full of inventory items to stock in the store.
good,"Working with Family Dollar really tested my patients. Not only are customers rude but the coworkers as well, especially management. I was able to expand my communication as well as knowledge. Despite the differences it is still a great work experience."
good,"I work their to make money "
good,"There were issues with communication and constant problems with merchandise. Also they paid an assistant manager $9.25 an hour when we had to do all the price changes, merchandise changes, inventory and an assortment of other duties that were originally supposed to be done by the manager. I do believe it had potential to be a good workplace but they need to pay attention to their employees more and become a little more organized with daily functions."
good,"I enjoyed working for family dollar but when the most recent manager left is when I left. The environment was okayish, but then again not that professional which isn't a bad thing but still. A typical day at work started with some stock running and scanning over the back room seeing what I could put on the floor, then toward the end more cleaning and straightening up and doing paper work. I learned a lot about team work and how to manage my time more. Management wasn't always the best, but teamwork really helps when trying to run a store. the hardest part of the job was avoiding the drama everything else was a piece of cake honestly! The culture was very mixed and thrown around working here. Most enjoyable part of the job was the costumers that came in everyday for there same basic needs."
good,"I liked the job and the area, the people around me were nice and listened to what I had to say and did well with helping me on all the questions I had about the job."
good,"A typical day at work consist of waiting on customers, stocking shelves and zoning, cleaning, unloading the truck on truck day."
good,Come to work off load truck on delivery days and stock shelves.  Help customers find items. Management was alright.  The hardest part of the job was the lifting boxes. No real good part just everyday stuff.
good,"always had to keep store clean. the manager i worked with was poor , she did not have us working in order. made our schedules late and last minute changes all the time. work environment is fast specially in the afternoon."
good,"For the most part, I like my job pretty well. It wasn't too strenuous but could get quite busy at times. especially around holidays. My coworkers were very nice, and the manager is a good guy."
good,Stock and cashier.Only there few very stressed job only get 10 cents raised .Like some of them not place too work for cheap on everthing do want pay employees
good,"•	Recommended merchandise to customers based on their needs and preferences."
good,In general just a bad place to work. No payroll so Store Managers are forced to work very long hours and go through high stress both mentally and physically
good,It was a really nice environment to work in very family oriented and fast pace place keep you on your toes at all times. Very good for a high school student.
good,"You would clock in and count your draw. Help customers at the cash register and re-stock selves. You would clean, reface everything and then count your draw before leaving."
good,"Family Dollar is a family friendly workplace. The job is fast paced, competitve and ideal if you like that sort of thing. I loved it however I had to leave due to too many scheduling conflicts with my other job."
good,customer services stocking cash handling unloading trucks paper work checking in vendors helping  the manager help cashiers run back up work as a team and recover store
good,"Family dollar is a good place to work if your just graduating from high school, if you are just seeking another job its not worth it but all in all its a pretty fun place to work."
good,In hindsight their was always something to do though not to sound ungrateful but the pay wasn't the best. Even though it was a great enviroment to work in.
good,"I was a team member here for over a year and a half , and never called in sick a single time. there were co-workers that did it often and they were given way better treatment. wouldnt recomend"
good,"I Learned a lot from this job , pro and cons . Meet a lot of people and got to mix and mingle with others, if they wanted me to come back I would . Very nice people"
good,Family dollar is a neighborhood store dollar store is a store ment for quickservice for a low price and for me family dollar is a great opportunity for most
good,"Great job, just lack career advancement."
good,The co workers were great but honestly all together management wasn’t so great. I don’t believe that they did there best and that’s one of the reasons that I left other than my surgery.
good,"Family Dollar was a good place to work except for the fact that it felt as though we were understaffed a lot of the time. Most of the time tasks such as unloading trucks, stocking merchandise, handling and checking out customers was split between two people. If there were at least one other person there, the working conditions would have been much more enjoyable."
good,"This was ok. It's pretty typical retail environment with low wages and lots of stress. My store was pretty bad because the store manager was a lazy slob but I can't say whether or not that is the norm. I do know, from my experience, that the ""open door policy"" is a joke."
good,Clean friendly environment. The pace was fast but steady. Customers was satisfied with the way I handled their items. The associates work together as a team
good,"Day goes by fast, always work to do.  They have company lunches and perfect attendance awards.  Production is paid incentive pay however 40 hours are not protected."
good,I did stocking and was cashier and assiant manger.. The manger and the crews was cool the customers was friendly and respectful... they always had fundraiser...
good,"Like most large corporations, upper management is disconnected from employees in the field and expectations are unrealistic. Training is too short and  does not completely prepare any candidate for their respective roles."
good,"I enjoyed working with people on a daily basis,  assisting customers  in locating products, in addition to front line exposure; not certain of owner and upper management leadership qualities. limited experience overall."
good,"Although its an easy job my schooling was an issue when it came down to it. The customers were easy to talk to, the work wasn't complicated at all. The freight was fairly easy to unload. the best part of the job was closing at a reasonable time."
good,"You do your job, meet, greet and teller ring up store items and foods, keep store clean. keep items stocked and lined up on the shelf. And all sell items in the sore at acceptable display and organized. management was perceptive. And did not tolerate trouble causing workers. Their was no hardest part of the job. The job itself was fun, busy. but relaxed as well. I enjoyed the job itself."
good,"not a bad job to start as a teen or someone starting off, but it doesn't pay too much as expected because it is not too difficult of a job. I enjoyed it."
good,The company was a great organization to learn how to manage a small retail store. I was able to engage in great customer relations as well as lead by example.
good,the time i worked at family dollar was good just wasnt enough work hours. pay was to low and not enough working hours for the employees. didnt have any good benefits
good,a typical day at work was very stressful and not fun the store was always dirty and everything was always thrown around  always a different thing everyday  but i needed the job at the  time  but if they offered me a job i would never go back to that store again
good,"Family Dollar would be good job for any young adult it just very unorganized, just make sure you have a second job on hand "
good,It is an okay place to work if you are just starting out in the work force. I started back in 2005 and it was my first job in retail. After nine years I did move up fom a cashier to a field specialist/assistant.
good,Team members are very helpful of other and customers. General manager not very friendly but over all consistant work and always busy and always reliable.
good,Poor management lack of hiring people to help the team. Poor customer service. Products were always in the floor. Too many followers not enough leaders
good,"Very fast paced and the customers are dearly missed. Was a position that I was easily able to jump right into since I had previous retail experience. "
good,"Family dollar was a fast pace, getting out merchandise, checking in vendors & I really enjoyed helping the customers.Typical day is keeping the store clean & safe."
good,"Constant on the move kind of job, love the customers. Nice people to work with, make good days. Alot of stuff to do but if you like to keep moving then this is the place."
good,A good place to work if u can handle a fast paced work environment  and are good at customer service. And can work well with others  can lift over 20 pounds
good,"·	anticipate and deal with customers issues"
good,I reccomend this job for those who really need a job immediartely.  Poor pay and poor benefits. Assitant managers get paid $10/hr and sale associates $8.20.
good,Nice Place To Work At Family Dollar Good Customer Service Skills people nice where I was working will all was tell people about the job so thay will no about it pay is low put the job is ok good place to work
good,"it has been so long since ive worked for family dollar, i don't really have an opinion on the company and don't know how the managers are now. and i don't even live in the state that i worked at before."
good,It's been over 10 years since I have worked for Family Dollar.  The company has been bought and I don't have a feeling of what work is like there now.
good,4hours. Zoning lots of freight. Management was very good. Schedule was good.co workers very noliegeable.not enough hours for management to workers. Very busy company. Change up shelves and merchanize and most poducts needed more room. To much product for something like seasonal stuff all at once a less of others. Finding room for overstock and not having backroom for freezer stuff.
good,"Lots of stocking, fast pace. Always busy with lots of work to do never  a bored moment. From customers to job duties your shift will go from start to end"
good,"Not a bad place to work, management was good, employees, worked well together hardest part of the job was when the truck would come and you have to be at the job by 5:30 some mornings to unload. The most enjoyable part was meeting the customers."
good,"A typical day. Start my day at 8:30 in the morning by counting the safe and till. Then I would wait for 9:00 am. Open the store and greet customers. If the truck came I would put up stock while I had a cashier to ring up customers.  I would ask the cashier to take lunch and I would run the cash register. I loved what I did I would always be doing something to help the store."
good,"It was a Temporary job, that was supposed to become a full- time job in Hart, MI, but was given the run around by Corporate management. I helped construct a brand new Family Dollar in Walkerville, MI by putting up shelving, product, and office furniture, and equipment."
good,It was not a bad job. Can be stressful because they want you to do ten things at once. The job is fast paced. I enjoyed working there. Not enough pay though. I enjoyed helping customers and working together as a team. There was not enough help because the hours available were were minimum.
good,"it was a fun environment to work for, great staff but the pay could have been more. The company does not have room for growth but overall it was a bad experience"
good,"Family was a cool place to work, it was fast paced, alot of work and dedication, it's just not enough team work but over all it was fun. Always had alot of work to do."
good,Expectations are grossly over inflated for the general economic environment of the store location. Theft was rampant and payroll hours did not adequately reflect an offset to this problem. This particular location had an extreme rodent problem which caused multiple extermination events and closings.
good,"Although I think my managers were likely my favorite while working there, the income was not livable and there was little room for growth."
good,"I did learn a lot from working at this company. Since the merger with with Dollar Tree however, I must say the culture has changed and company moral within Family Dollar is very poor. Team Members are not made to feel valued for the work they do, but rather that they are indebted to proving their worth to management. Not very many opportunities in IT to grow here but it is a good stepping stone"
good,"working here was a real task, you had to have patience in order to deal with most walk in customers, the responsibility is over your head, and management is not the best."
good,"Overworked and underpaid, not enough staff.  There is too much work and not enough staff to accomplish the mission. Family Dollar can be better if paid more and carried more staff."
good,"Always work to do. Can be stressful at times, specially during the holidays. A lot of people come and go because they can not work under pressure . They will work around your schedule"
good,Nothing highclass that's for sure But its a job. Stock when no ones in store and got to clerk when someone needs to buy something other than that. you will get the occasional truck unloading which is normally nothing over 1000+ pieces so simple and easy.
good,It was a very fast past work environment rewarding at times and then at times it could be draining depending on the store you worked at that day the only thing i didn't like is people always quit
good,we unloaded trucks stocked shelves ran the register help customer find different items when needed answered customer complaints. it was a fast pace work environment due to location it was a high volume store
good,I.T was fun . Worth the job. Seeing the regulars were always fun and meeting new people was better. Loved only one of my managers tho. She was really cool don’t work there anymore fortunately. She’s my fave kink now.
good,There was a lot of ups and downs while working for the company.  When I got pregnant I had been advised to stay home due to high risk pregnancy.  The management however needed improvement as there was not very good management.
good,it was ok. long hours. do not like to give raises. I was in 3 stores in a month. get one store cleaned up moved to a different store. hard to find good help in some areas.
good,Assisted customers with check their checkout purchases also restocking Shelves. Unloading truck once or twice a week. This was a very easy and straight forward job.
good,Working at Family Dollar was nice. It was a fast paced environment and very stressful at times. the customers made the job wonderful. 
good,"cool place to work , sometimes you can get a lot of hours depending on what location you are at . good deals . fast paced work environment. no time off."
good,No one wants to pay you for doing everyone's job. No raises to black people with experience. Give all the raises to the young white people with GEDs. Don't make a easy job hard.
good,During my time with family dollar I  learned that upper management is really not the best and they don't make a point of insuring that the store managers are keeping up with what needs to be done in store which falls to the rest of the staff to do in a rush
good,"I had a good assistant store manager position, I enjoyed working for the company and I do believe that it is a good workplace for beginning employees."
good,Family Dollar is struggling to put on this higher retail image and is failing in many areas. To maintain a store that is expected of us we are given little hours which causes the managers to work harder then they need to be. New policies are constantly being added as well as new procedures which is causing a higher turn over rate in hard working employees. I rate family dollar a 3/5 however the cons outweigh the pros my team makes the job easier and we know what is expected of us and in the end we always manage to get the job done.
good,I was moved to manager after less than a year. I slowly realized that the manager takes the brunt of everything from the DM. The job itself is easy enough and the other employees worked well with me and each other.
good,There's different people coming in and out of the store you have to watch  you're a cashier making sure you close and open the store the right way the store is very fast paced and I'm very fast paced person and a neat freak
good,I m fairly new at my position. So far the job Itself is not too bad but there are things like any other company that can be a little different to improve the workplace.
good,working there was very stressful to me. but I enjoyed the customers coming in on the regular. I left because I thought I had found a better job during that time
good,Fun not to slow but steady job. manager is awesome you have your good days and bad days with customers. Hours very flexible very easy to do. Co works are great.
good,"Always busy "
good,"Typical work day at Family dollar was stocking shelves, managing, employees, and strategizing for the team. The most enjoyable part was being able to lead."
good,"I had a great experience working, laid back management, hard working employees . We were Robbed around Christmas time 2016 i left due to not feeling safe"
good,my managers were very rude to me on a daily basis and blamed me for their lack of training. seems everwhere i work the people dont instruct me correclty and get upset when i dont execute right
good,It was an okay place to work at. The hours were long and the pay wasn't all that great but overall you met great people and the 401k plan was actually really good. I never used any of the medical benefits but overall it was a good experience in retail.
good,When i first started here it was quiet it was slow pace and thwn as time went on welost our manager we had a hostile work enivorment everyday but over all .. All family dollars are not like that i just happen to be that way
good,its an okay place to work its slow sometimes and sometimes it gets busy. its sucks when you have to unload the trailer . other than its okay . stock the products
good,"Working for a big corporation like Family Dollar, you're just another employee with someone waiting to replace you. They run their employees ragged.,,"
good,My Store manager was very unprofessional. She was verbally abusive. Her scheduling was really was off. She couldn't get her team to cooperate with authority. And also it was a problem with getting her truck put on the floor.
good,Not fun stress no fun job is bad people work therea gain Not fun job is bad. Never wont work there again nobody should work there the boss is mean and hate black people
good,fun to work in you learn alot from the cowokers its very relaxinfg invierment the let you work in the clothes you like to use the managment is not to bad
good,If you are over the age of 18 its good first job. You will meet a lot of different people but it will give you a fair base for future employment options.
good,"worked in two stores, the store manager can make or break weather it a good place to work or not. The company considers 32 hours a week a full time job. I would say it can be a fairly good place to work if your manager is well trained and hard working but if not, it can be a horrible place to work."
good,Working at family dollar was very inspirational. There was my first time learning how to set up a store by myself. I made me very vigorous and eager to advance i every aspect of my personality. I got use to doing trucks stocking a big store by within 40 hours alone. It made me very committed.
good,"Stocking shelves, cleaning store, setting schematics, signage, and displays were many duties. Daily duties included money handling, customer care, recovering store, and maintaining cleanliness."
good,I didnt like it much.I didnt get alot if hours the pay wasnt good enough  for me. The store was always junky and the manager was lazy and stayed on her cell phone all the time.
good,This was one of the best jobs I've had and my friends were so jealous because they would come in and see me having a ball working and wanted to get in.
good,"Could be a fun chill workplace if everyone did what they were supposed to instead of letting it fall on the asst Manager, could Pay a little better for the work"
good,Made sure every merchandise got put out before we left the store and everything was cleaned as far as shelves and front registers. Made sure customers were happy before they left the store.
good,Highly recommended. Good co workers. Good management. Good customers. Learned a lot about stocking. Different types a retail experience. Can manage money.
good,It was a good experience working for families all I enjoyed it fast pace so it doesn't really bother me I enjoy moving fast and give up getting my job done but the schedule was good for me I was it was very convenient because I live close by so sometime I walked and I enjoy to work with my coworkers very pleasant good place respectable place to be an RN good money
good,Family dollar was one of my favorite jobs that I have worked at. Everyone knew me and I knew everyone there. I knew pretty much how to do everything and I was gonna become an assistant manager.
good,"Family Dollar is a fast paced, sometimes calm environment."
good,a lot of work not enough pay one manager was the best when he left we had a new manager that did not respect the fact that we got of at 10 pm so sometimes i did not get off till 11 pm that was not working for me
good,It was fun  n not a hard job to do n I got along good with the co_workers but da pay was a little low but overall fair but I wouldn't mind working there again
good,i worked great days money was ok needed to find something with more money than what i was getting paid i enjoyed the job it just was something to start at
good,"Family dollar was not a bad place to work for. But the pay was very low and there was no opportunity to advance. this was in the state of North Carolina, other states may be different."
good,"The pay is very low. As a former store manager, I was unable to have a life outside of work. I put in 65+ hours each week and was only paid a salary for 52 hours each week. I felt as though I was working for free majority of the time."
good,Interacted with costumers answered questions about sales and products. Spoke in a nice and sincer manger. Very productive hard working employee. Fast learner.
good,"Family Dollar is a good place to work for one who doesn't have much of a home life. but for those who do, it is not very family friendly, they are well in pay but its almost like you have to threaten them with quitting to receive it. it quite unfair actually."
good,It was a wonderful experience working for Family dollar. I met a lot of people being new to the area. I would not change anything about it. If I still lived there o would have kept it as a part time job
good,"Count change out to people"
good,Good  place to work. District managers are over 20 plus stores which makes them a little hard to get in touch with. Store manager was pleasant and helped as much as possible.
good,"My experience with Family Dollar was up and down. Due to the nature of the business, difficulty was normal. What I did like was our collusion to control shrink."
good,this job was ok it just had to many mess with the company but i stuck with it for 3 years and  it was fun but i had to quit and find new employment but it was fun
good,This company is very unorganized and don't give their staff proper training. They are always having management issues because they don't show the employees appreciation for the work they do.
good,It was OK. the work schedule was flexible and the hours were sufficient. The store was not a safe place to work and the management did not work to make it safer
good,"The work is not strenuous but can be stressful. Social skills are a plus, because you will be dealing with the public on a daily basis. Perfect job for a teen."
good,Started working here during a Family Dollar job fair. I was unaware that we were building up a brand new store and starting out with twenty employees only for the managers to choose two-three they wanted to keep on. We had to build the shelves up and stock the entire store and was let go before the grand opening.
good,"There is always something to do to keep you busy, either stocking of cleaning, but the company does not want to pay the employees what they are worth for all the work that they do making sure the store is clean"
good,"I personally don't think the company cares about their employees and there needs, but I honestly can say I've been with this company for 4 years and it definitely has it's pros and cons"
good,"You work hard for the amount of money they are willing to pay. They want a lot of something for nothing, at least at the store I worked at. It doesn't offer discounts for employees."
good,"I help customers find the items they are looking for, maintain store cleanliness, and sell family dollar products.I count my register before and after shift."
good,it was always busy which was a good thing. i learned how to help the customer no matter what. i was a manager. the work place culture was great. the hardest part was making sure the shelves was stock even when we were busy. i enjoyed the customers the most because you meet some different people
good,"The opportunity is there to move up with the company, you just have to put in a lot of hours. The balance between life and work really isn't good. I wouldn't recommend working there if you have children."
good,"It was an ok job. Very stressful and in the area I worked, cops were always called to deal with robberies, at least once a day. Store manager was very rude to the customers."
good,"******************************great products****************Great place to work and gain experience."
good,Low hourly wages no pay raises from the company after months of employment. Management is very lazy. No health care at all also hours are inconsistent.
good,Enjoyed working for this company. I was trying to move up in the company quit took longer than what I expected. But overall was a good company to work for and would go back to it if needed
good,"I had a great experience I really enjoyed myself , I like the customer service very fast past no problems if so management would take care of it . which was great!"
good,"Great communication goes a long way for a excellent working environment at family dollar, when the staff communicates, the store becomes successful. go family dollar!"
good,"The work itself wasn't always hard.However, having to hurry to get done injured people. I Loved preparing the store for closing and meeting new people."
good,The company is rude and they hire people that have drug addictions and managers who steal time and don't show up for work on time. The store stays very dirty and very hard to keep clean.
good,At family dollar you don't get advancements or overtime. Also the pay is not that good. Could use better management and more incentives to work for the company
good,fast work place. lots and lots of truck and unloading product. Learned you must work very fast and very hard. Management can be upsetting.  The hardest part of the job was management.
good,What I've learned at family dollar is how to manage conflict and how to engage and deal with customers and work together with co-workers. This job taught me the skills and to prepared me for future jobs and how to work under pressure.
good,"I learned how to do inventory, conduct interviews, stock inventory, merchandise new products, advertise seasonal merchandise, completed customer orders, open and close the store."
good,I worked at this company for up to 3 years out of high school there where plenty of work and hours. Some stress but that is at every workplace good business for opportunity to grow
good,"a typical work day at family dollar woud be every busy"
good,Family Dollar was a decent place to work. It was fun to do cashiering and stocking merchandise at the same time. I liked my job but it was hard to get my stocking done at times due to busy with customers.
good,I had this job as my first job and I was kinda thrown in a lions pen. It was good money in my teenage years but as time went on I noticed that I needed more advancement in life.
good,THis job was a good small town job but lacks the ability to advance without the ability to move or if the manager quits or gets promoted. Had to leave for better job
good,"Cashier, stocking, inventory, customer service, sales, handling money. On the job training. Easy to advance. Mostly part time positions. No benefits unless full time."
good,"The regional manager was rude, unsupportive, and didn't care about the employees. The store manager was amazing but is no longer there. Pay is not great."
good,i enjoyed working for this company till the closing of the store. if i could i would love to work for this company again in the furture. thank you very much
good,"part time work, however, still scheduled for 6 days a week, I tried to have my days of work reduced, but it was never consistent in the number of days per week."
good,"Family Dollar is a decent company to work for, as long as you are not a Store Manager. Store Managers are pressed and expected to work extremely long hours, usually a six day work week, working three to four days from open to close. This does not allow for much family time nor down time."
good,A day at work would usually include stocking shelves and checking out customers and assisting them with their shopping needs. I learned how retail works and how to better my customer service. The most enjoyable part of the job was setting up displays for different seasons.
good,Working a family dollar there is always something to do weather its stocking the shelves or ordering inventory. There is no down time where you are stuck looking for something to do and is very fast pace due to the amount of multitasking needed during day to day operations.
good,It was a good spot to work the store was switching owners so they really didnt care about my job location any more they sent me no help an i wad under staffed
good,"I liked working there . you get good pay , the hours are good , just needed something more you mostly work by yourself but its better that way you get a lot done."
good,Family Dollar is a Fun and very busy place to work. there is a lot of stocking and cleaning involved. Have to have good customer service skills. Also patience.
good,"This employer is a good place to use to fill in until you can secure something better. I enjoyed working with my co workers and they paid weekly, but over all, I needed more security."
good,super company i loved it great great great it was amazing loved the people there and management i will like to work here again i loved it so much and great benegits
good,"Family Dollar is a compelling place to work. However, at any time the rules can change per situation. There isn't any set in stone company policies. I must say that I learned a lot. Family Dollar was definitely the hump in my professional career."
good,"Family dollar is a ok place to work. the conditions that they have you work in. sometimes are crazy. they want everything to revolve around family dollar, they disregard anything that's going on in your personal life."
good,Nice for a high schooler wanting a part-time job. I wouldn't recommend this job to someone wanting to save money nor start a business with serious bills.
good,A typical day at work involves coming in and working by yourself for the rest of the day.  My manager always seemed overstressed and constantly complained that we weren't helping her enough though we all did what we were trained to do.
good,"Working at Family dollar was rewarding and a learning experience. The management was making sure you knew what you were doing, but I could have been trained a little better. It was an amazing time and the team was awesome."
good,"I can't necessarily give a good or bad review on Family Dollar as the job I did was just temporary."
good,"family Dollar is a low paying job that contains alot of stress and activity, but can be great for people that never worked before and  just graduated out of high school."
good,"Family Dollar was a great place for me to have a career at. I enjoyed my co-workers and have even remained friends with some of them after a couple of years. I learned how to restock, receive stock, do exchanges/returns, manage all types of customers."
good,"Some days were good and some days were not so good that’s a typical day at any work place, I learned to count money better to deal with any customers, my manager was a fair person, and the most fun part was to help the customers get what they want!"
good,"The experience I have had working with this company hasn't been a bad one. The staff from store to store is relatively small, meaning its more of a family based atmosphere. Everyone looks out for one another to make it work."
good,"Not an overly complicated place to work as far as a retail environment goes, however, they are always short staffed and you will always be given way more than you can complete in a single shift."
good,I really like working at my store the only thing is that as store managers we do not get enough payroll to cover most shifts so that makes it difficult to get everything done.
good,A typical day at work would consist of people stealing the most random items even children steal. I wouldn't recommend working there but a job is a job.
good,"the store itself was a mess and unorganized "
good,I would go back if I had the opportunity to under differerent management.  The upper management that I worked under was really indecicive and not stable at all.
good,"I didn't have a problem doing my job there, I just never got to see my children when I worked there. I was a single mother and I needed to be home for them in the evenings. So I found another job that I was able to be home at nights."
good,At one point I did worked  and really liked this company but now that is owned by Dollar tree... I don't recommend this company to work for............
good,"...for working for the company since I was contracted through Signature Consultants.  I did not work directly for FDO.  The people were nice, but the hours were not the best.  I left when the contract ended."
good,It was an ok work environment but when I left it was do to a cut in my hours that was later explained to be nothing to do with my work but with someone elses. When I reapplied to try to get my job back after they clearly made a mistake I was deemed unhirable as someone who quit it when I really put in my two weeks the way I was supposed to . Not fair practices at all
good,"no consistance there, store manager lacks ability to treat everyone the same, has favorites, assistant manager are never treated equal, they are favored by store manager"
good,"Nice place, friendly customers, a good place to work. I learned that you can move up in your position at family dollar in no time. You also get paid weekly so that's a GREAT BONUS"
good,Customers are excellent. I loved the environment I was in my co-workers were awesome. As a Team we kept a clean environment no matter what the circumstances were.
good,"IT was an ok place to work, flexible schedule. They worked with me as I just had a baby. Typical work day consist of ringing up customers order and unpacking shipments."
good,"Family dollar it a pretty decent place to work for highschoolers or college students, i learned how to work a cash register and how to restock, recover and read barcode scan numbers."
good,"Family dollar was a great experience, working with the people in my neighborhood and providing smiles for people who really could use one. I would recommend this job for someone just starting off."
good,"great people and management, somewhat stressful, and absolutely love the customer. love to work there again was a great palce to work at. some of the best people to work with"
good,This is a job worked right after high school to purchase a car for traveling purposes. My goals were to attend college and pursue a degree in nursing.
good,"I feel that my manager needed more manager training. She was alway siting and complaining about her job. She stated that she was moving thing and putting them in the wrong spot to see if someone going to move it. I understand that she was testing us but we have enough to deal with on a day to day bases like stocking, watching out for shoplifters, getting customers in and out, etc...."
good,"Great place to interact closely with customers. Typical day included cash handling, recovering store, and unloading trucks. Flexible scheduling to assist employees with families. Low compensation."
good,"Eating: Assists residents with menu selection, checks diet trays with diet orders before serving trays. Sets up, assists and/or feeds residents as needed. Removes trays/meals; assists with personal after-meal care. Supervises residents while eating; promotes and encourages social interactions during meals. Serves nourishments and fresh water. Maintains awareness of special orders for fluid retention and snacks as ordered."
good,"It was a nice experience.  I would have enjoyed it more if there was more consistency or staff to pick up the slack instead of over working the workera there. Other than that, I enjoyed my time there."
good,Fast paced job. I enjoyed working there cause I was always busy and it seemed like when it got busy the hours went by fast. Great coworkers. Enjoyed they  daily customers
good,friendly place to work and meet new people everyday and the thrill of being able to help costumers find what they are looking for and having good staff to work with
good,Getting to meet all types of people. Providing excellent customer service. Pay raises and advancement was not a very good option. I learned how to stock shelves and remove out dated products.
good,The hardest part of being cashier is dealing with I rate customers because they usually are mad about something you can't control. Other than that is an ok job.
good,Store managers work was very intense. I did learn quite a bit from working there. Most of the customers were very friendly but you did need to learn how to deal with the irate ones also.
good,"Great Place to work, just got to have better pay for the work and better store management. Loved the shifts and people you meet, but dint like that some of the stores where really dirty in back room and in store. and the stock was out of controle."
good,If you are looking for a fast pace environment this is the place to work. I would actually consider working for this company again the pay could have been better.
good,I wouldn't tell anyone to work there. They work you like a dog. And didn't really  get breaks. It was always just one cashier at all times. I had to worry about getting robbed.
good,I believe I am a hard working empoliyee who is dedicated to whatever task she is given. I woke my hardest and get a long with customers. I also build good relationships with co-workers.
good,"Enjoyed working here. Get to meet exciting different types of people. Did a lot more then the job i was hired for after the first year. Did cashiering, stocking, pricing, build displays, freshness program, drop deposits & check in vendors."
good,It a secure job with benefits.They don't have good pay raise system. We get company bonus once a year but no employee appreciation lunch. The people here lack team skills.
good,Management & pay need improvement. A little more. Training on the cash register would help some people out. Love the flexible hours....just need more than 10 a week.
good,This was my first real job. This wasn't a hard job at all. You would work at the register and do basic sweeping around the area. You would also unpack merchandises if you needed to. My store sold clothes so I would usually pin whatever clothes that could fit and put it away. The hours are flexible.
good,"a typical day would include hard taggin clothing, cleaning store, unloading truck, work hard at what you love to do. set up end caps, cashier, a lot of multi tasking."
good,I run the register an do repacks I recover the store and help with the customers needs. This would be a great place to work if they would give more payroll and more raises.
good,It was a good experience and I would like to work there again but in Kansas city mo thank u. If I could start working on Kansas I will be good from here on out
good,The store was busy at certain times and their was never enough employees and the pay wasn't very good and not enough hours and the store wasn't to clean and it was just an overall mess. I didn't have enough hours and also the pay sucked so I quit. I wouldn't recommend this is a good place to work
good,It's a very hard job if everyone doesn't work together and the benefits are not the best in the world. They are very hard company to work for. I'm not saying I would never work there again because you never know what you will have to do but it will be my last choice.
good,"the store manager is not the ideal manager."
good,"I usually started at 8 or 9am my day would consist of checking out customers , stocking shelves and loss prevention. I also helped unload the truck when new products arrived."
good,The locationo that i was present at the time needed alot of work that was not provided to the manager. I personally knew the store manager and if she was giving the right help the store woud have been perfect
good,"They gave me a chance to apply the skills that I have to help enhance the productivity of the store in various sales and general labor, management skills, and administrative functions.  Through Family Dollar I gained a knowledge of how to deal with customers complainants, solving problems among employees, finding ways to keep a staff motivated, training employees more extensive in various areas of the store, being accountable for ensuring everything is done by store standards."
good,"assisting the customers, opening and closing the store, handling cash, i learned that you will different attitudes everyday,work place was fine,controlling thief,i enjoyed meeting new people."
good,Love my job wish it paid more and wish I felt more safe. no security guards constant petty theft and threats from customers. raises are once a year and aren't much
good,Fun place to work with great coworkers. Easy to learn what to do they love to help you figure out problems and get you up to speed with everything. All around good job.
good,I had a great manager to work for. The days were good. Just a bad location where there were constant people stealing. I had another job that needed me for more hours and that one was closer to home and less stealing.
good,"Not enough time to properly train new staff.  "
good,you had to be full of energy to perform this job.  the customers became like family because you would see the same ones everyday.  the company was strict about going by their policies and procedures which it made it easy to work there.
good,Good company to work for. I enjoyed working with management staff and interacting with customers. My manager was great at helping me with anything I need or providing me with the necessary information to be great at my job.
good,I honestly didn't agree with how the store I worked for was ran. It was always stressful and never easy. It was very clean because it had been recently set up. I ran a register which was pretty easy learning.
good,it is a job has the good part and bad part of this job. I think the company should give more payroll so the store could run more efficently..Other than that it not that bad of a compnay to work for.
good,"Multi-tasking,fast paced.  The team members are good hard working people. Customer service based.  Excellent benefits, time off -paid and health benefits."
good,"Production and quality driven service is a driving force for this company. Excellent employees, great products and services. Average workplace coulture"
good,"typical day at work consisted on stocking the shelf with merchandise, keeping los prevention down maintaining a fully functional store,helping customers and management."
good,I enjoyed working st family dollar. I just think we should have been paid more for the things that we had to do. But other than that everything else was fine. This job helped me work with customer service skills.
good,"Not enough hours..no planning scheduling..environment okay to work at times..pay was okay, but could be better..overall 3 out of 5 stars.................................."
good,"I enjoyed working at Family Dollar like the customer,the employees and I liked that it was fast paced. I didn't line when we got a new distric manager and he fired me, to downsized the companies payroll"
good,Working at Family Dollar is a very demanding job! Its also very unsafe. The store that I work at has gotten robbed 3 times within 4 months and we still don't have a security guard.
good,A good place to learn at an entry level.  I gained some customer service skills.  As well as cashiering and problem solving. A nice place to learn customer service skills.
good,The pay is not worth all the work you are doing allthe work you are doing with ib one day you are constantly on your toes doing heavy lifting and other stuff as well
good,"Family Dollar was like most stores.  However it was a long work day.   You worked from open to close.  You were always busy, which made the day go by quick.  I learned how to unload trucks, do resets, and rotate stock, etc...  The customers are so varied that you got to meet some amazing people.  Overall it was a good job."
good,"It could have paid better an give more hours. It was an learning experience for me in retail and working with the public. They have good products. But, I couldn't see myself making it there."
good,"working at family dollar is a good job to start out with but its not "
good,Great place to work.friendly customers.  Everything runs smoothly for the most part. Versatile working environment. Compatible working hours and schedule.
good,Job keeps you moving and keeps you busy at all times it's a no none sense place great managers you don't have to worry about nothing just stay focus on working
good,"I like my job just  look for something  different .I like meeting new people. there work  is not  hard .I like to help our customers  when they need it ,It makes me feeling I am doing a good job"
good,"family dollar is small with so much to do, the managers are over worked and the employees are very under staffed, the bagging area is extremly small and over wealming."
good,it is ok just have to work harder for little pay. they do teach you how to manage your won store before you actually own a Family Dollar store. I do like working by myself so you do not always have to be in customer faces
good,"Slow paced retail sales, 30 minute lunch break, 8 hour shift times varied. Minimum wage pay. Must be able to properly handle upset customers. Overall decent work environment."
good,"Greets and assists customers in a positive, approachable manner. Answers questions and resolves customer inquiries and concerns. "
good,While employed I was able to work my way up to assistant manager position from being a cashier. During the time I worked with the company I made up my mind that I enjoyed helping people whether it is in the medical field or not. This was a great atmosphere to work in and people to work with. My most hardest part of the position was to maintain the correct amount in each drawer at all times which made it very difficult when there was more than one register going at  once.
good,Nice work experience easy job but rude customers at times my manager and coworkers was nice and hard workers great customer service wonderful work environment.
good,"Family Dollar is always busy.  You get to change your position by sometimes working stock and inventory instead of always being cashier."
good,I liked the job for the most part but working in distribution just wasn't really for me. The people were not mean. But they were not very nice either.
good,"Good place to work to help you learn independence, no breaks at all whether you work 6 hours or 8. Assistant managers either leave you alone to work by yourself all the time, while they go outside take breaks constantly.But you meet new people daily,  and there are lots of people that are really nice an understanding. But then you get customers that are rude and you learn to just do your job, make sure their happy and go home."
good,If I could go back to the location I was at & have the same staff & managers I had will go back in a heart beat no question I love my coworkers & manager
good,It's and okay company. They have some strange practices. I don't feel safe in the store at times. We have no security and there is a lot of theft and robberies.
good,"Fast paced work environment. Receiving truck deliveries and vendor deliveries. Good coworkers and regular customers. It was a busy store , We had a truck 2 times a day . The managers in the store had helped us with in the stocking up , The workplace was good sometimes depending on the assistant manager."
good,"I helped open this store, we put up shelves and product. Then after store was opened I was a cashier, then I was a third key manager for a while. it was nice job"
good,At this job a typical day would be spent stocking and occasionally work on the register. Didn't learn too much here because I wasn't able to stay because I moved to another location. Hardest part was organizing everything on my first day and the best was the experience
good,great working environment friendly staff and customers. Very easy going. An hour lunch break was nice good location and great hours. I enjoyed my time
good,"Opening and closing a store, how to run a business and customer satisfaction. Shrink control, building and leading a team, delegating duties, maximizing profits."
good,"Retail chain store "
good,Family Dollar was a great job. Pay was on the lower side but the job made up for the low pay. Safety is to be considered when applying for this job as my store was robbed multiple times. Many of the stores within the same town were robbed as well.
good,They taught me how to manage a store. And treated me as Family. They taught me the ins and outs to the store system.  They have well management skills.
good,was meeting new people an helping them find what they needed an over all good coworkers if I would get hired back I would because I was a good job ...
good,I worked here part time as a stepping stone until I finished my schooling it was a ok position to take in for a short time but it was a ok job but not a career for me
good,I haven't worked there in a really long time and when I did I worked in what they call specialty divisions. That means the normal managers around there weren't my managers. I didn't have to deal with a lot of stuff most of the employees did.
good,Family Dollar is a great entry level job because you can obtain management experience very easily and quickly. It is very convenient to learn how to manage a small number of people starting out.
good,I would work 12 hours on the weekend I enjoyed my job there but there was family issues and health issues that made it hard to continue my employment there. The pay was ok but as a store manager I was making less pay then most of the cashiers...
good,Was a very balance and working warehouse. The managers and employees was very nice and helpful. But I really enjoyed my time there at family dollar warehouse..
good,"This company was brought out by another company and then sold again, and now I'm out of a job after a short time of working there . Would love to work for the real family dollar and not dollar express which was the company that sold it.."
good,Somebody had a good time aka. relations with thier boyfriend in the backroom. Although sort of awesome it's still not a professional thing in which to do. Lots of smoking pot.
good,There was always two people in the building a manager and your employee. It was always busy and there was never really down time. There weren't really good break scheduling either.
good,Work there for so many years I got to learn different things and worked with great people . If you like to multi task it's a great place to do that . Love my customers.  You also have the opportunity to travel and work at other stores . I did this and I got to meet some other employees.  Other stores don't care to help you need help.
good,Family dollar was a good work experience for me. It was very fast paced and sometimes over whelming. The customers would try to steal so you have to watch them and also check out the customers trying to leave the store. It was overall a good experience. Very fast paced which is something that I like. I like to stay busy. I stocked merchandize also I had to clean the front end of the store as well. A lot to do so u will always be busy.
good,"Being on the register for long periods at a time."
good,"The job is pretty relaxed and the co-workers are fun."
good,working at family dollar eye opening.  I didn't think it was that much to do at a store like that. the management team was really good and caring. the hardest part of the job was the weekly stocking.  there was so much tom put away and it had to be done in a timely manner.  the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers that you get to interact with on a daily basis.  the hardest part was making sure the store was shoppable for the customers and making sure it was always neat and presentable
good,"I learned a lot from working at family dollar from cigarettes to medicine. My manager was very unorganized, the job wasn't hard at all I got the hang of it my first 45 mins of working my first day."
good,"long hours, stocking shelves, cashier, customer service, security, checking for out dates on food, giving up your days off if employee calls in, manadtory 52 hrs"
good,"typical cashier job. High turnover rate i think due to the younger employees that were hired. Stores need security, theft in stores is very high in most areas"
good,Fun workplace dealing with many different faces. A lot pf room for growth and developement within the company. Pay wasn't that great unless you're between the ages of 16-18.
good,put it to you this way I was an assistant manager I was making 7.65 cashiers made 7.35 there was absolutely something wrong with that picture and that's the real tip
good,Managers work 50hrs or more a week but only get paid for working 40. Employees are fired for any reason or no reason at all. Starting pay is very low. The risk of getting robbed is high because the safe is out front in the customers view. Some days the manager is the only person in the store for hours before an employee comes in. The hardest part of the job is standing for a long time and working long hours and not get paid.
good,"just some of the neighborhoods are not the safest, the people are good and s is the management,"
good,"This is a pretty decent place to work if you are in need of a job, have high energy, and enjoy people. It is very quick paced and can be stressful however your experience varies dependent on management."
good,"I started working there because I needed a source of income. I don't know how I lasted as long as I did. My biggest issue with this company was that there were never enough people to work. If you worked more than 8 hrs, you did not get a break or a lunch. There is no room for growth at all. I was told on many occasions that I would be able to move up, but never did. It didn't matter how hard you worked or pushed yourself, it was never good enough. My suggestion would be to stay away unless you just need the money. Management was the worst. There is no communication and you got yelled at for things you didn't know about."
good,I didn't like working there I guess because I didn't know anybody and they were barely scheduling me but It was fun while it lasted learned a lot there as well
good,Was  a good place to work.I like getting to know the people i severe.The hardest part of my job was asking people not to return when they do wrong in the store
good,"My review on family dollar I'd say it's an Comfortable environment & staff , very friendly & helpful. The work is not hard and you would love working there"
good,"It was the first experience I'd had with the management title. My immediate boss did not always like that I called him with questions, but I needed to learn."
good,There were many long hours with a ton of work that never seemed to get complete because they would only have one employee do everything because they wouldn't let you have two people working at once to save money.
good,A typical day at work for me includes opening or closing the store handle customers no matter what attitude they have and i have to always maintain a professional attitude the hardest part of the job is always truck day which is every tuesday
good,family dollar every day work is repetitive. your either unstocking or working on random stuff for the day. the only thing that sucks is that the corporate team members expect the work of 5 employee per shift but we are only allowed at most 3 team members per shift.
good,I started out as an associate and made it to assistant manager in about 6 months. The work was a lot like other retail jobs pretty monotonous and predictable.
good,"another retail job just like any other. all depends on the manager of the store (if there even is one) first store i worked for, i was the only employee there when i had to quit for school. my experience wasn't that great but to each their own"
good,management was very unfair at times. was making sure that the store manger was not stealing money from the store safe. hat sometimes no matter what life isn't always fair with unfair staff
good,I loved working at this place and help me with a lot of things taught me a lot of things as well. I hope my next work environment is as friendly as this one was.
good,Upper management positions have benefits. A good 401 k is important and as you get promoted your 401 k increases but being a cashier sucks and you have to play security guard and handle the register at the same time
good,Family dollar is a job I can't complain some money is better than no money but they pay you the bare minimum minimum wage I believe the work at family dollar is worth more at least 9$ for cashiers and 10 for assistant managers
good,it was fun and good the time i was therr my boss was nice and careing. it was easy doing the job my other employees was very friendly they help work around myschedule.
good,"I learned the responsibilities of being an assistant manager, how to balance customers and getting things done around the store. The most enjoyable was customers saying how clean the store looked after working hard fixing the mess the night before"
good,"Dirty conditions at store."
good,"I liked working there because i got to meet new people and learn new things such as stocking,loading/unloading store products.Also,it helped me learn to enjoy working with the public because it feels good to be able to helo others"
good,"I loved my job at Family Dollar.   I was given a promotion within 2 weeks to Management.   I enjoyed working with my employees, and learning how to be a boss to them.  The employees also knew that I would never ask them to do anything that I wouldn't do myself."
good,"It's a job."
good,"North houston, tx"
good,In my time at Family Dollar I was a manager and at first things where good we grew very fast in my community but the budget did not. I worked many hours. I a three month time frame I worked on average 65 hours per week. If someone calls in or is sick or quits it was my responsibility to cover. I had three quit. I found it hard to recruit because of the wages offered and even harder to keep them once they realized the work load.
good,"Typical days of work feel long and boring if co-workers do nothing at all or if you have no re-packs to put out onto the floor. Some managers or district managers complain about seeing you do nothing on camera if there isn't something to do it is a place that things that there is always something to do and it isn't true at all times in Family Dollar. When it picks up it is fast paced but if the customers and co-workers are great you will always have a fun time working there. Culture itself is pretty good, always a mix of people that can get along all the time if an open mind is present. Hardest part of the job is dealing with co-workers who do not do their jobs on their shifts such as put backs or re-packs and customers who believe they are entitled to something even if the policy says otherwise.I can say that I enjoyed the people I worked with and the customers I had were all wonderful in my eyes."
good,"Good place to work but if only they had professional supervisors that are able to follow  company policies."
good,love my job it was a great place to work i would not mind working for the company at any oppertunity i get thank you for allowing me to work for your company
good,Family Dollar is a busy variety store geared to the local market of each store. The company gives decent hours to the employees that want them. It was a place for me to firm up my management skills with both employees and customers.
good,The company doesn't seem to care about you as much as they should. They want work done but no hours to do it! I've never worked for a company that also wants you to lie for them.
good,"My time working as a manager with Family Dollars, there was not a work life balance. As a store manager at the time your yearly salary was based off of the volume your store produced. In order to keep a decent pay I had to work around the clock and keep a very small part-time staff.  The work environment wasn't safe due to the area and the kept there safe on the sales floor in the open."
good,"This was a good place to work because I loved working with people. The hours were not the best, but the work was easy. I would recomend this job for a young person in school."
good,"to be short. Manager didnt know how to order correctly, Customers were always upset because we would run out of items, do to lack of traing. Co-Workers always had a bad attitude. Store was always unorganized"
good,I learned a lot about good customer service skills working there the job was easy and everyone works hard its a safe work place and everyone has great work ethics
good,I enjoy assisting the customers on a daily basis you see the same faces every day so you become a family! The management is great and the workload is heavy.
good,Great starter job with the opportunity to build skills and move up. Working with Family Dollar helps verse yourself in customer service and retail. Working at Family Dollar provides you with the basic skills to work at bigger stores.
good,It's decent just stock as a part time associate job mainly for extra money main goal is to still have full time and work what I can here. But for mean time it's ok
good,This company has many aspects and train each individual to perform many tasks. They also assist with the education of the employees and promote from within the company.
good,The management was decent. I got along with my co-workers very well. The customers in general were very kind and understanding. The hardest part of the job was lugging product around the store as well.
good,It was an easy job. Just didnt like how they would hire new people and the ones that have been there awhile get less hours or the new hires get offered a management position when i was there the longest. Besides that everyone was nice
good,Ive learned that anything can happen at any given time always show respect and be honest. The most toughest time was getting rude and unthinkingable guests. Enjoyable was coming into work and leaving out the same way you came.
good,"A fun place to work, I enjoyed helping people shop and learn about the different products in the store. I enjoyed talking with the regular customers it was like they became a part of my family."
good,The job was in a great location with were i live. I did enjoy the weekly pay. However it could be a bit unorganized at times. The atmosphere was cool.
good,While working a family dollar I handled cash and debit transactions on a daily basis. I was able to gain experience in stocking as well as dealing with angry customers. It helped build my customer service skills
good,"The team had great comunication skills energetic environment"
good,"all though the company  is great with  internal advancement and good compensation turn over, and delegation to lower management is a constant struggle. ontop of that keeping payroll with little to no coverage with in a short time frame to get the stores truck done ontop of plenty other tasks."
good,"If you believe in yourself self and your job , there shouldn't be no down falls! Keep a smile and remember customer always right! Be on time! Keep work neat and nice."
good,The work atmosphere at the store with all team members is Excellent. We have fun at work while making sure all tasks are completed daily. We work as a team and help each other whenever necessary.
good,"Under staffing, and people don't believe in team work. Great opportunity to advance, if you work hard. Otherwise, if you have a good team it will be a great place to work."
good,"One typical day I had at work when I first used the unloaded the truck pallets. I had to get familiar with it at first then when I learned how to do the job it became easy to me. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are making the pizzas , its also the easiest part of the job."
good,"it requires much thinking and plenty of paperwork, considering the fact I was an assistant manager. you must stock, everyone must stock, so knowing your store and it's isles is important. what I enjoyed most about it is the closeness of everyone; we were like a family."
good,I enjoyed it there at family dollar. It was id say a wonderful experience for my firstt job. Everythung went well the people were nice and all i loved it
good,Nice place for retail career. Lovely people in the family dollar family. Love the interaction with the customer of the community at any family dollar.
good,Working with Family Dollar was a job not a career. The job didn't challenge me. The days were long and boring with very repetitious tasks. I didn't feel valued as an employee.
good,very structure. great quality store.learned how to manage store property and also help staff with daily duties. it gets quite busy but it seems to be managed with the right staff. will love to work there again.
good,"I think family dollar is a place for ppl for coming out of school or is good for kids with summer jobs. Not much else to really add except I would definitely not return,"
good,Being employed for Family Dollar has been fun for the most part. I do feel like some of things that are asked or required of associates can be ridiculous.
good,You stand there and ring customers merchandise up all day. Stocking here and there but nothing hard at all. You get paid every Friday you wear black or blue jeans.
good,the job has very long hours . the community that was in was a hard neighbourhood so everyone come to by simple house stuff. we had a good manager who always gives us hours and keeps us busy
good,Everyday was something new and interesting at this place. My first job is one that i will former never forget. It's probably the job that taught me how the work atmosphere can be intense.
good,"It was easy laid back kind of work. Not too busy, however they just needed more employees. Other than that I enjoyed working there."
good,I would go back as a last resort but I would not go back the work is no where near worth the pay and most managers do not give the base raises the company promises
good,if you have a good crew to work with and every body gets along everything will go good that is the way we work we are like family we work with each other and we help each other out.
good,"Typical day customer service, ran the register, stock, managed employees. Learned good people skills and skill to help run a more productive job environment"
good,Customers are friendly you see alot of the same people. It is easy once you get in a rhythm. Don't work here if your not twenty-one or older because you can't advance if you want more hours just ask they can send you to a store that needs help there are four in Muskogee.
good,"working at family dollar isnt for everyone but if you know how to follow directions and you are good with people then you should be okay . i came to work and clocked in i would always work with about 3 or 4 other people and 2 of us were on the registers cashing people out and the rest of us would have to unload things and stock things onto the shelves , thats really all i did and it was a very easy job."
good,I was able to learn a different type of customer service.  It was a diversity of customers which was nice since it allowed me to deal with a variety of people.  Just did not like how the schedule was not consistent and would receive work schedule late so having a life outside of work was hard.  Could not really plan anything.
good,My time at Family Dollar though not very long was nothing short of standard. There was nothing too complicated about the job or what it entailed. My favorite part of the job was the fact that it was my first actual retail based job. The only part about the job I was not too fond of was unloading the delivery truck as it became tiresome with the limited amount of assistance provided.
good,I like the working for Family Dollar some of the people was a joy to be around.  I enjoyed my breaks where I would sit on the outside patio and take in the fresh smell of the flowers and the air.
good,Productive work place also very ongoing with the consumer . We always make our consumers happy and encourage them to come back soon
good,I was just a temp there. I worked as a stocker. I went store and store and stock new items and also made sure the store was clean. It was fun and I loved who I worked with. The manager was pretty nice as well.
good,"Easy work environment, not too many hours to work but enjoyed my time there. I learned to be a team player and to better communicate with customers."
good,"You get to work with the public, and the plusses and minuses that come with that. The products are better than fair. It was a very very very very nice place to work."
good,Opening the store checking safe drop deposits get change for tills if needed check on staff greet customers making sure stores is running properly receiving& checking  inventory.   making sure customers are satisfied& a safe environment I enjoy talking with all customers
good,"It was something to do while I was in school, I love dealing with the customers and to make sure they found everything they needed while visiting Family Dollar."
good,loved it it was amazing.... fast paced good workers. offer good benefits. love the customers. if you dont like fast paced then dont work here. thank you.
good,"It was a very difficult job, due to company policies, and catered to a demographic who carried a very nasty attitude. I was consistently disrespected by customers, but still carried a positive attitude. I always went above and beyond, it was bothersome however, that customers carried such unpleasantness."
good,A typical day is arriving to open the store and greating customers and helping them out if they need something that they can't find for themselfs. I've learned to multitask and gain people skills as well as management skills. This job is challenging at points having to deal with situations where you have to keep everyone in line.
good,Working at family dollar has it days. I love working with people and managing is one of my greatest qualities but I felt unsafe.
good,many opportunities to learn in a fast paced environment.  I liked the management style and work environment.  Worked well with customers.
good,"I loved the people that came into my store, and most of my co-worker. Management get too personal with decision making of job and a lot of inappropriate behavior exposed at the location I was working at. The work duties I fulfilled was fun and an experience."
good,"Over working, need a good supervisor or you will cripple yourself to keep up. They don't handle employees safety and compensation well."
good,This company was very unorganized and I did not enjoy work. I didn't receive enough pay for the work that they had me doing.
good,There is always something new to learn everyday by working for this company. Everyone helps out the best they can there are workers that's been with the company for a long time that's understanding and know what they are doing
good,management isnt really that good where i was at but fun work place but we made it that way. it has its ups and downs. i mean i learned a lot from this place i went from a CSR to Loss Prevention and then to ASM. THE HARDEST PART ABOT THE JOB IS WORKING WITH THE MANAGERS THAT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT WHATS GOING ON IN THE WORK PLACE
good,"I come in count my drawer before I start. I ring customers out, I do refunds. I take care and tend to the front of the store. I clean and recover my area of the store."
good,"Being a cashier at Family dollar was convenient for awhile. The store was unorganized and unprofessional. It started to get over stock with products, till it made us fall behind. People was stealing and round the holidays the store get rob. So I felt unsafe."
good,Just wanted to make more Money so I chose to get my cdl but I enjoyed working with people and management was great I really enjoyed having her as a manager
good,Family Dollar was a friendly environment to work in. Employees were hard working and cooperative. Store was well maintained and clean.
good,I enjoyed working for family dollar. I like getting paid weekly. I kept the store organized and clean. The shelves stayed stocked. Sales were good. I trained my new hires very well and I shared my bonuses with them. There was something to do in the store every day. I enjoyed meeting the deadlines for stocking and unloading the supply truck.
good,Could be a great place to work if anyone ever got some appreciation. They would give you a list of 100 things to do in very little time to get it done and if you missed one thing that's all they care about.  Company can't keep a distinct manager where I worked. Dealing with the public is not for everyone. Honestly that's the biggest problems with working for this company. Others then that most days I really enjoyed working for family dollar.
good,"it was a temporary position, I liked it. I only worked to prepare a store for opening.  It was okay.  it was a teamwork environment"
good,Family dollar is a great job. It allows you to build work ethic and good leadership skills. There are plenty of career advancements. The district manager was very helpful.
good,"I enjoyed all my customers. went at my own pace loved meeting the new people. work place was good and full of laughter. its always nice to make other smile and help the, enjoy the rest of their night."
good,"The upper management seems to forget how hard the store managers work on a daily basis. Not all, but many of them do."
good,"You have to run cash register, stock product, clean store, count out register before and after shift, and make sure all product on shelves are  facing forward."
good,the job always kept me on my toes customers were nice the co workers that I worked with was very fun to work with I would do it again if I had the chance
good,"made some new friends at family dollar, loved getting a paycheck every week...I had some really nice managers...loved working there..."
good,Fun and easy going job. Great team. Nothing about this job is hard for me. it isn't my dream job however it helps pays the bills. Great job for students looking for a simple job.
good,Too many issues with customers stealing and being rude.  I got along with my co workers and management just fine.  Had to keep the store clean and organized as well as stock items.
good,The work I did here show how great of a leader I am and gave the  opportunity to learn everything about the retail industry. I had the chance to learn how to regulate inventory and control stock.  I also lead a team of 20 employees to keep store successful.
good,The day to day work was hard because they never had enough people working at any giving time the manager we had was very nice after him everything went down hill
good,It was my first official job. I enjoyed it an it was a great experience  for me. an it helped me with my customer service skills a lot better.but I had to move on to better my work experience.
good,"Job duties included a wide range of responsibilities including cash management, store presentation, managing other employers, and keeping a safe working environment for all staff."
good,It was a good with environment and I definitely learned alot of food and qualities to take along with me into my future places of employment. The environment was very productive.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. it was one of my very first jobs. the people were friendly , but too large in employees to care. I was too young to understand the importance of benefits, but overall a good company."
good,"Setting  employees scheduled, delegating work, training new workers, and ensuring customers satisfaction.Also have great leadership skills, whether you're managing a group of sales people in retail or dishing out orders.I had to keep a level head, to multitask ,have excellent people skills, and overall know how to deal with all types of customers."
good,The most enjoying part of my job is seeing that customers get what they came for and return to the store because of its cleanliness and the customer service they receive whenever they come to shop.
good,"Nobody there took their job serious enough, Management was a joke, Alot of people would just do whatever they wanted to do and not get in trouble for it."
good,"I enjoyed being a cashier, I loved talking with customers and helping them with what they needed. The management was fairly good, and they helped and trained well."
good,This certain location was out of management for over two months and the store went downhill. There were so many people coworkers and customers being sneaky and stealing. I would not prefer to ever work for this location again.
good,"A typical day of work at family dollar is enjoyable and fun from the many variety of customers we have. I stock merchandise , work the cash register, recover,  clean and greet customers ."
good,"I love seeing and talking to the customers that come in, but since I am the youngest, I am credited as being the least reliable. One out of the other 6 workers treat me in a friendly manner. I fill in a lot for others, but had to miss one day I was not scheduled for due to major pains that I later had to go to the hospital for. I informed the manager I wouldn't be able to make it a day early, yet am getting punished for it by losing hours every week."
good,"I love it at Family Dollar.  I love my customers and my co-workers.  The fall back is that I get less than 40 hours a week even though I am an Assistant Manager.  Shift changes are a requirement.  We are open some holiday's that we are all required to work without holiday pay that most employers provide.  Also, the pay is very low.  The most enjoyable part of my job has to be the customers.  I have regulars that come in to shop when they know I am working just so I get to see them and help them.  This is a very satisfying experience."
good,There was always a chance to move up in the company. Becoming part of management was very easy. Overall I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a fairly enjoyable environment
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the lifting of shipments onto and off of the trucks. That being my first time working with inventory in bulk, I enjoyed the teamwork and atmosphere of the company."
good,I liked working there. It was very hard work and they could always count on me. They called me when they needed help and I always went in and help. Even if I wasn't feeling good I still went in.
good,family dollar is a store that can be very busy at times. sometimes they don't have nomore then 2 or 3 registers. customers sometimes can be very rude.
good,You will spend most days stocking and opening boxes and breaking them down.  Along with assisting customers and making sure no one is trying to shoplift.
good,"Working at Family Dollar was a okay experience. Some days were good and some were bad. A lot of pressure came down from the corporate office and it wasn't a lot of involvement from the managers even though we were the ones in the stores. Being a manager was a okay experience I learned a lot about payroll, inventory, customer service, budgeting, and store orders."
good,Good enrty level to warehouse jobs but no place to be if you want to advance in the company. Management is lack luster and compensation isnt at all competitive with similar jobs in the area.
good,"Being a manager is very stressful because you never know your hours , the pay for managers is entirely too low for the work that has to be done, need to go up on the wages, good benefits , needs to be closed on holidays"
good,"There was always something to do at family dollar because it was such a huge store the store I had. It was always clean, the people I hired were always kind. the only thing I would say would actually be a downfall for this company is they don't have enough payroll to cover the store. great company to work for but, they did not seem to care much about there workers than the store because they only had a small portion of people in the store at one time when needed things done. however great store."
good,A  high pace job i would have to come in get things in order that was not done on 2nd sf. Get things ready for firstshift far as putting pallets down for the different locations the bens have to go coming down the belt that i would have put down for the different stores.
good,"If you are manager you get the good and bad, you make your own schedule according to their guidelines and rules, hardest part is making a schedule with limited payroll and finding  time to do everything, co-workers for the most part do get along, the thing I enjoyed the most was seeing  all the new products coming in the store especially during  the change of seasons"
good,I enjoy working with the public and helping others. I had a great relationship with management team and co-workers but I wanted more for myself.
good,"I cashier and stock the store. ensuring that every customer receives great service while in our store"
good,I look at it as a okay job if your trying to get by and save some money or until you find a better job but I wouldn't conceder it a place where you make it a career
good,"High turn-over, liked the distribution management, corporate was not as collaborative.   Site was going through being bought out so many people were positioning to protect their job.  Made it hard to get things done."
good,"Family Dollar is a company to work for if your a college student or fresh out of high school, the minimum wage there is too low for anyone to make a living and it barely provides any hours or overtime accept for one holiday , which is Christmas, yes! you have the option to show up to work for this holiday if your just a CSR (Customer Service Rep), it is mandatory for the store manager thought and or the supervisor."
good,"A typical day at work consists of the management of multipliable individuals and dealing with ill mannered customers. I also ensure that the lines stay short and the customers are happy and their needs or issues are taken care of. Throughout the day I oversee many transaction such as reloading funds onto prepaid car, retuning unwanted merchandise, and so fourth. Since I have worked here I have learned how to count and prepare funds that need to be sent to the respective bank, work a register quickly without fault. I have not have any issues with my co workers and I have seen two managers go now on the third one. the hardest part would be dealing with the impolite customers and each team member not doing their part. The most enjoyable part would be my co-workers and some of the awesome customers that come in. I seldom get a break or lunch break and there is no security guard in the store so a issue occurs or someone steals we have to engage them. We get paid weekly but nowhere as much as the manger and we almost do everything that they do."
good,"didnt work there very long, but it was ok. i cashied customers out and stocked the shelves. Management was ok. There was really no hard part about my job."
good,dollar Family Dollar I was very intrigued at the work environment they it was a good team of people to be surrounded learn very very stains with on job learning experiences
good,The management could be a lot better ... The job really isn't hard but the hours aren't satisfactory at all and the managers are usually very unprofessional. The job as a cashier is nice though .
good,You will have to deal with the on going traffic but good competitive prices and quality product. If you work hard it wil never go unnoticed all you have to do is stay focused and complete the task on hand.
good,Throughout the day handpicking cases and placing them on production line.  This process is repeated throughout the day until my shift is completed and supervosri checks me out.
good,Most of the customers are very friendly and nice I've experienced working in retail the store manager is very nice and flexible putting away the truck and having to check customers out working with friendly people
good,"You get your hours, but the store is in an unsafe location. Managers talked about their employees behind their backs and made their employees feel slow."
good,not a bad company to work for..depends on the area and customers. Retail isnt for everyone. I move up pretty quickly from a temp employee to a store manager
good,Great environment to have a 1st job. It was easy and fun and energetic.  Made good friends ith my coworkers and didn't have a problem working there at all.
good,Nice and friendly enviroment to work in. Sometimes the customers are rude. But I loved the work and store hours. The hardest part of the job for me was counting the smoke product at night. The most fun part of the job is meeting new people seeing so many different faces and personalities.
good,Working there was fun just wasn't enough money. The customers were nice people but some were not so great. My manager was great very reasonable and my hours were flexible.
good,"My job duties were easy I had to do truck on Tuesdays,  and working with cash register was easy when I was really nervous but got over it."
good,Helping the elderly when they come in the store. Nice employers. I like putting up new items dailey to see customers face expression. They work around family life.
good,I Like The Type Of Work I Had To Do But It Was The Wrong Time To Work There Or Maybe Wrong Location Because The Whole Time I Was There I Had Like 4 Different Bosses And People Would Get Hired Just To Quit Or Move To Another Store.
good,It was a ok just it is a very fast pace to work but they try and take care of they employees they cook for u some times. Hours we're OK it was just up to you and your pace on how fast you want to go and do what you have to do to get the job done
good,"Managers had to work 12 hour days. There was also a lot of physical work required, Managers had to physically unload the trucks piece by piece. There was a lot of theft, with the employees and customers."
good,I love my customers and my manager.  Also one of the assistants.  I'm paid 7.50 to work the register keep the store clean and stock. That's not a good deal.  Then here in Va. we were just told starting Sept 1st cashiers will only be given 9 hours a week. I have a family and bills how can I do anything for my family working 9hours a week?  So when Sept 1st comes I will no longer be am employee of this company. I think it's absolutely unfair to us cashiers.
good,"This place was very laid back. I worked the register and stocked, so that was a typical day for me. Got along with everyone, it wasn't a problem there."
good,I started off doing loss prevention with the company I loved every minute of the action. This company and the group of people are the best.
good,Everyone works hard.  Many of the positions there are being moved to Chesapeake VA so there is a lot of uncertainty.  The company was recently sold so no one knows what the future will bring.  Have had many opportunities to work as a team on several special projects which have been fulfilling.
good,I didn't really care for working at Family dollar to much but I stuck it out until I found me a new job I learned that unloading trucks was not for me
good,"Being offered the management position at this job opened doors for me. It also taught me how to be flexible, how to deal with pressure"
good,As a retail store always watching customers if they are going to be stealing merchandise. Very stressful place to work for.
good,"This is a good first job for a teenager.  I worked evening hours, meaning I learned how to close down my register and count the till at the end of my shift. The hardest part of the job was standing in one spot for hours. Another part of the job that I did not like is that some customers are very rude.  I did like the people I worked with.  The reason I left is because I graduated high school and moved to Lexington with my parents."
good,"walk building, talking with the team, check cctv, merchandise, talk with customers, look out for shoplifters, drive company car, hand out checks, bonus, gift cards, go to the bank, get change"
good,Things are a little crazy over there right now. The manager is new and was handed a mess and is trying to do the best she can with what she has.
good,Worked here over 20 years. New management came in and changed a lot of rules. Many dedicated workers lost their jobs like myself. Demanding workload but quality team members.
good,Never was busy unless it was holiday. most enjoyable part of the was when i was on break. As an assistant manager I played a big roll into making sure the store runs smoothly and making sure employees conduct and work such as.
good,"had an awesome store manager and was always treated like family."
good,reallly liked working at the family dollar. the employees are wonderfull. not very long hours because of the budget but in the end of it all it was wonderfull the pay a hour could of been better.
good,".a steady day, ive learned that its best if you come in early, and not on time. Management is ok. and my co- workers are cool"
good,"I loved working for family dollar and having my own store.  Being independent and getting work done faster than required.. What I don't like is being in the store till 230pm everyday by oneself and not feeling  safe.   Also not able to completely help the customer that truly needs the help.  "
good,I learned a lot working at Family Dollar. I was able to advance positions easily and was given productive feedback. The problem I faced working for Family Dollar was the pay rate. As an assistant manager my pay was not complimentary to my work load. The staff was friendly however the corporate execs do not seem to take into account the work load of the employees.
good,Long hours high stress high turn over no appreciation. That about sums it up for working for Family Dollar.
good,Family dollar was a great stepping stone for me they gave me a chance to display my talents and skills. I love the customers that I got to see on a daily bases. The hardest part of this job was trying to protect yourself and co- workers from crazy people all the time.
good,I did not like working for this company. The management was very one sided. had favorites and if you weren't one of them you always got the jobs noone else wanted to do.
good,"company needs to hire more employees to take care of the customers needs long lines, only have one casher to help out at the checkout lines."
good,people were rude lazy and had attitude problems. no one cared what it looked like. management tried his best but it was not respected . no one cared.
good,"As an assistant manager I did way too much work for such little pay and I didn't feel appreciated for it. I would unload the almost 1,000 piece truck almost every week on Thursday then be expected to have it all out on the sales floor by Sunday while helping my cashiers and recovering the store. The store manager was rude to not only his employees but to some customers. Flat out told a customer when her kids who are all almost adults that they make a mess of the store when they do not and lost a really great customer."
good,"There is always something to do at this store, whether it be the stocking or recovery of the shelves or unpacking the U-boats. Either way, it can be a very demanding position."
good,Family Dollar is overall a great job for somebody's first job. It's a great place to learn and adapt into the environment.
good,"What I learned while working at Family Dollar is the fact that the moral is low and the lack of management. Seeing that most of these stores are on a city bus line, we see diversity.I personally do not have an issue with diversity but my co-workers did. This was very bothersome to me."
good,its an ok job. I think they should pay just a little bit better. the hardest thing you would probably do here is unload the truck. I learned how to be a manager here.
good,"a Typical day is dealing with about 400 customers through out a 8 hour shift,  counting all tilts and safe before getting on a register or about to begin recovery. i learned more about customer service and how to count money faster than I've ever had."
good,Overall the company doesnt care about your security or customers input on how to make people feel safe shopping at the store
good,It is a very easy going job to work. a lot of work needs to be done and its always busy. you get to meet different people and interact with the customers.
good,"When i worked for fmaily dollar, it was usually slow but me and other employers made the best out of it. I actually liked doing work there because it was an easy and quick job."
good,Was a great experience learned a lot new alot about the store and the company but was always looked over as management due to fact while employed there we went thru 3 store managers in one year
good,"As GM, I'm able, within corporate guidelines, to mold our culture, which is a principle-centered environment that executes through Lean/5S and TOC concepts."
good,I loved my job at family dollar but Family Dollar doesn't care about their employees. You have the opportunity to advance but your life maybe in danger. Proceed with caution. Great job no support.
good,"Typically, it is really fun getting to know new people joining the team, but overall Management sucks! Many hours and extremely challenging and laboring work. Not enough workers on one single shift. Constant aggravation for customers because of long lines and not enough cash registers open. This is not a great company"
good,"I am an assistant manager at Family Dollar and while my co-workers are great and my manager does work with days I need off, the job itself is difficult and stressful. We are in an area that has been going downhill fast and since I've been there we have been robbed 5 times. The payroll gets cut back a lot causing us to be in the store by ourselves until 10-11am. There is only ever 2 people in the building at one time which makes it hard to get stuff done when you have to keep running register and helping the cashier. I've been fortunate enough to have a manager who really appreciates my work ethic and has gotten me a few raises now to help me."
good,Its a fast past store no room for a break. makes the day go by fast though. I love the regular customers  the make the day much brighter. They love talking to me telling me things about their life. I enjoy working with my manager because she is so calm and positive.so having that positive and helpful manager around they day doesn't have to be as hectic if there were no support. Its hard when im the only cashier on duty that particular day. My coworker are pretty cool after they get to know me.
good,My resume lists everything  I would say regarding this particular organization. Great team members as well as supervisors. good job.
good,I loved my job but the compensation sucked and management abused their jobs. Safety was another issue. People love shop at Family Dollar others love to shoplift there and I've been at gun point twice.
good,I worked at this company for a little over three years. While I worked in Maintenance I and the other Tech's had to take care of over nine miles of conveyor system. We had to tote a tool belt everywhere you went. In the time I worked there I had to have Rotator Cuff Surgery because of having to tote a 50 lbs tool belt. I quit before my left shoulder went. To sum it up. My body could not take the stress.
good,a good place for someone to start in management. but the pay and the overall security make it a short-lived desire. Deal with alot of shoplifters but also alot of fun regulars
good,A typical day at work is i clock in than i get my cash drawer from my boss. Than i count onto the cash register after that i find something i can do like stock shelves untill i have to check a customer out and pin clothes.
good,Job overall not worth it.. they dont pay good and they expect ASST.MG to work until there last breath... Also they like to work regular team members at all times and work them out without getting inappropiates hours to sleep and in top of that no breaks at all..
good,No Work/Life balance at all.  I've worked retail before with other companies and Family Dollar def rates towards the lower end of the scale.
good,Management was very insensitive to postpartum depression made fun of my appearance during a sensitive time in my life.
good,They were unfair to they're employees. I was fired after 6yrs with no prior write-up. They lost there jobs because of they're behavior.
good,"I enjoyed working with the public, each day would always be different. I was able to get my assignments finished every day."
good,liked how they were always willing to work with my odd schedules when I was in school. Easy to transfer to other locations if you ever need to move
good,Good learning experience and great development programs. Very flexible schedules and leadership team works to be lenient with time off.
good,down stock products. helping customers with the day to day is enjoyable.  holiday set are fun to set up.  management was very easy to communicate with
good,"Family dollar overall is an easy company to work for, however the pay is terrible & the mangers have to work six days a week. im at the point in the company that i can not move up any furter."
good,Working for Family Dollar was quite interesting on the daily basis. I have come across some cool people while I worked here. The people I worked with were some funny individuals and made coming to work fun. You did not know what to expect when you walked through those doors. While working with the company i have learned that looks can be VERY deceiving. I've also learned how to deal with angry/frustrated customers a lot better.
good,I enjoy working for Family Dollar and I enjoy the people I encounter as well. It's a very relaxed workplace and very easy to catch onto things.
good,"Not great pay for assistant manager, but otherwise a great place to work. Breaks are given often, there are plenty of workers to help out, and corporate seemed to be supportive."
good,"it was a decent place to work and helped me get experience in retail and as an asm, and helped me learn more about different items and had a decent pay rate"
good,Overall not a career post.  Okay for part time students. Not a good choice if you support a wife and children.  A typical day can have a  person stocking one minute and cashiering the next.
good,It is a great place to gain experience while continuing school.To show great customer service to ensure everyone has a lovely visit and will most likely decide to come back
good,"helping the customer , with check out and finding things that they need.i also enjoy talking to the customer and cleaning. sometimes it can be very busy but i enjoy ."
good,I was always excited about going to work.My experience with Family Dollar I have learned to multi-task and also communicate a lot more with customers.Co-workers showed me how to work as a team.The hardest part of the job was difficult customers.The most enjoyable was well satisfied customers.
good,I kept busy and loved working around the people I was with. They kept the workplace exciting so that you were able to work comfortably.
good,"Ok place to work.  Benefits were ok and they don't micro manage."
good,I worked stocking shelves and the cash register.  Was responsible for emptying the delivery truck when it arrived and getting the boxes open and the merchandise out on the floor.
good,"A typical day here for me was more of stocking the shelves, unloading the shipments , and inventorying merchandise in store."
good,"I've learned how to stock well and also cashier ,co workers was okay ,the hardest part of my job was recovering the store and the best part where the loving customers"
good,"General Manager that are hired outside of the company are only given 8 weeks of training. New team members are only given 8 hours of training. "
good,Customer service was a really great experience. I learned how to deal with a lot of different types of people. A great experience of meeting new people.
good,"If you're looking to make extra income, this work place is a good choice. Customers can be friendly and become regulars. Becoming friendly and familiar with the customers is a plus. Duties are shared among the employees and good communication with fellow employees is key to a great work environment."
good,As far as I remember it was a good company I never had any complications. I would wok there again. They are family friendly.
good,"STock shelves,Cash people out. Learned how to catch  theif, management was fair, Co-workers were great, Hardest part was dening someone, Enjoyable part was the atmosphere."
good,"The restaurant is closed already but it was always fun, is was food by pound everyone very polite. Great place managers sometimes dont care about emplyees"
good,This was an easy job however my manager made the work experience here less that desirable. I was able to transfer back home after college which is a plus of working for a company with so many locatios.
good,It was okay. I mean considering the location it was decent. I kind of sort of liked the customers but for the most part they were every rude and disrespectful and so was the staff and management.
good,"My day at Family dollar consisted of customer assistance, stocking shelves, and maintaining cleanliness of the store. In my opinion there where too many managers which caused some confusion. The most unenjoyable part of the job was trying to put away the new merchandise that arrived an a truck every week while still being attentive to the register. I believe we needed more workers to efficiently handle all the aspects of the job."
good,"The hours was long, rude customers, low pay and I worked in a bad part of town. The store also was not very organized because nobody knew what anybody else was doing"
good,"The work environment is good. Pay and hours available to work as a n assistant manager is horrible. Company states the pa is commensurate with knowledge, I have over 9 years as a manager and all they pay is $10. They tend to micromanage personnel and business, not allowing store managers to manage their stores. There is no set goals or incentives for the stores to aim for."
good,"They're a decent company to work for it just depends on who you work with. Retail constantly changes so people are always different. Right now i have good and bad co workers but you honestly have to learn nobody is a like so try your best to understand people. I enjoy my customers the most. Unloading trucks is the hardest part because we manually do it still . Everybody else in other company's get cages or some type of assistants. Management could be better and more caring. I learned a lot like how to do merchandising properly, money handling, training people, hiring process, unloading trucks properly, how to please the customer, schematics and much more."
good,Even managers are standing all day. There are a lot of customers. Sometimes sales associates make more than the managers. They don't pay correctly. Low pay.
good,"Cashier dutites, cleaning, stocking shelves and recovering merchandise. Mostly friendly coworkers somewhat easy to get a long with. Loved dealing with the public."
good,I enjoyed working at family dollar i love to see the regulars come in i like when customers ask me where something is i love doing suggestive selling based upon what customers purchase i love when customers tell me i am so nice and very helpful it makes me more motivated to know i am able to help someone in any way shape or form.
good,"waiting on customers, stocking, unloading trucks, good people to work with, but would not show up for work on some days nor call in."
good,"the company isnt all that but it is a job. sometimes bosses expect way too much from you."
good,My first week we was robbed. Then later on we founded out the manager had something to do with it.. They over worked. We had people stealing left to right.
good,"I learned how to operate a cash register, how to handle and exchange money, on the job safety precautions, how to maintain the register and stock shelves at the same time, how to properly use a U-boat."
good,It was okay working here. This is a standard retail job where you just work the register and stock. Depending on the area your customers will vary.
good,i liked working for family dollar because opportunities and benefits were very strong and were offfered for the employees who worked the hardest which i like that challenge.
good,for a first job its fine but the management wasnt all that to good. i didnt really like working here wasnt my favorite at all. but i worked here to make money because it was my last year in high school. also so i can get some job experience.
good,"This was a learning experience for me. I learned alot while employed at this job. I opened and closed alot so I felt I wasn't compensated at times. I was hired and paid as a cashier, but performed as a Third-key holder, and an Assistant Manager."
good,"Didnt like the manager at the time. She was never there and when she was she didnt do anything but talk bad about everyone. they got a new manager at the store is doing good. would go back,"
good,In a typical work day I would greet customers and make sure that I perform speedy transactions. While working with this company I've learned how to interact with several kinds of customers. My managers and coworkers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was when customers would get aggressive with the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely dealing with the  different varieties of customers.
good,It was a great experience for me.I learned how interact with different people and got to know them after awhile.I also learned how to deliver great customer service skills.
good,"The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers. A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers, ringing up customers, handling money, putting away stock, and ensuring all customers enjoyed their experience at the store."
good,Not much potential for growth. Company is going through a merger and the moral is very low. Management is stall and pay is not average.
good,Nice place to work. A days work consisted of ringing up customer merchandise. Greeting customers. Job was very busy. Everyone there as very nice.
good,"A typical day of work consists of me clocking in and signing on a cash register then depending on what shift I have I clean the store windows on the doors and clean the counters. The for the most part of the day I run recovery around the store and restock things that are sold out. Then at the end of my shift I declare out on the register and count the money I made on the register and give it to the manager or assistant manager depending on who I work with. Then I finally clock out and go home."
good,a good place to work with a steady income. everything within store requires team effort which helped build social and Leadership skills
good,I actually liked working for family dollar. The customers made my day go by quite fast. The only down fall was the pay. I loved my co-workers
good,"I worked here for a short period of time and saw so many things that I disagreed with as far as management was concerned. I worked very hard at my location, without a store manager. I tried to transfer to a different store that would make me more comfortable and was denied, even though my store manager walked out and quit. I did learn to multitask and focus on tasks under alot of pressure. I also learned how to adjust to anything, even what I thought was the worst."
good,"Under pay the managers and staff. it is designed that the manager is in the store 10 to 12 hours a day 6 days a week.  Managers and staff are not only the cashiers, stockers and security."
good,Early morning unloading trucks and stock products. Balancing register while stocking and recovery store. Stores within my district have been robbed several times out of the year. No security in the store and CEO and supervisors were did not trust employees.
good,I was a stocker and worked on the cash reg. and worked with people the olny reason i had to quit there is because me and my sister was working there and we was family
good,I was an assistant manager and barely got paid over min um wage. The work wasn't hard by any means and I enjoyed the customer interaction but I could not live off of that pay.
good,"A typical workweek involved alot of hours, usually anywhere between 60-65 for myself to get projects done and there was always something to be done. I did learn alot about business there but they expected so much for little compensation and really no acknowledgement. There was very little communication with upper management. The most enjoyable part of my job were my employees, they were really the best."
good,Dollar General gave me an opportunity to advance and learn key skills in the workforce. They gave me key skills that I have used throughout my life.
good,"i looked over employees, scheduled employees, counted tills, stocked store and unloaded trucks. i enjoyed working with others. my favorite part of the job was stocking the store."
good,working at family dollar distribution was always physically demanding. even if you job is mainly office there are times it will be physical. the main drawback would be low pay.
good,Fun workplace with great customer service. Decent pay with great benefits. Reasonable schedule but no set schedule.  Store managers are professional
good,this was my frist job as a teen i kind of enjoy it i leard most of the thing i kknow from heremy cowoker were okaymanagemet was cool the hardest part was going to school and working
good,"A typical day at work was coming to work and dealing with customer service. I had to deal with money, debit/credit cards, checks and also gift cards. At the end of the shift i had to make sure everything was stocked up and recovered before closing the store."
good,"Enjoyable work place with not so supportive management. Fairly manageable scheduling. Management was not professional and there was favorites, my reason for leaving."
good,"Working at Family Dollar was one of the funniest jobs i had. A typical day at work was fun everyone would most of the time show up with a good positive vibe and ready to work, Management was great. If things would ever get out of hand they would fix it right away. If something was ever bothering me my manager would make it as comfortable as possible for me. The co- workers i worked with most of them where great and others not so much because of the fact we had to always pick up their slack."
good,"I enjoy my coworkers, the work is simple enough. Policies often times make no sense and the relationship between upper management and team members is practically non existent. Pay rate between Store Managers and their assistants is ridiculous based on the similarity of the work required from both positions."
good,"Provided good training for the employees, had a good structured MIT program, They provided great employee benefits and took care of the employees."
good,"I started working at Family Dollar after high school as my first job and I also began going to college at the same time. A typical day at work begins by loaning on to the register, also while customers are shopping I begin to keep my work area clean and organized. I learned to be industrious with my time, have empathy with people, and being grateful for the chance to serve the people that pay my salary. The management is really great at keeping the team productive. The best part of my job was that I got to help people."
good,"Typical work day for a DM. But you do have a ton of stores (30)"
good,"I provided customer service, did cash transactions, cleaned store, unloaded freight onto the sales floor. I also helped with paperwork, did online training to better my knowledge of the job."
good,"Responsibilities include: cash management, customer service, stocking of merchandise, recovering store, ect. Hours vary and will be less than convenient most times. Working night shifts is mandatory."
good,Family Dollar has came a long way and I think that the company is doing better with they employees. I love to see the growth this company has developed
good,"Check customers out, do a drawer count down before and after each shift greet all customers and familiarize frequent customers. Participated as a team effort to stalk inventory and organize store. prices all inventory."
good,"open store,count the safe and all registers,balance safe,do daily paper work,see if any daily project are do,position staff,assist customers with complaints and daily returns"
good,Working with this company was awesome. Got to work and meet new people and help make a difference with the stores and the way that people could see us.
good,"Great fun place with good co-workers. Fun environment , engaging team members . Great shift , good location, lots of jobs available. Good employer for the area."
good,I enjoyed doing customer service. What i really enjoyed most about it was meeting new people every day. I loved the group of individuals that i was working with at family dollar.
good,a typical day at work for me is coming in stocking selves and helping customers. i learned that the fast you work the more you get done.i loved my co-workers. they was very nice and funny so we got along very well. the hardest part is wen it gets really busy and thers only 2 people working at the cash register. the most enjoyable part is knowing that i put a smile on a customers face because they was pleased with my service.
good,"co-workers and manager was nice, enjoyed helping customers, cleaning and keeping the store presentable, greeting and helping customers, knowledgeable of products to better assist customers, keeping busy in between customers , stocking shelves"
good,I enjoyed working here and enjoyed the people that worked under me but after awhile I just did not like the retail business and wanted to get into an office setting.
good,"Its was always busy, Never really got days off, I was part time working full time. The hardest part about the job was that we had disrespectful customers. The co-workers were easily to get along with. The most enjoyable part about the job was stocking shelves, I was able to come to safe environment, and my schedule was flexible enough for me to go to school."
good,"The day went with waiting on customers, learned a lot about person in general. Management has a lot to do, and the co-workers work to gether. The hardest part of the job was remembering the price of the sales items. Knowing the you helped someone."
good,"a typical day at work was pretty much myself and the main store manager."
good,Family Dollar was a nice place to work. The company allowed chances for advancement. The employees that I worked with were nice and always worked as a team.
good,"During my time it was fun. I had a good manager and two great district managers. Unfortunately I helped other stores who were not so great. Working at my store was fun, but, understand that there is a job to do. The pay is not always the best either with the workload you are given."
good,"Pretty straightforward retail job. Pretty good job security unless you're literally not working or doing dumb things. Pay could be MUCH better, all management above direct store manager is really annoying. They're obsessed with recovery or organizing the store before closing. Not enough vacation time for full time, and did I mention the pay should be MUCH better!"
good,this is a good company but the only people who benefit from there is management I was a store manager for a year and worked 80 hours a week for salary its a lot of work for little pay be prepare to give up a lot but if your single it for you
good,"Answered telephones and relayed messages accurately. Opened and closed the store by counting funds, properly writing down and accounting for funds and getting them prepared for bank deposit. Maintained files, records, and lists needed to maintain the home. Received, opened, and directed mail. Accurately developed and processed employee schedules, supervised a staff of eight, input time keeping and payroll; handled customer issues and complaints accurately. Provide information orally and in writing to the owner and other employees. Maintain supply inventories. I also performed other various duties as they were delegated."
good,"Long Hours , Tight controls, old systems which makes it difficult to run a multi million dollar location. Wish the company had more updated equipment."
good,Co- Workers are amazing good company pay is not good at all for the job being done a lot of work nice customers. Management is good and overall its a descent job to have
good,"I was a cashier for a retail store, It sells a variety different items,"
good,I worked with customers to help them fill their retail needs. I managed and directed a crew to ensure easy flow of daily functions.
good,"The crew that i was able to work with were loyal to the customers and excelled at customer service. Although the company demanded ridiculous payloads with minimal payroll to accomplish tasks, i enjoyed my time at the location where i was employed."
good,"Go to workk and clock in. unload trucks. stock merchandise,. cashier answer phones and check bags in, clean store. I learned multi task. cashier most enjoyable part. unloading truck the hardest."
good,"Signed in to cash register, counted out drawer for the day, rang up customers and stocked shelves.Cleaned up store at the end of every night."
good,"Managers do not manage, they are often alone.  Consider your safety and ability to control shrink? How does one become loyal?"
good,"The place is just chaotic, from the way it is ran to the customers. It was easy going don't get me wrong. Some of their policies don't make sense, and are quite silly."
good,This is a great place form work place growth. I worked with the company for 2years. Within that time I was promoted and asked several times to become a store manager.
good,Work environment was always exciting because I worked with the public; had the opportunity to meeting all types of people and that really was very enjoyable to me.  The people that I worked with were supportive and very helpful.  The hardest part about the job was controlling the inventory.
good,"a typical day at work consists of ringing and bagging grocery items, working freight, and stocking. you will learn how to multi task, the hardest part is being the only one running the front with more than one full U boats to unload while serving cutomers while it is busy.i enjoy the people"
good,"thet expect a lot from there employees,they dont take care of there people like i would have thought.need  to be more thoughtful toward there employees"
good,My experience at FD was one that was helpful to my degree field I was more able to get involved with the customer and get a fill of what it will be like when I start my own business.
good,"The typical day at work consist of Customer Service, working with merchandise, stocking,and shipping. Learned Management,  Financial, Store Regulations, and Merchandise. The Management was not to concerned about the employees and the benefits. I worked with a great team. The hardest part of my job would be coverage when dealing with the management, and the most enjoyable part of the job was customer service."
good,"cashiering,drops,unloading trucks,inputting checks,credit cards,counting drawers,help assit police,problem solving,calling checks in.facing products,cleaning,mopping."
good,"wasn't a safe environment, the manager smoked, the employees were lazy.. didn't get to take any breaks.customers often gave fake money."
good,"Quickly promoted! However depending on the department and manager, skills are not always acknowledged. In addition, depending on the role, schedules are flexible and time off is easy to obtain. The hardest part of the job is the constant change in management (due to layoffs) and getting suggestions in motion."
good,Work as cashier. Provide good customer service. Try not to upset customers. Make sure customers do not still. Not worth 7.25 and hour.
good,"I enjoyed working at Family Dollar as a Customer Service Representative/Cashier and wanted to continue,however, due to the location transitioning from Franchisor to Corporate Store my hours were cut to single digits. "
good,"loved working with customers. loved the public. loved the pros like free food and products. uniforms were great. awesome job, it was so great"
good,the job was very fast pace you had to reach a quota for the day and they were giving 50 hour plus a week for work. the people who work there showed me how to keep my production up and my pace even faster so i could do my work and move product faster.
good,the work was very and demanding. I would to work up to 16 hours a sometimes with no overtime and the goals were very high at most times.
good,Very good company to work for but do not take care of the store level personal. Long hours and short on help to cover shifts.
good,being a cashier at family dollar is exactly what it would seem like slow days and low pay. good for a first job or an after school job.
good,I like being a manager it feels good to be in control. The environment is a create place to be in I really like it. I really like my employee they are all great people to work with.
good,The most enjoyable part of this organization is the ability to touch the lives of our customers.  Creating memories for a lifetime is a amazing responsibility.  It is difficult to see how changes in an organization impact the management style of the leaders.  As the company goes through many foreseeable transitions it will be interesting in how they overcome these.  I do not see futures being built for new leaders in this company at this time.  I am grateful for the experience and the ability to learn how to manage many over multiple states.
good,"I have learned a lot working in retail. I have counted tills, checked inventory, stocked shelves, unloaded trucks, made store orders, made bank deposits, and have received/sent out e-mails to the D.M."
good,I was really impressed with my supervisor while I was employed at Family Dollar.  She was easy to get along with and she was very good at her job.
good,"Provided excellent customer service , scheduled store meetings, managed and maintained a schedule for a team of 15 employees. Handled accounts payable and receivables."
good,Good company to work for if in upper management position. At store level managers and not compensated for he amount of work and responsibility that they are accountable for.
good,"very unorganized, unclean, bad communication with in employee environment the managers could be very rude and unprofessional, safety needs a lot of improvement."
good,it was okay was promised a promotion that I never received the work is easy I was a cashier and I had left a management position some where else as soon as I got my old job back I left very quickly the store wasn't in good shape I really didn't like the hours they had given me it was like every week I was getting less and less hours that I eventually left but I did leave on good terms and gave a notice
good,The typical day at Family Dollar was great. The work is very easy and a good workout. Management depends on what location you are.
good,"A typical day at work reminds me about my early routine; get up early in the morning, be the first in the office, and start my day with a cup of tea. As assistant Manager, I will reconcile previous day sale and quickly make cash deposit to the bank. I will set up the store and open the day sales.  Cashiers and delivery associates will sign in for work, and I will mostly concentrate on supervising store associates and handling customer’s complaints. During this time, I have gained lots of experience regarding team building, conflict resolutions, and managing employee diversity. "
good,"A work day at Family Dollar, overall exciting and great atmosphere.  Working with my team and helping them advance and grow within the company is the best part."
good,my job was the same as dollar tree but i was also an assistant manager so i would also supervisor the cashiers aswell as help the store manager in every day functions.
good,"I held several positions at family dollar. In the almost 5 years I was there.  "
good,everyday the sales floor need to be stocked and organize shelves. the truck came on tuesdays so i had to be at work early to unload it.
good,"a ""truck day"" usually consists of just about 1000 pieces coming down the belt . as it comes down the belt , i and a co-worker or 2 (depending) usually grabs the piece & puts it on it's rightful cart so   from the cart , the individual working on that department can put"
good,I got to learn how to do a lot of different things on a day to day basis and the people I worked with were very kind and friendly to work with and would help me if I needed it.
good,loved seeing the same customers faces day in and day out. not to mention the wonderful people I worked with.
good,family dollar was the worst place to work ever. customers were terrible
good,great workplace.. its a job nothin special about working at family dollar!
good,busy dealing with different people everyday and getting a truck every week trying put stock out before the next truck comes long hours lifting heavy boxes .
good,The job was an okay job to work at. It started out as a trying to work at but turned out better when management changed. All of the employees got along which made it fun at times. Overall it was an okay place to work. I really liked the fact that it was close by and i could walk to there.
good,Once the store manager was terminated and the new store manager came the job was more easier and the workplace became enjoyable. I was promoted to assistant manager within a year and my co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of the was working open to close on Sundays which was 8:30am-9:30pm. I enjoyed interacting with my co-workers as well as customers.
good,The assistant manager at this location was very rude to me in front of customers. I found her very difficult to work with. The store manager and district manager did nothing about it.
good,"The job is fairly easy, I'm a hard working guy that is fortunate to get a paycheck"
good,"Must be able to stand for long periods of time. You cannot end your shift until another employee comes to relieve you. Must be able to multitask: answer the phone, tend to customers in your line, answer customer questions who are not in your line, and write down truck information when you receive the call. It is a small retail store but the customers think we should have all the qualities of a superstore."
good,"A day would start either morning or afternoon (mostly afternoons) with signing in for the day, informed of what was needed to be done, work tough out the store floor or a register, assist all customers entering the store friendly/unfriendly, then after store hours and doors are locked come sweeping, mopping, store recovery, counting out the register, and then punch-out."
good,"Perfect opportunity for someone who is looking for a part-time position.  The flexibility of this position allowed me to spend more time with my grown children who live out of town.  As long as I was honest with my manager about my concerns/needs/etc, she was more than willing to work with me.  Enjoyed meeting the public."
good,"My day at work was open the store get the registers open and wait on customers,go to the bank and make deposit and pick up deposit slips ,get change, work til 2 or 3 pm by myself and get jobs done that needed done. I did vendor deliveries and worked 60 plus hrs.made out the scheduel. what i learned was to mulitiy task. I enjoyed my job."
good,"Cash customers out, answer question via phone and also in person, stock shelves and help with inventory when business was slow. I learned some new techniques for organizational skill and to multi-task."
good,I didn't enjoy working there even though i got promoted. The job there wasn't that great. I loved the customer service aspect because it was i enjoy meeting new people.Stocking kills time so its always good to do that. The job was repetitive so i easil mastered everyting there s to know about family dollar
good,"easy to follow, easy to operate, very poor support from company. long hours, long shifts, almost no rest, training very minimum"
good,"learned the value of teamwork. i learned most of what i know here. i was always on my toes, never a dull moment. only downfall was management and no job security."
good,A typical day at work is sometimes tiring or very easy. I had learned they are quick to fire someone in this company. The management is cool and my co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part about the job is multi-tasking because they are always busy. The most enjoyable part about it is working with the people in it.
good,"Building and putting the family dollar in Harper woods together. A 2 week job, stock, unloaded truck with product. used cash register. Then they picked 7 people and sent everybody else home. Job wasn't hard or enjoyable."
good,This was a great temporary job that helped me with my customer service skills and learn more about retail.
good,New to the west coast the company hase some growing and learning to do.
good,"recovering and rotations shelf "
good,A typical normal day helping customers in what they need and what they don't see or doing anything that actually helpful enough for them to being able to know that we gratitude help in our store.
good,"It was a very fast paced environment, which I excelled at. My first manager was phenomenal. He got transferred to help another store boost their sales, so I got a new manager. She too, was a good manager. My co-workers were nice and hard working. We all got along well. The hardest part of my job was unloading the truck with our inventory every Monday because it was a lot of work to do. It was also the most enjoyable part of my job because it made me want to work faster and harder to get the job done, and It also kept me busy."
good,A typical day was fairly easy just had to make sure that the stores appearance was always clean and that when handling customer concerns it was done in a timely and courteous manner.
good,I maintain store managers duties. Open and closed store. Made bank deposits.
good,"It was only temporary when i worked there, so on a normal day I would come in and go straight to putting up shelves and then would move on to putting up merchandise and so on."
good,"Receive payments by cash, checks, credit cards vouchers, or automatic debts. Issue receipts, refunds, credits or change due to the customer. Assist customers by providing information and resolving their complaints."
good,Very busy and stressful place to work.  There are not enough manhours nor budget to properly do the job.
good,"Getting the store together"
good,"I work in the evening to close  about 4 days out the week.I'm looking for a career  in the field in which i went to school for.A full time job is what i'm needing.I enjoy interaction with the customers that come in the store.I have to do some unstocking, to place the invntory that we get in on truck day up. and cashiering is part of my title also. Management is friendly."
good,"friendly people. got use to my same buyers everyday :)"
good,Clock in  and run my register till I clock out.  Assist with new inventory and restocking of products.
good,I simply liked family dollar because it was a busy but friendly place to work at. you were always busy and constantly did different tasks.
good,"It could be a great place to work. The employees at our store are really like family. However, the stores are not allotted enough payroll hours to meet the tasks outlined by corporate. The store managers are salaried and are on the schedule for 52 hours. They are expected to work 65. In reality, they work 80-90 on a regular basis and sometimes resort to paying cash from their pockets to people who will work off the clock."
good,good costumer service very clean and organized store very helpful and freindly employees
good,i would rotate the stock and deal with costomers daily. I also would unload the truck daily
good,"You are responsible to keep the store operational by writing schedules, operating the register, ordering for the store.  On whatever day your truck comes you must unload stock onto U-boats by hand.  The co-workers are okay you work, converse and get the work done.  I learned how to drug test employees, how to deal with other people problems, and also that marketing presentation of your store can play a big part in your sales, which results in what your bonus will be.  The hardest part of the job was trying to control shoplifting.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the privilege of making your schedule, which allows you to get other things you need to do in life done."
good,worked till you drop and do it all over again the next day you had to meet productinon
good,"Close/Open store, stocking, recovery, cashier, make deposits, count safe, customer service, close "
good,The most enjoyable part was the customers. Their smiling faces keep me going.
good,"Looking for a better career , family dollar is a good company but its not a long term career for me work is great I enjoy the hands - on work completing task and providing leadership and knowledge to other team members on board ."
good,The day would start by opening up the registers. follow by cleaning around the front of the store.
good,"At first glance its an exciting place to work. Then comes Thursday after Thursday of the company sending hundreds of things we have no use for nor any place to put them. The management would always find an excuse to ""have to leave the store"" anytime anyone from corporate or another store was coming by. Security is almost non existent  but things seem to walk out a lot more than we'd like. The employees were fine. Most times the manager was too until it was time to hear or dish the latest gossip and if she ever got into it for something she ""should of been doing"", the finger is always pointed towards the employees, whether rightfully or not."
good,Good company to work for. Like any retail business there are good day and bad. But over all I enjoy working for them
good,"a day working at FedEx was always a good early morning workout for me. I would start bye loading two trucks and pulling my boxes off the belt at the same time. I learned how to stack boxes, make room, work at a fast speed. I learned how to communicate with all my co-workers and managers as im  inside of the truck loading. The managers was great at anytime they would try the best to help you make work better for you as needed. I always could go to a co-worker and help them load the truck, when I finish my truck early. my co-workers would do the same without me asking. It was nothing never to hard about my job, I love to work hard."
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar from my experience was bit chaotic. I learned most of all how to manage a workplace wit very little order. The management was honestly poor and neglectful at times, but my co-workers were decent people for the most part. The hardest part of this job was constantly trying to maintain the sales floor. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was the interactions I shared wit so many customers."
good,company was bought out by my previous employer.There was high turnover in the supervisory positions.was a very fast paced environment in a high shrink area. had a good team working in store worked well together.toughest part of job was the area we worked in with very little security in the store.loved the daily merchandising of the store and the responsibility of having to increase sales.
good,"Typical day ran smoothly"
good,good place to work. it is family oriented. the pay is awesome. I would recommend this job for people who need a little extra cash
good,"Analyzed work flow procedures and business processes, gathered information from consultation with manager and individuals, studied work products and observed work process."
good,A typical day at work was laughing have fun while working. Management was always willing to learn you something new
good,great company to work for. so glad i got the experience of being a manager with family dollar.
good,"Productive"
good,I still work there and it is a typical Corporate job. I am in the HR department.
good,"Had a good experience working with the Family Dollar crew.Also, working close to my home made it very durable"
good,"It seems they make up their policies as each day goes by. They pay next to nothing, but want you to do everything. Long story short....they are just a ridiculous company to work for. I hated working there."
good,"I cashiered and stocked shelves and cleaned, I learned how to tag and put out merchandise."
good,Hard work unloading them trucks and setting up the store and I did enjoy it.
good,"Love the job, customers, and over all employees."
good,"If I had had a different manager then I would probably still be working here. First of all, I left a job of more than two years because the manager promised me an assistant manager position. Needless to say, this didn't happen. Secondly, the manager was extremely lazy. The only time she came out of her office was when the district manager came in or when she clocked out. The back room was so full of stock that should have been out on the shelves months before. Thirdly, she was a liar. I knew a manager of another store and they would talk about my personal life behind my back. When I reported it to the district manager, she lied, so the DM didn't believe me. The company was great but they have poor judgement in who they place in management positions."
good,"awful management, not enough hours and there wasnt enough customers to make any money. had to find another job."
good,"Hardest part is trying to get so much accomplished in a short amount of time.Family Dollar has great expectations that aren't always realistic. Easiest and most enjoyable is working with the staff and customers. Working with the staff is easy as we had a good group of people who care about doing their job. That isn't always the case in some positions, and that is when good managerial skills have to be utilized. Customers come from very diverse backgrounds so is always challenging"
good,Fast paced working environment but with a strong team we got the work done.
good,"Love working with the public, interacting with different people."
good,its was always fast past enviroment it help me with my people skills and  showed me how to b patient with other as well as understand other people need but its also showed me that i have to be punctional an accurate with time and money.The hardest part of the job was dealing with different type of moods not only from the customers but also from the staff.Ill have to say the most enjoy part would have to be knowing that i help somebody get what hey were looking for or told them were they can find it at i have a joy of helping people in the smallest ways.
good,You have to be very detailed oriented. You have to treat it like it is your own business since the profits are generated on store performance.
good,"A typical day includes stocking shelves, fronting and facing the store and ringing up customers. I've learned useful time management skills and also how to calm down angry customers. I've also learned that I work well when all of the upper management works together and are in a good mood. The hardest part of the job is when a cashier calls off or a truck shows up early or three days late. For me the most enjoyable part of the job is the customer service, I love meeting new people and helping them with things, it warms my heart to help others."
good,IT was an okay work environment. I learned how to be patient with others.
good,Like being a cashier however not enough help to control the store at times
good,family dollar does not care about the employees they fired and hired so much did not get a chance to build relation with any staff
good,Working here is a good place to work. That's it. it just a good place to work
good,"fun workplace i liked it,,wanted more hours...,,what else do u want me to say.. i quit for a reason..wanted something closer to home and more hours"
good,"It was a difficult co to work for,they never was satisfied I worked hard and there was never any thanks for it. The more you did the more they expected from a person. The ones that didn't put any effort into it seemed to get away with just sliding by. I enjoyed my co-workers most of them put out the effort.The hardest part of the day was from opening to noon when I would finally get a cashier to come in so I could finally get of the register and get to go back to work on all the things I needed to get done. I enjoyed relating to the customers"
good,"fast pace, work a lot of hours, learned how to interact with people"
good,I was an assistant manger and enjoyed the customers and other employees. Upper management was extremely unorganized though.
good,"ability to get promoted quickly, certain employees are lazy and have to pick up slack."
good,"Getting paperwork for truck drivers, checking refrigerated trailer temperatures, making rounds around the premises and checking ID's of employees."
good,"I've been at Family Dollar a little less than a year. I started out as a cashier, so an average day would be pretty basic & a steady pace, working register & working on the floor. But the couple months I have been the assistant manager was quite challenging at first about the first 2-3 weeks but I'm always up for a challenge. So a average day would be sometimes fast pace none stop. My co workers are awesome, everyone pitch in. The hardest part of my day would have to be when a customer comes in acting outrageous. But over all it's a lovely day."
good,"I liked this job but must of the mangers didn't know what had to be done and were not trained right including myself "
good,Cashier. Stocked overstock and helped customers find items.
good,From unloading trucks to stocking shelves to assisting customers there's never a dull moment! It can get a bit challenging and very busy but with great co-workers we always made it through the day okay!
good,Great company to work for if your trying to get your foot in the door of retail.
good,"It was a very productive place to work. I was an organized environment, no speaking of the company in general. Our store was clean and it ran smoothly."
good,Ok work environment and got along with the co-workers as well as the management.
good,Keep the store clean and do paper work and keep the shelf clean and wait on costume
good,"lots of work stocking, sales, and customer services. good to start a job in the retail industry"
good,"Asst. Manager for 3 years"
good,"I Liked It Sometimes, Hated It Other Times. Customers Were Very Rude. My CO-worker were great. Good team Players. Face paced."
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work as they have many events and give back to the community.
good,A  place to work that gives you balance between your job and life.
good,"I enjoyed working at Family Dollar as an IT Business Analyst.  It was a very challenging job that I enjoyed a great deal.  Some of my responsibilites included gathering business requirements for small and large projects, writing/executing test scripts for all phases of the projects, training, and providing support documentaion to the end-users."
good,I liked being an assistant manager and the store I didn't like the manager himself.
good,"Everyday, I handled money and cleaned up the store."
good,Family Dollar was a place that customers could come to shop for their everyday needs and receive a great conversation while doing so.
good,"tipical day work and go home earlie."
good,i honestly dont recommend the neighborhood. during the begining of the month always was the hardest. I learned that you cannot argue with customers they are always right.
good,I moved up fast. The work enviroment was very fast paced and I like that. There was always something to do.
good,"Typical retail job, every customer thinks they can get one over on you. Ever customer thinks they are right. The job can be fun, usually a lively bunch of people, who work hard. There is little wrong with this job."
good,Family Dollar was a challenging place to work because you didn't really have enough payroll to staff your store according to get tasks done. I learned not to let my job take over my personal life. My management team sometimes didn't support me the way I needed them to when I needed help in certain areas.
good,"No set schedule, and constant changing of schedule so if you have children you wont have time for them!!"
good,"Stucking goods, customer services, team work and inventory"
good,"Loved my job at Family Dollar. I do think they should have a better training program for starting and existing employees though. Maybe a detailed job description book for each position would help just in case a question or problem may arise during a shift and management cannot be notified for some reason. This would prevent a lot of problems. Some managers might not have been trained properly themselves, so, how are they supposed to train others? Improper training on any level leaves a lot of room for misunderstanding and miscommunication between management, employees, and customers."
good,The hardest part of the job was not having reliable employees
good,"Worked as a cashier and stocked, answered phones and delt with guest problems"
good,It was a great first job it was a well organized business.This job taught me how to have patience
good,"While I was at Family Dollar, I trained to be an Assistant Manager. I learned how to balance drawers, open and close the store, process merchandise, and stock shelves as well."
good,Ran store to maximum capacity. Distributed monies to cashiers when necessary. Opened and closed store when store manager was absent.
good,"For my time was short with Family Dollar, I enjoyed working with the team of people that I worked with."
good,Good hire/promote with in system.Not a very safe work environment in some areas of town.
good,"a typical day would be clocking in and jumping right into work, working for papa johns there is no one set position. You go from taking the order in person or over the phone and then go and make the pizza from scratch, cook it, then package it in the box with the label to tell the driver that his order is ready to be sent out. Management was a little lazy but then again she was always in her office so I'm sure she was doing manager things. Me and my co workers worked as a well oiled machine. The hardest part about the job was being overwhelmed with orders. the most enjoyable part for me was knowing how much work i got done that day and knowing that I did a lot."
good,"It allowed me at a young age to learn responsibility. I love it there, it helped me to learn that I was a leader"
good,"Assisting customers, stocking and rearranging shelves for more products to increase shelves, learning as you go, always room for advancement and the hours are not the greatest but they pay you for what you work plus any and all overtime,"
good,The hardest part of the job is time management you have to know how to multitask between customers and getting monthly schematics done.
good,"System is old. They need better management. Co-workers were fun to work with. Need help improving store needs, missing store necessities to satisfy customer needs."
good,"I enjoy working with family dollar, the company has help me grow as a person by allowing me to be myself, and expand my horizon. The most enjoyable part of being apart of family dollar is that I can come to working knowing I can make a difference in someone's life just by conversting and engaging with the customers."
good,"This is one of the easiest jobs I have have ever had! Started the day by turning everything on, counting drawers to insure change was ready for customers. We had shipments once or twice a week that we unloaded ourselves. Stocked, merchandised, replenished, answered phones, and did cash handling. I can't remember anything hard about the job. The best part about working there is that no one is constantly looking over your shoulder. Its like if they hired you they trust that you will do a good job."
good,Good place to work. Always something to keep you busy. Scheduling is always consistent
good,"This Company has taught me everything I really know about Retail,customer service,management and so on from doing payroll to processing freight. Great company to grow with as i have done 13yrs of my life but to be let go after everything I have done for that company was a shock n still hurtfully unbelievable . The struggle of inner city stores and the problems that come with it. I got through it and always had a well stocked organized store with very little staff and very little time they gave. Overall Family Dollar Corp. doesn't see what us little people do and how much time and effort is sacrificed to give them what is asked of a store manager n their staff. If it wasn't for us little people in store level they wouldn't even have a business. They should have way more gratitude towards the people who truly make them there money. However that's not how it go's."
good,Long hours and a lot of cleaning. Too much heavy lifting. Need to get paid better for working holidays. The employees are knowledgeable and easy to work with. Really enjoyed working for them.
good,The customers are wonderful and understanding. Even when its truck day and product is hard to get to. All the co-workers get along and help out one another.
good,Not really a good balance between life and work... but love working and trying to make company better..
good,"Work with customers daily, run a register, clean the store, everyone has to work every Monday which is truck day, constantly stocking and facing shelves and racks.  Management at the store I worked at was unacceptable and showed favoritism.  Co-workers, some were helpful and some were not.  The hardest part of the job were Mondays with unloading the trucks and stocking all the new product."
good,"Deposit drops, supervising other employees, loss prevention, restocking, ordering new supplies, and closing the store every night."
good,the service in the store is great. The company is an overal great work place.
good,I have no review on this job. It a job and it served it's purpose.
good,My co-workers were nice to work with and my manager worked well with my busy school schedule.
good,"Everyday is a adventure working in retail, staying on top of your customer service game and treating customers with a great attitude and a smile keeps them coming back. Management and  co-workers need to work together to make any job succeed, and I had a good team.The 6am deliveries can be somewhat tough be overall the job was one heck of a good work experience and having customers saying they had a great customer service and will return really does something for you soul!"
good,Stock Inventory and assist customers through the day.  I learned to assist customers and work independently as needed.  Working with a coworker was enjoyable.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday which were customers.
good,"Open register to start the beginning of your day. Stock and"
good,it was a lot of lifting involved but i enjoyed working there because it was a lot of people i went to school with. i learned that even though u are a hard worker don't mean u will keep your job.The managers was nice they would always have me laughing. The hardest part of the job was lunch once i stopped my feet would really get to hurting.The most enjoyable thing about the job was looking forward to the next day to see everybody i had to leave the night before.
good,"I like this job, because I like working with people and this offer ways to advance such as promotion and great benefits."
good,"it's and ok place to work. "
good,its a good place to work wish they would give the young people a chance for a fresh start out of high school tho here in shreveport  you have to be 18 to work there.
good,"good work place and productive workplace"
good,"great job for someone who is in school, loved my co-workers they were very kind and understanding. i had very low hours which lead me to quit."
good,well when i came into work in the morning and and work till the after noon working the register and putting stock up. the management helped me out when they could and always stuck to the rules and my coworkers were great. the hardest part of the job was working the cash register and putting stock up at the same time. the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers out and doing what i can to make there experience great
good,The employees sometimes do not come to work or do not work at all.
good,"customer service, money handling, freight handling & stocking shelves. shift management"
good,"Getting work done"
good,The managers didn't do much of anything! The customer service reps. did mostly everything! another employee and I always had to switch shifts because the manager would schedule us when we had school. Also we did everything from unloading the trucks to cashing out customers and stocking the sales floor while our managers lounged around.
good,The customers are very nice & entertaining. If have a open heart like i do you will walk out everyday with a smile on your face & making people day. Some of the co workers was pretty nice as well but some also had attitudes problems they made the days sour. The hardest part of the job is running the cashier & stocking at the same time. Fridays are the best days cause its pay day.
good,on thursdays the workers have to unload the shipment truck and place the items on the shelfs by closing time. since we have all the workers there on thursday and working togather everything be done at closing time.
good,"Typical day at this job was basically stocking shelves, unloading trucks, and keeping a clean store."
good,I wished that I made more money and worked more hours. The work was not easy and I worked extra hard.
good,I worked there for a year and a half. It was really stressful. The manger hired unreliable people. The other employees and I would have to work double shifts.
good,"I would come in for work and take care of customers. I learned that no matter how nice you are to people, if they treat you badly you just have to be nice back. Management was alright, they knew what they were doing. My co-workers were nice. There was not a hard part about this job. The most enjoyable part of this job was when i would see customers on the regular and they would say hi how are you? and know me by name."
good,"Training to be a assistant manager, I learned how to do a lot of new things and I really enjoyed the experience. The hardest part of this job was to try to meet everbody needs an the most enjoyable part of the job is that i got to meet different people."
good,"This job was not very enjoyable i mean don't take me wrong, I love working with customers but when its the employess giving you a hard time it makes it difficult to do your job. The best part of the day was when we would be busy."
good,It was a decent place to work as long as people never mixed business with personal
good,"A typical day at work would involve opening the store and setting the registers up for the cashiers. After that I would walk around the store and see what items needed to be restocked. After delegating these orders I would be responsible to keep the store neat, clean, handle all customer problems and complaints."
good,"It was a good experience for me in Human Resources, I learned how to interact with different cultures, and how to properly handle a unhappy customer. The customer is always right."

good,Learned a lot of skills while employed at Family Dollar. Skills that I was able to take forward and apply to my other jobs.
good,not a bad place to work. will not let me get 40 hours per week. safety has to be a major concern.
good,Most of my work days I would spend either at the register taking care  of customers or stocking the shelves in the store.
good,"I have some really good co-workers, we all work very well with one another. The hardest thing we do is unload trucks weekly. We all have each others backs and always try to help each other out when needed. I've learned that at times dealing with the public can be a little stressful, but all in all it's good. The management is good also."
good,"I got along really well with the store manager, and i stocked worked every day."
good,"* working at family dollar is very cool"
good,I love the Customer's made my day never a dull moment. Manager was great at teaching me what I needed to know.
good,if you like your job you will stay there long and be willing to learn new thing
good,If you are a high school graduate and you are looking for your first job. Family Dollar is the best place to choose. when i use to work at Family Dollar i was happy to see that i'm helping people choose their best product to use in their daily lives. i would wake up and get ready to go to work and when i get there my manager was already there preparing the store for a crazy busy wonderful day. i'm not saying that the pay was the best but i'm trying to say that i was able to live a life with no pressure and that was because of the way my manager and coworkers were. being at Family Dollar i learned a lot of things. first i learn to respect and serve whoever comes in front of my register  and i learned to be very patient an order to satisfy my clients. the hardest part of the job was to deal with the customers on the daily basis because not everybody have the same attitude. the most enjoyable part of the job you get to relax and do your job with minimal supervision as long as you understand your assignment for the day you get to talk to your coworkers and laugh sometimes and to me it was fun. i would go back and work for family dollar again if the pay was a little bit higher because who doesn't have bill this days. that's all i had to say
good,"A typical day would start by reading store managers to do list."
good,"A Typical day was dropping bank , deposites, keeping store clean,counting money, managing clerks, assisting customer needs,opeing and closing store,and following the direction of the store managers needs."
good,"I start at 7am with a walk through, start the safe open store on computer, start morning paper work, count safe and open all registers, count cigarettes, send this information by e-mail, read all  E-mail, check daily projects, to do list, open doors to the public.          "
good,a typical day is very fast paste  it gives you a since of responsibility also you have fun and hard working co-workers
good,"This experience was different than others that I've worked at. The employees for the most part work nice to work with, but there was a lot of stealing going on (cashiers ringing up friends and forgetting to actually ring up items) and cashiers not wanting to work when they were there. Some of the customers were good, decent people, and some of them were there just to shoplift."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of cleaning my station first after clocking in, performing all cashier responsibilities (counting down register) assisiting all customers, straightening the store, and stocking on required days. I've learned how to handle all customers in a manerable way, and working in a fast pace environment."
good,My typical work day i would start with a brief discussion with my manager about the work i was expected to do for the day. Other times i would learn about other departments.
good,I learned how to set up a store for opening. I set up the shelves for the products.
good,I enjoyed working at Family Dollar because it was fast paced.
good,I learned alot from this job and met alot of new people working this job. Was able to make lifelong relationships and friends at this employer a very interactive field.
good,"Typical Day at work included mopping floors, stocking shelves, unloading supply trucks, working cash register, maintaining shelves of the store.  Management was decent and didn't hover over your shoulder the whole time.  Co-workers were from all walks of life just looking to feed themselves and families.  Hardest part of the job was the minimum wage and schedule changes from week to week.  The easiest part of the job was pretty much everything about it."
good,Aiding customers in purchasing/returning merchandise. Handled cash transactions. Taking customer complaints and solving the issue.
good,bad scheduling. inadequate trained management.not as a company as a whole just my particular experience.
good,i was assistant manager meaning that i was the manager when the manager had her days off. i would stay at work from open to close. and make sure that everything got done and theat the customers were happy

good,"a very fun and exciting job i learned alot of things as to fixing cars"

good,work extra hard and don't get paid enough for the work the end up doing 
good,"I have not worked there in a long time. At the time, the store was very unorganized, but it seems to have worked out its issues since then. There is different management, and there are different workers so I am not sure how it is to work there anymore."
good,"Typical day would consist of me opening the store at 8 a.m. Putting stock away and straightening up the store from time to time. The management team could have been a little more better then what it was, everyone was not on the same page, no one wanted to barely do any work. The co-workers were easy to get along with, no problems with them at all, The hardest part of being an assistant manager was dealing with customers who wanted to make a scene just to prove a point. The most enjoyable part about working at Family Dollar. Knowing that I was working my tail off to provide for my kids and all that they needed and wanted. "
good,"Fun place to work and a nice environment. Upper management is pretty clueless when it comes to first line management. Not nearly enough payroll to properly run the store. Pay is better than most small box retail stores but work load per employee is much higher. Computer systems are far far FARRR from perfect. Team member and assistant manager positions aren't bad but store managers and district managers have no job security whatsoever. They fire store managers left and right for reasons beyond their control. Bottom line, it's a decent job that is close to home that pays better than other similar companies. Would not attempt to make a career out of it unless I constantly wanted my job to be threatened and to be told I wasn't good enough."
good,"Family Dollar was an enjoyable place to work. On typical day my responsibility's were to unload the company truck, stock my departments merchandise, assist customers, and stocking the warehouse with overflow."
good,I was not fond of the manager. There were many complaints about the store manager from customers. I did like my job and the other people around me.
good,"A typical day at work was opening the store by 9AM. Making sure everything looked clean and ready for the customers. I learned a lot from my time at the Family Dollar. I learned how to do book keeping, make schedule's, run a store and deliver great customer service. My team was great, we all got along and had fun. I believe you should be able to get along with your  co-workers and be able to work in a fun friendly environment. The hardest part of my job was not getting the maximum training to do my job to the fullest. I did my job to the fullest of my abilities. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with all new and old customer's. Being able to get them to smile and have a conversation with them."
good,"I was very excited about the opertunities with this company, I was initially a Second Asst. Manager and was promoted to lead Asst, Store Manager, and District Manager in a short very while."
good,keep friendly has the welcome to store and keep the money corrections and store stock up and asked customer if you can help them and it easy to get along with everyone.

good,"There is not a typical day at work, every day is different. I am always on the move helping one person after the next."
good,1st we would count our draw then stock until we had a customer maintained a clean store by sweeping and picking up drop merchandise
good,"My experience with Family Dollar is somewhat sour.  In the beginging it was great, I received a promotion within the first 2 months I was there due to my hard work and previous experience.  After I became Assistant Store Manager I was expected to work open to close every day we were open due to the store manager leaving to open another store, when I asked the district manager for another manager to come help with the hours I was told we werent a priority store.  However I do miss the team I did work with on a daily basis and my customers, the company should reprioritize and understand a single mother can not make her job her only focus."
good,"Small store, poor leadership. No room for advancement. No incentives for good work."
good,Family dolar is a serious company they mean business all the time.
good,lots of hours. Salaried for 50 hours weekly but always put 60-70 weekly hours in.called in to work a lot due to staff calling in.No home life due to working so much.
good,"Typical day at work was mainly organizing everything. I learned better communication , writing, sales, and cashiering techniques. Management is good they listen, except when it comes to paying more. Co-Workers were great if they weren't stealing stuff or not doing work. Hardest part of the job were the belligerent customers. Most enjoyable were the slow days when everything was easy."
good,A typical day at work would be signing on my register and stocking if i don't have any customers. I learned how to have patience with people and everything else fell in place. The management was very helpful if I had any questions and the co-workers got along well. the hardest part of the job for me was the crazy hours and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people.

good,Family dollar was an okay job but you risk being robbed and it makes so uncomfortable to work
good,"Working with customers and putting up stock, I learned how to handle all kinds of situations weather good or bad, management is ok, co-workers were like family, hardest part of my job was not being able to stop people from stealing, enjoyable part of the is the customers."
good,"work register, do shipment , count deposit at end of day, sweep and mop store before closing"
good,Participated in various shows in order to show my fast food skill.
good,"Family Dollar is a very fast paced environment because the amount of hours allowed to employees per week consists of 2 team members per shift to try and work as much freight as possible between customer service. I learned to manage time better because of the short handed experiences and my co workers were very friendly, funny and hard working. The hardest part of my job was working with only 2 team members (a manager and cashier) during holiday seasons. I mostly enjoyed my customers because they were always so warm and happy to see me."
good,"This job taught me a lot about dealing with the public. Co-workers were easy to get along with, and excellent management. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet for many hours."

good,Its a work place the manager there wasnt really into her work there fore it was a job just to go and get a paycheck
good,"A fast pace environment. Hands on training kind of job. Being short staffed is the hardest part of the job, being that as a store manager, you are expected to be a in some many places at one time. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers."

good,Typical day is pulling up needed systems and programs. The work is the same work daily but the amount differs from day to day. Atmosphere is teamwork and relaxed.
good,I enjoyed working in the Mayo store because of the manager at the time-she was a great teacher and leader.
good,"Long 10 hr shifts , you have one 15 minute break and another 30 minute break. The area I worked in had the worst customers ever! The worst retail job I ever had."
good,"i have 11 yrs in asst. manager hard working i learned how to do payroll, schedule, daily paperwork , open& closind stores, check emails,being a key holder, promotions,and i love workin with people and working as a team"
good,Was a great company to work for but were going through management changes at a rapid pace. I enjoyed my boss I worked with for 8 years and my fellow employees.
good,"Tried to exchange hours because my husbands car was in the shop & he had to at work a certain time, was not willing to do so."

I learned how to be a manager by doing bank deposits on a regular basis and closing the store. I got along with my co-workers never had a problem with anybody.

good,I enjoyed working and bringing smiles to people's faces. The employees and managers were very nice as expected.
good,"I started as part-time cashier. Caught the manager stealing, ended manager of the store within a month of being hired. NO training for job specifics. I hired and trained all employees, opening and closing store, daily -weekly-monthly reports, deposits, cash handling,merchandising, store orders, unload truck, stock merchandise. Failed yearly inventory, so was sent to an even busier store. ended up working 90+ hours a week, with very little assistance. I got overwhelmed and left."
good,Making sure that all task are handle in a timely manner therefore I will have time to attended to the customer needs as well to provide them with excellent customer service.
good,"I started my day off with either opening the store doing the paper work making the bank deposits reviewing all task notes by the manager or corporate office best part of the morning was opening the doors to the customers it was nice knowing nearly everyone by name,or I would go in for the evening and close the store, completed whatever task that was left uncomplete recoverd the store counted down the registers and got them ready for opening the next day drop off deposit scanned the parking lot making sure nothing needed to be cleaned oh we had a DTF plan when the truck came in mostly at 5am or 5:30am it would come myself and another employee would meet to unload we always had coffee and snack cakes and when ever it would come in the middle of the day when customers where about it was slower and we always had powerades and enjoyed our lunch break together inventory control was the best thing that I learned and enjoed the most,counting the outs and reordering made our truck alot easier for ourselves and our customers oh DTF means Door To Floor 48 hr. to put the merchandise in its home my hours kept getting cut and I had no choice but go to another job."
good,"A typical work day for me began at 5:00am. I was stationed at a location that was approximately 30 to 45 mins from my residence. I would arrive at the store about 5:45 and proceed to prepare the store for opening on business. The opening procedures included daily paperwork, checking signage, verifying deposits, reviewing security footage from the previous day, and doubling checking the condition of the salesfloor. After the first shift cashier and the store is open I continue on with my daily plan. I worked on merchandising, product placement, assisting customers, and supervising employees."

Daily I am learning best practices and way to enhance the work environment. I try to make the work place as accomodating and enjoyable as possible for my direct reports. The hardest part of my job is talking to a poor performing associate who seem like they are trying really hard to be productive and get required numbers. The most enjoyalbe part is talking to my associates and learning more about them."

Operate cash register, scanners and computers to itemize and total customer purchases; collect payments and make change for cash transactions; and balance drawer at the end of each shift. Assist with store stocking, floor-sets and opening/closing procedures."
good,A typical day for me involved stocking the shelves and running the register. I learned to do my work even if no one else does theirs. Management watched from the two way mirror as we worked. My co-workers were both assistant managers that helped me on the floor. The hardest part was getting enough hours. The most enjoyable part was having to dress comfortable.
good,I love working with customer service everyday there is something new that i am learning. When i clocked it i have to loan in and get right to work. Some days we as cashiers have to put up stock in the health and beauty dept. I like most of my co workers but some of the managers take they to job to serious.

good,enjoyed working for family dollar was a very busy. i would rather stick to in office job
good,Making sure that you have something to do because the business was really slow. The management was very well but you usually went through them fast because of how the business was.

good,A pretty good job as a store clerk. my customer service has improved as months went by and I feel confident in talking to and helping people.
good,"Working at this particular job tests your patience. But it's up to you to overcome that and provide great customer service. Everyday there's a new challenge. Being an Assistant Manager is not to difficult. I do my tasksto the best of my ability. My coworkers are very cooperative, they don't give me any trouble. The hardest part of the job is keeping the customers happy. As much as you will do for them, to some it still may not be enough. Sometimes it's disappointing but I get over it. The best part is knowing that, at the very least, I made someone's day by offering them great customer service."
good,A typical day at work consisted of our regular customers which was great to get to know.
good,"On an average day at work, I would order fill in non conveyable, and sometimes in conveyable. The hardest parts of the job is dealing with the extreme temps and meeting quota for the day. This job has taught me how to stay productive and make good use of my time"

good,Family Dollar is a great job if looking for a part time job or full time with training provided.
good,"I currently work for Family Dollar I started in Feb of 2012 and just recently been promoted to assistant store manager. I enjoy working for family dollar but the company has just been shown to be not all that it is cracked up to be. Compensation is truely a joke to the upper upper management. They do not pay enough for the work load that they expect you to perform. on top of that they expect you to run a store on a minimum budget and produce top of the line results. Bottom line I am looking for something else as I type this, this company is a joke although advancement is swift thats only becuase the previous person either quit or was fired becuase of the situtations the company put their employees under."
good,Taught me many things tnat can be used in any job. Communication can be a little better in the company.
good,"A typical work day was sometimes busy and sometimes slow but I still loved the environment, I learned so much when it came down to customer service and how to deal with certain types of customers. The managers were what I would say ""Exciting"" but I loved coming into work. The hardest part of the job was when the trucks came in and unloading everything and stocking it all up but I still enjoyed it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfication of helping others and meeting so many new people."
good,Managed all aspects of daily store operations including:
good,"i enjoy working there , sometime is not friendly people work there but i dont complain unless it bothering me and i always offer to help out anytime they need. good with numbers."
good,"I learned how to drive a standard car, management was great, my co-workers were outstanding and fun to be around. The most enjoyable part was running for the cars and conversing with guest."
good,"It's a small store therefor you have the responsibilities of EVERYTHING ( cashiering, stocking at the same time, throwing truck as well) minimum pay with few hours"
good,Good place of business and great employees nice people to be around and great costumers
good,typically did sme thing as Freds I went to work as a cashier advanced to asst mgr then to mgr was very stressfull no payroll big trucks company has improved since I left
good,"Friendly atmosphere, some days expected to work over, training could be improved."
good,Its a great place to work at. The customer is nice and emplyee
good,"My day was never typical once I became Assistant Manager. We would unload the truck on truck day. The Store Manager or myself would take the deposit to the bank and get change. Then we would stock shelves and assist customers all day. Sometimes we would run the cash register. One of us, when it was that time, would order product and supplies."
good,Was not there long but the people I worked with were very helpful in answering questions if I needed them answered
good,"A typical day at work is fun,action packed, and full of excitement. I mean sure I have to deal with customers day in and day out whether they are in a good mood or a bad mood, I try to make the customer as comfortable as possible. I've learned that honesty goes a long way and speaks a lot about that person. Management is a great position to hold, you have to be stern, aggressive, productive. What I like about the position is having the responsibilities. I feel that I can make a difference where ever the place may be. The hardest part of my job has to include being away from my family. I do not have a set schedule so most of my nights take place at work. The most enjoyable part of my job is showing up everyday knowing I can perform the duties that are required of me!"
good,"A typical work day can consist of anything in retail but at family dollar they took this beyond limits, i enjoyed my daily job because of the family i was fortunate to work with. I have learned with this job how to deal with all aspects of stress,"
good,Welcome customers entering the Family Dollar Store.
good,"Customer service, merchandizing and unloading trucks. I learned how to run a store and ballance payroll dollors while covering the store hours. The co-workers were great to work with. The best part of the job was it was close to home, the customers were friendly and the job was pretty simple."
good,"organized, however, no integrity. Was not happy with their protocal."
good,I liked the fact that I interacted with people on a daily basis. I'm a very talkative person.
good,well cant say much since i worked here for a short period of time.
good,While working there I meet alot of new and different people. At some points I can be very active and there is also alot of down time. I am looking for more hours to work.

good,A very well rounded cultural environment with positive admiration from employees to be trusted to accomplish they're goals in achieving the store's reports.
good,"Family Dollar is a fun place to work. The employees are very nice, helpful, and hard working. The store itself is a clean, safe, and happy environment. The merchandise is always stocked properly and neatly on the shelves. Family Dollar also has great deals on everything you need for low prices."
good,Sometimes my week work would be closer to 90 hours while some times it did stay closer to the salaried amount of hours which was 52. They abuse the ones who are willing to work instead of building support so no one has to work those kind of shifts.
good,It was a fun an productive environment to work in.
good,"location is everything!! most of these types of store are put in lower income area's, so you deal with a variety of different type of people. Treating everyone the same (nice) is the key. High thief"
good,"Even if you are new, if the store fails inventory you don't get your raise, Store Manager never available. Trucks are backed up, no security to help with shoplifting."
good,This job is for a person that have no kids and is able to work long hours. They must be able to dedicate all their time to family dollar. This job is not for person that cant think outside the box to come up with new Ideas
good,"Great Company to work for, Not so great if your'e looking to advance. I've been with Family Dollar for over 10 years and I've seen them go through many transitions. But most recently, it seems their values have changed. It's more about the dollar than the family."
good,"-Communication is key. "
good,A typical day at work for me was making sure the merchandise was properly organized. I would check our sales and productivity. Once a week I would write a schedule for me and my team members. The hardest part of the job was that I was there a lot by myself because we didn’t have a lot of payroll. So I was expected to do most things by myself including unloading multiple trucks a week. The most enjoyable part was our regular customers. They were like my family because I would see them everyday or sometimes even multiple times during the day.
good,"A typical day has you running register, waiting on customers.  Giving customers assistance when needed.  Making sure shelves are stocked and look full.  Also keeping the place clean."
good,The company overall treated me with respect and dignity. My managers were pretty laidback for the most part. The job can get intense at times especially dealing with rowdy customers but as long as the cashier keeps a cool head any situation can be defused. I enjoyed my stay.
good,the work schedule is flexible because of my part-time position but after the everything is middle chaotic three people in each shift make it hard to get the job done.
good,"Other than the flexibility to move to new locations, I felt abandoned at my post. Unrealistic expectations for minimal budget given to the store. Working unrealistic hours with low budget to hire reliable employees."
good,This is a great company to work for. I know that they have merged with Dollar Tree and I  still have friends that work there and they have no complaints.
good,Probably would not work for the company in store again. I'd consider taking an office job for them though. Management was unmotivated to make changes and improvements to the store. I was offered a position in management but due to plans to relocate very soon I declined.
good,"Working at family dollar was a good experience,I kept to myself and got my job done. Don’t let nobody take advantage of you, and always make sure you know your time."
good,"Working there was my first job and it was good. It gave me a good feel for how having a job would be. There were no problems at all everyone there is nice, hardworking, and respectful. I just decided to apply for other jobs."
good,I liked most of the people I worked with and a learned a lot about life and becoming a better person and also learn how to  teach as well. I'm glad I got to experience working with this company.
good,"While working there i enjoyed working with people that were there. I don't have to much to say about it. This job was just a filler, until I could get back into the oilfield."
good,"I came to work for them because they needed help. After I got there I helped improve things greatly i.e cleaning, organizing, inventory. Then all of the managers left leaving me with two other employees. I was only there for 2 weeks mind you. Both of these employees were part time and had other jobs. i met a lot of other family dollar associates as they had to pull them from other stores frequently. They trained me and bumped me up to assistant manager with talk of possibly becoming the store manager. Unfortunately, due to lack of employees and upper management being swamped with other stores that also had most of there employees walking out, nothing was getting resolved. Family Dollar could be a great career path but the company has to fix a lot of things and train employees better."
good,I recently was emploied by Family Dollar as a part time employee. My overall experience as a cashier was excellent. I enjoied the place and amount work hours available to me.
good,"It's hard work having to watch the floor, take care of cashier whenever business picks up or giving changed. While putting up freight (truck). Count the safe and watch cameras for people stealing."
good,"I’ve been with family dollar for a year so far and I like working for this company. The downside is that there is a crazy turnover rate for cashiers or customer service representatives. When the store is fully staffed and everyone is on board and they do their part, it’s a great place to work."
good,Nothing bad to say about company. This company gave me the chance to become a better leader and learn and grow. I would of love more hours and pay but I enjoyed my time there.
good,Was a good job. Overtime was a pkys because Store manager was never in Store. Justin Let Store everyday to luck up gos child and would nevera return back to end this shift.
good,Love working with people.am people person.excellent customer service skills.and fast with my hands.i love working fot family dollars but i didnt get any hours.
good,"Great customer service  and got the job as Assistant Manager a challenge I enjoy the job. Overall Duties: Managing the frontend, backroom, cashier, bank deposit, facing, ordering stock."
good,Nothing to say about this company at the present moment. My work experience was great just wish i would had gotten the proper training when transitioning over from assistant manager to store manager.
good,Super stressful for managers who have to be in charge and make less money than other company’s. It’s hard to believe any family dollar is in business.
good,"I had been there for about a year when we got our 3rd store manager,well my wife got into a car accident, I told my manager about it and stated I may have to have time off to help her,I asked about if there was any paper to fill out for the FMLA and she said she would take care of it all and if she needed me for anything she would call,I kept track of the weeks and called into HR and asked them when I was required to retuen to work and they said I had been let go !!!"
good,Having worked there was a good experience as a manager but the work itself was too much for what they paid. I didn't last long for the same reason of feeling underpaid for the work itself.
good,"I would have to say the most likeable thing about my job is meeting,new people and learning new things . I also enjoy being able to travel for the company"
good,It completely depends who you work for and with. Its not a huge company so you have less people to work with and for. If you can deal with a little bit of BS and maybe think about staying there about two years then you could probably reach assistant manager. overall not a bad experience.
good,"A typical work day for me includes coming in at 7 am and stocking shelves till 2pm-4pm. I'm also required to recover, put up recoved/returned items, mark down damaged items, take out the trash, clean the store if the closing manager doesn't do it. I like my job and I like the company but the constant nagging or pitting one person against the other one is getting old. The hardest part of my job is working out the leftover freight from the last 2 MMgrs plus what they deliver to us each week.s"
good,For most part was a good job to do learned great deal bout retail but management was not the best good have been better may have stayed longer if would have changed
good,In all it was great working there.  Friendly environment always have something to do . Stocking is done 3 days out of the week cleaning is done every day.  Always a place where you can find thing when they are stocked
good,Family dollar was a good entry level job. The managers were very friendly and helpful. Work place was very clean and organized. When ever  it was someones birthday a manager or assistant manager would buy a cake to celebrate the occasion.
good,"There is opportunity for growth but you have to really prove yourself. You have freedom but it can be a bad thing if you are not disciplined. You have to work 6 days a week which is the worst thing about the job. I would return if I could have a 5 day work week. Also, if your district Manager cannot find a replacement, he will not recommend you for a promotion."
good,"The entire Family Dollar franchise as a whole is not terrible & depending on what type of work you're looking for; however,you should not expect to make a career out of it. I also would advise to be mindful of certain store locations as some have issues with item security."
good,"Work was fine but the management was terrible. Communication was very inconsistent and sometimes hours would be moved around without telling people, if you even got hours. Working for family Dollar was enjoyable and simple but the management was horrible."
good,"Good company to work for if working with a good crew.  One person slacks off and its downhill from there. Truck is not for the weak..  Rain,  shine,  snow,  or scortching sun ot has to be put away.  The holiday season os the worst for this..  Trucks are nearly double normal box count."
good,"They say they appreciate you, but there is so many people in and out that the management barely knows who is who, lack of supervision causes unnecessary work for good workers."
good,Family dollar is a decent job as long as you can get decent hours and are hired at a high traffic store. There was always something to do but at less busy stores it become tedious and annoying tasks.
good,"If you work hard, you're guaranteed a job with great possibility of advancement quite quickly. Most stores are in low income areas and customers can be pretty tough. If they paid better, the hard work and stress would be worth it. As a salaried Store Manager, plan on working 52+ hours per week. The pay is too low for only getting one day off per week and having no life. But, if you need a job, they're always hiring."
good,Good company but losing identity while trying to compete.  Lots of stores are cheap Family Dollar need to put more money into employees.  Having enough people to get truck and inventory ran daily.  Letting people know that this is the place to go for that extra that other stores don't have.
good,Ok until management then time consumption plays factor good work environment good pay make sure to pay attention to money task completion important as well
good,The only bad thing was management never helped when needed them to whenever the district manager came in anything that was wrong because of them was automatically the cashiers fault
good,Manage the store and employees counted registers down made deposits unload and stock items on shelf. Made returns keep store cleans. rotate items on shelf checked for discontinued item.
good,District management overall tries to trap their general managers in a position. They have monthly sales competitions with no prize only a write up if not complete. Family dollar refused to take care of a pest issue residing under their refrigerator section. They also use job security as a threat for questioning actions against their failure to comply to state regulations
good,fast-paced and stressful nothing too exciting. some of the customers that come through are a little tough to deal with at times but overall good people.
good,"Working for family dollar is very stressful, you feel like you live there and I do so much that I feel I'm under paid by far. my boss is excellent about everything but its really anyone above store manager s make it hard to enjoy work, lack of communication."
good,"I really did like the job at first. My first two weeks I had 100.6 hours (i was on spring break). My co-workers were nice, I already had the experience, the customers were cool. My problem was that my manager sent me home ( I CAME IN 20MIN. EARLIER) because I looked sick. I told him I was fine but sent me home anyways. Later that night I got a text from my manager saying people have been complaining about covering for me (i'ma senior in high school and it is close to graduation) So I got fired. The pay was good."
good,"I had a great manager at the time very understanding with your schedule and needs,she also was very good at teaching and showing you anything uyou didn't understand"
good,besides everyday dealings the best was customer interaction customers become family to you when things are ran good and they have a positive place to come to my customers were great and loyal to the store and me and always showed appreciation for a good job
good,I didn’t like the pay great place to work a family friendly place an good management the jess wanted more money i jess loocking for a job where i can make good money and be around good people
good,"Very demanding, hard to have balance between work and personal life. Management is constantly rolling out new programs that they never follow up on. The delivery system is a mess and very dated. Overall not a bad job if you have and can keep a good team if not manager will have to pick up the slack and work more than the recommended hours and not get compensated..they do however offer pretty lucrative bonus incentives based on comp sales/ inventory results"
good,"I have had many jobs before, and Family Dollar was a really interesting ride. I am currently still working there, however I am looking for another job. If you are new to working or starting out, Family Dollar can teach you a lot of things. I have worked at several stores since starting. My home store manager is really nice and down to earth. The only thing I would recommend for her to change is that she needs to learn to keep her promises! I won't go into full detail about that but, I would recommend if you work here to take the managers promises with a grain of salt. As far as other stores I have worked out the managers varied, some being lazy and others being supportive and fun to work for. "
good,Working at family dollar is an interesting job just need more hours. They have lack in professional etiquette. District managers do not know how to speak to the employees
good,"It's a good job if your a people's person. Great flexibility. It's a good work environment management is okay customers are great."
good,"It depends on the location of the store. The store i worked at was in a less desirable part of town, and as such, customers were very particular about prices. Despite them being ridiculously low and affordable as is"
good,"The job was great the location wasn’t to good , and the DM at the time wasn’t Enforecing the raise so I never got one . Job had potential just . Just need better pay and more Security"
good,"Family dollar absolutely does not allow overtime. The hours as in any retail store are inconsistent. Depending on the location management varies, but it is always a fast paced store to work in especially on truck days."
good,The entire company is so cheap. They refused to upgrade on old run down equipment. And the buildings are bad too. and they don't pay that well either.
good,"The manager is laughably the worst employee there! The store is always filthy with dirt, one of the part-time assistant managers is unbelievably lazy. Myself included, there are 3 good employees but myself and the best of the other two are leaving. You also encounter some unsavory people and there is A LOT of theft on a daily basis."
good,Family Dollar is an expected part-time job. I ran the front or the stock room depending who was on my shift. the front consisted of the register and customer service. The back consisted of stocking the aisle also creating space for the warehouse
good,Nice place to work learn how to deal with customers while working manager taught me alot while working there met alot of good people while working there
good,I feel like i dont get paid enough for what i do. Customers are really rude. Family dollar stores often get robed or assaulted thats is why i decided that this job would be temporary.
good,It's a good company to work for to get experience.  This is not a top down bottom up ran company.  Technology is 20 yrs behind time.Creativity and innovations seems to be less than most organizations.
good,Decent enough for a part time high school student not enough to support yourself afterwords unless you're a head manager. Employees were kind and reasonable.
good,It is a great place to work.You are doing different things every day.You take care of customers needs your stocking the store for the week.People fun.
good,Try to see people ( employers) true potential and give them a chance to show themselves off with out playing side quote on quote talk behind others back . Keep it professional and not Getto create a positive atmosphere and freely give away what was giving to you ... A Chance 😊
good,The store was an older store.  The apparrence was not the best.  They are organized but can look unorganized.  Should be properly cleaned and arranged for a better shopping experience.
good,Gave me an opportunity to transition from a developer to an analyst.  Nurtured my growth and development in the new role.  True definition of team…always willing to help each other
good,I basically was in this job for the insurance benefits they offered. They were better than the insurance that my husband at the time had with his job.
good,I would start off opening the store. Then get a boat of supplies to stock and just stick and work with customers most of the day. I would be there all day myself from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm.
good,"It's very productive , I wouldn't Blame anyone does choosing this as a career path. Fun also, well it can be fun. Just have to know how to work at the same pase"
good,"I had a great manager, loved most of the people on my team, most of the customers were nice and engaging. Fast paced and the company never seemed to give enough hours or hire enough workers. You cant have two people work one big store and expect everything to be done on time."
good,My experience while working at Family Dollar was a kind of roller coaster ride. Dealing with certain managers were very pleasant and enjoyable. But certain ones took they're job a little too deeply and were treating employees as less than people. some of the district managers were very inconsiderate to others feelings and positions and placed their frustrations on other employees.
good,"you have to be aware at all times it's like being on pins and needles, it's very challenging and stressful, if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't unless the security was better than it is."
good,It was a great job at first because all of us were pretty close and seemed like everyone put some work in but now it’s different. They expect things to get done but only have one person working on it which annoys me. I don’t like that at all. If you want something done especially something that’s big like putting out truck there needs to be several employees workin on it not just one. Here lately seems like I’m the only one getting stuff done. Not saying there not doing there job but if they are I haven’t noticed but I love them all and would never talk down on them
good,"Good people, good pay, but poor upper management. I liked the people but the general manager has poor judgement. Other than that I loved the job. Fast paced and Competitive Pay."
good,Working at family dollar is a laid back environment with seldom fast-paced scenarios. Working at family dollar is a non-stressful job that requires you to perform at the very best of your capabilities.
good,"Managing a planning team with relative autonomy to make impactful and profitable decisions. The Merchandising Buyers are dependent on the Planning team for both annual in season and preseason plans was well as assortment/SKU level plan input. Planning is a tight-knit, supportive and goal oriented group that consistently promotes cross-functional partnership and support group partnership. Managing up and managing quickly changing priorities are the hardest portions of the job while the most enjoyable is working with the Planners and helping them to build their future careers."
good,Cool workplace lots of loveI love working at Family Dollar just had to find something with a lot more money so I started driving trucks but I can’t say nothing bad about Family Dollar
good,I enjoyed my job. i loved meeting new people different cultures. My employees an i were a great team. . The customer's were awesome.It' s in an good area with many business around.
good,Great place to work in management if you don’t have a family and you’re just looking for some extra money. They have so many lawsuits against them because they over work their salaried managers. But the pay is awesome
good,I suppose people work differently together. We're all grown so get along to get your job done. If everybody does their job correctly then goals will be met.
good,Family Dollar is a very slow-paced setting. There is a lot of stocking and front facing the products. You have to make sure that the store is always looking nice and the aisles are clean.
good,I would tell anyone who doesn't mind the hard work or the heat or cold to apply there. It is a good place to work as long as you don't mind working in the elements.
good,"Working at family dollar was like a rollercoaster, Manager was so unorganized, she wouldn't do anything, she'll just ride the clock, and get paid for taking her time. I felt like I was a manager, everyone asked me was I the manager, that's how good I treated my customers. My customer service skills are beyond EXCELLENT, I've learned that people would take credit for your work in the workplace, and your ideas. The hardest part of the job was having to clean up someone elses work closing the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, all of the love, and positivity/feedback."
good,The management team above me is not the best or the worst but I can handle it however search for another job just in case. I am a assistant manager. I take care of customer needs and complaints. I stock and make sure store is recovered. I open or close the store depending on the shift.
good,"You start your day off clocking in and getting straight to work, there is always something that needs to be done.  Good luck getting a break. IF you are a manager, you shoulder a lot of responsibilty"
good,"The company needs change a few things, especially when it comes to the raises. Its possible that you can get skipped out on your raise if you relocate to another store so you get passed up and that is not fair."
good,I would go back only if they increased pay.Employees had to be security guards because of no loss prevention rules in place.Employee lounge was unacceptable.
good,I prefer not to say but it is a very physically demanding job and too many hours not enough home life. There's no balance. There's not enough hours given to the stores to successfully have enough help at the store when needed.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of numerous conference calls, working with district and store management regarding employee relations issues, performance issues, training and development, investigating issues, assisting with recruiting store and district management.  The company is very loss prevention focused, rather than people focused.  I learned from my peers and some leadership new and different ways of dealing with issues and resolving them.  Very low work/life balance as travel is Monday-Friday, every week for two regions consisting of 400+ stores in 15 states.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people develop and grow in their roles."
good,"good job to gain experience in customer service. whether you are a night owl or a lark, you should be able to get working hours to suit you. So its the perfect job to gain valuable experience."
good,The job is very easily goes by fast as a cashier. The managers are not trained properly learn as they go and it can cause issues with the customers occasionally.
good,The pay was good it was just to much work and not enough employees. The dont give you enough hours for your store to run correctly and for that reason alone is why they cant keep employees.
good,It seems that it hard to find people who want to work and are trust worthy. The generation of people are different. Great upper management but some other store managers are not team players..
good,"Position was fast pace and a lot of walking. Dealt with a lot of truck loads at guard station, making sure loads were correctly sealed and making sure paperwork was sent to correct department. Securing the warehouse after working hours. Family Dollar Distribution Center was a good place to work."
good,"Mainly ran register, assisted customers when needed,  able to do voids and returns, stock shelves, unloaded  the truck. helped in opening and closing the store."
good,I look forward to going to work on most days. I am overworked and underpaid. I have not received a raise in a year and looks like i am not getting one.
good,Family Dollar has ahigh turnover rate and the company could care les about the safety of their employees especially at night. the store are a steady target for robbers and the managers are salaried who get paid for working 48 hours each week but actually work at least 65 to 70 hrs.
good,Woring at Family Dollar afforded me the opportunity to build my supervisory skills in effecting the Company's Policy and Procedures that ensures employees be respective to both internal and external customers. Example: not using their mobile phone while attending to external customers and rather using their devices appropriately during their designated breaks.
good,"The job was great some aspects were not the best , the manager was wonderful though. At my time of employment some of the employees were dishonest and lazy and tried to avoid duties by any means possible, they are no longer employed there."
good,-Typical day would consist of coming to the store early for paperwork and opening store procedures as well as counting money and making sure the store was in good shape for closing.
good,Family Dollar is a boring and repetitive job. Most days you will come in and do the same tasks and even deal with many of the same customers. It is an okay starter job
good,I really enjoyed myself at Family Dollar.  I had a great Manager and Assistant Managers. I really enjoyed working with the customers.  The only downfall was employees always texting on there cells instead of working  and you have to pick up there slack.
good,You become well acquainted with customers who come in on daily basis and over time created a bond or friendship. Most can brighten up my day and give me great advice for anything. I learned that I can never really be prepared for some individuals' personalities and how they take bad news. The hardest part of the job is when a co-worker leaves after being there for so long and then having to get adjusted to the new comer.
good,"Productive and busy work place.. I’ve learned a lot about working with the public as well as cash management, decision making, how to achieve goals you have set within the store! It has been a wonderful experience!"
good,It is a very stressful place to work for anybody. I didn't that company cared about their employee because of danger they put there employees by them working by themselves a lot.
good,A typical day at work was being behind the desk as a cashier helping and checking people out. Stocking iteams back on the shelf and organizing everything in place.The management there was good in its ways. The hardest part about the job was that it was hard to get answers from the management but the part i enjoy the most was getting to know new people and making friends with my co-workers.
good,I worked long hours.  Sometimes 70 - 90 hours per week.  Amount of payroll given to run a store is not sufficient.  Therefore Managers work more to complete job tasks.  Its definitely a challenge to be a store Manager.  Difficult to hire quality staff due to low wage pay.  Many stores operate only with 1 person in the store in the morning till afternoon.  It depends on the location of your store.
good,"At the start of day you will take the deposit to the bank, and then return to the store for opening procedures. Next you will check for daily projects to do, i.e. setting ads, and after that you usually will stock or recover the rest of the day. The hardest part of the job is finding the right balance of stocking and recovering to ensure all of it gets done. The hardest and most enjoyable day of the week can be truck day. If the stockroom is not ready for a truck it will be difficult, however if the backroom is ready then you will have a much more enjoyable day."
good,"threw the time i worked for the company 7 of the stores had been robbed at gun point, knife point, and full on assaults the company has no interest in making store safer."
good,"It started off great, paid every week, good raises every inventory, and laid back management who kept an excellent staff. Up until dollar tree took over I loved family dollar... but not so much anymore. They've lost alot of good managers due to dollar trees new policies and regulations... I'm fixing to be another one... the main thing I hate about working there though is the unrealistic expectations they put on their employees now. They've ALWAYS got us running contests, and if you don't score a certain quota a day you get nastygrams from corporate. They only give SMs enough payroll to have 1 manager in the store 5 days out of the week, so we're there by ourselves for countless hours running register, stocking freight, handling schematics, vendors, along with 50 other things usually. Like I said unrealistic expectations. If it weren't for me having an absolutely amazing manager, I would have left quite a while ago..."
good,"Family Dollar, in my time there, has been a great source of both income, and, learning. I've learned patience working with so many different people and also learned how to properly help others. I would recommend working for this company."
good,"The Job was easy, some dys were hectic some days were slow. New management came in and tried to turn everything around when employers were already customed to how we worked."
good,"Very little help when in need. I did not ask for help very often, but when i did i was they went unanswered or ignored. Started to feel like i was a number and not part of a team. I have worked with some great people there, i will miss a lot of my fellow management friends."
good,"Family dollar was a busy place to work with plenty of task in one day. Between waiting on customers, paperwork, stocking  shelves, and maintaining the store there was plenty to do."
good,I love the crew I get to work with. Upper management can be tough but they do their best to work with every ones needs. They do have good benefits for full time.
good,"Unloading delivered stock"
good,"The job was very easy to learn. The job is better when everyone works as a team. Overall It was a great place to work, but the change of management is why I ended up leaving."
good,Must be very flexible  friendly and able to deal with any problems that come up quickly and efficiently .you are required to work a minimum of 52 hours a week
good,"A lot of hard work.  However, time went by quickly because you were kept busy at all times.  They were excellent at obtaining that of good customer service."
good,"I didn't care for the way that things were run with the amount of employees in one day because that made it hard to take a break, but we did manage. I was able to close with my favorite assistant manager and we had a groove because it was only the 2 of us closing."
good,family dollar has bein the only job I have ever had the 9 years that I worked there I worked there because of my manager cari she is a great boss but honestly its a very stressful job
good,"I have worked for this company two times now and have generally liked the community store retail environment. Just over a year ago, Dollar Tree took over ownership of the company and things seem to have taken a turn for worse when it comes to how it is ran."
good,"Good work place, good prices. Flexible hours, hard work. You have to have good customer service experience to work here. I enjoyed the job. I would like to work here again."
good,Nice place to work and shop. Not not very organized or we'll put together it has a certain fun every now and then but it's mostly hard work restocking recovering Cashing Out customers.
good,The managers and assistant managers are very hard working. They do not get paid overtime for what they do and what they have to deal with. I wwoulsnt recomend working there but the service you get when you are there is great.
good,I work for Family Dollar for seven years and I  Advance  in the company very quickly it can be very challenging but if you have a good decision making and delegating skills and thick skin it will be all right
good,"I enjoy working at Family Dollar because it give u the experience of being flexible in a Work place. I have learned to Merchandise, Stock, Pack and Receive all while accommodating customers. I have learned to tag clothes properly, find skus and change prices ."
good,Fast paced work environment.  Always work to be done.  Most customers I knew on first name basis and they helped with my job.  Most employees were great to work with however there were a couple that didn't pull their own so u were basically forced to do their job as well
good,Typical day consisted of waiting on customers and providing customers with answer and assist with getting items. The overall working environment was positive and I enjoyed working with them.
good,"I started and was getting 15-25 hours. I would pick up others shifts when they called in& always came on time. Was told I would be getting more hours and I never did, actually took hours instead."
good,"It was a wonderful experience to work at Family Dollar. I've met a lot of people that were nice. I had the awesome manager ever, wish she never had to leave."
good,It has good room to move up in the company but the pay was not competitive. The management team could be up front and honest about some topics but not on everything it needed to be.
good,It was a great workplace. The manager always motivated me and other workers. I learned how to provide high quality customer service.The culture is excellent.
good,"A typical day at family dollar requires a lot of hard work and patients. You are required to check out customers, put out stock, and maintain a balance between your task and your customers."
good,Family Dollar is a very steady work place never any dull moments. It is a very positive work place. They are very flexable with your schudel put side of work.
good,It wasn't a bad job. They do expect a lot out of the managers with little hours to give employees to help. Pay was ok just need more help in the stores. They expect the managers to do it all
good,it was a very fun work place just not organized and people always come in and steal things. it also extremely too long to close due to us being under staffed everyday.
good,i miss family dollar but am happy to be done there very stress ful sometimes not getting break as a manager after working 12hours the way i want . no security feared for my life
good,"I learn how to clean,stock,unload trucks,and help customers with ever they need. depending on your job as a cashier for example it can be stressful because you gotta be fast,you gotta make sure your counting the money right and you gotta deal with rude customers. Now for stocking its not that stressful most of the time but sometimes it can be stressful when you people knocking things out of the shelves and making a mass and as working in the back (stocking) you have to unload trucks and it can repetitive and overwhelming."
good,"I loved working here. Flexible hours, and chances at advancement, but it does take time sometimes to move up the advancement latter. Depending where your located the store can be either extremely slow or incredibly busy with no time to recover.  So it would just depend on which area the store is located and how well your team works together for how well one would enjoy this job and position."
good,Family dollar is a non stressful place to work. the employee's where nice  so was the manager and helpful when you  were new to working there. Sometimes it can be stressful when you spend a little to much time working on one portion of the store but for the most part its nice
good,it was a great place to work while in college. my managers were great roll models on work eithic. the only down side was dealing with the public do to it being a low income store.
good,The was a cooperation among all the workers in the particular store I was working. The manager and his supervisor treated everyone with due respect as well as very good customer service.
good,I enjoy working for family dollar  very productive workplace although i wish every location had in store armed security guards. The store manager is awesome always helpful and great attitude.
good,My typical procedure for opining the store consisted of putting the tills with appropriate change in he registers and get the change to be used throughout the day ready. I would then print the paperwork and run register while stocking until my back up arrived and  i would then stock and handle any customer  problems. I learned how to run small scale store and manage a small team while also keeping the customers coming back for great service. The hardest part was working an open to close shift only because it is half of the day was spent by yourself and it can be difficult to keep working when handling the register.
good,I really enjoyed my job there just moved out of state I was very fast past and a lot of hard work  must be able to lift heavy objects. great job for a hard worker.  no standing time
good,The workplace culture and organization leave much to be desired. Day to day tasks and performance goals are short sighted and do not provide much perspective for long term value or purpose.
good,"Count your draw then immediately take customers or if you was on the floor you'd count your draw then recover the floor until the main register needed help"
good,"I would start my day by counting registers down have meeting with my employees  before door opens put every one where i want every one for day,face my store, start my day"
good,"A typical day at work will involve the in-completion of the set goals for that day. For instance, the recovery of merchandise and the cleaning duties of the store tend to be incomplete since only the assistant manager and a customer representative will only work at a given time. Most importantly, the major drawback of this job is the lack of security. Since the store does not posses any cameras, thefts occur very often at that place. Furthermore, the lack of evidence to justify the theft generally prevents the occurrence of thefts at that store. These drawbacks essentially make the job very difficult to manage and monitor. However, the job will provide a lot of experience in customer service."
good,"A typical day at work consist of making a bank run so I can open the store, then I  proceed to attend to the costumers and stock shelves. I have learned to be appreciative of costumers and their desires while making their shopping experience enjoyable. My management skills consist of keeping the District Managers and costumers happy and coming back. The hardest part of my job is not having great team work. A job should be like a family that always helps out one another. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to the costumers and catching up like old friends. Seeing them walk out the store smiling, is defiantly the best part in my job."
good,"A typical day consist of unloading trucks, stocking shelves, hiring associates, training new management and store associates. Also placing orders, doing payroll, scheduling and helping clean up problem stores. Also waiting on our customers."
good,"However, the work atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable, manager was very good, and I enjoyed my job for the most part. Some days, I only worked four or five hours and, on truck days, worked eight to twelve hours. I only averaged 25-30 hours a week, except in November and December, when we worked 35-50 hours a week."
good,You can sit there if your work is done and no customers and be on your phone but overall i liked it because it was expirence. They are alittle to gettoh in there.
good,Family Dollar could be a good job if they use more payroll managers are alone in the store multiple hours every day computer systems are very slow and out dated in
good,Family dollar is a great start off job. The only thing I disliked about it was the hours. There werent enough.  Other than that the manager and staff were great.
good,My first job was a great experience . The was very fair clean I actually learn a lot from the people i work with .I was a cashier in that help me count a lot better in faster.
good,All depends on your direct supervisor. Some care about their teams other do not. if looking for employment here spend some time getting to know your direct supervisor
good,A great company.  Learned alot from my manager and the company.  District manager was always visible.  A nice place to work for.  Managers and staff was easy to talk to and learn from.
good,"Working at Family Dollar was literally just to make ends meet. "
good,Family  dollar  to me is the bootcamp of retail if you can make it here you can make it  anywhere.  Day to day operations  is all hands-on whether management or cashier from the truck to planograms very fast pace and no room for errors but if you make it you definitely worked hard and earned it
good,worked here for about 7 months good quick job but not enough money to live off. good job for students however the security is very low and people steals from here everyday
good,Work based company with plenty of benefits. Great atmosphere when working with others. Customers are satisfied with customer service. Stores  make great sales.
good,Its a great place to work.  It just needs to dependable people to work and stay longer.  They're are many turnovers and I fell they should find a solution for that.
good,I enjoyed working for this company they did their best to make sure all of the employees had a work schedule that fits into their daily life and would give you notice if they needed you to work over or come in on your off day
good,not a great place to work managers are left alone in store for 8 hours a day and they dont provide breaks casheirs only get 10 hours a week they are open on thanksgiving 12 hours and some stores are even open on christmas they do not value the american family traditions
good,I would open the store and greet customers. I would count the petty cash and provide it to the manager to take to the bank. My management team was excellent. I worked in a high crime low poverty environment. I didn't like catching shop lifters. The customers where like family.
good,The workers are great to work with. However can be very stressful at times. You have to be able to multi task and take direct orders from superiors. You MUST be a people person.
good,You get to meet new and different people every day and help them find what they need.  It is great to see the frequent customers come back.  I learned great customer service and fast and efficient service.  The workplace culture is fun and laid back but also they want the truck unloaded in a certain amount of time and the same to get the shelves stocked.  The hardest part of the job is keeping good help due to the low wages and limited of hours to work for a part0time employee.  They do not allow any over-time accept for the manager.
good,"Usually stay at the register most of the day cleaning up after customers that come in the store and and counting cigarettes and the registers as the day goes by. I learned how to clean the store and make everything look presentable, unload new items from the company truck, help people find what they're looking for and keep track of everything in the store. the hardest part of the job was finding the spots for items; the most enjoyable part was I didn't need to dress a specific way at work."
good,"Family Dollar was a good first job to have. The manager is a great woman and she is an excellent worker. The co-workers were fine to get along with. Usually the morning shifts would be slow, the busiest time was during the afternoon of course. Night would be slow also. I became quicker with math and was able to quicken my pace at work with long lines. I was able to balance the stressful times. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers, but that is nothing new. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting along with some co-workers and knowing some of the regular customers and create a great environment with them. Its also great to be bilingual and use my abilities to help others and to be a translator at times."
good,"Opening and closing are a breeze."
good,"Was a decent place to work , the biggest complaint I had was the with the conditions within the building, hot in the summer and cold in the winter inside the building, only offices areas had AC."
good,"IT has hundreds of departments, so wide in diversity. Good place to work depending on management."
good,"I like the different products family dollar has to offer customers. The work process is great for what is needed done, as far as unload truck and stocking store."
good,I do enjoy working for Family Dollar. The pay is just to low for the amount of work you have to do. All holidays are worked at regular rate with the exception of christmas and weekends are always worked.
good,I liked to work there because my manager was a very good person and she hired people no matter their background.  She was always nice to  me and I learnt so many things from my co-workers.
good,"Retail is a fast paced business, The company keeps cutting back on Employee hours to increase profits and there by losing out on customer service and Security ( shop lifting )"
good,I loved being an assistant manager enjoyed the atmosphere and learned a new trade as an  store manager and i just didn't see eye to eye on some matters
good,"customer service, cashier , stocking , cash management fast pace work environment have to multi task  takes at least a year for advancement 30 min break salary depends on where hired my start was 8.25 per hour"
good,"it was a good workplace I received a promotion fairly quick, it is a fast work environment I would refer someone to workthere if they don't mind working in fast environment"
good,Great place to work! i enjoyed me team and my store. Great with scheduling and working with personal life and the pay is good. Management is ok on some days but they care about your life.
good,Was trained on putting stocking items on the shelf. Was trained as an cashier. Also was trained as an assistant manager learn how to work well with others
good,This was an okay job. Everyone was nice . The kids were so full of love an life. Parents could be on time more. Needs more activities done outside of the daycare if it was still open.
good,Management needs to be replaced with someone who is able to manage employees. Job has a middle school like environment and is a very hostile place to work at.
good,"The manager did not allow breaks, for the amount of customers heavily outweighed the number of employees. The pay was nice, most of the customers where sensible, and the manager allowed us a flexible schedule."
good,"Not allowed overtime"
good,"poor management, I have a hard time with my schedule being done on time for the following week, aswell as my hours for the week that the schedule has been done they will randomly change your hours from one day to the next on a short notice"
good,I had an overall great experience. I got to experience new attitudes and my co workers was very understanding an polite. I had a chance to work different things.
good,I'm not really sure what to say about this company. It was really easy to learn. Not hard at all. I enjoyed helping the customers with their purchases and answering any questions they may have.
good,"As store manager all responsiblilies fall on the manager. I never had enough payroll to schedule my assistant managers 40 hours. I learned how to manage the workers and time I had with them. Holiday time was always the hardest because cooperate wants high sales so the truck loads along with store space becomes a huge headache. Like any job it has its ups and downs,"
good,"Family Dollar is a pretty good job to advance at. When you become a store manager it affects your life, because you have no home time.The hardest part of the job was customer theft and the fear of being robbed."
good,"as a assistant manager, customer satifaction is always a plus , keeping employees busy and customers first and then keeping them busy stocking merchandise on down time."
good,Depending on the store and the location this could be a great place of work. But at the same time it could be horrible too. your life could become family dollar and nothing but family dollar especially if your management
good,As an assistant manager at Family Dollar there is always something to do whether your were dealing with a customer directly or keeping shelves stocked nice and neat and full and store clean and organized while also directing other staff down the right path by helping them keep on task and cmpleteing them as well as training them always to be the best customer service reps they could be.
good,"A typical work day would entail prepping store ads and checking inventory to make sure store is ready to be opened. Being attentive and catering to the needs, questions and concerns of customers. Checking to make sure store was safe and family friendly. My co-workers were diligent hard workers who reduced workload. I learned that some of the worst experiences with customer services were the most valuable and most often enjoyable learning experiences."
good,"Overall, Family Dollar was a good place to work. The benefits were good. Though, it was a good & productive place to work, it can also be frustrating when the management team seems clueless & ""improvisation"" is being put on company policies. One example is when a manager threatens to write an employee up for doing something that is in the policy book. Another is when management tries to skip seniority to play favorites. However, I wouldn't recommend anyone not to work there."
good,"Family Dollar has its pros and cons as a company, I enjoy interacting with customers on a day to day basis. There was always something new to learn which never bothered me because I consider myself an open minded person. Staffing was always an issue due to small payroll but the best was made with what was provided. A typical day at work is doing safe counts, signing off on tills, giving approvals for transactions, doing store orders, stocking shelves and mainly assisting customers. I enjoy being around my co-workers because we work as a team to get tasks complete and I strongly believe  union is strength!!!"
good,"When working at Family Dollar you will learn different skills there like, how to greet people coming into the store, helping people with question, and seeing how much it takes to be a manger in running a store."
good,"Family Dollar IT Area is a place where many people planned to work and retire.  It was challenging at times and  interesting but the people I worked with made even the hard times doable.  There was a sense of comaraderie.  If you worked for a team, you knew that the team would go above and beyond for each other to make sure the particular taks/project was a success.  I had the pleasure of having (most) managers that respected you and your position. They were always ready to jum in the trnches and help if needed, yet gave you your space to work and no micromanage.  My managers firmly believed in work-life balance and did their best (within comapany standards) to honor that with their employees."
good,I learned about how to be in charge of a group of team members.  I was in a position to learn more about being a Store Manager. My last job I was in charge of one person.
good,family dollar warehouse is a hard job you have to be on watch every day all day because of machines employees are operating.
good,"Fast advancement if you want it. If you are not a total screw up and they like your attitude, you can move up fairly quickly."
good,Overall this job was ok. It was real easy going. It just wasn't enough hours. What I can say that family dollar taught me how to lead a team!!
good,"Family Dollar is a good company to work for that offers a good opportunity for advancement.  It is a fast paced environment that requires it employees to work hard and encourages them to also have fun. It does run on very low labor budgets which also requires the employees to be alert and self motivated.  There is usually only two people in the stores at one time, and during the first part of the day it is not unusual for the manager to be there for several hours alone.  If you are a person who feels secure and can work independently then Family dollar is for you."
good,"It offered less than 25 hours per week and management was laid back, but a bit unprofessional. Sometimes the environment was fun and occassionally there were good employee discounts."
good,Work a lot but enjoy the employees. been working there for a while. Solid company many benefits for working with this company. I would recommend anyone to join this great company if you are looking to grow with a retail company that is fast pace.
good,"keep stores open for business."
good,Most days are easy going working at family dollar. The most enjoyable things are the different customers you encounter and the relationship you develop with coworkers. the hardest part would either be the physical labor of truck day or the craziness when we get really busy if you're on the register that day.
good,Always dot your I's and cross your T's. Loved working with the public  but the upper management has no idea really what goes in each store.
good,I would open the store some mornings. I make sure the store is clean. I would help the customers find what they needed. I Closed the store most night.
good,"Management is great and easy to get along with"
good,"I loved seeing people everyday and helping them while they told me stories. I didn't mind cleaning or stocking shelf's at a fast pace because everyone wants to work in a clean environment. I was nice to everyone and did what  I could to help, the manager wasn't fare with everyone, she had a lot of favoritism and inappropriate work behaviors."
good,"It's a great first job experience gives you different skills that you will need for other jobs.However, days can really drag on if there is not a lot of customers."
good,Family dollar was a great learning experience. Being an assistant manager comes with a lot of responsibility. It teaches you to multi-task fast! You have to have great customer service working in retail. You learn so many different things about a company when you start to climb that ladder of success in a company. I enjoyed working for 4 different store managers. It gave me that ability to be flexible with other peoples performance of work and their attitude.
good,"A typical week for me at Family dollar would start on a Monday mourning. I arrive at work around 8:00 AM to help unload shipment from the truck unto or shipment carriers (u-boats). My manager and I usually get done prepping u-boats by 9:15. After that i either get on cash registers, or Stock shelves while customer servicing until i clock out. I have learned how to set up different displays, Work on different register programs, and also customer service in a different type of retail. My management plays their part in teaching me fundamental manager rules and thought process to help me take my hard work to the next level. The hardest part of the job would have to be making decisions on where the displays should go to make the most appeal to customers. The most enjoyable part is helping people by helping my financials."
good,"its a typical retail store, the money isn't great and its not horrible for a young adult. if you want to make more than 12 an hour I suggest either applying elsewhere or applying for store mangager or higher"
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and helping and employees the hardest part of this job was picking up others people SLACK and getting them to be fair
good,I put in loads of work and made pennies on the dollar. I tried to move up to assistant manager and I was pretty much ignored. I was always nice and helpful but it got me nowhere pretty much.
good,In a small town we were the only store so that caused for great business. Co-workers were ok to deal and work with and schedule flexibility wasn't an issue either.
good,"I loved working here, great people, great management,I learned how to deal with customers in a variety of situations. Family Dollar was one of my first jobs and it definitely will always have a soft spot in my heart.I think what makes my experience working here so great is that I had an Awesome Manager and Asst. Managers and a great team to work with."
good,"The working environment is nice and most of the customers are kind. The real issue is the pay.For the amount of work that is done, the pay doesn't match up."
good,I have had a nice experience at Family Dollar. Been there for many years and have learned alot along the way. Just ready for better growth opportunities.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me opening the store and counting all funds to make sure it meets the proper requirements of cash we need. When the store is open I will check out the items  customers have brought to buy. Then as a cashier comes in I will begin to stock merchandise we get weekly from our distribution truck. My co-workers are fun to work with we all know our responsibilities and know what has to get done before shift changes. The hardest part of the job is trying to make room for our seasonal merchandise we get in. I have to try and move old merchandise and set seasonal items in its place. It may be difficult, but I always get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers leave satisfied from the store with products they have bought or with their overall experience in our store."
good,A typical day at work was running the cash register and stocking. I learned a lot from management I learned  to close out register and make night drops at bank alone with training for manager position. The hardest thing was learning to do people schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything. I enjoyed greeting and helping the customers.
good,"Good place, higher up needs work but this particular store is great, friendly environment, clean, organized, you get help when needed but mostly you work at your own pace."
good,"The work environment moves at a steady pace, with the average employee cashing out customers, or working on one project or another.  With a weekly truck, it provides a bit of a differentiated work system, so as not to encourage people falling into a habit of doing things.  If you show interest in moving up in the company, and prove that you can do the work, opportunities are available.  The associates are good mannered and fun to be around.  As for the hardest part of the job, I would say it would be having to get a project finished on an extremely busy day, as deadlines don't wait.  My personal favorite part of the job was truck and freight.  You learn where most things in the store are, and it allows you to help customers more efficiently."
good,"I have liked working at family dollar , I guess cause I have been their for many years and notice their was no change for the company as I getting employees involved in special events."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Family Dollar working in the Mail Center. During my time there I have been introduced to, and trained in, several new areas such as mail sorting, mail routing, computer programs that facilitate mail processing and distribution, and driving a forklift. I am a fast paced worker that pays close attention to detail. However, this job is very physically demanding, requires working in extreme temperatures and currently offers little opportunity for advancement."
good,it was an OK job. they payed weekly which was a good thing. the hours were bad because we were short staffed and they wouldn't hire more people. sometimes we would have to work 15 hours ( whole day ) with a 30 minute break
good,I come into work at 7:45 am to do the paper work from the day before. Count the safe to make sure that the correct amount of money is in the safe and make a change order before making a run to the bank for the day. I open up at 9am and wait on customers until the cashier comes in. Once my other employee gets there and they are logged on I leave and run stock. In between running stock I help the cashiers out if they get busy or if they need an override on money cards or anything that needs to be voided off their register. On Monday mornings I arrive at work by 5:30 am and help unload the truck. I work anywhere from a 8 hour day to a 16 hour day.
good,"It was a great learning experience. I learned alot of new things about myself and working in retail. A typical day of work included, dealing with customers, stocking shelves, unloading trucks, and running the cash register. My managers didn't really reward us for any successes. the hardest part of the job was unloading the truck when we had a big shipment. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and them appreciating your service."
good,"For the most part, its a great company with great pay, but stay away from the small stores, they have their own cliques and don't like outsiders"
good,"A typical day at work is of course very busy and full of customers; however there are slow days where (on a level) you get to rest a bit while working. Time at family dollar taught me better customer service, patience, and money management. My co workers were all different in taste and style but all had the same general mind set as a team; which made working more comfortable, motivating, and feasible. The hardest part of the job were the strict and ever changing rules/guidelines. There were (at times) ridiculous guidelines the team felt they had to follow but in the end they all made sense and worked for not only our good but the good of the company. We also had to understand that the store we'd chosen as employment was a ""special"" store with very particular requirements that were necessary for the operation of the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a job, along with the support and help received from managers, co-workers, and higher ups. We were all out to help each other-something that can't always be said on every job. It was almost family."
good,Family Dollar is an overall good company and a great start for a first time retail job it give you the opportunity to be independent and work on your own without constant supervision
good,The good thing about the job is the salary was decent and I made friends that I hope will last forever...We usually had Pizza night on Fridays
good,"> A typical day at work consist of  stocking  an moving a lot of boxes. "
good,they taught me the real meaning of customer service and help me gain great people skills they have good prices and also good hours as an employer but since i been there the customer quality is ok!
good,"a typical day at work consists of asking various questions that customers come in and ask while operating a cash register to check them out. "
good,"I do not have any real complaints about this job, everyone has been easy to get along with and willing to work with you in hard times"
good,"to many hours working alone,"
good,Running the register while stocking the selves and cleaning the store constantly throughout the work shift. I learned valuable customer service skills and cleaning skills. Management is also pretty good. Co workers are friendly. Hardest part of the job is managing the customers while trying to do other things. Most enjoyable part is also the co worker bonds.
good,I have already submitted a review on this company.  Good company to work for.  Very family oriented place to work at.  Great skills to be learned here.  Take advantage of all the opportunities it offers.
good,It seemed as if i was the only employee with a heart that worked ther they were rude to customers. i as told i was the nicest young lady who worked there i felt bad but happy that i was able to change the outlook on most of the customers.
good,"A great place to work with a lot of great people but the management could be a lot better. Typical day at work inculdes driving a stand up fork lift and order picking,case picking or full pallets."
good,I enjoy working with people and the different areas or communities teach you how to deal with several different cultures.
good,I Liked The people I worked with at Family Dollar. The Company is great and it was not overly difficult to move up in the company. I became an assistant manager in a little less than a year. Although it was fun and sometimes easy to lose focus by enjoying customer conversation there was still a lot of work that had to be done but done easily. MY overall experience was good. I got a lot of work and life experience working there.  You will meet a lot of different personalities not only because of the people you work with but the customers that come in the store.
good,"Pretty basic retail store work. Learned how to manage the store and about 6 people. I unloaded trucks, stocked shelves, balanced all receipts at the end of the shift, handled and problems with employees or customers, etc."
good,"I had a couple coworkers who I absolutely loved to work with, but for a while it was just me and one other person working which was ludicrous. I enjoyed staying busy, but I loathed being paid so poorly for a job that multiple would need to accomplish but it was only myself who was capable of completing it."
good,"Not enough pay, bad hours, need more help, great for someone in school, not good to make a living off ofNot enough pay, bad hours, need more help"
good,As a store manager for this company I worked 70 hr work weeks to handle the work load.  Very little support from superiors and constantly changing of high management made this job very demanding.
good,"get the store ready to open and see that everything is in its place."
good,"Come in and count the safe and find out what all has be done that day and what all is left to do for the daily tasks"
good,i enjoyed my time there and my opinion was listened to. The shift was not bad as a assistant manager.
good,Loved working there for the convenience but the company wasn't my favorite.
good,Long hours no help. In the store alone robbed. theft all the time. no holidays off you have to work xmas this is only a job if you do not have a life family dollar needs to be investigated by the bbb. no help unloading stock DM always complaing this job really sucked
good,Typical day at work is taking care of Customer needs and making them happy they shop at Family Dollar
good,"A typical day at work consisted of communicating with customers and giving directions to other employees. My job duties varied from day to day and was will with many challenging and enjoyable duties. I learned how to cope with difficult situations when the I was held at gun point when being robbed one night. I increased my experience in money management, being a leader, organization skills, time management skills and ability to adjust well to change. My hardest part of the job was to have to learn quickly to adjust quickly to hostile situations. The most enjoyable part about my job was working with a diverse group of people and learning new things."
good,Nice Company to work for. The customers make the difference.
good,"A typical day at work is to clock in, loan on a register, open store, assign the cashier that's working with you on the register, pull out and stock mechandise, make sure merchandise was recovered around the whole store, help ring on register when needed, go to the bank and drop off deposits from previous night and get change if needed, keep store cleaned, recover all coolers, make sure all go backs are put away, close store, count down registers, count petty cash and make sure it's exact and make sure both registers are put away with only $100 in them."
good,"New experience for me. I worked as a cashier, stock clerk, did "
good,"you work hard but you earn your pay"
good,I enjoyed working at the Family Dollar I was young and going to school so it worked for me at that time.
good,Hard work hot have to work at a very fast pace the hard part was working in the heat trying to get use to the heat
good,"I left there cause when I was hired the terms of my employeement was 6 days a week,52 hours.It started off that way in my 4 week trainning but as soon as my trainning was over and I got my own store I was working 68 to 85 hours weekly,During this time we were getting remodled,my Asst.manger quit so I was working 17 and a half days for 6 consecutive days in a row,I repeated to my DM I needed help and yet I didnt get it.I wrote an employee up for store conditions and she contested it so myself,her,and my DM had a meeting about it.The DM agree that the store conditions were poor but yet he took the write up and threw it away,after she treated my like I was her asst. and she was my supervisior when it was the other way around.I was put in that store as an store manger after that issue I decided to leave due to my DM underminding me in front of the asst. manger at the time.If I was in the wrong I would have fixed the problem but when my DM felt the same way about the store conditions I felt I was right by my actions but for some reason in the meeting things was different,as my DM he should of had backed me up on the write up instead of throwing it away like nothing."
good,"hardest part unloading trucks, setting up store from the beginning"
good,"it is a type of job that will test your patience with the customers. The people you work with end up being people who not only are your team members, but individuals whom you develop  bond with."
good,The most enjoyable part of this jobs was the customers and the employee working together getting customer products together and getting them upon waiting time.
good,"I truly enjoyed working with the many different kinds of people who came into the store. Even the mean ones. However, when you go through 6 Managers in a matter of one year, you know there is a problem with the company and its hiring process. I learned how to manage time more efficiently and deal with difficult customers and keeping my cool at the same time."
good,i would only work weekends and go to school during the week. i mainly worked the cash register and picked up around the store an hour before closing.
good,"Enjoyable company to work for. Co-workers are a pleasure to have around. Customers are nice, however everyone has there days."
good,A typical day at work consisted of unloading and stocking and giving customer satisfaction. I learned that all it takes is motivation and you will move up quickly in an industry. Management was decent but she was never around. My co-workers were hard working. The hardest part of the job is the long hours. The most enjoyable part was the pay check.
good,"Co-workers were great, hardest part of job keeping people from stealing. I learned you have to work together to get the job done."
good,The job was very challenging at first. Then started to get a routine going and it went smoothly. Learning the ins and outs of Family Dollars was rewarding. Co-workers where good people to work with. The hardest part had to be taking over the store as Manager when my boss had surgery. Filling her shoes was hard. I managed and it was only for a short time. Working with my co-workers and meeting new people every day was very enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at work involves filing paperwork, assisting customers, checking in vendors, stocking shelves, recovering the store, cleaning."
good,"My store's management was decent. They didn't really take their jobs seriously, but they would always help out. It was a small store so it was usually 1 employee and 1 manager working at a time. I usually ran everything in the front end, cashing out customers, stocking shelves, etc. while the managers were doing paperwork or other duties around the store. It was pretty fun to work there, but it's entry level retail with little to no advancement."
good,"Working with this company,customer recognized great customer service and likely to return for great shopping experience"
good,If someone likes to work in a warehouse it's not a bad place to work.  But I prefer the office environment.
good,"learned how to balance cash drawers, and handle debit and credit card transactions."
good,"Depending on the stores volume, can vary on how hard and how much you're paid. Very hard work if a high volume store, very easy work if a low volume store."
good,"Family dollar was a fun job, I got to interact with the public on a day to day schedule. I learned most of my customer service there, stocking experiences and inventory. Management was okay, my co-workers were fine I work well with a team. The hardest part about this job was some of the unfriendly customers and trying to make them happy customers. I love a complex job, staying busy at work is always good."
good,"putting up stock"
good,busy days kept u on your feet have to be a worker and strong minded
good,"This is a good solid place to work. Compensation and benefits are excellent, you are paid frequently (once a week), and the shifts are generally that of a part time employee. There is however collective fear about corporate agents whenever they are around or planning to visit."
good,"Training Associates, Ability to operate a 2.5 million dollar store and deliver great Customer satisfaction."
good,"Typical day at work is having a pattern and a priority list. This particular District manager would change your priorities almost on a daily basis so you were constantly changing the days plans which didn't sit well with your employees. I learned to talk to everyone and explain that these things are out of our hands the thing for us to do is to do as asked to the best of our ability. Management that was over store managers did not help when asked because their work load was heavy. this caused problems because we need answers to day to day problems that are out of our hands due to needing to get permission from our district to handle certain issues. The hardest part of the job is the lack of help from the district manager because of his work load. Example: Need to print all sales and daily computer functions as well as testing and day to day forms needed to log what was needed on a daily. Only the district manager can order the printer needed. It took 2 months for him to order one for me and then it took him 5 minutes to brake it, inwhich he did not order another one until lost pervention came to visit. The co-workers were great. You have your normal call outs but the day to day with them was great. Very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers. They are the highlight of the day even when you get an upset customer. You get joy in helping them and fixing the problem so that they come back."
good,"Full concentration on work with ability to sit long at a time."
good,"Unload trucks, Cash Management, Interacting with customers which helps one learn to maintain patience."
good,It's not a bad place to work unless you get hurt then it's like everywhere else they make it so hard on you that you quit.
good,It was actually a great place to work. I learned how to work at a fast pace.
good,"I gained more knowledge of inventory, loss prevention, comp percentages, sales. I also learned about store closing procedures, information systems. Deposited, changed out money, money-handling and bookkeeping."
good,"I love my coworkers, no drama and very easy to get things done that are required throughout the shift. Hardest part of the job is the values of the store manager."
good,"My work day at Family Dollar,would consist of stocking shelves,unloading the truck,customer service which I enjoyed interacting with the customers and my co-workers,the hardest part of the job was trying to be creative for each and every customer"
good,"I enjoyed working for Family Dollar. I liked having somthing to do at all times, but it was easy to get behind on stocking and ringing customers out at the same time."
good,"Over all Family dollar is a decent place to work. co-workers are generally easy going. Typically, an average work day was very high paced with a large ""to do"" list. However I noticed there were a lot of integrity issues with the employees in my district. Also, upper management has a tendency to take advantage of there store managers. Store and assistant managers are not allowed to take lunch breaks off of the clock. Very low compensation for job title and responsibilities."
good,"Unprofessional"
good,Pleasant atmosphere. Fun place to work. We all worked together as a team
good,i enjoyed working with my fellow co workers here everday was a great day
good, I enjoyed helping costumer and working in the cash register. I learn how to handle money and how not to be shy. I was fun and enjoyed but at the sometime it was hard when costumer stolen from the store. My co-workers were great i enjoyed working with them. 
good,"Working with Family Dollar, I learned what it means to work in a fast pace store. I got a chance to interact with many different culture. I was very pleased to have a such an organized manager. There really were no security."
good,"This was a job I had when I was very young. Part time employment. I barely made enough to buy gas for car, even though I had no car. Couldn't afford one. This job would be for a part time student. The place closed down, thus me having to move on."
good,always something new
good,discount retailer with over 7700 stores in 45 states
good,"Open store, count cash in safe, check to make sure the store balanced from the prior shift, daily bank deposit, redoing end caps, overseeing cashiers and assistant manager's work and cash flow and spread sheets. I have learned quite a bit from this company regarding managing staff, overseeing shipment and cash flow. My co-workers are friendly and do a good job. The upper management is a great as long as all tasks are completed and are willing to help if need be."
good,Its an ok place to work for. The hardest part was the manager and her tactics and also the irate customers.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interaction. I also enjoyed working in a fast paced environment.
good,good for a first part time job...no room for advancement! ok pay ..... and limited theft
good,"On a typical day I would check my email, walk my store to check for low stock then check my schedule to see who I schedule to work truck, stock or register. I that doing things first set tone for the day."
good,Family dollar can get sort of stressing at times especially if there are many customers coming in at one given time. Co workers tend to be helpful when needed. The hardest part of the job is getting your duties finished in a timely management if there is a lot of customers your area can tend to get messy. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the customers and being helpful to them. Ive learned that patience is a virtue in the workforce.
good,Management promotes a good Team Attitude.
good,The hardest part about the job was having to work alone when employees didnt show up to work.
good,I have learned so much and its a good place to work for. You are always busy. worked well with others. the hardest part of the job is unloading the truck. the most enjoyable part is meeting people that came into the store.
good,"Daily operational tasks such as freight processing, customer service, shrinkage control, employee development, etc."
good,it was easy to learn jodb.i greet customers and take the money for the item that they buying.clean my work area.
good,"Family Dollar is a pretty good company there are plenty of advancements within this company, the biggest down fall witjh the company is the management they play alot of favortism, the hardest part about the job is keeping a team together. The most enjoyable part about the job is the people you meet."
good,"Store manager was excellent, involved, caring, and worked hard to make store function properly while still considering employee needs."
good,your customers will either brighten your day or you will brighten theirs
good,i learned alot from this job how to handle alot of problem in customer service an wit co workers
good,Family dollar is a growing franchise thats treats employess pretty fair
good,"We work hard with minimum people in the store. Family Dollar has cut payroll so bad that it has forced us to work by ourselves for many hours, and expect the work to get done while running register. I just feel that the bottom line is that they are only looking out for upper management and don't really care about the people whom actually run the stores."
good,The company itself offers great benifits and a decent working enviroment. The coworkers were nice and I found it to being a good stepping stone as a learning experience.
good,"The longer you stick around, the more you realize that you are not rewarded for your loyalty (pay, promotions,vacation time, etc.). This is a great place to work in terms of casual work environment, but don't plan to stay forever if you want to get ahead in your career."
good,"with very few employees in the building, the employees tend to become very tight knit. Managers are expected to work alone for several hours each day. Daily routines can make your job easier to do."
good,None at this time. They have one manger two assistants and two cashiers I have no other  items to answer to at this time. Speak to an employee when you go in the store
good,"This was my favorite retail experience. You usually deal with a regular customer base, and the work is fairly simple. However, there’s not enough hours, the pay is minimum wage, and your schedule is all over the place."
good,No work life balance managers get one day a week off. Hardly able to spend time with family and works all holidays. Customers are nasty and rude. Always wanting to spit on employees
good,"Fast-paced, diversity in customers and employees, everyday is a new day. Some days there is consistency and its reliable most days it hectic and you're not sure whose coming in to relieve you or if you're going to have to work a double. Schedules and routines are made but please do not depend or rely on it."
good,I love my job but I love customer service but whenever you have poor management as in the store manager with no encouragement no motivation not anything it kind of makes you want to look at other places for employment
good,No personal life outside of work. Long hours and never know what the schedule will be until the day. Before. Management can be really hard to work for. Favoritism is a big factor
good,"Not a bad company to start with, but they expect alot out of you for an unfair wage, the company wouldn't be bad if the pay was there, but unfortunately that's the way it is here."
good,Wish I had the opportunity to advance in the company but I didn’t have the proper support to do so. The job is great for someone that is looking for management experience as a stepping stool.
good,At the time I was employed there I had no set work schedule I was called to tell when to come in. I didn't get many hours. I wasn't told that I was let go they just stopped  calling me to come in
good,A typical work day opening closing cash handling inventory management merchandising unloading truck stocking cleaning customer service. I learned how to handle employees and customers needs
good,"Good experience, met a lot of people, good management/district/regional manager had good management skills, able to handle customers well. I learned a lot, how to work well with others."
good,"This was a great place to work.  Family-oriented culture, with emphasis on working together.  The goals were clear and concise.  Missteps were made later down the road, which in the end will eventually lead to its demise.  That will be a sad day for everyone who built that company to where it once was."
good,It's an ok part time job. There will be a good chance to become an assistant manager. Even if you are not good at customer service. There is a chance of he said she said drama!
good,Pulling u boats stocking shelves moping floors sweeping. And handling cash. Good workers and management good job to work at. And a very nice clean environment
good,"Management was good but Family Dollar associates were asked to move to Cheasapeake after the Dollar Tree Merger and Acquisition. Learned a lot from the co-workers, good work life balance."
good,I loved the job. They need better management! The customers could get a little crazy at times. My co workers was the best. The job is easy and fun. Easy job to work you do stand a lot but it’s not that bad.
good,"I've learned how to improve my customer skills as I'm constantly dealing with them whether they are happy or dissatisfied, I've also noticed my sense of organization has notoriously improved due to  my task which is to ensure the store is well organized and neat."
good,"My typical day at Family Dollar was attending to customers, unloading trucks and recovering  the store.  It also included managing employees."
good,It is a well enough job for someone who wants job experience within the retail industry and learn about how to interact with customers on a daily basis among other things employers will want in an employee. You may or may not get along well with the other employees and be sure you are ready to work on holidays.
good,"Everything about family dollar is good and a typical work day would consist of checking the money properly and making sure all of it is there multiple times a day. A work day is also running freight, recovering the store which means to bring all the products on the shelves to the front and picking up all the trash on the floor and making sure the store is clean and looks nice."
good,Great environment to work at but in general its a little stressful but in the end its worth the work and time when the people you meet helps you feel like your family at the distribution center.
good,I had a good experiencia excepcional for what i felt was unconfortable behavior from a manager but i  reported it to copperate and they changed my store no problem .
good,Family Dollar is a decent place to work at. If you want fast-paced management experience; family dollar is the place to go. Got me many job opportunities and made me think fast about situations.
good,I said that's reason why I left because the project manager take orders from the district manager to relay them to the store managers we didn't need a project manager we just need a district manager is to relay messages right to us I think it works out better and that's the reason why they got rid of project manager they should have did that when I was working at family Dollar
good,Gave up hope:I loved working there but inside pretty sad about the advancement program 2any manager position.I headed up Damages and so I was set back
good,Enjoyed coworkers & customers...Got to meet several different people daily...And got close to some familar customers who shopped with us daily...Enjoyed working with my coworkers we were like one big family.
good,The hours they give you is very little and the pay isnt the best but the employees are very friendly and helpful as well as the managers the work is easy and fair payfir how easy the job is
good,"Its was good as long as you had good employees working with who was willing to work as hard as everyone else. "
good,I have a great experience working with the staff and also a reasonable amount of hours. The work was easy and tolerable! Sometimes you would have a off day and they call you in to work which I never had a problem with!
good,"No comment , okay job, for young adults that graduate from college or high school . No comment,  No comment  , okay Job for a First  job or part time ."
good,"As a Store Manager I was short staffed and overworked because of the high turn over rate.  I was robbed at gunpoint twice, but never harmed because I followed policies and procedures instead of trying to be a hero.  The hardest part of the job is getting all your freight worked with a small or under producing staff.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the health, dental, vision 401k and being a salaried employee at the time."
good,Family dollar was the first job I ever had. I enjoyed working there. The people I worked with were very good people. The work was not hard and most of the time it was kind of slow paced.
good,"The company I worked at they had a lot of stocking, sales Association and alot of multitasking also a lot of customer service I felt like the job gets people prepared for what's next in their career."
good,Working at the Dollar Store taught me how to interact with customers and helping them the best way I can. The best part of the job is the people because there are some really hard workers there and it feels like a family sometimes. The hardest part of the job is having to be a work when the store is not busy and not having much to do. Overall this is a good place to work and grow. Thank you Family Dollar for the experience and memories.
good,"I learned a lot about customer service and retail, this was a good place for my first job. The assistant managers were very very helpful when I was new."
good,"Fast paced, repetitious work environment but with good encounters with customers and associates. Learned strong time management skills and discipline."
good,This was a great place to work I got along with so many customers and met so many great people this was one of the best jobs that I am I really appreciate networking and finding new ways to prove to my job daily there was always a smile put on my face by a customer and vice versa.
good,Working at family dollar was great at times even though I was working around kids that did not make sense at all and the managers was great except for one but other than that it was fine working there
good,"My time spent with the company was rather short. It was not a seemly fit for me and when it was time for me to go, I left. Most management was not easy to work with. The warehouse was in constant need of housecleaning. Although, it was a full-time job the wages were not as appeasing as they are at Walmart, and barely cover the cost of living."
good,Unfairly he is very unfair trying to fire people who do everything that is asked but keep the ones who has money issues. when you have a doctor note or you have someone that is waiting with you for cops to arrive and you get let go for that that really is very unfair
good,"This job gave me the opportunity to improve my social skills as well as improve my bilingual skills. The manager is understanding and always worked with my school schedule and the staff is friendly. Overall, I enjoyed being employed there."
good,"I enjoyed working there, until we lost our store Manager. He kept the store clean, he worked just as much as we did, he slowed down the customers from stealing. We had really good numbers when he was there."
good,it was a calm and nice place to work I really enjoyed the work place every one was very put going and down to earth some of the staff was kind of rude but over all I really liked the job
good,The company and management are great however the pay is relatively low. Opportunity foror advancement is unreliable. Was looked over for advancements several times.
good,Fast paced with always something to do! I learned a great deal about helping customers and meeting their needs. The management was very encouraging as well as the staff!
good,Na help you work by yourself all day very stressful but your paid fairly as a manager  upper management does not realize the stress store managers have there is no work life balance
good,Working for family dollar has its ups an downs. Pay is fair an the people are awesome to work with. Love the customers am working with the public. Couldn’t ask for a better environment to work in.
good,Good workplace. Not enough employees for the amount of work that has to be done daily. I learned how to work hard and be dedicated. The hardest part of the job was not having enough help to complete tasks as a manager.
good,a typical day work was very busy and  you always had something to do the team members where always fun to work with and the manager was good to work with.
good,"I wouldn't say I loved working at Family Dollar, but the people I worked with made it worth it. It was a job. The management was wonderful, for the most part. "
good,We work hard but in a safe a fun way and we work together and help one another when needed. At work we are always helping customers find a certain item or helping them with their items to their car.
good,I worked there with different types of manager lack pg communication led to alot of conflict because of envy ill say managers were unprofessional but other than that great job
good,A typical day consists of counting money to start of your shift. Assisting customers and re stalking areas near you. Managing money through the day and a lot of standing.
good,Job can be very fast pace and very tiring.pay could be better and there is little room for advancement unless you are bilingual. Good employees and coworkers is a plus.
good,"The typical workday consisted of 12-14 hours at a rapid pace and grueling physical activity. The management was decent, and most supervisors were right regarding the relationship with employees. The hardest part of the job was the consistent physical labor and inclement weather that contributed to the issue."
good,The family dollar has a very relaxed working environment. There were usually goals and responsibilities set every other day for things to be done throughout the store. Nothing was challenging or competitive as far as growth goes. you must request a day off or desired hours atleast a week ahead of release of a new schedule.
good,I would cash people and stock whatever needed stocking up front. I would recover the store and clean as needed. I would cash customers out when they were done shopping and help them find product whenever they needed it.
good,"i opened and closed the store "
good,Working with Family Dollar I became very knowledgeable when it came down to handling challenging situations. The thing I enjoyed the most about my position was when I had the opportunity to train and mentor other associates into the management role.
good,"Family Dollar is no Dollar General or Dollar Tree it is it's own entity. All work no play be sure to bring determination, and the ability to assert yourself."
good,"a lot of heavy lifting and organizing"
good,This position did not require me to be responsible for anything other then maintaining the cash register and keeping up with facing the products. Under lining issues with the corporate structure within the company is why I no longer find it worth working for the company
good,good company to work for they work you hard but it takes that to run a store just wish they had a few diffrent pollicies on things   ......................
good,"Family dollar is a great place to work i miss it quite offen and if given the chance i would go back, truck was hard work but the customers made my day great"
good,"Working open to close"
good,"I learned to open and close a store. count out the registers.The managers were very helpful when I needed help. The days were never the same, always a variety of customers and situations."
good,Not bad for a student or person who needs a job. Trust me you won't get paid more than a custodian or school driver at a local school. As a second job? Yes it will work but not as a primary job.
good,"Nothing to exciting, just being a cashier. Do get Rude people every now and then but for the most part customers are understanding. being cashier and stock for the front is part of the routine."
good,Provided a good start to the working world. Not enough to live on but definitely enough to save up. The hours are split but you make due. Management was amazing and great to get along with.
good,"It's a pretty good place to work at if you like chill and steady paced work. Didn't want to relocate, but issues came up and I had to move elsewhere..."
good,I am grateful for my job at Family Dollar.  It allowed me the opportunity to do some things. It was stressful to have to put up freight and check out customers at the same time.  I wish there were more employees working at the same time.
good,"Family Dollar is a great job to start off with, I have learned how to work with many different people. Its a very enjoyable job, the hardest part is dealing with bad attitudes"
good,Family Dollar is a very relevant place to dodge high prices for such small things around the house.O enjoyed my time asa member of this franchise because of the worth ethic and pay. It also boosted my ego.
good,the job is fine when you have the right people in there that knows what they are doing and how to do the job because there are a lot of people that work there that doesn't know how to be a manager or assistant one either
good,A typical day has me working as soon as I walk in the door until I get off of work.  The work requires focus and concentration to ensure you are getting things correct for the customers.
good,At family dollar the managers are great and so are the customers. you have the opportunity to get your work assignments done and interact with customers as well.
good,"Started with family.dollar when we had to unload trucks box by box on the metal roller system and left unloading them boxes stacked,  shrink wrapped on pallets with a manual jack."
good,It was my second job and not where I wanted to be at for my career. It was a great place to start learning the job force but not where I would stay and start a career.
good,"I wish we had more security and hours we're more steady other than that the job is good."
good,Most of the time we would face the store. Of course when we had customers it was always friendly and helpful service. You learn to communicate with people in a positive and precise manner.
good,"Slow and boring. Low pay, alright benefits and to many whiny people. I was forced to work overtime so I had plenty of time to work on school work. They could make so many improvements."
good,I loved going to work everyday i help me stay in shap mentally and physically if you dont come prepared it will be hard on you but long as you doing what u have too it will be just fine
good,Family Dollar is a job where they work you for a little bit of nothing. It's enough to get by with bills. Inventory training cashier and new assistant manager bank deposits.
good,"The job was decent. Great work environment, and management was excellent. My co-workers were great as well. I guess that reflects well on the manager that hired them."
good,"Handle cash register. Helping customers, keeping floor stocked and clean can be agreat job the management was poor and majority of the time no manager at all"
good,"Working as a cashier is simple except when you're the only one at the register. Recovery is easy, working with the register is simple but, being the only cashier is difficult as well as dealing with so many customers at once."
good,Great place to gain the management experience. It's all about teamwork and getting the right crew in place. I have learned so much about management that will help me in my next journey. The home/work life balance is the only downfall with working for this company. 52 hours per week minimum...
good,Ever since Dollar Tree bought Family Dollar the store has gone down hill. The employees are treated poorly and receive next to nothing for all of the work that they do.
good,"Family Dollar culture is a balanced place to work. While management lacks training how to handle employee concerns, the overall vibe is relaxed. It is a good organization."
good,"Family Dollar was a good experience, I learned a few things that can benefit me in the long run, I wouldn't discourage someone to work there. Not a bad job for building customer service skills."
good,I enjoyed the job because it was customer service work and i love talking in interacting with people and being able to help out. It is and all around fair job for someone who does not need a lot of money or do not have a family.
good,The job here is slow because its in a small town. There isnt much to do so the days a long and boring. There isnt anything hard about the job. I guess the best part is meeting new people.
good,"The store is most definitely a good environment to be in. Sometimes stressful. It seems like it's hard to keep help at this company. Due to some rules, that people don't seem to like."
good,"My manager was the best manager I've  ever had. She was very flexible but made sure everyone got the job done. "
good,"Family Dollar is a very underpaid job. There's not enough help scheduled, high rate of shoplifting and the hours are minimal. It's enough hours for a high schoolers not an adult with responsibilities."
good,"Always threatened at work. Everyone is out for themselves and will throw you under the bus to benefit themselves. No feeling of appreciation and only work, work, work. No work life balance at all."
good,"They worked with you on your schedule. the manager always seemed to able to  move things around even if it meant he had to spend a little more time at work, to allow  his employees to do whatever it was that needed to be done that day. was always in a good mood.but stayed on top of everybody to get the inventory out in proper time. great work place. i would love to jump back in that experience."
good,"I was a assistant manager so my average day was to keep record of on the floor activity, make sure the safe isn't off, make sure its a safe and clean work environment, stock, and use great customer service skills."
good,"Overall It's an experience I would offer to someone who has a job and just need extra cash. Good People, they just don't offer enough hours in my opinion!"
good,"Provide exceptional customer service. As a SM I am very aware of the needs, wants and expectations of the Regional Manager with daily operations.  Under the direction of the RM, I am also responsible for maintaining inventories, store appearance and completing daily paper work.  Training sales associates, unloading the delivery truck organizing inventory, ordering merchandise, record keeping, payroll, scheduling, while following all Company policies and procedures."
good,"Every job has its up and down , but remaining humble at all times what really gets you through the day. I was laid off due to store closing , so I went back to school and now I have a associates degree."
good,Very busy store and never ran out of things to do.
good,The work is hard but not unrealistic. Pay is fair. Managers are salaried. Dm was a huge help to my store and others in the area. Very hands on. Great training for all employees
good,I personally believe that this is a fast pace quick learning job. I also believe that it helps a person have good social skills. This is a wonderful job.
good,"Overall it is a good company to work for with good benefits, the downfall comes to the store manager you are only required to work 52 hrs a week to meet salary quota except most salary managers work atleast 62-65 hrs a week. You don't have a choice most of the time because the payroll is not enough to cover the work and running the register. That was the one big thing I disliked you are constantly at the store and it's hard to have a personal life"
good,It was a good job  with a good costumer service and hours
good,"I enjoyed working at this location, you get to know the customers and the things they like. only negative i could say is the theft was high and we had to chase the thieves."
good,"Family Dollar is a job to work if you can work with general public, and also if you have good customer service skills. But otherwise it's a good job. Work it don't let it work you"
good,The company sets unrealistic goals for it's employees to accomplish in the short time you work each day. They expect you to work off the clock if you are unable to get the job done in the time they give you or get wrote up. I want to work somewhere where I don't have my job threatened because I don't want to work off the clock. The store manager that I currently work under is even quitting because they are treating her like bull as well. They have no respect for their employees and no matter how hard we work it is never enough. I have no problem with my manager. It is corporate that I have a problem with.
good,Pay sucked but wasn't a bad place to work.. not ideal for someone with kids though... did not make enough to get by... no overtime allowed and pay was very low
good,On an typical day at Family Dollar me as an assistant manager would come in and start by making sure that my CSR'S know what is expected of them and then begin my daily task by making sure that my assignments are completed in a timely manner.
good,Here is where I was given my first opportunity to lead and boy was it a challenge. My supervisor was supportive and groomed me to become a great leader.
good,working at Family Dollar was one of the best experience i had. i love the management and the customers there. i've learned how to have patience and deal with certain situtaions in a great and well maner.
good,I loved working for Family dollar it gives you a lot of room to grow and receive work experience with in cooperate. I always enjoyed going to work. I loveee the hours
good,working for family dollar was a simple job. fun environment. merchandising and customer service are big factors. being able to work alone is another plus
good,"I have learned so much from working in my position as a manager.  a typical day is about 8-10 hours long with an occasional 13-14 hour day, most of the time we are running registers in the morning and multitasking to stock shelves.  Workplace culture varies by store manager and team in place.  Hardest part of job is having a plan in place when you are shorthanded.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers, I enjoy helping and getting to know people.  Higher management varies, I've always had good experiences with management."
good,Working for family dollar was a diferent experinace because i got to work with the cash regester and was in charge of customer service. My delight was always making a customers say with my assitance and inspiration.
good,"Very friendly good place to work, everybody's nice, and well mannered, stores are clean managers communicate with everyone,  and the hours were good, wish I could've stayed longer."
good,"each week is truck day. You have a certain amount of time to get it done, if not you will be written up. You also have a certain amount of time to ring all your customers up."
good,being in charge was great working around different people training and teaching other employees about what to expect. I love my customers what ever their needs was I tried to meet it.
good,The Store Is Under Good Condition. Easy to Find Products. Amazing Customer Service And Friendly People Who Work there. Everyone Is Always In A Great Mood And Everyone Works As A Team.
good,I really enjoyed meeting the new people and making more out of being a cashier. I would always get the regular customers hat well come in and enjoy talking to me. I believe I made family dollar better company.
good,"This job consists of mainly repetitive tasks so don't expect your day to day work to vary much. 40 hours a week gives you adequate time at home and add in payed holidays as the cherry on top. You will occasionally get customers with attitudes or difficult problems to solve but if you are trained properly, following procedures should help you manage the situation at hand. On the downside you also must deal with thieves and robbers with no security in the building to be of service."
good,All in all great place to work. I gained a lot of experience working in this company. The company likes to promote and have you move up. They desperately need to improve the security in these store locations.
good,They never gave enough payroll to get the talks they wanted done nor the man power.  Most of the stores were falling apart and corporate did not get in a hurry to try and Fox them up either.
good,"I loved learning something new outside of doing nursing"
good,"A fine place to work, but as a store manager you can expect long hours.  Many building maintenance issues outside of our control hampered our ability to accomplish all our goals."
good,"Having only two people working in the store at a time didn't help with all the customer service issues there were. However, dealing with being a manager and having so many issues, I felt comfortable learning new things and creating a better environment for my customers."
good,I was a great place to work and co-workers was wonderful. The management wasn't that great. The enjoy able part would be working with people. But they don't make it safe for you either.
good,family dollar is a great job with some good opportunities to grow within the company. as far as management they work with their workers and made it a comfortable environment to work in. Hardest part of the job was some days being that payroll was low some days it was possible that sometimes you can be stocking a whole store up with a short period of time
good,Was always fun working with my co-workers and my boss was amazing! Always a busy store where I worked and some very wonderful customers. Would go back to working there if I moved back to indiana.
good,It was a good atmosphere to work in. The customers always made you feel good. I love working with the public. But they do not care enough about there employees. And treat some of the employees better that don't deserve it. I would love to still work with my old crew
good,The job is a very easy job. I had my first management experience while working. The hard part is working with rude irate customers. Co-Workers were very seldom about working
good,I was constantly busy performing daily operations of the store.I was bumped up to keyholder before I was trained. It was hard to learn so quickly. Distributions are a difficult task to learn and I was forced to learn them very quickly.
good,My co-workers are the best you could ever have. They are fun to work with and they help the day become more productive . We work with people from all different backgrounds and we enjoy helping our customers.
good,"- Had a very fun working atmosphere"
good,You have to work physically hard but it's very satisfying if you like to work retail. You unload your weekly truck a box at a time. You have to work 6 days a week if you are a store manager.
good,Co-workers were awesome but the customers not so much. What made it great however was the manager. She was very accommodating. My only complaint is in regards to pay as there is not much room for advancement.
good,Family Dollar strengthened me in a lot of ways. I enjoyed the job and all the diverse challenges. The best part is workin with a team of people who are results driven.
good,"Working at the family dollar I worked It was good at first when I started but then I started noticing that it was more like a soap op rah the a decent work environment, yes their were great employees, hardworking co worker their but the drama got the best of the work environment."
good,A typical work day is consist of testing equipment fhat family dollar store uses for their point of sale check out items. I've learned to work well with computerized items.
good,Great if your in school in working part time but if your working full time expect long shifts because alot of the times people dont show up to work. Expect high turnover i have went through six crews since my time here
good,"Calm work place with good management and fun co-workers. Growth in the company is fairly easy, just have to do your job and do it well. One of the most important things learned was how to deal and manage different personalities. Most enjoyable part of the job would have to be my co-workers. The hardest part of the job would have to be, being a part-time security when it came to shoplifters."
good,fast paced job moving every minute of work dat customer interactions friendly people cleaning and well kept work area...
good,"When I worked there (2011) was a very busy place. A lot of exciting  thing were happen. Most days was like any other job, setting up and follow up through out the day. Spent over 14 years with company I learned almost all that I know about Distribution and building great teams."
good,"Each and every day at the office was a positive, motivational type setting. I also loved the fact that the managers were on the team instead of just managing. Great, positive place to work."
good,"A good place to work and job security. Learned a lot about welding, preventative maintenance, and expanded my mechanical ability."
good,My view of family dollar as a work place is that its a great place to develop a diverse variety of skills that are useful in the retail industry.
good,"Working as an assistant manager at family dollar was overall a rewarding job. I feel as though upper management doesn't show appreciation for the assistants or cashiers. Also the store managers are not properly trained or organized enough to run the store smoothly with continuous returning customers. I did however enjoy the friendly environment, my co workers positive attitudes, and the never ending amount of work!"
good,I enjoyed employment with Family Dollar . Had a great working relationship with the DM. I just thought my safety was more important. I would open the store at 7am and be alone until 2pm. Just became a unsafe work enviroment
good,"My typical day at work were greeting customers, assisting the customers, and organizing clothes. Maintaining a clean environment  and rotating the products around the store. I enjoyed seeing my regular customers they always greet me with respect and they know exactly who to come to when they needed help which is me."
good,"Ongoing growing company, productive place to work at. Management is detailed oriented and high expectations. Stable income. as it gos for retail not enough people ever working to get the job done correctly but enough to get it done to get by."
good,This is a Pretty good company to work for if you want to work with customer service. If You work hard you can move up fast in the company.
good,Worked at a fast pase meet alot of great pepole was able to get alot of overtime and the manager cared about they employees
good,"My co-workers were easy-going and very easy to work with; I had no problem making new friends.  Management on the other hand was somewhat less professional, as we'd gotten a completely new manager once the previous one left for another store.  He didn't write out schedules when supposed to, he didn't have strong communication skills, and didn't pull his own weight when it came to running the store.  The customers were friendly for the most part; stocking came rather naturally once you knew the location of everything; running the register however was pretty complicated at first but after a couple of weeks there I was more than confident and skilled to do so.  The best part about working there was the atmosphere we as the workers set, which made the customers feel welcomed."
good,"The work day goes by pretty fast, the customers just want to be in and out. The management is very understanding about any issues. Overall a good place to work."
good,"Pay not bad,but too much work.If you like to unload trucks,stock shelves and do all of the tasks that regular workers do,as a manager,then this job is for you."
good,i learned a lot of new things for being the first retail store i had worked at.the hardest part was unloading the truck every week to ensure good stocking. easy software to use.
good,"I am now a better manager based off the skills that I have learn here at Family Dollar.I Trained the store staff by reviewing and revising orientation to products and sales training materials. Also delivering training sessions. Prepares reports by collecting, analyzing, and summarizing information. Maintains professional and technical knowledge by attending educational workshops; reviewing professional publications; establishing personal networks; benchmarking state-of-the-art practices; participating in professional societies. Suggestively sell additional items and services that the customer may not have anticipated they will need."
good,"Have met a lot of great people who are employees and customers.  A lot of great products sold and always something to do."
good,Working in transportation is a very busy environment that requires you to be able to multi-task at all times. The phones are always ringing and reports have dead lines that have to be met. There is cross training going on that makes it a very interesting place to work. You have the ability to learn new task and work with others who are experienced and can show you.The people are great to work with and the hardest thing about my job is learning something new.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening the store, counting the preceding days sales and depositing it in the bank. I learned every aspect of the job as required cashiering,unloading of truck shipments, stocking of merchandise, cycle counts, inventory, customer service. I thought all of the job was hard because I wore so many hats inside of the store. I enjoyed my experience with the company because i was able to learn so much."
good,nice place to work at but management doesnt treat people fare . will discuss further thanks in time. I learned more money management skills. The hardest part was never getting breaks when suppose too.
good,"Productive and good place to work.  The employees and great to work with and very knowledgeable with great work ethics, very thorough and detail oriented."
good,Helping recovered drug addicts get back into the work place.Picking out clothes in our warehouse that is suitable for interviews. Very stressful at times but it was ok. It felt good to put a smile on peoples faces
good,Family Dollar was an alright place to work. It gave me the opportunity to become an assistant manager which can open more doors for me in the future.
good,Managing the stores daily sales and employees. To provide a great customer experience that allows Family Dollar to gain a profit.
good,"i enjoy working here at family dollar, it has its days like any other job but it has been a good experience."
good,A typical day there was okay when not having a manager look over your shoulder for an hour out of the day. I learned from this job to keep all comments and request low when dealing with an angry manager. The hardest part of this job was working with a person that was not to nice to the opposite race.
good,"I was an assistant manager.  The job was fairly easy, but it was a very good place to work with opportunities for growth."
good,"As a store manager or assistant you are responsible for payroll first and foremost. I've seen DM's turn a blind eye to customer service, inventory, and the basic cleanliness of the stores if payroll is met. What is not understood is that if all those very important priorities were scrutinized and company regs were actually inforced, the sales would increase. The door to shelf would flow more regularly. The customer would have a positive shopping experience. They will talk about it with others. SALES WILL INCREASE!!! Payroll will go up to compensate. The only way to fight off the lows is to keep the standards up. If you drop the ball when you have more traffic, that traffic sees you dragging your assss instead of a mop. A guaranteed reciepe for failure. What are you gonna focus on? The chicken or the egg??? Door to Shelf and Recovery have to be your first priority. If you don't use your payroll today, you won't have sales to pay yourself tomarrow. Because your customer will be having a pleasant shopping experience next door at DG!!! I'm not saying you need to go over, I'm saying use what you got. If you save some on Monday, use the surplus on Saturday. Call extra help in and burn it up!!! Make sure you are ready for the next weeks truck. If you use it now, you won't have to make a pallet in the stockroom come inventory or the night before visit........"
good,"This was my first time in retail. The experience was ok. I would meet different people everyday. Some were delightful and others, well let's just say to was ok!"
good,"A typical day was full of merchandising, customer interactions, employee training. I learned how to pay more attention to detail. My direct supervisor was great, she was very helpful and informative. My co-workers were great."
good,"Excellent work/life balance"
good,Company constantly changed its goals and corporate structure with little or no communication to its employees. Lost sight of its original core values and started losing its customers to competitors. It is truly a shame because it was a wonderful place to work.
good,"I enjoy working at Family Dollar, and the team members are great. The benefits however aren't, neither is the pay. Yet, I've learned a great deal about internal operations, and how to handle stressful situations. The team members are also great to get along with, and the hours are flexible."
good,"This is a great job to gain experience from. However, there is limited advancement options. It is a very high pace work environment which requires rapid decision making, quality customer care and being proactive. From my duration at family dollar I have learned that there are many situations you will encounter on a day to day basis that  will require me to use good judgement and maintain professionalism at all times. I have worked along side some great coworkers and learned from excellent store managers who have helped me in many areas like successfully running and maintaining a excellent store. The hardest part is working with little payroll and not enough staff to achieve good store grades. The most enjoyable part of working at family dollar is having a great bond with coworkers who want to be the best and succeed."
good,"managers make good money, but you have no life, working 60-70 hours a week.  it started out years ago 48 hours, then over the years, payroll kept getting cut until managers were working 65 hours weekly."
good,"Retail is my career, and has been challenging and very rewarding."
good,Team work every body gets aloug helping each other where needed  to be help putting stock out is the hardest part of the job you got to make sure its out on the floor at a certain time. Helping and Assistant customers.
good,"I like working there, advancing is easy as long as you're a hard working individual. It's nice to work at the dollar store."
good,"Typical day starts off as counting the money in register making sure it has the correct amount, keep the store looking nice, and helping all the customers out with whatever they need. I learned how to correctly communicate with people with both good and bad attitudes, and how to correctly handle cash."
good,"Nice place to work horrible , but young and inexperienced management staff!"
good,A typical day would open or close store I would help customer. The hardest part of the job would be unloading the truck every sunday at 5 in the morning.
good,This job was almost perfect. The issue is the high chance of robbery.The hours that these stores are open and some of the nieghborhoods they are embedded in make it dangerous.
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers. Enjoyed seeing familiar customers. Had a great manager. The hardest part of the job was complaining customers.
good,"I open the store sometimes; and, sometimes I close.   I count the money, load the safe and count out money in cashier's drawers.  I check emails from district manager to see if any projects are due.  I check stock room and start brining out freight.  doing time there greet and assist customers.  I learned how cut time in half on working freight and get more done on my shift.  My co-workers and I have a good rapport.  We have had the same staff for over a year.  The hardest part of the job is pulling out freight on pallets; rather use u-boats.  The most enjoyable part of my job is we have same customers coming to the store and know me well. Some even thought I was the manager.  Customers ask me do I ever go home.  When you have a good staff it makes managing the store much easier.  I have a routine that I stick with and know that something may change on a given day so I know how to adjust and multitask."
good,"After I graduated high school, I worked a job at Family Dollar. It was your average retail store job so I won't be saying too much about. Straightforward job, operate cash register, stock store, clean store, balance register and close store. I can't say management was clean, matter of fact the guy was a crook, he embezzled money from the store. Co-workers were...eh, I barely talked to them, most were a bit shady too, nothing was hard about the job as I can recall and I can't say it was the most enjoyable job, but hey I got paid."
good,"Family Dollar Corp office is a great company to work for; Family Dollar continues to grow on a daily and yearly basis which is due to the great vision of the senior management team. Typical work days consists of supporting business initiatives, project support, testing new system versions, live production issues, team building exercises and team knowledge transfer sessions. "
good,"it was okay, store could have been better. some co workers i liked, some i disliked. Hard workers and sorry workers"
good, Start cashiering and then stocking in between customers. Keep all areas as clean and neat as possible. Assist customers with any questions or concerns they had. Learned more conversational Spanish as well as stock inventory. Management was friendly and maintained a professional look. Coworkers worked together to complete daily duties. Hardest part of jobs was remembering exactly where everything was. most enjoyable part of the job was interaction with the many different types of people I met daily.
good,"I really liked interacting with the customers.  I rang up customers, helped them if they needed it, provided security to stop shoplifters also.  I learned how to multi-task.  We had to do different things throughout our whole shift.  I got along well with the management, they did the best that they could do to help you.  Security was hands down the hardest because of the geographical area we worked in.  The most enjoyable part was helping the customers and making sure they were satisfied.  The girls I worked with were the best also."
good,A typical day at work for me was always the same. I would start off on the register and stocking shelves and I would be doing that until the end of the day. I would also have to take tests online for work as well. 
good,"A typical days consists of costumer service, stocking shelves, and seeing that the store functions properly.  I learned a lot to do with retail and merchandising along with off loading and staging merchandise.  Co-workers are well trained but depending on who you work with thing need to be kept at a professional level.  The hardest part of the job was the long 14 hour days.  The most enjoyable was the cohesiveness of the team."
good,"As the store manager of a higher volume store you are constantly busy. From sweeping floors to stocking shelves and serving customers needs you are always on the run. The responsibility is a large task but with the right associates in place all becomes routine. Upper management is  always helpful and willing to help when problems arise."
good,"My time at Family Dollar was great until I became an Assistant Manager. Then my boss made me work 40+ hours a week while I was trying to go to college full-time. These hours included working open to close (7:30 am - 10pm) as the only manager on duty so that meant I could hardly take a break throughout the day. Then my district manager promised me a raise in a few months time. When I kept asking him about it, he kept giving me excuses as to why I couldn't have a raise. I left."
good,"A typical day at work was rounding up sales on the csh register, stocking merchandise. What I learned was good customer services and how to get along well with other employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting along with my boss and supervisors"
good,"typical day at work, running reg, good customer service, stocking shelves, refunds exchanges, filing paperwork, making deposits, ect. I am asst manager & just stepped down from manager, so that the store would be covered when I find my new jobs. I have been with my current place of employment for the last seven years, and I would like to do something different line of work for a change. The unloading of the truck's is the hardest part of my job, and I would like to find a job that dose entail unloading of 1'000 to 1'600 case trucks every week. The best part of my job is that get to work with people. I enjoy that part the most customer service"
good,"a typical day was coming in at 7am start throwing frieght setting any ad sets get registers up and running to open at 9am. after opening it was my responsibility to check in vendors, wait on customers, answer phones, put up freight do all paperwork and if it was truck day unload the truck. Normally i had someone come in between 1 and 2. I worked 2 15 hour days and 3 eight days and how many additional hours it would take to get all projects complete."
good,"Family Dollar was a good place to work at for my first job. There weren't many employees, so hours ended up being irregular and cashiers often ended up doing jobs that were assigned to assistant managers if the job wasn't done."
good,"Productive and a fun but learning workplace. I learn how to manage a store, how to do store orders,cycle counts, recieve the trunks properly, traning an coaching my employee,s and the hireing and the fireing process. Management is following the company,s policys and being able to run and mantain a store properly, also protect the company assets and most important is customer relations. My co-workers is having respect for them but an knowing that when you are on the job it is all work and no play.The hardest part of the job is making sure that you hire, train and coach the right people for the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting everything you want acomplished an still having fun while you are doing it."
good,A company that promotes from within and rewards the highest achievers
good,"I really enjoyed working there the few hours ,i were there.i help open the store in lovejoy..he;lp out racks shelve and so much more..we put the store together in a few days,we unload the two bis trailers and stock alll items the same day,it was kind of fun,been by first job,working for someone over 30 years.new experince,which i thought would have been good for me at the time..nut it was great working for you company at the time i were there.,Thank You"
good,The job it self wasn't difficult nor was it hard the management and company just doesn't offer tpits employees the respect credit or right work conditions they deserve.
good,Family Dollar's culture is great! They believe in obtaining and promoting great talent. Team Members care about each other and the goals of the Company. Management accepts ideas and suggestions from Team Members. I enjoy working with my co-workers and the Team Members on a daily basis.
good,I do like the work we do at family dollar just looking for something even with less pay to spend more time with family.
good,"Payroll is the hardest and of course the people that dont want to work and when they do they whine and cry about it. My coworkers are ok but they mostly whine when they dont get their way or the days off they asked for. The problem is that someone has to pay the price when they dont show up, me."
good,"In the mornings , I come in, make the bank drop and open the store. I always check the monthly planner to make sure that all displays and circulars are up to date. Once i give my cashier their daily assignments , I move on to the stockroom where I work out all of the merchandise fro our weekly truck. At night I close the store, count the petty money in the safe, get the deposit together and recover the store. The best part about my job is being able to be creative with my displays. I also love the amount of face to face interaction that i get with the customers. The hardest part of the job is probably trying to get all of my work done, watch customers for shrink and help my cashiers on the register at the same time. It is a challenging but very rewarding experience all together."
good,i will always love working there because there was always there for improvement
good,Their were days where I was happy and ready to go but it got so over whelming to the point where I was having a life. And stress and depression to a toll on me as well I wasn't myself anymore.
good,Team work have to always stay on your job can't let anything be missed placed. Manage your own money you make. Every station has to be cleaned. Closing make sure everybody money add up for the bank the next day.
good,I worked for this company and I was very truthful with anything they asked of me. When I told them the truth it's like they didn't believe what I had to say. I have given my all to this company and they turn around and slap me and my wife in the face. FD needs to learn to have integrity.
good,Good team and staff every one was a hard worker good pay but did not like working hours hard part of the job was up keeping a organized store and keeping it clean but alwats great help and team work
good,"They don't have enough employees on the floor days. So customer service is very hard to accomplish when your the only one there all day to do stocking, running register which is most time consuming. Its extremely hard to be able to give good service when there is only one person working. Also very hard to controll shoplifting when you cant be on the floor to help or observe."
good,It’s an okay place to work just looking for better benefits and time with my family. And to advance in an better atmosphere. Thanks..........:.::.........
good,"A day would start with a meeting and a stretch ii wiuld geab my forklift,inspect it drive to a dedicated area and start putting away newly received product and pull older for the outgoing lines when not busy cleaning is a must also going up in a cage to fix dumped pallets log in different scanner screens quitting time is when all product is in location and lines are filled"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers knowing that they are well taken care of and dealing with the different personalities. Family Dollar has taught me how to manage my time,and multi-task better. Management is very hands on and involved with the up keeping of the facility. Typically there is a lot of stocking and customer interaction in the store."
good,Relaxed job and simple cashier work for anyone who doesn’t need much but also a lot of lifting and moving one day a week usually or when restocking shelves.
good,Don’t really have a review everything I have already told don’t have anything else to say I do not have one hundred and fifty words to share so I hope this is enough
good,"Family Dollar is a very good company to work for, fast growth within the company and great customer service . You also meet all kinds of people all the bosses within the company are very helpful when it comes to customer satisfaction and solving problems."

good,family dollar was very challenging but enjoyed working there.i done several jobs there from cashier to shipping and receiving to mopping floors cand buffing them
good,"ok job to work at work is hard if you like working in hot sotres wiith no cooling and people stealing, managers are required to stay in store on their breaks and lunches"
good,Could advance with more security. Secure products firmly before delivery. Additions product safety for the recieving party. More employees during truck days.
good,"Getting notarized occasionally for a job well done. The fun was meeting new people, and helping them to succeed in the business."
good,Family dollar is a family shopping place. You can get all of your home and family needs. I think its a place for young teenagers because the pay can't pay your bills.
good,Fun and friendly place to work.  The managers are friendly and most will jump in and help when it’s needed. The only thing I didn’t like was the head set.
good,"Its a very intrested place to work at, you can also meet new people. its fun to help people an making sure the custmers are satified . i enjoyed working their very much."
good,"I didn't work often since everyone's times were cut back, but my coworkers were nice and I enjoyed working there while i did. The hardest thing i think was trying to keep up with the fast pace, it was difficult for me sometimes, but I learned a lot."
good,awesome job for anyone who wants to build a great career background they help you deal with the different personalities each day.family dollar  also give u a chance to grow
good,"Work day was usually stressful and fast pacing."
good,Family Dollar is a good job oppurtunity. Its in very high demand of employees.I would try to make sure you have a store manager that you can come to a mutual level playing field.
good,The incentive program needs to be adjusted. In one area it is extremely easy to hit incentive while in other areas you can work extremely hard and your percentage will still be very bad.
good,I enjoyed working for this company untill my hours were cut so low I could barely keep the store running. I eventually felt like I was running the store all by myself.
good,Family Dollar corp is very interesting and fun. You get to show your skills off as far as how much you know about IT related issues. The culture is always fun the environment is a bit noisy but you have on headphones so you get use to it.
good,There was always something to do to stay busy. It was a pretty positive environment. There was room to grow. The management was very well structured. I enjoyed the job.
good,"The hardest part of the job was helping loss prevention."
good,Family dollar is a great company and I really enjoyed working there.  I'm just looking for something less with plans on moving to a part time position.
good,It's OK to work there just need better pay for everyone.   My manager is the best and we work harder then most think not a bad job... Just need better pay for all we do..
good,Being in management is a great opportunity also has your ups and downs. It's awesome being able to teach others and watch them grow. The downfalls are that if someone doesn't show up for work you have to stay and don't get additional pay as for your salaried.
good,It was very fast paced but loved working with my coworkers. I would still be there today if my store did not close. We all got along and everyone helped out each other.
good,"This job was fun and a quick advancement. Even though we were robbed a couple times it was okay. I was working here for 5 years so the customers of course loved me. Until this day I run into some still, and they still hug me."
good,"Its a wonderful working habit. With people willing to help you through hard times ,great service. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers. Love working at Family Dollars but they dont give you a schedule and working hours."
good,"the customers, they were very nasty at times. most family dollars are located in poor neighborhoods so most customer are not that educated.as a result of this I was mistreated by some not all."
good,The company itself does not care much for its employees. Your job crew can make or break your experience at Family Dollar. I would not suggest working here.
good,"It as a very stressful and competitive place to work! The Manager as not nice, i cleaned and stocked shelves and ran the cashier. The customers were great!"
good,Loved the job itself and the customers. Had difficulty balancing work and home.  A lot required of their managers. Not enough staffing allowed in the stores.
good,Being at family dollars I took it apon myself to be a team leader and a manager.Being on time and staying late getting the job done that was my task making sure my team members had a safe and clean environment to work at.
good,"It don't pay enough plus no set time and need more holiday off days.I load semi trucks,count boxes and check the label. We load other trucks when time and sign the load diagram. It's load by hand from a power conveyor belt."
good,"Loved family Dollar , they give room for improvement for hard work , enjoyed working there until store manager was changed, and so there was a lack of proper leadership"
good,"imperativeness  to restocking  inventory oldest to newest. management very good fast self teaching programs. "

good,"Family Dollar is a decent company with room for advancement! During my time with this company I learned valuable skills in people management, operations, and strategic planning."
good,It's very physically demanding. On weekends it may be slow but you can always find something to do. Policy is strict but it is there to protect the employees. Management changes frequently.
good,"There was a lack of leadership within and outside of the store. As a result, the store lacked structure and sales and the team suffered. The pay was adequate though, that's the only reason I would consider recommending someone to work for them."
good,"Good place to work until senior management retired.  Easy to advance if you were willing to work hard to get where you needed.  "
good,The work load was easy for the job that was at hand. Nothing to crazy. Dealing with customers was the easiest thing to do. Hardest thing to do was dealing with customers.
good,Good management. Good pay. short staffed.   The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and the great pay. The  worst part was we tended to be short staffed at times.
good,"duties for the day were dealing with reports of sales for corporate. Working along side my crew. Ordering new inventory, counting stock and preparing night time deposits. The job was a bit stressful since they gave me one week of training as an assistant and the manager quit and I was promoted straight to Store Manager. I enjoyed working with my employees and the different customers that would come in. I did move to another town and transferred as an assistant."
good,"A typical day working at Family Dollar was for me to clock in count my draw to make sure it was $100 after that I would start restocking, stocking the shelf's until I had to check out a customer or I would be answering questions that the customers may have about a product that we sell in our store. My management was none stop working making sure everything is top notched to everyone standers , making sure each and every customer is satisfied with the service, welcoming with them with open arms, making sure the customers feels welcomed coming into our family dollar. The hardest part of the job was being new to everything basically tying to figure out were each product was and getting use to finding products for customers when they need your assistance but after you mastered that everything runs smoothly for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers find what they need, dealing with customer service you get to talk to different people, most of the people I have helped while working at Family Dollar had much humor , made me laugh, it just makes the work place go by faster."
good,"Okay company to work for. Limited time for a family life, A lot of hours involved if you are a manager. Besides that if you are willing it is an okay job."
good,In the 2 years of employment with them I Watched every benefit of the job disappear within the 1st 6 months. It literally became to expensive to work there
good,"Wasn't a bad job pretty easy to catch onto things. Decent hours and good pay, very flexible. Time goes by quickly as there is always something to get done."
good,"I've long since had a dislike for this business. They try to run a store with the very minimal amount of employees resulting in long hours, understaffed and lack of payroll, and just other issues resulting in the loss of employees. Luckily the one advantage is that it's quite easy to move up the ladder for promotions if you work hard."
good,I was working for Family Dollar when it was minimum wage he is getting paid 7.25 an hour you have to be really dedicated and a people person to really work there
good,Company pays very little money and does not really care about employees' well being. Usually pays the minimum wage rate and sometimes offer overtime but not on several occasions. Less room for growth.
good,they give lots of work to do including watching for thieves while running the register while stocking...just a lot of work with little pay and you don't get included in the bonuses for slaving.
good,"Every day at work I did my best in keeping the right attitude, and making everyone feel like they were part of the team. I learned "
good,I enjoy working with the people that work at Family Dollar.  They try and help each other.  We seem to have things in common.  The customers who come in make it interesting.
good,"Open store, stock shelves, wait on customers. Learned about accounting and scheduling. Good people to work for, fun environment. hardest part was unloading the truck for stocking shelves. and best part was getting good deals on clearance racks."
good,"I loved everything about this job, It was fun working with my crew everyday. I couldn't wait to get to work. The only down fall was when the store manager left they hired a dummy."
good,"Business at work is moderate be busy one and slow the next. Work truck load to be done before the next truck shipment. Teach new workers how to run registers, help out customers and learn how to control the stock inventory. Be wary of customers in the store."
good,"I've learned to improved and effective time management skills, improved ability to stay calm in stressful circumstances, experience handling cash, debit and credit card transactions, excellent interpersonal skills, and improved ability to problem solve and think on your feet."
good,"From personal experience, overall, I would say that Family Dollar Corporate Officials and District Managers fail to recognize the importance of their staff. They have too many expectations with minimum staff."
good,"One day a customer comes in with an issue about his card was over charge, what I did was. I calm him down first by double checked it, find the problem apoligize and  explaining  to him it was our errors and that could be fix in no time. Offer him a discount of the product and put the money back on his card."
good,It was a very good work experience. We were all able to get along with one another. The hardest part of the job was moving so many things. I enjoyed learning new things.
good,"Family Dollar is a great place to work, especially if you're looking into a management career. A Typical day will consist of running the register, assisting customers find and buy products, replenish stock, and recover. In a management position, you'll assist the cashier when needed, replenish stock, recover the store, and place orders as needed. "
good,"Show up on time for meetings, stretch with co worker groups,  get assigned trailer to load, I learned that Night shifts arent as easy everyone says they can be, but also learned that it requires a strong mindset on top of having good physical condition. Management wasn't as well put together as it should have, but they did their job to say the least. Hardest part of the job was making passed that 3am crunch of tiredness, but most enjoyable part was that we made everything work out perfect in the end"
good,very demanding job to do. Most enjoyable part of the job was my colleagues and watching and helping them grow in the company. I enjoyed working with public. Was able to go outside my store and run teams on the road which abled  to step up and show I was willing and able to step to take on the next challenge and give my assistance managers step up too.
good,my typical day of work at family dollar is coming in getting on my register talking to customers trying to make them feel good about their selves so they will love to come in our store on a regular basis. this job is training me more on management a step up in life.i love my manager and co workers family dollar isa great place to work.i think the hardest part of my job is unloading trucksand the best part is making my customer feel good and enjoying shopping here.
good,"My particular store was a huge and great store."
good,"Store manager responsible for productivity and customer satisfaction. We have many regular customers and I know many by their first names. Most customers are pleasant to be around. There is a lot of theft in the stores and very little security. It is not a safe place to work, the majority of the time I am working alone due to the small amount of payroll the store is allowed. I have had problems keeping co-workers due to the many other available jobs that offer more benefits and better pay. All my co-workers have enjoyed me as their boss and I do my best at training them to achieve the goals they desire. I enjoy working with people and I like that I am constantly busy doing something, I dislike the turnover and having to be the one to work 70 hours a week and 15 hour shifts back to back."
good,my co- work were very helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers with anything. Keeping the store very organized and clean .
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work. Dealing with the different people was a good experience. Meeting all the new people was something that I enjoyed. Dealing with upper management is hard due to they do not know what goes inside the store on a everyday bases. To explain what goes on and try to speak with them was very hard. If the store was not making the budget then nothing was really spoke of.
good,"I help customers when they need me too. I also help stock shelves and handle money. I love the people that I work with, they are very outgoing and they work hard. The hardest part of the job is when we get very busy and the registers will not go fast, they are very slow and keeping the customers happy. The thing that is the most enjoyable is getting to help others."
good,a day a family dollars is clocking in stocking and zoneing products.  Then i would zone clothes.  After that i would relive the cashier and that's what i would do until i clocked out.
good,"Working for family dollar has been a great experience. My crew has became somewhat of a distant family, I have gained a management position and a substantial amount of experience. As my time at Family Dollar increases I have noticed a lack of concern for the crew by the corporate side of the company though. The amount of work expected with the allowable budget was becoming stressful with the addition of crew members quitting and being pulled by corporate Family Dollar for various reasons."
good,This is a part-time job. The most enjoyable part of my job is  my co workers and the managers are great.  I love with being able to help customers.
good,Management hours are long and it is a salaried position. Coworkers are okay. A lot to learn and a lot to keep up with. Great Challenge
good,"Productive workplace with nice people to work with and great customers. I like this job because it was face paced and there was always something to do,therefore, I stayed busy. The thing that I disliked about this job is that they provided a very low pay rate for assistant managers. They also didn't allow us to take breaks because usually there was only one manager there for each shift."
good,At work in the morning i would count the register to make sure the register has $100 in the draw. I would open the doors and let the customers start shopping. I would start stocking the shelves til a customer is ready to pay for their merchandise. Once my shift is over i go to the back office and count the register to make it go back to $100.
good,"A regular work day in Family Dollar Stores, Inc. consisted of starting with counting the safe, cigarette sales and all registers for accuracy. Filing papers in numeric/alphabetic order in regards to vendors and the Kiosk system. Checking daily e-mail's from district managers about payroll, markdowns, recalled items, upcoming sales and promotions, etc. Helping and managing the team on sales floor with stocking items in an efficient manner according to planogram description. Helping customers with any questions about store items and/or general concerns. "
good,Typical day at work was satisfying customers. I learned how to manage employees and help keep inventory under control. The management which was at this location is no longer working for this company. My co-workers helped me to learn the do's and don'ts of this position (Store Manager). The hardest part of the job was finding the time to hold store meetings without employees having overtime. The most enjoyable part of this job was working on the computer and satisfying customers.
good,"i started out being hired to help open the store in berea KY in 1998 i quickly worked my way from cashier to assistant manager to store manager duties included run the cash register , ordering store items and supplies, deposits , bank runs unloading trucks , stocking"
good,"clock in, count my money that im going to open my register with. clean my space area. ive learn how to unload our truck. clean our store front face the merchandise in its home. the management are wonderful."
good,"I have enjoyed working for this company and have been with them for a total of 12 years. I am leaving because they have been cutting payroll back so much that we can't get the job done. As opening manager, we are the only employee in the store until noon. We go in at 7am and get the paperwork done to open. That's a long time to go without a break or any help  with the customers. I understand the need to cut back right now but not at the cost of employees safety. All the stores on my side of town have been robbed or broken in to. They broke into our store and got into our safe. Its just a matter of time before they rob us. They know we are there alone in the morning. Besides that we are chasing our tail trying to get all the freight put up and price changes done. Not to mention cycle counts and all the 100 other things there are to do in the course of a day.It has been a great company to work for but it just seems that they don't care about us anymore. They are going to loose a lot of really good people."
good,"Family Dollar is a very busy place, with all kinds of over time. Management is fair to all employees. Great opportunities for advancements with in the company. A friendly environment, with a great work atmosphere."
good,"this job was an amazing job, i advanced in the company only after a few months of hard work, the only thing that turned out to be regretful about this employer is the fact that they did not like to work with other aspects of a persons life."
good,"A typical day at work: Ringing out customers, cleaning, helping customers with finding things."
good,"My work day is somewhat repetitive. I come in to work, clock in and begin my day. There are always boxes to unpack and things to stock no matter what; while I stock, I watch the register and greet customers as they walk through the door. I've learned new things, like how to work a register, count down and loan in, plus deal with customers that aren't happy with the service or our selection of items. I have also learned how to manage money and ensure that I am profiting the company as much as possible. Management is not bad and the district manager is always on top of the stores in her district; she is concerned about the well-being of the stores she runs as well. My co-workers are hard-working, older people and all females. No one I work with is rude and most of us are good at working under pressure and getting things done no matter how difficult things are or what problems we may encounter in the process. The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to deal with customers and communicating with them, ensuring they find everything they need/want and that their experience is the best it could possibly be."
good,My typical day at work would consider ringing customers up at my register & helping customers with their needs in the store.  I also took deposits to & from the bank. I worked on project manager projects. Im a very people oriented kind of person & deal with all situations gracefully.
good,"sometimes it was like pulling teeth, I learned that not everyone you work with you are going to like. most of your managers thought they were better then you no matter how great you were as an employee a lot of employees were lazy and never wanted to work and the one the ones that were awesome they always let go. The hard part and trying to get door to shelve done within 24 to 28 hours while also trying to cash customers out and help people. the best part was talking and getting to know different people that live around you."
good,"A typical day at work is simple. Mostly taking care of customers, stocking, and fixing up the store. Cash management and filing paperwork. I have learned that you have to manage time better, and expect the uinexpected. The management is okay. With the District managers having so many stores and spread apart, they are not available to come out to every store. The hardest part of the job is balancing personal and work life. There is not much time for personal when you are working 60 plus hours or 6-7 days a week. The most enjoyable part of the job is the associates and customers. They make the day go by fast and are the people that are most appreciative."
good,"A typical day working at Family Dollar:"
good,"To begin the day,  verify the safe to be the amount established by the Family Dollar Corporation. Ensure all previous day's deposits have been recorded properly and the deposits have been brought to the bank. Once monetary tasks have been performed, follow the weekly and daily agendas.  The Store Manager delegates to the Assistant Managers what needs must be met and ensures all corporate tasks are completed.  A co-worker is a business partner,  the two will always look for other's best interests.  If the day is planned properly, there will be no hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job will be serving the customer and increasing the store's sales."
good,"Greeting customers, assisting customers with finding products and processing the customer through checkout."

good,I want to feel better about going into work. when i get paid for 52 hrs and work 65+ hrs a week it very stressful. Plus I dont see my kids very often because im seem to always be working
good,"I came to work and started to work immediately. I'd unload, stock, be cashier, and customer service. I learned to be more social and how to handle different situation properly. Management wasn't the great but it was far from the worse. Nothing was really prepared or in order. The hardest part of the job was having to unload the truck with a messy back room. The most enjoyable part of the day when I got paid."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, and would work there again."
good,"a typical day would be me getting from class and coming in the store to do my job, once i was told what i had to do for that day. What i learned was everyone view you differently regardless of what another person may say or think of you. Management when i first started was great because we had a great relationship and she had that with all her customers. however, when she got in a accident and we got a new manager i didnt like it because the store was going downhill and he blamed some of the associates, but i had really just started to work there. my co-workers was cool we all helped each other. the hardest part was dealing with the new manager accusing us of stealing."
good,o Responsible for providing exceptional customer service
good,"i got to work at 730 took deposit to bank and opened the store done what ever needed to be done...and closed at 9pm ... I learned alot of patience and understanding...

good,"The days that you worked were deffinitely different. depends on who came in, what happened, and if the day went through smoothly. Had to be aware for alot of shop lifters considering the times we live in. I learned to be a supervisor and that anyone can be a thief. Management was good depending on who you got. some were beyond great managers but others were slick people who didnt care about others. CO-workers were great anf very friendly. The hardest part would have to be first thing in the morning on shipment day when your unloading, stocking, and supervising the store similtaneously"

good,small retail store settings allows associates to work closely together. Making is a freindly environment.
good,This job was a very enjoyable job for me because I was able to directly affect the lives of every day in my community alone with being given the opportunity to advance quickly through the ranks
good,Do not get treated fairly as an employee. For what you do and the pay that you make is not worth it. And if I were to ever be allowed to go back to work at Family Dollar I would never consider it very displeased with the company
good,"I looove this job until my location would be getting robbed every 3-4 hours. No security guards and a lot of nasty people would come in. Only great thing was the overtime pay, sick time, vacation time and my employees were great! Rude customers on the daily also made my work experience here a bit less favorable"
good,Worry about not having enough workers but will still let people go. Or dont really care about their employees having family emergencies that they have to attend to.
good,Very demanding work for the pay. Lots of heavy lifting and working long shifts alone. Too few employees to accomplish the job effectively. Schedule is constantly being changed. Little to no work-life balance
good,I was a assistant store manager I had a store manager who started out great to work for then she hired her friend as a cashier and got rude with other
good,Family Dollar is a good job. Its a place where you can learn lot and grow real quick from. I would recommend friends or family that want to learn and grow in retail this is the best place to do so
good,Easygoing environment but a lot of work is expected in short time periods and minimum employees. Great place for first time workers and u can achieve promotions with dedication and hard work
good,"out going person,love helping others .independent. motivated. the customers the bussiness it self is good...i wish they would have more benifits and higher pau"
good,I liked the job but you have to be a hard worker. Rarely had breaks and not enough staff to  cover busy times. Oftentimes expectations are not realistic.
good,You get out of it what you put into it. Start at 6:00 am and go to my head hits the pillow. Every store visit requires a store audit. They only supply you an I pad and company phone for this role.

good,There was a lot to do and very often not enough time to get it all done. You are expected to work quickly and to always get better. If you slack off or or are too slow at the job they have no use for you.
good,"Great working with customers & interacting with the different folks that came in the store. Great conversations while cashing people out, cleaning, & inventory. The managers were pretty great to work with too, they were both hands on,setting examples."
good,"A typical day at work was, clock in, check to see if there were extra cashiers and if they needed help if not, my job was to go to the back and grab the restock items to stock the shelves in the store, if my help was required i would go to the front and help out with customers and when most of the customers was gone i would clean and restock"
good,Definitely a good starter job for people trying to get out there. My managers were reasonable with my hours and when I could not get to work on a certain day because of prior engagements my managers worked with me.
good,Family dollar has been a great work experience for me and it’s a place where you can grow fast it is a bit complicated sometimes depending on your work location

good,"It was an okay place to work, but some of the people there were very rude, and the guy that works there was harassing me and others. To the point, I felt very uncomfortable in had to leave them, but the pay was decent. I just knew it was not the right environment for me honestly too much drama."
good,I enjoyed my time while I worked at Family Dollar.  They were bought out by Dollar Tree awhile back and that has impacted the day to day life with the company.

good,"It's Family Dollar.....Some are good, while others are STRESSFUL!!!!! Managers are good. However, Assistants are not the best and can be rude. No heat or air in some stores. Customers are what they are."
good,"resent "
good,Loved my job. When the manager's moved it became a place that was not a good fit to work. The new manager was not willing to work with me an my overall goal of going to college.
good,I started off as a cashier and a few months later I was asked if I wanted to become an ASM. It was a very high volume store which means that the store would be very busy each day and it also was very fast paced.

good,"a typpical day at work, relaxed fast paced and keeping yourself busy."
good,"Working at Family Dollar they care about your needs on the job and eventually promote you when you're ready. The management is always wanting to know how work is and if there is anything you need like more hours or time off, they are there."
good,the stores are small with just about 3 to 6 people per store. it runs like a mom and pop store with the perk of being a corporate company. overall days go by fast and you are never too overwhelmed with the work that is given.
good,chance for advancement within the company. you meet people of all walks of life. the hourly wage could be better. security was a bit of concern as well or the lack there of.
good,The job offers chance for advancement. It can be very stressful and face-paced at times. You get the opportunity to help people and make new friends. You also get paid weekly.
good,"Overall it was the best job experience I ever had but there were some downfalls for working for the company. Such as not necessarily corporate but it was like all the customers were from H -E-Double Hockey sticks. I've been robbed , locked in the store by a customer trying to take something that was mine , customers would watch me pevertedly(?) through the window it made me so uncomfortable and corporate still refused to put security in my store so as a result from fear and stress I simply resigned."

good,I would usually be on the register most of the work days. It would be challenging dealing with customers who were not too friendly.
good,The only thing that concerns me is that safety standards are not up to par.  Very messy back room and asiles too crowded for safe shopping.

good,Spend 52hrs to 80hrs at the store. Manage from 5 to 10 employees. Put displays out on the floor. Make bank deposits daily.
good,"I have learned many things about this job! I have learned that people can be very rude, and the fact that I still maintain a very friendly attitude to me, is great. My boss and co-workers are all very pleasant to work with. The hardest thing about this job is honestly the work itself, and maintaining that great attitude towards my customers! This is no easy, stand around kind of job, you are always on your toes. This is not something I dislike, just the hardest. It makes it much harder to reach my goals, but that's what I love about it!"
good,The work was very productive. I learned a lot about the grocery store business
good,I would normally be working the cash register or assigned to stock shelves. There were some days in which I would do both. I learned more people skills and customer services skills. My boss was very understanding and down-to-earth. She did the same work the rest of the crew did and always gave a helping hand. My co-workers were very fun. They were easy to talk to and were very nice. The hardest part of my job was taking products off the the truck into the store. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I had great co-workers that made work fun and quick.
good,"I was in charge of the stock room, unloaded delivery trucks, moved merchandise to sales floor, resets, helped customers, and cashier-ed."
good,well family dollar was ok just kinda stressful and so i had quit do to the stress of this job all though i really liked working there. other than that i really enjoyed my jo there and was wanting to be management.
good,I loved my job. Loved my coworkers. Loved the customers. I was a very hard & dedicated worker. Was always on time & ready to fulfill my responsibilities. Just me and my manager had differentiation on respect
good,"It was an enjoyable job, but Way understaffed which led to multiple robberies and store theft. Employee endangerment was it's downfall. If the number of employees was more than 1 during the day, it might've been safer."
good,There are some things that family Dollar can improve on as far as providing hours for employees or managers don't have to work 50 hours plus a week good dm
good,"keeps you busy, not every day is the same. encounter different types"
good,"GM's were of no help. I was promoted from Asst Manager to Store Manager and I did the job with NO prior training, then was replaced without notice! Basically used me, demoted me back to Asst Manager... Needless to say I QUIT!"
good,Had to greet customers and wring them up work the floor and stock and sometimes when we were very very busy had to help open another register and help the fellow cashier.
good,"The company is great. Management is awesome but it is a very fast-paced company and the work is sometimes stressful.  However, there are jobs out there that are worse."
good,Was enjoyable and fast paced. Alot of responsibility and very busy. Loved all my customers some returned daily so got to know alot of them i made a great work environment.
good,"free lunch,Christmas parties are always fun, flexible hours, understanding management, the workplace location was a little unsafe at night, the hardest part of the job is counting the safes twice a day."
good,"Loved my job at family dollar even worked there while pregnant with my daughter, nice place friendly people. Would have stayed but the store I worked at closed down."
good,Family Dollar was fun at times but with the work load it was stressful. Family Dollar is a very busy store and the demand is very high. Sometimes it is not enough staff to successfully complete the many daily tasks.
good,Greet the customers with good customer service. I have trained to stock the shelves. I was offered the Assistant Manager position. It's a productive and fun workplace to work. I don't have any complaints. Is meeting and greeting with customers and employees.
good,"cashier, greeted customers, stocked shelves, cleaned and tagged and separated items. Made sure all my work was done before leaving. You also count down your on register"
good,A typical day at work on a Monday would be unpacking the truck and putting things up in the store. The job is not hard and the most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting people .
good,not a bad working enviroment although i was high riosk pregnancy at the time they refused me breaks then had to go on bed rest and they didnt approve of the bedrest due to short staffed so was forced to quit or get fired.
good,"I started as a Assistant Manager and was promoted to the Store Manager in a few short months. I worked in a very challenging area but I excelled, always up for a challenge. A customer even wrote a letter to my manager saying how great my customer service was. I work very well with the public."
good,"This company is open 7 days a week."
good,It was very disorganized but there was always something to be done. The job it self didnt really fit my life mainly the enviorment. The job didnt really pay great at all.
good,Family Dollar is a job more for a collage student or someone who is trying to supplement their income. other then that the work environment is a positive and friendly place to work.
good,"Working with a diverse group of employees, learning how to coexist with people from different cultures and back grounds. One of the hardest parts of the job was filling a management position as it became open and employees had to step up to fulfill a better and more demanding position.One of the most enjoyable parts of the job was making new friends, meeting new people and the satisfaction of a smile on a customer face as you assisted or helped them with their shopping experience."
good,"Very hard but successful days lots of work ,worked with great people ,management were hard working knowledgeable and great to work for.the hardest part of the job might be the location but we provided excellent customer service"
good,"Days were usual, all the same stock shelves money management close the store repeat"
good,"Management didn't speak English, the job was not in a good area , we use to get robbed and things took from us , I ended up quiting family Dollar due to our safety"
good,"As an assistant manager at family dollar a typical day went as such:"
good,"In my 6 years at FD I've learned about the retail world and the fast pace environment. It takes multiple teams and departments to make things happen and they make it happen. Working in the office, we also had multiple opportunities to work in stores."
good,The typical day at work was great. I have learned a lot from the company alone. Management wasn't to great they were young mined. There really wasn't a hard part to the job just wondering if the cashiers would come to work on time or not. The part I enjoyed the most about working at family dollar was becoming a supervisor and running a shift alone made me feel important.
good,"I always enjoyed going into work probably because I had a really great manager. I sadly moved out of the state so I wasn't with the company long. My store manager was awesome, as were my co-workers. Had couple issues with two male employees at the end of my career with FD but overall it was a great place to work. Fun to get to know some of the customers who would come in everyday & make conversation with them. Sometime instructions from DM were a little iffy & it kind of felt like we weren't as important as we were."
good,Fast paced environment trying to meet neighborhood needs at affordable prices.  The hardest part of the job is trying to meet the demands of the store while being minimally staffed.  Love being conveniently located and seeing familiar faces within tight knit communities.
good,"Working at Family Dollar Stores I opened and closed the store, hired and fired people, drug tested them and trained them for the job. Made bank deposits every morning , picked up change for the store . Schematics, change window signs, unloaded Truck every week put out stock. Payroll each week. Ins and out every Wednesday morning. Customer service , refund and exchanges. Recovered the store every day."
good,"opening  the store was boring slow i  was the only one there for 5 hours before my cashier arrived, when all employees were there we were and still are a family its nice to have that."
good,"Open Store, cash balance, floor displays, audit perishables, dialogue with other stores,changes on processes and procedures"
good,Was a steady flow of work coming in. Constant learning always happening in any role. Always ways to improve and ways to meet new people to help in your role. The best part of the job was the fast paced environment and the people I met through the company.
good,"The job itself was fine it was the employees that were really hard to deal with. I enjoy working with the customers, as well as getting to know other people."
good,"Every morning I will feel positive at work. The coworkers and I will always communicate make each other laugh, and work as team to the projects done. I learned how to use the register, how to do price match adds, avoid items a customer didn't want to purchase, just many unique strategies. If I did not understand how solve a problem on the register, my manager will always guide me. In my opinion I am very lucky to have a manager like her because she is always willing to help when a situation becomes complex. The hardest part for me when I first began, was getting familiar with merchandises. Yup, it was very scary, you had to remember the department number of the item, and follow the sku number and place them in their proper place. Other then that it became easier because I started to get more familiar with my products once restocked them. Finally, the most enjoyable times I will have at work is communicating with distinct customers, and coworkers. Plus they are always full of laughter."
good,"This was an awesome place to work , the upper management was awesome and really made you feel valued as their employee, If a problem arised the owner was always there to help ."
good,my co-coworkers and managers where fun to be around. A typical at work was facing shelves and running the register. The hardest part of the job would have been the days when I would have to unload the truck on my own.
good,"a typical day at family dollar, would be handling transitions with all customers, cleaning the store, stocking, customer relations."
good,"This was a very real experience. It may have to do with where the store was located. The customer experience was not pleasant. My co workers were nice people. I loved being in management. I helped our store manager see things more positively. The work was satisfying and I liked opening the store, counting the money, turn everything on and stocking."
good,Family Dollar is a job that require a lot of physical labor day to day.
good,I enjoyed working here. I didnt like the people but it was ok. thing need to get better
good,"I ran the cash register, put up stock from the company truck. Opened and closed the store. Always plenty of work to keep me busy."
good,A typicalwork day is very busy fast pace enviroment. Everyday I felt there was something new to learn. Its like a different way to learn
good,"Greeting customers with friendly smile, appearance is uniform required. maintain financial transaction daily. Stock merchandise. Ability to setup monthly sale display assist the manager on site. Team player and work individually with stock, the hardest part of the job is theft of merchandise. Enjoyed meeting and communicate with customers, and coworkers."
good,ring up customers   stock shelves   closing and opining procedures  help customers get what is needed
good,Managers are easy to get along with and are willing to help with professional and personal issues. I really like my co-workers they are for the most part like family. The hours here are great and we have sufficient vacation/personal time 
good,"I really enjoyed working there, management was really great. "
good,"Assist store manager with store operations, train customer service reps., bank deposits."
good,"The work load is not bad, the place stayed clean and maintained well, the crew is friendly, and the location of the place is not that great"
good,fast paced and excellent growth opputunity.A typical day is never the same every day.I learned time management and appopiate customer cervice skills.my co workers will say im always a joy to be around and can always make them smile.The hardest part of the job is working 15 hour shifts.The most enjoyable part of the job is customers coming back to let you know how much you were a big help.
good,"My everyday routine is making sure Family Dollar handled customers with great service. My responsibilities were taking care of weekly reports, filing papers, and managing employees during my shift. Great opportunity but looking for a chance to become a receptionist."
good,Amazing team at the location I worked at. Some locations not so friendly. This is not a company for weak minded people. Advancement options with hard hard work
good,"Management and loss prevention need extreme attention. lacking "
good,"It was nice, clean everyone got along very well no drama workplace. I knew the customers some people shopped there everyday. The Manager & my co-workers made it good stress free environment. Everyone knew their position."
good,"I walked in the door making way less than discussed with management, didn't get a raise until I had already applied for my second job and was ready to leave. Pretty good company when the store is properly staffed. Easily motivated by management, always store incentives. My store won a pizza party! Security inside the store helps improve shrink and helps employees feel safe. Family Dollar gets a bad rep because people think its easy to steal from. This company cares about employees, upper management sends emails and checks in with the team frequently to keep us on track. Truck comes once a week, mostly management putting it away. Easiest part of the job is audit and shift changes, safe counts most of the deposit for you. Hardest part is being in stores without a security guard. We were once robbed at gun point, Family Dollar responded quickly and officers inside the store were put into place afterward. That's the only reason I can't give more than 4 stars."
good,amazing work environment as well as great hard working people around you. A good company to grow with in the retail business. Also very flexible with your schedule.
good,I have Nothing to say i dont like the dm there he is rude and disrespectful they dont care about your safety at all they just care about is getting money
good,"Family Dollar is a good place to work, the stores arent in th ebest shape or the employees dont really care but its how you manage the place at the end of the day."
good,"Productive and enjoyable."
good,The easiest part of the job is stocking. I said that because you by yourself and you can get stuff done while you stocking and helping customers. I like individual work but i also like teamwork.
good,I like the environment but pay is not great they only have room for a few employees to get 40 hrs a week. So have to work nights and part time. I have a wonderful manager who makes it work environment great.
good,I was able to take 2 smoke breaks. It was fast paced most of the day because lines where so long. It was a little stressful because a lot of people had attitudes. I was getting paid minimum wage but overall the team members supervisor and manager where very wonderful.
good,It's very busy with theses stores sometimes to busy where as to you may find yourself working from open to close. Pay attention to your surroundings. Other than that I loved it.
good,A typical work day is about a 12 hour shift  for management which includes a lot of customer service and hands on. Not a lot of payroll so  most of the work falls on you. I learned how to better manage my time and treat top priorities first. The hardest part of the job is not having enough payroll to cover high traffic times.The most enjoyable part was the culture and the customers.
good,Kinda time consuming when you don't have a good team though. It showed me alot about running aND managing a store. knowing how to check vendors in and making sure shrink is good for cycle counts and inventory.
good,"I worked 10-14 hour shifts and also had very few off days due to being called in when other employees call out. I worked very hard there. I worked on cash register, stocked helves, and recovered the entire store most. I was only paid minimum wage."
good,a typical work day is basically recovery money management helping/greeting customers and making sure the cashiers are doing their share of the job also having all paper works done before the next shift starts. I learned more about responsibility and time management.
good,its a lot of work...its okay to work for... its just hard if you have a family because its like you married to you job...lol. there a lot of space to grow in the company.
good,You are definately productive and stay busy. very easy to learn definately not a job for lazy people jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjsssssssssssssssssssjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
good,"Working with family dollar helped me gain much experience. I love working in retail. Retail does have its pros and cons, but one main pro is being able to work with various of different people on a daily basis. Interacting with many customers on a daily basis. Working in retail environment gives you the ability to perform in any fast paced career."
good,I love interacting with the customers. I learned many things at this job.i learned how  to manage a whole store and team members and while everyone has a different opinion about everything we still made it a friendly environment to work in.
good,"I loved my job, got along with everyone , always treated with respect and I treated the people I worked with  the same"
good,"I enjoyed working at Family Dollar although there were some major issues. First, I would go in to open store at 7:00am and would not have another person to come assist me till 5:00pm.Policy and Procedures stated, cashiers could not leave the sight of the register and no eating anywhere except designated break room. So that left me with no breaks to eat or go to the restroom. Doing inventory on Sunday mornings was out of wack as well. I was to have inventory outs counted by 9:00am on Sunday morning, however could not start the count till that morning and I was to open at 8:00 am. The total store on a good day took 4 hours to do a complete accurate count. I learned how to set up displays and do complete resets. The hardest part of the job was stock was not put up in a timely manner during the week and the staff and I struggled to get it placed prior to Sundays out count. I only worked open to close on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The most enjoyable part was the team I worked with was dedicated to helping me place the merchandise. Our store went from a inspection score of 4 to a 9 within two months and I sales increased by 20% with in that same two months."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of greeting customers, running the cash register, and stocking the shelves in constant rotation."
good,"i worked at family dollar for about 2 years and i loved it ,i loved the customers the hours were great and they work with you the company overall was wonderful and atentive. but i was drawn away when i was threw under the bus to save the DMs job i was thrown into the managment position unwillingly when he exhusted all other options at 8 months pregnant i was working almost 65 hours a week because i didnt have an assistant manager at the store and the DM wouldnt let me hire one i was told i was just the holding manager until he found someone else which took them 4 months to find but overall i loved the place just not the higher managment"
good,"A typical day consist of doing daily notes. Working freight, all while handling customer service. I learned how to merchandise and get a lot done with little. The hardest part of the job is working in some of the bad neighborhoods. The most enjoyable part is dealing with the customer. Most of them are regulars."
good,"It's very time consuming,must work a minimum 52 hours. Usually closer to 65 70 per week, very very time consuming and not alot of time for family or a home life"
good,It is hard work but the benefits at the end of the day are more than worth it. This job is what kept me going from throwning freight to the customers.
good,"Honestly, I enjoyed every day at Family Dollar that I worked, the manager was like an Uncle and there was a family like vibe we had throughout the store. The part that made the job bad was the community itself. There was a lot of stealing which made the jb stressful on your part."
good,Manager was very rude and took forever to get tags. Not really a good experience for me. I was better off not being there. I don't really like my races boss
good,they where a great company I learned how to stock unload trucks the hardest part was unloading the truck I enjoyed dealing with the customers and the other team mebers
good,"I work to make ends meet, make my customers happy and stay up and moving its nothing like trying a new career field. The job was actually quite easy theres nothing much to learn at a dollar store."
good,I typical day at work could be tough but it always helped knowing that I was reaching my correct percentage. My management was wonderful they were always their to encourage me and tell me that if I believed in myself I could easily succeed with my job and even work my way higher as time when on. I think the hardest part about the job was the hours I was new to it but everyone was understanding and other employees were always great about giving advice to help me out. Then Id say the most enjoyable part of working their was knowing that in reaching the goals I had set for me made me feel better about myself and kind of like a pat on the back each week because I was not just for me it was for a whole team we were not a one person operation we were a team.
good,"I had to put together a store , it was very fast paced , it was pretty easy to learn. the managers were very helpful. It was a good environment."
good,"Had to work hard to do this job but at least your work was reconized and appreciated."
good,If there was enough pay I still be there. and employer came too work often.
good,"It was a place to come and eat. It was hands on and not very hard at all. We just had to be very nice to people and smile. I was in charge off keeping the floor under control and making sure the customers are satisfied. I also handled money and made trips to the bank and also managing payroll. "
good,"Work was always productive, yet very fun. It made me want to come back every day and excited to work. Though the manager was very rude to those who weren't her favorite. The first day I asked off, which was asked off before I was even hired, she tried to fire me. The other employees were absolute the best people I've ever met though."
good,Everyone was nice and helpful... A typical day at work was very easy going.
good,"I applied here looking for more challenging work and to gain managerial / customer service experience. It has been interesting to say the least. I did get the experience I was looking for, but the company has it's issues."
good,It was an ok PART-TIME job but not enough to make a living off of. The management at the location i worked was horrible everything was so unorganized and unprofessional.
good,This place had no security guards you often had to worry about getting robbed. It was a scary situation trying to close the store with no protection. Scary place to work at
good,Operated a fork lift.  very fast pace job. Good management and great work environment.  Good experience running a fork lift.
good,"its a good company but not a career job. i have been there for 7 months and is ready to leave."
good,an easy going loving simple day at work very kind people off on holidays
good,Family Dollar is a great place to work. Working here has taught me alot about working with people and greeting them. It is an outstading place to start gaining experience in customer service.
good,"A typical work day at Familly dollar consisted of me stocking the store, running the cash register and picking things up throughout the day. The culture for the work place was good but the hardest part of the job was the manager wouldnt give me more hours."
good,"Giving full time jobs to part time employees, never had time for anything but work, very competitive co-workers, lack management, never had same schedule."
good,while working here the store was unorganized and under staffed it was the most stressful job. I had to clean up and pick up behind the store manager daily. there is never any change for the store in the safe. theft is the highest here of all store and the DM is rude errogant and unreliable
good,"They’re friendly and nice and sometimes that’s a good thing sometimes it’s not. But I didn’t enjoy it, I didn’t like the fact the the schedule was never posted until the day before, not a very professional environment."
good,It's a overall good place to work just don't pay enough. You learn how to unload trucks and do mark downs and stuck selves. The people are very cool the managers suck
good,My experience was fine met alot of people. It was an exciting experience to be able to work with the customers and learn new things. It was definitely a learning experience.
good,You have to work more hours then I wanted. The Manager was a thief. Corporation doesn't care about the little store workers. I was very unhappy at this job
good,depending on the store mgt. your work day could be great. mine wasnt. she always took advantage of me. always talked down on everything i did. mind you i did as much if not more hours than her.
good,"The location was not the best but I certainly appreciated my time there, the experiences I learned from and don't regret my time spent there."
good,I enjoyed my job but my work ethics and the managers work ethics cause conflict and we was unable to resolve the issue. I learned that hard work does pay off and you can always learn something new everyday.
good,Learn to never give up on a job. Job was hard to get store open but never gave up. I stay in there with the job until it was over.
good,"Family dollar was a great place to work I enjoyed the customers and co workers. The hours were not consistent, the pay was low. My boss was very rude and unproffesional"
good,The company is pretty good. Customers are awesome and the relationships and bonds are unforgettable. Flexible scheduling. It's a decent part time job.
good,I love the company because it’s an active job they don’t have very good family leave and you work a lot of nights after it was bought out by dollar tree it’s not so great
good,Its a great place to work but u work extremely hard for 8 dollars it really depends on your manager and the staff we are like family the job it self is alot but the cashier is easy the stocking and unloading the truck is tireing
good,"Typical day at work is very hard with not enough help. It consist of stocking shelves while trying to ring up customers. I learned that you can work hard for little pay. My managers at the store were great but the regional manger she promised me a position and when I started working at the store every thing change. She told me I had to be there for 6 months, when I knew for a fact that people were hired at other Family Dollars for at least 2 months and was in manager position.  The hardest part of the job was that it kept me away from a lot.  I had to work a lot of night hours and on Sundays. Before I was hired I told them I go to church on Sunday would that be a problem they told me no. It was the truth. I worked just about every Sunday until I got tired of it.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I met new faces, enjoyed the customers."
good,"I see something different every da. I feel that family does not give the stores enough hours and they expect for two people who work in a very busy store to put up freight, provide customer service and watch for shop lifters, which is bad in my area."
good,Family dollar was a great place to work it all just depends on managment not a hard place to get comfortable have to be patient because alot of people that come in are not easy
good,"It’s good place to start if you don’t have any experience since you will be getting taught how to manage your time , operate a cashier, and stock items."
good,"Family dollar is a great place to work if you are a student or single, however they do not offer enough pay or hours to financially take care of a growing family."
good,When I first started working at family dollar. I would have 40 hrs a week. After a few my manager hours got cute. So I went to working 10 to 15 hours a week.
good,Worked many nights for long period of time. Job recommended for someone that doesn't have children if working nights. I think a raise would be considered
good,"My typical day consist of greeting customers and stocking up the selves and recovering, making sure all products are neatly organized.  I learn new things everyday, the store is full of different types of culture with different personalities.  The hardest part of my job is making people happy."
good,The hardest part of the day is when we be very busy and suppose to be customers walk out the store with merchandise and it it only be one register open.
good,"Its just like any other job, you have your good days and your bad days. They management does not care about their employees. Nothing else to say about family dollar would like to be back in the CNA field."
good,To much work for the stockers. I feel they should be paid more. I feel that everyone should have to stock..  I also hate that there is a a CD that stays on repeat.
good,"Family dollar is a good company as a whole, and the management team super! I spent a lot of time there and learned a lot as well. The hardest part of the job I would perfer not to speak on however, for some its a wonderful company to work for more then others and again they have some awesome leaders. The most enjoyable part for me was meeting new people."
good,"I am a current employee who seems to be working in a workplace where favoritism plays a key in your happiness. If you do not kiss up to management, they will turn their back on you."
good,Manager sometimes flexible with schedule. Enjoyable customers.
good,"setting up cams and stocking shelves, talking to customers, I learned to set up cams and use the scanner so as to know where things belong. I had one co worker that I worked the best with the other two and I got along but really going miss the one. The hardest part of the job was putting things on shelves and knowing when a customer was ready ... The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers!!!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working the cash register, helping customers on the floor, unloading new freight, stocking the shelves whenever new shipments would come in, and helping to clean up at the end of each day.  "
good,"Pay wasn't satisfactory. Management was unreasonable, work space was limited, resources were sparse."
good,"I didn't mind working there, but after my medical leave I was treated awful, my manager was down right rude to me and wouldn't give me any slack after having extreme ankle surgery. My co workers were amazing, but there was always a bad apple. And the most enjoyable part of my job was getting close with the people I worked with."
good,I loved this job it was a chance to leave the job I had in manning to get a job closer to home.
good,"I would have a challenging day & I loved it. I learned how to handle my employee's & work load better. Being a manager & learning my people & seeing how other managers treated the employees made me a better person in alot of ways. All of my co-workers really enjoyed working with me & I never had any probles with any one doing what they were asked to do,because we all worked as a team.The hardest part of my job was working with a manager who did'nt no how to treat,talk,or respect others, employees or customers & always got away with it.I loved everything about my jobs just not working with disrespectful people."
good,"The management is not worried about the store having enough employees to complete work as needed. The employees will work 12 to 13 hours a day, 2 to 3 times a week and sometimes more. They do not pay their employees enough to keep them. Their scheduling is based on a budget for the week, so depending on the amount of the budget will determine the amount of hours you work."
good,"typical work day at family dolllar is crowded . there is not much to learned from that store . Management was lazy , co-workers were lazy . the hardest part was the truck . the most enjooyable part was not being there"
good,Family Dollar goes through a lot of people that is why they are constantly looking.
good,My store never closes but as long as you work hard you will have a chance to make decent money and maintain a  successful career and make a new work family.
good,"There were times where it was hard to work, due to the fact that there was little to no support from upper management. Most of the time the work was or had to be completed by one person with a small hand of employees."
good,"While working there i really never had a problem with any of the employees, except for one stocker that was theManager best friend, me as an assistant manager it would get me mad that this lady would want to tell me what to do"
good,"It was very fast paced , always had something to do. Management when I was there was not very good. very rude and short with employees. the environment was nice the employees all were very nice"
good,You sign in at the register and count petty cash.  You greet customers at the door and answer questions about merchandise.  Once a week you unload truck and put merchandise on the shelf. I did a lot of cashiering.
good,"A typical work day was okay"
good,"This is a good job. It would be awesome if they paid a bit more!               "
good,I would run the cash register and handle cash. I got to work directly with people. I learned to use the computerized cash register and do nightly reports. I was hired as full time and promised a chance in advancement to management but they never would work us full time hours.I liked the job but it wasnt enough to live on.
good,"And very fast-paced job, Very steady depending on what you made out of it.  Get the opportunity to meet new customers. Get to learn how to multitask use in the cashier and greeting customers."
good,Not a place for me to work. They dont pay any good money. Management all did drugs and was never on the job. Or they would be sleeping in stock room. Not a good place
good,Work was work. That location just needs more security especially at night. Management was good. The culture was relaxed and have a nice feel. It was a nice place to work for the time being.
good,I applied at Family Dollar with great excitement. After being on the job with this corporation it was a great disappointment. Schedule changed on a daily basis. Cashiers do not obtain any benefits nor do they get hours as management does. Management walked around acting like they were facing products but were actually on the phone. Other than the Main manager and one assistant manager the other managers have a bad attitude and would always show up late. Lack of discipline to employess
good,NA some task are great. It's an ideal company to work for. Good with handling the business. Customer friendly. Delivery is hands on from truck to store to sales floor
good,"the manager before all the employee got laid off was great ad the people we worked with also, the bad thing was you had to stop theft but with out putting your self in danger"
good,"Great staff just not enough of a challenge and not enough pay."
good,Great first job for a highschoolstudent you move up extremely fast you learn something new everyday hardest part is they don't care about your life outside of work they don't care if you have kids they make you work every holiday and let the ones who don't have kids have the holidays off
good,Stocking and unloading the truck. Taking care of the customers and there needs to reinsure that whatever the customers needs that we have it stock ready fir them to buy.
good,"The family dollar i worked at did not stay clean no matter how many times we cleaned it, my experience started off as fun when i would get more than 30 hours a week but when they started gettin new managers the store went downhill it started not getting cleaned and cutting hours."
good,If they had a manager that worked instead of setting outside and smoking and taking other employees drinking at the bar after hours the store in St Johns would still be open. District Manager was great we could work together and get store stocked
good,I like working for family Dollar I would just like better pay and to be up under better management but I do enjoy working for family Dollar and enjoy doing my task
good,Mostly stocked merchandise and unloaded trucks. The store I was working at needed better management. A lot of people stopped coming in which made it harder on everyone else
good,"A typical day at work may have been hectic earlier in the day."
good,It's very easy to catch on to the system to be able to ring up customers the process to get hired took a long time in my perspective the hardest part of the job was dealing with the customer that wanted to be disrespectful to you and call you out your name the most enjoyable part is when a customer compliment you on how well you took care of there store experience I loved the fact that they appreciate the good service I provided
good,"Loved my coworkers and district manager but the Store Manager was absurd. Always talking on the phone while assisting costumers, not correct hygene. But other than that it was great"
good,"Is looking for supplemental income. That's all family dollar offers cashiers. No benefits... management has been through several teams at this particular location... so management sucks. Don't let the DM be around when she screws up cause she blames it on you.  Not a good job, you can tell by how long she keeps employees (2 months at best)"
good,when i first started in January and when i left in august i had already gone thru four mangers.  i enjoy the job flexible hours. i became pregnant and couldn't stand on my feet for long periods of time
good,Learned how to map the floor plan to set up a full store. From placing shelfs to truck shipments.Family Dollar overall great experience with assigning and setting up a store with a team.
good,"Good place to work no benefits. "
good,It depends on your management team. And it depends on their boss the DM. If you do not have a good DMX then you will not have have a fun management team. Therefore the employees are not going to do a good job. Then the store will have constant turnovers and the store will not look good.
good,A typical day at work was most of the time the same but that store was going though alot of changes like three different managers in a time of six months or less.  the other job i did for Family Dollar was great but it was temporary.
good,"It was okay. Wasn't the best but it paid well. Long hours, 12+ hours a day from Monday to Friday and sometimes worked on Saturdays. Had to lift 100+ pounds boxes over my head."
good,I enjoyed this job but the benefits weren't as great as I was hoping for someones supporting a family on one income. Made it to assistant manager ok but it became very monotonous with no room for getting a raise or advancing in any way. I also had to do a lot of grunt work when everyone else would call out and unloaded the trucks every week it took a toll on me.
good,Eh I don't really have anything to say so I'll just keep typing until it says that I have the correct amount of words. Blah blah blah.
good,I liked working there the managers were very great to me and taught me a lot and it was my very first job and I liked going to work everyday just because the employees I worked with until the night we were robbed that scared me to death.
good,A typical day at work is about 10 hours. pricing product and stocking shelves. assisting customers and providing the best customer service you can provide. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time for your family. the most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team of coworkers and providing a fun place to work.
good,Whether i was closing or opening depended on how the day worked out. But for the most part I worked with at least one more individual at a time we counted the money daily and handled customers al day. The down side of the job was liitle room to advance the most enjoybale part was being able to intercat with customers.
good,"Good place to work , needs a better manager , needs to pay more they employers andd give more hours and benefits"
good,"-Days are pretty long filled with wonderful customers who come in all sorts of good and active moods."
good,working at family dollar really showed me a fast paced company to work for. You are always resetting the store. I done alot of resets for all the seasonal stuff. You were always busy. The hardest part was getting everything set and moved in the short amount of time the give you.
good,"Managed the daily operations to include but not limited to: Banking, Staffing. I learned how to manage staff an my self. mY Co-workers wear great, the hardest part of my job was people stealing from the store. The most enjoyable time was the people i started work with."
good,customers coming in are very friendly and nice. company is good about working with you on days off or unexpected health issues. Management is not trustworthy and there is a lack of communication in the store. 
good,A typical workday was just checking out customers and stocking merchandise. I learned how to treat customers and run a cash register. Management was good. I loved my manager. She was very laid back. My coworkers were awesome. There was no hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the regular customers that I grew friendships with.
good,"it was a great job but the company ran the business not to well. i would work for 7am to 9or 10pm with out a break. & had to clean a store by myself by 9. i was very loyal with the company. they didnt treat there employees professionally.the customers where some what not happy because they wouldnt let us open more lines.i believe that they should give more benefits. and also the hardest part of the job was trying to run the registers & do truck days being the only manager on shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is The customers , if they are happy , that made me happy."
good,"Stingy. As even an ASM they don't want you to get over 40 hours. Complain about paying OT after 40. There is no over 8 hour rule. They constantly tell you what your not doing right. Even if you have taken place to excel where prior mngmt lacked. Our store has excelled from prior mngmt yet still complaints. No raises. Complete lack of work life balance or appreciation. Want you to work more than e/o weekend because they have specific rules of only 3 ASM including the SM so 3 people does not equal an every other weekend shift.  Even if their are people who want the job. They don't care."
good,Doing cutting and stocking and they would work me  6 days a week when i is was there  and management would constantly  change  and  they expect alot out of you all the time
good,its a nice place to work the customers are awesme but the company doesnt wanna pay you very well they are mainly just focuesd on money and sales and nothing else
good,"Family Dollar shows NO care about their employees when it comes to holidays"
good,"The store manager was extremely unprofessional.  He was rarely at work and all of his responsibility was placed on the assistants.  He would receive bonus and would not share it. He didn't deserve the bonus. It should have been split up amongst the ASM's. The District Manager knew of all the store issues with the manager and he did nothing about it, no matter of the complaints made against the store manaager."
good,"FAMILY DOLLAR is  great company to work for ."
good,"When hired I had a schedule I needed to accommodate my kids, this was never follow, and I was scheduled to work all holidays and kept at minimal hours (15-20 a week)."
good,The days were long and you often had to open the store alone. With a smaller store it was expected although you did get another associate to close with. The company didn't allow enough payroll to accommodate for fully staffed days.
good,Family dollar was a part time  job. One that i will not like to ever have again. They need to care more about their employees. They wanted you to put your life in harms way for detergent and get upset when you don't chase stealing fighting customers. Need better security.
good,"typical days were filled with unloading u boats of merchandise while maintaining register as well attending to any customer service needs of individuals,finishing the night with counting cigarette case and counting out registers by hand."
good,"Pretty typical cashier job, easy to learn. You will have to do most of the stocking as well and cleaning at the end of your shift. Not bad for a temporary job."
good,I thought it was a nice place to work. The work in conditions was terrible. We have no updated tool to work with. The rollers we used for truck load was broken.
good,"I really enjoy being a manager, but there is not work/life balance. You have to give up some freedom. My superiors are not into communicating. A lot of things I had to learn on my own."
good,"need to have better security for employees "
good,Two years plus no raise.    Lots to do for one person. Cashiering stocking shelf’s cleaning facing products setting end caps  I do my best I feel. Rearranging products.
good,Horrible store manager at the time. Altogether fine workplace fun to work at and a great place to meet new people. Worked around the schedule you needed and very helpful .
good,When I worked at this particular Family Dollar there was different management. I still shop there and they have terminated the manager I worked for so the environment is a little better. I can't give exact details because I have not worked for the current management.
good,"I love working at this job, the work was easy and cool. The one thing that did it for me was the ignorant store manager at this location. He does not do anything,he makes everyone do the stuff that he is supposed to do and then there is no appreciation."
good,There was always plenty of work to do.  I tried to keep the store clean and welcome all customers.  We always had great prices and discounts for customers to consider.
good,"Family Dollar wasn't a bad job at all. I had lots of previous cashier experience, so the job was like a piece of cake. Some of the days when we got the truck were a tad demanding but nothing unobtainable. Not too much to complain about other than the fact that they randomly cut my hours in half."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Family Dollar, mostly working the register, interacting with customers, answering customer questions, keeping the front end of the store clean and neat, keeping merchandise in the correct place."
good,"A typical day at Family Dollar is a fun, productive, and enjoyable day. Great customers, great workers and learning new business management everyday. This is a great job for a high school student."
good,"The company could give cashier more hours and better pay, and not convert over to bi-weekly pay. Cashiers should get at least 25 hours per week, and should be paid at least $9. I also think that I myself keep getting looked over as trying to become assistant manager. I’ve had proper training I know how to open and close, how to unload the truck and put out the freight. But everything I do gets looked over. Other than that it’s a pretty good place to work."
good,"Customers are rude, upper management  such as corporate always on you about what's not done instead of praising you on what's done . Sum teams were broken so at times hard to what needed done done"
good,"At Family Dollar from open to close and be a very busy day. My position as a Assistance Manager is very important. Stocking, unloading the truck and counting inventory. Managing a small group of employees. Cashiering through breaks and making two trips a day to bank to deposit money. Keeping the store clean and organized while opening/ closing store 4 days a week. Solving customer and/or employees problems daily leaving everyone satisfied."
good,"Family dollar was my life and my family, like any other retail company hire turn over rate is extremely high. We had to have code words in case of a robbery. This company care little about their employees safety! I loved working with the public, but i couldn't continue to work for a company that don't appreciate the safety of their employees.... SORRY"
good,"A typical day for was always busy open from 8am-10pm ,unloading trucks stocking make sure Employee are safe and ready to work creating friendly enviroment,At work i learn only your best alone is good enough."
good,"Busy Days, Nothing is hard about the job. just need dedication. Only thing is, they're security system isn't good for the type of area the store is in."
good,Very fast paced job.management could be better.customers are a very important to family dollar. Easy to be promoted but there is a really high turnover for emplyees..its hard work but its not rocket scientists stuff.the environment is wat u make it. I would highly recommend any young out going person to apply here.
good,"Needs to work on professionalism"
good,A great place to work if you are in school but far as a career the pay is not good enough. A typical day depends on how busy the place is. in down time you can get a lot of stocking down and/or recovery done .
good,I do not recommend this job to any . There is a lack of managers they don't care about their store . So junky and there is always someone new standing at the register . I just don't like it.
good,I loved my job there just didn't get many hours and I was a hard worker. I never called in and was always on time. l loved everybody I worked with and enjoyed talking to the customers.
good,"hands on job, active manager on floor.  not enough in the budget to schedule more help to help manager and keep on task.  very busy store, which had potential for bonus opportunities"
good,"A typical day at work would be running the cash register ,stalking the shelves with the items that needed to be replenished, picking up the items along the aisles that weren't in the right places I had to deal with sassy customers on a daily and hourly basis. I met some good ones and some bad ones but you have to stay positive. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet all day long on the concrete and also the slow software they had when it come to my cash register and cashing out my drawer and also the holidays really horrible too because it was so busy but overall it was a okay job...."
good,"I loved working there. The customer's enjoyed my outgoing personality. I was always cheerful, always smiling, and always cared about the customers. I listened to there problems when they had one and helped solve bad situations. I had wonderful Co-Workers."
good,it was a great experience to work here because I learned how to handle lots of people in a way that I never thought I would be able to. I would be able to utilize these skills and I used them in so many different retail stores. I know this skill will work out for me in the future.
good,"need to have more payroll for the stores to help complete work and for asset protection. Company does pay their managers very well, Good company to work for."
good,Family Dollar company has no work ethics within their company. there is no job security with this company. you get blamed for other peoples action and possibly terminated for things that have absolutely nothing to do with you.
good,Working at family dollar can be a career dream if you are under a management system that follows company policies however my experience sucked I was responsible for job tasks I wasn't responsible or trained for
good,most enjoyable day the customers they were nice and knowing everybody that came in to the store was a plus the hardest days at family dollar is the customers some of them can be having a bad day you just have to know how to deal with them on those days
good,Lot's of work to redo a store that was down. Customer service is a must. Good job just not a good company to work for
good,"Working for Family Dollar is not a job for the feint of heart. It is a hard, physical job. It requires extreme multi-tasking with minimal assistance due to payroll budget restrictions."
good,Working at family dollar was a somewhat fun experience for me but it has its days. Some of the customers are really nice and will have conversations with you. One thing that I didn't like was when the line was long at the cash register there wasn't much help there was only one other register but that didn't necessarily mean that you could get the assistant manager or manager to come to the register right away. Also almost everyday someone or a couple people would come in the store and steal things regardless if they had a security tag on them or not.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was working with my employees to accomplish a common goal. The worst was the lack of training and hectic holiday seasons.
good,Regular Day as any other job. Management had difficulty running stores because of cuts. Over worked and under paid. High turn-over rate. Fair share of robberies.
good,"New DM came in and I lost my job.  I loved this job, something crazy happened and the new DM left me go, without explanation. Working for this company was a bit overwhelming at times, I would work 80 hrs a week because of lack of staffing. And I felt if I wasn't there, the store wouldn't be perfect. So I had no life outside of Family Dollar."
good,"I arrive at work depending on my scheduled shift prepare my work station. receive my register and begin counting down my drawer to be sure the amount is correct before I start. I then check my to-do-list my manager left for the next arriving shift. while the store is down on business I multi-task starting on my next task at hand. due this being a new store and location I educate my self on departments and merchandise. while doing so I am in the process of completing a task for unloading/stocking merchandise. the head manager that hired me was great to work with, however, I honestly had difficulties with the shift manager. after talking to my general manager the issues was quickly resolved. working with my co-workers was a great experience. we worked hard as a team to be top notch team members. we all took turn being empowered if we felt the need to step up and our manager was either busy or not at the location during the time needed."
good,"A typical work day was stocking shelves and Cashiering."
good,It was very boring at times. My manager was always telling me I was never doing anything right when in reality I was. I was always stocking the shelves when we ran out of product. I was always recovering the store. Moving products forward.
good,"During my employment at Family Dollar I experienced my fellow co workers understanding of the fact that I was new to the job. They were all very patient and willing to help me along the way if I had a question about a price or a function on the cash register. They would also show me where certain items went on shelves when I was unloading boxes and stocking the shelves. "
good,There is A lot to be learned daily at Family Dollar. You never know what to expect from day to day. The hardest part of the job is that know one takes there job the way they should.
good,Family Dollar is a difficult work space because there is a requirement of a heavy workload for only two employees (manager and cashier) on the floor for each shift. This workload can be overwhelming depending on your store's flow of customers. There are no real benefits other than close relationships with co-workers and gaining experience in different areas.
good,Great job loved  the customers and some employees but manger was not professional nor co-workers. Not very flexible or fair.
good,Would have to greet every customer that entered and left the store. Its wasn't the best only one cashier at a time. Had to stock merchandise while still helping customer checkout and or find what they need.
good,great place to work if your just gettin out of high school or are still in highschool the work is easy and you meet all kinds of different people.
good,As a cashier your time passes by so fast. I would say my favorite part about my job was the customers. Even the ones who gave me a hard time. I was able to learn self control and how to speak to people who was having a bad day.
good,"Working at Family Dollar was different than any other job I've had. After working there for a while I got promoted, but I never got my pay raise I ended up leaving the job because of it. My manager at the time did not even seem concern about giving me my raise,"
good,"a days work includes greeting each guest as they walk through the door. Assist customers with merchandise for sales, refunds and or exchanges. Assist with stocking of shelves for new merchandise."
good,i trannsfered out of security because of the boos there at the time
good,"I really enjoyed working with customers at the Family Dollar. I enjoy being around people and helping people find what they need. The job itself wasn't difficult, and I tried to get as many hours as possible, because I didn't mind coming in to work. The only con to this job that I can honestly say, is the manager of the store. The Assistant managers were productive with criticism and made sure I got what was needed done. The main manager, was not so kind."
good,"Family dollar was a nice stepping stone for high school and college students , but career wise it was not a stable environment, and in my experiences upper management showed little concern for sales associates concerns and worries."
good,"A typical day at work with my previous boss was fun, exhilarating and unpredictable. It was a friendly space to work. I learned so much about the different techniques of stocking shelves, unloading trucks, and even greeting customers. The management when I was hired was great. About 4 months down the road, we get new management hired from within the store. My co-workers and I weren't thrilled about it, but it made us closer as a family. The hardest part of the job was the supervisor. She was the reason I decided not to continue working there. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to listen to music while stocking shelves. It was a rhythm I could not be shaken of. Truly, one of my favorite jobs."
good,"It was hard to get people to stay because they didn't have enough payroll available. If you asked questions on why something was done it was frowned on. There was way to much over stock so to get rid of it I was allowed to be creative in marketing, but only on weekends. They liked the extra revenue but didn't care to learn how. The pay scale wasn't enough for the hours put in. I was required to do associate/assistant manager/manager/stock positions daily. Open to close 6 days a week, never sitting down unless to stock a low shelf. The co worker I had was a nice person but didn't appreciate me till I left for more money and respect."
good,I thought family dollar was fun yet professional place to work but I thought management was sorely lacking unprofessional and they did not set the example for good workmanship
good,"If you are looking for something temporary, this is a great place to work. If you have something else that you are trying to do career wise, go for that. I learned some great things while I did work there."
good,"Being in a small town it definately keeps you busy, but most customers have no respect for you or the property. Despite countless attempts at keeping the store clean, it's always messy when I return."
good,Its a good job. Not hard at all. I had a bad experience because of management. Having favorite employees. Like i said its an easy job its just the manager thats gonna make it a good or bad experience
good,I enjoyed my time with Family Dollar. I met alot of great People. Only thing is the hours they are very strict about them and were not 40 hours a week. I learned alot about running a store selected merchandise inventories and store orders as well as schematics and computer work.
good,The job itself wasn't bad but the manager was horrible she had her employees doing their job plus hers and she would always be on her phone or smoking a cigarette outside or even leaving the store randomly.
good,"Working for family dollar Corporate was a great learning experience. Several opportunities available, training and coaching was always a plus when applying for different positions"
good,"Good support from Management. Terrific experience over-all .A more experienced Manager would've been 10x more successful. "
good,You must be prepared to work and be a team member. There is room for advancing if you're a leader and have great customer service experience. Your going to be required to dress according to the company's policy.
good,The job is kind of stressful..there is alot of things to know..theres alot going on all the time there..its not very organized...im unable to work the hours that i want
good,"Really liked working there but upper management didn't or couldn't understand why people with children couldn't just work whenever or wherever. "
good,working for family dollar for 1 year with no raise and only a part time pistion. I was looking for more of any oppertinity to advance in the company. I needed more money
good,"Good work force, nice team members. Managers are nice easy work work but you got to be willing to work.  The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck every monday"
good,"It was a great job wished I could have stayed but things changed with new manager & the ways he wanted things done weren’t really the way we was thought to do so, he wanted things done his way even if they weren’t by the book.(regular procedures that must be followed)"
good,I enjoyed working there. People were friendly. Always busy and fast paced. With any company there are some small downfalls. Good benefits if you are full time.
good,A typical workday at family Dollar is fast pace with no breaks or lunch breaks. The store manager gives task that can't be completed in a day and threatens right ups if not completed. There is no consistent work schedule.. As assistant manager you have to work weekends and all holidays. There is no time for your personal life with Family.
good,Hiring manager shouldn’t have held the position she was given. Expected employees to unload and put away truck in a timely manner. Constantly talked about employees and customers.
good,"My boss and coworkers at Family Dollar where awesome but the store was located in a bad neighborhood."
good,"At my location robberies are a daily thing, the security is off two days and those days are extremely dangerous. I am understaffed daily, lucky to get 3 employees in the afternoon where in the morning there are 7 to 11 employees."
good,"Managers are not given enough hrs to get jobs done, management have too many hrs working alone and corporate expects truck of 589 pieces to be done in about 39 hrs and of that 18 hrs mgr or asm is by themselves waiting on customers and vendors and 4 more hrs mgr and asm due to lunches and breaks so actually corp saying that size truck should be done in 17 hrs which is nonsense, them schematics change at least 3 times per section not counting seasonal and holiday areas, mgr no control over stock because corp. orders what they want for the store whether needed or not"
good,"I like working at Family Dollar I think it's a very good company. The management not so well. I feel that they also need security, There was always incidents with theft and really loud and obnoxious customers."
good,At my store I have a manager that has no clue what she is doing and always calling the DM  for help. The DM  is always at our store because she leaves five minutes away from our store.
good,"Benifit options are available but expensive for pretty bad coverage. Little to know advancement opportunities, but consistent work and ok pay. Bi weekly paycheck, no discounts, paid days off only for managers, 2-4 yearly."
good,"Quick-paced work environment."
good,"I started off loving this job but it seem after I can back from vacation I was being accuse of many things and started to notice supervisor taking advantage of a new learner. I repeatedly felt unheard, uncomfortable and unsafe and has expressed this to the company multiple time but get ignored"
good,"If you are looking for a fast paced, physical job, this is the place. Neatness and the ability to work independently are a definite must. There are advancement opportunities into management, with the ability to become the store manager of your own location if the position becomes available in an area that you choose."
good,"It was a family , friendly atmosphere . Customers were great . It was a great learning experience for me especially after going back to work for the first time in 10 years ."
good,I worked at atleast 3 different places or stores it was a lot of hours no recognition was hard to enjoy it when u had no real  leadership or set up for success
good,It's typical retail you stock shelves and wait on customers while keeping everything neat and clean in the process the most stressful time is when truck is delivered and you have to work at a quick pace to get it all put away
good,"I started out loving my job, and everyone I worked with. However, my manager had trust issues from past past employees, so as her assistant, it made my job unbearable. As a whole, the company was physically and mentally challenging, but overall, if you have a good team, it is a great job."
good,"It was a fum, fast paced job. I loved it. I loved my repeat customers and really getting to know them. My manager was constantly letting another employee slide when he got caught doing stuff he wasn't supposed to."
good,It was a good job until they hired a bad District Manager. She did not work well with her Managers. If you needed her to approve of anything she didn't. When visiting the store she was more interested in going to the salon next door then doing her job. I had some of my customers ask me who she was and if she was a hooker.
good,This was a nice job i actually liked it but the only thing was they get robbed too much it’s a risk of putting my life in danger real bad safety hazard. Wish they did better with  security for family dollars locations
good,"Good place to work. Accommodating to Disability."
good,I was working their shortly because of the pay and not getting enough hours and I had two kids to take care of and did most of the work there I was a hard worker and a go to person for my boss
good,"As a team member, you must be alert and attentive for shoplifters and criminal acts while providing excellent customer service. The must difficult part of the job is maintaining loss prevention."
good,"My store 11750 is great. Not in a great area. Manager is very flexible with my schedule. Co-workers are great. Very busy at times also slow as well. Great company to have as a part time. Hours are decent, pay is ok."
good,I loved working at Family Dollar. I would have stayed if hours weren't cut to where i couldn't afford day care. The manager is a sketchy man and I was a little scared of him.
good,"Slow paced and relaxed. Easy going place with good people to work with. Higher ups could be better. High on theft in the area, needs better ways of security."
good,Laid back sometimes. If busy can become a lil tiring. Have to deal with the homeless and sometimes drunks. Every now and then we get some very violent customers but other than that every one us nice.
good,When I started working I was pregnant. We were doing a new store setup and the transfer everything from the old store over it was only a job for a month or 2 . I wasn’t guaranteed a job right there but I was able to apply at any other location if I wanted.
good,The reason there is a lot of stress in the workplace is simply because it is located in a poverty stricken area.  Where there is poverty there is usually violence close by.
good,"I was the only person working double and working every weekend.  I worked hard and did everything I was supposed to, and used for it. Once I asked for a transfer I was lied on so I couldn’t get transferred."
good,"My favorable moment when working there, is when truck days come and my staff completes the door to shelf program within 2 1/2 days tops. My worsts moment is when I go outside and tells the homeless people to stop walking up on customers begging."
good,"It is an ok job to work with. Some of the managers aren't what you would expect, but then again there are some that'll make sure you enjoy your time at work."
good,"You have to be able to multi task and be able to work in a fast paced environment, with multiple personality types. Be able to handle customer service and stock at the same time."
good,must have a lot of patience. must be able to stand for a long time. employees can be hard on you and expect more from you then you think. overall its a fun experience.
good,ok place to work if you want to make minimum wage as a store manager the pay is decent but be prepared to get worked to the bone and if your district manager gets replaced so will you no matter how great of a worker you are
good,"I enjoy working at Family dollar. My coworkers make you feel welcome in to the store. A day at work is always interesting, you never know who you gonna meet. You also have your regulars (people that most commonly visit the store regularly) and your random Customers that just stop due to the location of the store."
good,Everyday at family dollar we have great prices and differ items for everyone. I give great customer to make sure the customer feels good and satisfied
good,Good work experience anyone who decides to work here has to know how to work well with different types of customers.......................................
good,Could be very busy filled with store related activities such as merchandise resets or just busy with customers and serving them. Sometimes the management was hard to understand. But overall I really enjoyed the experience.
good,I had a great relationship with my manager and coworker. We were all respectful to one another. The location wasn't safe because we didn't have security but other than that I learned from one another.
good,"Love this store, wish I worked with better people. Loved the customers and my job. Customer service is a good job field but only for the right person."
good,No work balance... calling you in on your day off. no life outside the store. I had to work double all the time and when you try to take a day off your DM does an audit in your store and expects you to come in
good,Family Dollar is a wonderful place to work. Excellent benefits and pay. Great opportunity for advancement within the company. Job just needs security.
good,"I absolutely LOVED my job at Family Dollar, but the pay very not worth the trouble you had to face as an Assistant Store Manager. I loved my crew and when I worked we was always the busiest. This was the best teamwork experience I have ever had. I love being able to manage a great team and driving others to do their jobs. I had so many customers upset that I was leaving, but they definitely followed me to Walmart because of my excellent customer service."
good,"this was my first ever job. so i was ready and willing to give everything i can to show them i am here to give it 110 percent. working at one of the highest grossing stores in the district. i had to get on it fast. at first i was little slow working with the pace but overtime i got right in the flow of things. as a stocker, we unloaded trucks on weds. whether is was raining or snowing.. we got 1200-1600 pieces of frieght unloaded in 3-4 hours. as a cashier, i didnt like because i dont like dealing with money but i did it because of my job but the customers absolutely loved me and that what made my job easy."
good,"this place was ok place to work but not enough hours so had to look for another job. manager was a delight to work for, she tried to get me more hours but could not."
good,"i increased my costumer service skills.the most enjoyable part was able to work with the assistant manager and learn everything.a typical day at work cash out the costumers, stock shelves,do re-shops, recover the store, clean the counters and floors."
good,"An all around decent place to work. Work tasks are explained thoroughly and expectations are maintainable. Some management are questionable but most are well rounded, experienced people."
good,"work as a sails associate,i learned how to communicate with people.the managers were good but my co-workers weren't  because they didn't take the job serious.i didn't like unloading the merchandise but i loved communicate with the costumers."
good,"I love my customers a lot. I like to help people. I'm very energetic, positive attitude, always with a great smile. Being an customer service representative I have to  Deal with a lot of customers at once, Stocking, cleaning, cashier, receiving delivers, and also caring for the customers wants and needs and make sure they are very satisfied."
good,"I was hired on as a temp so we moved around to help build the .stores, walked in to empty building and started from there"
good,"there was always a lot of work stocking, customers always staying busy. i learned how to deal with all the theft going on in the store. management was good about something but the need to take control of there store. unloading the trucks with just two people."
good,"It's an easy job but a lot of work. You have to wait on customers and try and put up items. Love all my coworkers but I wish it wasn't so much to do. I understand that the managers be busy stocking themselves sometime, just dislike how customers get mad just because I can't get help with the line. Lol that was months ago, its nothing new to me anymore. I'm over it. The one thing I really hate is not getting benefits at all."
good,"i was with this company for more than 4 i had learned a lot , at this point i'm ready to put my knowledge in my skill to the public ."
good,"it was a fun experience for me being that it was my first job.  a typical day on the job is basically stocking out the merchandise. so far i've learn that being in a management position is not an easy task but takes a lot of patience to handle the most part of it. my co-workers was one of the best group i had ever since working there. they are a fun group of people who knows how to get their job done while having fun but not to much. the hardest part of the is having to get a full recovery at the end of the night but got atleast 80%. the most enjoyable part of my was to interact with the customers, to c how their day is going and to make them feel welcome."
good,"Enjoyed working with public and other associates.  Very busy and fast paced environment,  Challenging work place.  Management very knowledgeable and demanding of your best."
good,"Family Dollar was very convenient in my life. The hours are adequate is you are a hard worker. The management needs some work, but overall I enjoyed my almost 2 years."
good,"The management will try to skip you when you opportunity comes for raises, and any advancements. And minimul pay for work loads."
good,"Operation of cash register, assisting customers with service issues and product location, stock merchandise after unloading the delivery truck, audit cash drawer and other duties as assigned."
good,"Overall job experience is good. There's definitely room for advancement in the management field. I've learned to adapt to different environments as well as different type of people. A typical day at work involves multi-tasking in a fast paced environment, as well as communicating and dealing with customers."
good,The company expects way too much for what they offer and in doing so sets you up for failure
good,"Greeting and handling customers and money handling, unloading and loading trucks and stocking the store."
good,"I would go to work clock in, count my drawer get my register going and start attending to my customers. I learned that there are many ups and downs with working with customers when they are having bad days and come shop with an attitude i learned to oversee that because without the customers there would be no buisness and customers were really what made my day and what i would look forward to when going to work."
good,"A typical day at work started around 7:30 am getting the store ready, registers ready, and also making sure that the store looked great for the customers. I learned many things working at Family Dollar how to  deal with thief's and how to unload a truck for shipment. My co-workers were great and amazing with myself, i get along well with others. The hardest part of the job would be to deal with the thief's. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the new customers and getting to know the regular customers that came into the store."
good,"Enjoyed my job, missed a few days out with the Flu and then was laid -off because of point system"
good,"count down all registers, check surveillance tape , open up store getting it ready for customers ,fronting and restocking the store also unloading in coming supply trucks . that coupled with  great customer service  till the end of the day and do the same thing in reverse"
good,A typical day would start by me opening the store for the first hour or two it was pretty quite.I learned that I love working with people and I also like to be a manager it was a fun job i love almost everything about it. The Managers were ok for the most part. I loved most of my co-workers but i worked at so many stores that i meet so many new people. The hardest part of the job was stocking even tho that wasn't really hard. I enjoyed evertyhing even the hard days where cool
good,Typical minimum wage part time job. work a lot for little pay. the only thing i liked from here was meeting new customers every day.
good,This was a good job just security wasn't that's what made it a little hard 
good,I enjoyed this job. I am a people person so i fit right in here. I loved setting new displays up.
good,"load freight onto a truck, clean up your work area, hardest part of my job is i move constantly non stop moving all the time,"
good,I use to enjoy working for Family Dollar but once the managers and district managers find out what you can do they put all the work on you instead of helping and being a team. My typical day depending on what shift I work is what I do most of the time I am cleaning or moving items to a better location to sale. I am an asst. manager right now for this company. The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers and making them happy.
good,"I enjoyed working family dollar till alot of people kept selling and you have to confort them,most of the time i was the only person there a little bit scared. I enjoyed working with my co workers they all did there job we help each other alot. I enjoyed helping the costomers."
good,it was a great place to work but upper new managment need be trained better
good,You will work really hard if you do not learn to work smart. Your work load is always huge but if you tackle it bit by bit and learn to prioritize it is manageable.
good,"High stress work environment, mandatory 52 hours a week and 6days a week. Was with company for 41/2 years never recieved a raise even when I brought my store from a 3.9% shrink to 1.87%shrink within 1 1/2 years as well as increased sales from a 950k year to 1.1million"
good,Management can do better but it's a laid back just. Just come and do what you need to do and its fairly easy. They have stockers and cashiers there but you all doing the same work just about
good,"The hours were cool and the atmosphere was relax, the manager barely helped, and the customers were always in a bad mood not all but most. The stealing was ridiculous. I loved stocking cause you get to work in peace and the team was like a family once we got people who wanted to work. Pay out could’ve been better."
good,"Poor management at the time. Not able to balance work and home, due to working 6 days a week. The company itself wasn’t bad, they were very understanding and considerate for anything."
good,could pay better especially management positions could improve theft by adding security could improve safety for all associates great teamwork great deals
good,Searching for job with better opportunity. Pretty fast paced work environment I met many great people including my coworkers. But however this company doesnt allow you to grow.
good,I enjoyed being with family dollar I had alot of support from customer and my boss I loved making costumes satisfied and keeping them with a smile indeed.
good,"The managers aren't a big help, feels like asking questions are a crime, I wish Things were more friendlier around the work place. I also wish managers didn't only think of themselves."
good,most employees work well together. There is a degree of personal safety that is missing from the store guidelines. management is very encouraging but advancement is slow as they tend to bring in assistant managers from other family dollar locations. hours are not very flexible.
good,"Same as any other retail really. My personal experience has not been the best. I was hired into a crew that is a family, I'm still treated like Im unwanted, since day 1. Retail is my niche so I roll with the punches.  Just heard they put a cap on pay for Assistant Managers , so anyone hired after me will get paid less. "
good,Its a means of being gainfully employed. I wouldn't want to be a manager because I would never have time to spend with my family. There's a high turnover rate with this company. It can be very dangerous working for Family Dollar because of the high theft rate. Some of the customers are ruthless thieves and drug addicts with no fear.
good,Family dollar provides a fun workplace because of the sweet staff. In the other had this store does not have coverage. All staff has to pick up slack and work extended hours.
good,"My experience at Family Dollar has been challenging,but over all a great opportunity. Just in need of a different stress free asphere. A job to better accommodate my allowed work schedule."
good,"I had a pretty good experience sometimes there are not enough hours for everyone, also your experience working here depends on your manager because I had two really good ones and then I left because the third manager was horrible and the chain of command didn’t even work because the manager just brushed off all of our comment and concerns"
good,"Really fast paced and it has to have communication among the staff or it really doesn't work well. Always lots to do so you can easily fall behind. Best thing to have is great communication, good relationships to help the days go faster and better, do as much as you can and try to be proud of what you accomplished. If not try your best next time."
good,"Hours were not consistent, worked at multiple stores just to get hours needed, certain managers were difficult to work with, rules not consistent from one store to another."
good,"I have fun working with my co-workers,just was tired of being the only one who wanted to work. I loved when my old boss was there but the new manager didn't want to work that much."
good,Stayed busy. There is always something to do. Customers made the day either good or bad. Mostly good. I looked forward to my customers each sift. Commutation among management is a little lacking but has room for improvement. Got along with all coworkers.
good,The company is pretty good it just depends on what store you might be at. Some of the staff are awesome to work with. The store is not that hard as long as somebody teach you how to do it.
good,Cashiering meeting new customers..stocking products..hardest part is truck delivery day..getting a schedule ahead as to make plans and most enjoyable are the friendships made.
good,An all around good place to work for. The manager was helpful and worked with my schedule as i needed. Customers were generally nice and work was not too bad.
good,"Working for Family Dollar was more of a comfort , due to offloading merchandise and stocking the merchandise onto the shelves. Dealing with customers , which I also found to be very satisfying and very rewarding."
good,"My asm was promised a full time job, and they gave it to her. Well, almost. They have her working full time hours but set as part time so she doesn't get benefits."
good,It was an okay experience I don't think I would apply again. The managers are cool I just wish they were more hands on to see what we actually go thru daily. They pay could be better
good,They have a pretty relaxed work environment but you have to be working at a fast pace. The management even provides lunch for the employees sometimes.
good,"this was my first job ,I was very happy an I earn my way to being  THIRD KEY HOLDER hard work unloading truck but I got it done .it has taught me that hard work pays off"
good,Deliveries almost everyday. So annoying. I had 4 different managers the 1.5 yrs i was there. HR fired me over hearsay of a new employee so that sucked. The work place overall was good. Enjoyed 95% of people i worked with. Hardest part of the job was dealing with managers and assistant managers all thinking they are the big boss. Not enough communication with everyone as a whole. They pay you for one job but want you to do six jobs.One of the best parts of it though was helping customers with coupons and seeing them smile after seeing how much they saved. I loved my customers. Or just saying good morning and changing someones attitude
good,"most employees do not take family dollar seriously, that must change. The customers are amazing and polite. On the other hand, it can be very uncomfortable to work with some rude people."
good,Managers are expected to work more hours than salary allows.  No compensation for working triple the hours.  Teaches you self motivation solving problems and giving great customer service
good,Human resources doesn't handle situations properly management does a job done are not ready for.  Hours are not very flexible. There is no team work at all.
good,Was unable to become a full-time employee. But worked full-time hours. Lots of hard labor with very little  pay. However was offer advancement  but never given training.
good,I enjoyed my time at the dollar store. Wednesday's was the truck day and it pretty much took up the night with restocking merchandise. I also ran the cash register which i liked as well. Customers appreciation played a big part in my time there.
good,I love to work with people and that's what made the job fun. It was not like going to work. I was doing something I loved. The employees were also awesome.
good,typical day i'm ether stocking shelves or on register helping customers its faced paced there is always multiple things to get done on any shift working here alone is not enough to live on in my area
good,"stocked shelves, unload truck, customer service, recover at end of day, counted safe at end of night and  mopped floors. greeted everyone when entering store"
good,"Family dollar does not value there employees, it would be more of a temporary job. I guess it all depends on the area but the district I was in was not good at all."
good,"Not all family dollars are the same, but speaking from experience, there needs to be better selections of store managers. Store managers I have encountered are too emotional to do their job."
good,Needs employees that care and love makung a difference they lack that alot they also need to stop just promoting anyone cause its hurting there brand and losing lots more business
good,I worked her for almost 6 years. I like the job but it requires me to be at the store for six days a week and maybe seven sometimes.  I have three kids and would love to spend more time with them
good,A good starting job. Not much staff so you will have to do most things yourself on shift depending on location. Customers were nice. Had a Great manager but high turnover due to low pay.
good,Nothing more to say about this employer. The job was an ok job. There was not any benefits. I was abled to make overtime. No sick day or vacation days
good,Great place to work can be stressful at times. Weekend and some holidays are required .Pay was minimum wage. Room for advancement. Maintaining the store is probly the biggest responsibility.. reasonable hours. You unload truck stalking the shelves organizing the end caps keeping up with Mark downs and keeping the shelves fronted.
good,"The job pays well however the management team aren't very optimistic individuals. The management is the biggest issue I have with this job."
good,"Decent company  . fast paced comfortable                                           no room to grown  district manager was horrible . store managers helped good crew ran register ,  stocked shelfs and unloading trucks"
good,"Family dollar was a great starter job, I actually loved this job. Due to the fact of them not being able to work with my schedule due to having a child. I was not able to continue my employment there."
good,"Overall it was a great place to work despite the old male manager I had he was very disorganized.He was never on time and never prepared.The costumers were great,and the company itself was great to get along with.I learned mush from my time there and it was wonderful."
good,Good business practices and I really loved my job with Family Dollar. The prices and products available is a plus really good deals. A very laid back work atmosphere and good uniform policy
good,"a typical day at work is very stressful. couldnt never get nobody to"
good,"Worked here for a really long time, relocated even. The managers were wither really awesome and push you forward, or really unfair.. Will take advantage of you and promise promotions you never get."
good,"When I arrive to work there's already a long line of customers in needing of cashing out. I have learned how to quickly and efficiently scan products, place items in bagging, and accept payment. Therefore ensuring that all the customers in the store are met with proficiently fast and friendly assistance."
good,"Gives no payroll to complete manager task. Working eighty hours a week and has no time for family. They send to much inventory to store locations, that causes an overload stockroom."
good,"I liked my job because I love doing customer service. Customer service is my passion and I believe and giving customers my best. I didn't like the environment I was in, because it was a dangerous place."
good,"Fun place to work, security needs to be updated to keep employees more safe and comfortable. Work hard and it's not hard to move up in the company. Pay should improve."
good,"The job was stressful and physically tiring. I had to deal with irritated and sometimes irate customers daily. Even when I was home I'd get calls from work almost every day. The job was constantly pushing itself into my personal life. It wasn't an easy job to deal with. However, I did enjoy my coworkers and employees. My district manager as well as my general manager were very kind and helped train me and help me in any way they could so I could succeed. I enjoyed working with them."
good,"on a typical .. I ran the cash register, stocked the shelves. Helped customers with any questions or need that they may have had. Unloaded the truck on delivery days and made sure that the store was always neat and organized"
good,When I first started working there I loved my job. About 4 months into my employment I was offered an assistant manager position at a different store. I worked at that store for about 9 months and I was tranfered to another store which I fell in love with. I felt great about going to work everyday until I was tranfered to a store that was in despair so I was brought to my 4th store which I worked at for 2 months. After the store was staffed I was tranfered to my 5th store. After a break in I started to feel scared working by myself everyday and when I expressed my feelings to my supervisors they did nothing to try to make me feel safe. So I decided it was best for me and my safety to end my employment with the company
good,"9.0 per hr..management staff treat you fairly, hr and pay roll control...very little overtime. Customers some good some not so good..stocking nerchandise,cashier job not to bad.. Robbed at gunpoint...No bonus although was told i was to recieve one"
good,"The Customer Service Representative position at family dollar is fair, although they do not give 40 hours, overtime, or any benefits.  It does give you an opportunity to advance your customer service skills."
good,I loved working here! The current manager at my store is an amazing woman!! I loved that the days flew by because you are always busy even when the customer flow is slow!
good,"very relaxed work place , customers were nice and friendly.pay rate not reasonable, manager nice, wasn't a hard job.I wouldn't go back to working there because of the robberies."
good,"The hours are consistent, and the work environment is a mixed bag with strict guidance rules on time management. To having lax conditions at 2nd shift the work place environment stresses keen time management skills. While the actual work is repetitive and easy, it is also requires strong communication skills and being able to communicate technical issues in simple steps. This job isn't for everyone however it is simple and consistent in it's hours and if you enjoy a simple job with average pay it's okay."
good,"very busy and fast paced. always  have something to do. stocking shelves, opperating the register, pinning clothers, recovering, ckeaning and organizing. it keeps me busy i love it"
good,"I enjoyed the store I worked in as well as the people I worked with. The district manager left a lot to be desired. Alotted store operation hrs was extremely low which left the store with little time for cashiers to work. During the day it was usually just a manager to run the whole store responsible for stocking, customer service on the floor, and register duty. Cashiers only worked evening hrs usually only 15 hrs a week. Basic health insurance cost was too high to afford on what I made. There wasn't much opportunity for career advancement in the district I was in and the DM didn't let anyone transfer districts."
good,"csr cashier stock, inventory, drop offs at banks , open and closing assist customers to items they need and also make sure the store is clean and stocked properly"
good,had a lot of fun working with those i did. we got the work done together and we liked our job. liked coming into work. was fast paced but made the day go by faster. we just liked our jobs
good,management plays a key role in making happy employees. Training is a must to working for this company. you have a hand in all store operations and interaction with customers. Customer service is a great attibute to have in this business.
good,This job started out great until we went through new management. Afrter the first manager left the new one had no idea what she was doing and took it out on her employees. It was not a hard job though.
good,I did the truck every Monday had to unload it with one other person and it took like 6 hours every time. Stocking shelves and checking people out were the main jobs.
good,"Family Dollar is a decent company to work for, as long as you are not a Store Manager. Store Managers are pressed and expected to work extremely long hours, usually a six day work week, working three to four days from open to close. This does not allow for much family time nor down time.Low budgets are usually given which only allows for, a manager and two employees ""one during the first half of the day and the other for the last half of the day""to service the customer, keep the store in order while stocking shelves, watch for theft (internal and external), keep the store clean, etc."
good,"A very long work day consist of long lines, No breaks, and very little days for yourself. Management does not help just sit in their little office or on the phone."
good,"some locations are better than others but if you are a cashier you get written up for calling in sick even if you have sick hours, and you get 5-15 hrs a week of work."
good,"If you like working like a slave without adequate compensation this would be the job for you. You are overworked and are not paid fairly, raises and bonuses are inconsistent. I would only work there if there was no other jobs in the world available."
good,Over worked but good pay as a store manager. Little time to spend with family. Not a bad company to work for its just requires a lot of your time. Average company
good,I enjoyed helping the customers with whatever needs they had.  I also stocked freight as it was received.  The opening and closing of the store was sometimes challenging because you have to make sure all tasks was completed on time in order for the store to be properly ready for business.
good,Very simple job. A typical work day consist of stocking and or working the register also consist of  being generous to customers. Wasn't Much too learn And Management was very fair.
good,Hours would vary but overall okay job. Management could have been better. But it's a job. Not too stressful. Store discounts were nice. Friendly coworkers.
good,"I loved working with customers. I got attached to some of the people that were regular customers. It was difficult to run the register while stocking merchandise so I was definitely busy. When we were not busy, I found things to do like sweep or mop the floor or just organize shelves. I learned that working with the public can be a lot of fun but also difficult, especially when customers are not happy about something. No matter what the situation was I had to stay calm and help them to the best of my ability."
good,A typical day at work can be busy so a lot of people are rushing in and out of the store and some can have bad days and try to make yours bad. I learned you have to understand how people are feeling on different days and try not to make it worse for them. when it days when it only two people working it can be busy and the lines can get long that the hardest part of the job and sometimes you might have to rush and ring people up to get the line down.but the most enjoyable part of the job is sometimes you become family to other just by being nice and seeing them every time you work.
good,"it is a nice place to work , but it is hard to advance even with years of experience and the know how to do the job. actual job sercurity is ok but the physical sercurity on the job is needed , not saying you want be robbed but it could deter a robbery ."
good,"Most of the store managers will work 50 to 80hr weeks. This depends on how you run your store. I worked the minimum hours and my store was the #1 store to Comp. while I was there. You work 6 days a week with Sundays off. You will do paper work in the morning and then do your floor work once you finish. You do all this while you run a register. Some stores can afford to have a cashier during the morning. You also are your own AP/LP. So you also have to watch your customers so they don't steal from your store. Most family dollars are in rough areas, so it can be dangerous doing a stop on a customer. Store manager also does the truck. The driver will send it down to you, but you have to put it in your stock room. Then you work it to the floor. Hardest part is controlling shop lifting and inventory. Best part of the job is it's a very easy job to do. District managers care more about your employee's than the managers. Employees can end up costing you your job if they don't like you."
good,"My time working at family dollar was nice. I loved my job. The only problems we had there was that there was never any bags. We would run out all that time, so we would have to use garbage bags."
good,Its a great company to work for but good luck getting a promotion. They liked to bring in fresh employees rather than train a current employee for the promotion.
good,There were just a lot of stealing going on here and it made it hard to enjoy the job when you had to either look over your shoulder a lot or had to watch every customer.
good,All in all was a very good place to work at learned a lot of different things and gained a lot of management skills. Actually loved working there but after a while management changed and now they are changing things up from when I was first there and trying to say the way I learned was wrong.
good,Their I definitely always something to do. The stores locations are not so great and the extended hours during holidays can be a bust but it is a nice busy fast paced environment.
good,"•During a typical work week, one of my biggest tasks is checking in on my staff and assessing their progress on various projects I meet with smaller groups of my staff during the middle of the week to troubleshoot any issues.."
good,It was great. I learn a lot working in management. There wasn't much job work/life balance but that is also part of retail. It's a great place to work
good,Working for the Store I worked for was definitely a challenge everyday. Management let their positions go to their head. SM did not know how to talk to their employees.
good,"Well the typical day at work as an assistant manager would require u to push sales, organized the entire store, and also try to prevent merchandise losses.The Hardest part of the job would be dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable of the job would be Working with the customers that are sastified with their purchases and give comments about our services and the way we run the store"
good,"A very fast paced job, very busy. Plenty of nice people, and alot of hard labor. The management is very limited, and there is alot of things that need fixed, within the company itsself."
good,It is a good company to work for but you have to put up with so much working with them... Customer service try to get over and when they can't they lie on you.
good,"Family Dollar is a good place to work on a daily basis for part time work.  Management was okay but left a lot to be desired.  I enjoyed interacting with the customers.  I learned how to use a cash register because I had never worked retail before this job.  My co workers were very professional with the exception of a select few, the hardest part of the job was dealing with an unsatisfied customer and the best part of the job was dealing with satisfied customers."
good,"working at this place you have to learn patience and consistency."
good,"Not a bad job if you have the right manager. I however did not.   The job was relatively easy, cashier and stock. But expect to work every weekend and lots of holidays."
good,I enjoyed working at family dollar. Being an assistant manager was easy and fun. I had a very good manager though. The cameras never worked and didn't ever fix them.
good,"That is exactly what Family Dollar is: A job. In most cases, I loved working there. I had amazing coworkers who did their jobs and made mine easier. Everyone pulled thier own wieght and management was amazing. My boss always tried to work around our schedules. However, it was all very quick to change when the new girl was no longer the new girl. This job will eventually start to control your entire life if you're not careful. Find a Family Dollar in a GOOD location with GOOD staff and management. It wasn't a terrible job. Just, not a very good one sometimes."
good,"Always something to do while at work, most of the time you're not given enough time to finish tasks while the store is packed with customers."
good,"I got to work counted my register. Began ringing out customers, stocked shells in between, priced products as well as put security tags on products.  Helped customers when ever they needed something. Cleaned store, swept, mopped, unloaded merchandise. At end of shift counted draw and deposit for the day, dropped deposit in safe, closed store with assistant manager. Hardest part of job so much to do so little time, especially if your working with a co-worker that does not give their all."
good,"Demonstrated great customer service by providing complete"
good,"Very friendly co-workers and Management. Not the best pay, but it was fun most of the time. Best part of the job was meeting new people and learning a lot about retail."
good,"It's a very busy store. I liked working for family dollar, but its located in a bad area. Everyone got along. The customers were very nice. It was easy work."
good,"Everyday that I've worked here, I have learned a lot about the work force. I would say that this job is decent but I don't enjoy waking up and coming to work each day."
good,in my opinion the employee's were really rude and didn't help with much when needed help. employees did what they wanted and the managers and assistant managers usually sat in the back room on their phones.
good,"I worked up front as a cashier, assisting customers and putting away  stock. I didn't care for working so many holidays because I have a big family and have to cook for everyone since my Mother passed away and it was too hectic."
good,They need better judgement in talent period. The store manager only came in so often and when she did she did not invest in the employees. Which is funny because if your trying to create a team based culture to work at the coach should be coaching and taking the time to make sure not just one store and it's employees are running like a fine tuned machine but all of them
good,"Nice place to work, it just wasn't for me. To much mess and drama going around the store. Everyone was in everybody business, again just to messy for me."
good,"On a typical day at the job, its flows nicely. Most of the people are nice and considerate. It can sometimes get suddenly crowded but nothing i couldn't handle. Well i had been in retail before so if anything i got to improve on my skills and learn a little bit more about how to properly deal with all kinds of customers. My co-workers were friendly enough, and since the store wasn't to big its given that we worked well together. I think the hardest part of my job for me was adjusting to different attitudes and early mornings. I most enjoyed customers satisfaction."
good,"Overall it was a good job,if only they were willing to work with my school schedule.At the moment that i joined family Dollar i was still going to schoo,and in the due course that i was working there i asked management if they could kindly work with my schedule.Which at first they agreed,but later on down the line they started to show me otherwise."
good,"I opened and closed the store, cash deposits, scheduling, and customer service returns and exchanges. I enjoyed my job but did not approve of the way they ran things there it was very disfunctional at times due to store manager."
good,"Since a change of management in the store I worked at I have no complaints. The previous management was kind of short with customers/guests, he never gave us our 15 minute breaks, I feel I was rushed through my assistant manager's training sessions and never properly was taught certain procedures of helping manage a store. It was a moreso learn as you go situation, but due to a management change the store is running awesome, and doing much better all-around."
good,"The Family Dollar Store is a fast paced, highly competitive store in Mt, Morris, MI. We have a varied customer base and learning to work with all the different people who walk through our doors is an important part of my daily duties."
good,the wages were way too low i needed alot more money then i was being paid just to get by so i had to leave as soon as something better came along.. i enjoyed the job tho
good,The job duties were a bit over whelming at times. I was honestly the best working manager along side the store manager. I never had days off. I never gotten weekends off. I was there all times of the night. I barely gotten any sleep. Dealing with the customers could get a bit shaky at times due to the area a lot of individuals seem to want discounts on items I couldn't do due to my store manager's say so.
good,"working register, keeping frontend clean."
good,"I work Mon-Thur every week, I unload 2-3 trucks within those days. I pick up, carry, stock, and regularly use a cardboard baler and a pallet jack. I have learned that the team, in any corporation, who controls the merchandise intake and outgoing is very important to that place of business. Management at Family Dollar is not what I would personally like to pursue as a career, I would prefer to advance in a warehouse position. I have trained many other coworkers, I believe everyone is worth a chance but also, everything is not for everyone. The hardest part of my job for me is having to constantly redirecting other when I'm not a manager. The manual labor is the part of the job I enjoy the most."
good,"Any normal day at work would be to assist customers with any and all needs. While working at Family Dollar I have learned to live with more patience with people and to listen first. Management at every business different, district managers and so forth, those managers were not as kind as I would of hoped them to be. I completely enjoy working with all kinds of people. The hardest part of the job was the miscommunication between the managers running the store and their supervisors. I enjoyed knowing I can run a business, while still helping others with their needs."
good,"Clock in and get till number"
good,"A typical day at my job is extremely busy. We  are the number one store in our district.  My role as the manager is to assist employees and customers with their needs.  Instruct employees with their daily task.  Taking invoices, making orders, taking messages, budgeting payroll, working short handed, working on short notice.  All this while maintaining a positive friendly attitude."
good,"I really enjoyed working here.we had a family dollar family.all of us got along. until a new assistant manager was hired.she created chaos in the workplace did drugs on job,had anger issues, and walked around talking to herself.the hardest part of this job was dealing with irate customers and we had lots. but we all handled these customers well with a smile."
good,"the job was ok for the most part needed better management,could of use better team work.i didn't like the fact that I was always the only person there in the store for long periods of time."
good,"Had a conflict with area manager and will explain at time of interview.  But overall, it was a nice place to work, the advancement is quick if you know the knowledge of running the store."
good,"Never handle money at a cashier job, but the team was amazing, in all there help. "
good,My hardest part of the job is not really anything I just learn to do what it is to be done. I enjoy greeting customers and helping them making them feel comfortable as far as me keeping my store organized and maintain for them to shop. my co-workers tend to love working under me as there boss not to strike just let them know there job in what I need done for that day or week.
good,Enjoyed helping customers and working with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was unloading on truck day when you are suffering a bad back pain.
good,"I enjoyed working here. It was a fast paced enviornment and a team effort. I was offered a better job which advanced me to management, so I chose to leave Dunkin Donuts to help my career goals."
good,"I was pretty much my own boss at this job, which was good and bad. I worked more than 40 hours a week which is also good and bad."
good,Meet new people on daily basis. you learn to multitask far as cash handling and merchandising.
good,I enjoyed working at family dollar. Its I had a manger who lack the will to work. I enjoyed all the hours I was given. I always had 40 hours or more.
good,Many days and nights spent alone in the store with no other associates working. Very dangerous situation to be put in.
good,this was my first job ever and i loved it it made me responsible at a young age
good,"A stressful enviorment, no support from district management,80-90 hours per week sometimes 7 days a week and 3-4 months at a time,but the healthcare was great and my employees were helpful and respectful."
good,"Its not really where I want to be right now, I know I can do more with my skills."
good,"The best part of this job is the people, you can meet and network with many people in your community.  I got my first big start in politics because of some of the people I met at work.  People would come in and complain about certain issues in the town and I would voice my opinion, and created quite a following of supporters."
good,I have learned to always respect everyone your never know what they'er day might have been like at home. I loved working and staying busy. Some co-workers where rude but I try my best to make everything a positive learning experience.
good,I loved working there. Family Dollar gave me credit for my hard work.
good,"Having a day working here consists of working the register, stocking, and dealing wih phones and customers all at the same time. You might open the store or recover the store depending on which shift you work. the most enjoyable part about this job is the co-workers all get along great. It's a good place to work at."
good,Overall typical day at this company is unsafe and what I learned is that inventory numbers are all that matters at this company. As far as management the pay is great!
good,Go in find were I'm assigned for the day
good,Very hard place to work at with little corperate support they asign you a store with a budget to support maybe 3 employees but expect you to run it like you have 10.
good,"I liked working here, I left this work place because I just moved down here and they was only giving me two days a week and I had a baby to take care of. I couldn't take care of a baby with only 100 dollars every week. Everyday I would go into work I would count my drawer and then start the day out. I would take care of people that needed help. Then I would go through the store and put everything back in its place."
good,"Very busy since is retail. I really enjoyed working with customers. Management is a plus. The stories with good management is a great place to work, even though is very hard to keep a 12 hours shift on your feet. Very difficult, and at the end of the day you are very tired. There is security as long as you are a good employee. There is advancement if you are willing to go for it and if you like retail. Pay is not good. They offer benefits but it's not cheap with the pay. But it's not a bad place to work at all."
good,start of shift walk the floor to see what product is needed for restock face and front items on shelves clean floors with dust mop assist the costumers keep track of inventory I learned how to use good customer service skills management was great overtime was offered if needed even off schedule
good,"There is always plenty of work to be done, so time flys. My co-workers are great, but a bit undependable sometimes. The company expects you to be on call pretty much all the time, especially on Fridays when the truck is supposed to come in. The compensation is terrible. Im an assistant manager and I make a dollar and change more than a newly hired cashier."
good,Family Dollar is a great company to work for they have very good beliefs on how things should be the only down fall with Family Dollar is there is no balance between your work life and your home life if you are a Store Manager
good,A typical day at family dollar was very tiresome. when i worked there the manager and co workers were great. The whole day was hard because you were constantly going and going. The most ejoyable was my customers and lunch break.
good,I was always something going on at work. I learned how to be a manager.Management was bad because i had so many managers. my co workers were great and willing to do what was needed. The hardest part was having to deal with people stealing.
good,"It was in a way, a small business and a big business. There was also a very slow pace feeling."
good,"I opened and closed daily, balanced reigisters and counted over money from the previous day in the safe."
good,"a typical day at family dollar would be laid back, not a hard job at all. I learned about how to manage a 5 people crew in retail. my co-workers were very friendly. the hardest part of my job would have to be unloading a truck without all the proper equipment. the most enjoyable part was the hours."
good,"Stocked, rang up purchases and customer returns, recovery"
good,"My day starts with going over whatever happened the shift before,so I can be informed. The hardest part of my job is the on-call type of schedule very little time for family life."
good,my typical day of work was a 4p-close shift everyday.
good,I was in charge of training new hires. Open/closing the store at all times. We had to unload trucks and put the stuff out everyday. It was a very hard job but nothing I didn't enjoy doing.
good,The customers that came in we're great. The location was in a good part of Pawtucket.
good,"typical day at work includes customer service, running cash registers, and helping customers find what they are looking for. Fridays we unload a shipment of merchandise, and over the weekend stock the shelves. I make sure the store gets cleaned really good after the shelves are stocked, and i make sure the nightly clean-up is completed before closing the store. I count the deposit, and the petty cash after closing, and make sure the safe is locked and the alarm is set before leaving at night. My co-workers are great to work with, they make the job fun. Customers also make the job fun. The hardest part of the job is watching for and preventing shoplifters, its hard to catch them, but once caught they arent allowed back in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job, is meeting new people daily, and seeing the smile on a happy customer's face. A happy customer is a returning customer, and that means more business for the store."
good,"An over all ok place to work, but with limited hours available"
good,Enjoyed working here because of the customers and receiving freight was like Christmas! Had much fun with customers and employees. Store Manager was somewhat bipolar and we got along the best we could. The hardest part of this job was walking away from it because of my back injury. I learned how to properly lift a box!
good,"A Good hard worker."
good,The management at that location was very poor. Other than that it was a very good company to work for.  enjoyed customer and the other employees.  And the hours were flexible
good,"Have good customer service, have patience, work fast and efficiently, handle money with care, stay productive, leave personal problems at home, and be on time."
good,I for me think it was a good experience for it was my first job out of school and I really do believe some can benefit from it my co-workers were nice but my manager sometimes lacked kindness and understanding
good,"Long work hours, poor pay, fast paced work environment, good advancement up in the company, manager was strict but awesome, loved it there but didn't feel like at the last before I quit that I was paid fair for the amount of work that I did"
good,"Manager very well to work with. Little pay, short hours. There are no benefits for cashiers. Well organized.  All the staff got along. We worked together as a team."
good,Awesome customers they really do make the job amazing and all of the management a lot to make sure that there was a positive work environment and that we had fun while we worked
good,Its ok working at family dollar  nut the employee  need to be payed more and we should  be offered benefits  and it need to be more hrs for employees as well
good,"The store has very bad management at the moment, for someone who works there. If your applying be aware not to get on her bad side or she won’t schedule you any hours."
good,I did cashiering and stocking. They were able to let me work even with a boot on my foot before surgery with a doctors note. The location has some sketchy customers but basically just local people. Most customers were nice and pleasant. I didn't mind this job and would go back.
good,Very limited employees are employed in one store so we do work extra hard but if you love work you would enjoy this place that pays you weekly ! The store managers are mostly elderly but overall its not too many problems with upper management
good,"Comienzo mi día abriendo tienda, preparando las cajas registradoras y verificando la caja fuerte. Continuó asignando las tareas diaria a los empleados asignados ese día. Y trabajamos organizados, tranquilos y aprendiendo cosas nuevas cada día."
good,"I loved it!  Awesome customer's and the other employees were great 😊 I was lucky...."
good,"I love working at this place, theirs always work to keep busy. Flexible hours and trade off days also contributed to a great work environment. Great for college students"
good,The pay and benefits are descent nange.ent could use improvement so the place could run more efficiently if you dont have a problem working holidays and you like working a lot of overtime this is the place for you but if you like spending the holidays with family its not
good,Not much to say about this job I was always by myself at night closed had a other employees but  was good worker  they lied about alot and very unfair.
good,"While I was there I started at $7.25 an hour with a promise of a raise... I worked my tail off and got a $0.15 raise. I was doing all the jobs nobody else wanted to do, because I was new. I picked up early shifts, weekend shifts for hungover coworkers,  sacrificing time with my children."
good,"Hours tend to be inconsistent. Goes with the season, holidays, school, etc. A few weeks at less than 40 hours a week, then a month of manditory overtime."
good,When working at family dollar you never know what might happen so it’s best to stay on your toes and be prepared for anything. We have trucks that come unexpected all the time.
good,"While I was a employee at Family Dollar, I had an ok experience. I mostly worked on inventory and managing the store appearance throughout the work day which help me learned how to work more efficiently. One thing that I disliked, was the lack of communication and unreliability. Most of our employees didn’t have phones and wouldn’t come in to work which put stress on management to find replacements. Beside those common issues, I enjoyed being able to assist and interact with my customers"
good,"Relaxed work environment,  very happy co workers and bosses, also very clean store. Happy atmosphere with cheery customer service! Overall very happy place to work, although pay is a little low."
good,"This specific store is located in a very small town, so business was pretty slow for the majority of the time. When it was on the upswing the rush didn't last long so after there was nothing to do."
good,Overall it was a pretty good experience I would have stayed longer but another job offered me full time. The managerial staff lacked tact. So it was difficult sometimes to communicate.
good,Family dollar is a great store to start off at and work yonway up sometimes it gets difficult but most the most part you will get your money and some good benefits
good,"I enjoyed the work however, poor upper management,  there is no family in family dollar,  more expectations then helping hands, major lack in workable hours, hard to get benefits if they are offered, lack of guidance and support, no training"
good,Long hours pay isnt great but its a job must be fast paced and willing to be on call delivery days have to be able to deal with large numbers of customers at once
good,over all the store was good to work for but upper management was bad i am not sure what more i can say about a place that fires people if the do something wrong without warning
good,If you like fast paced then this is the place for you. There was a lot of turn over but the job duties and responsibilities are easy to understand and follow.
good,"Store Manager is great ,co workers are great .just wish it have more hours . And paid more . 4-5 hours a day 4- 5 days a week . Pay is bi weekly. I've really enjoyed working here for the most part . I enjoy getting to talk to some of my regular customers that come in on days I'm there. . Just wish I got more hours."
good,"i like family dollar not to many issues w co-workers, costumers aren't rude. i would like to come back eventually. its a great company and i also love shopping there."
good,Fun work environment depending on who your coworkers are. Management was unappreciative and didn't recognize the hard work their employers did. Very understaffed but no hours to give to anyone but management.
good,"typical work day i would greet the customers as they enter and leave the store, assist the customer with any special look ups needed, stock the shelves when receiving a DC truck order, learned how to count petty cash before and after shift in safe, and count draw down at night as well."
good,"Working at family dollar I learned so many different thing and I gained a great friend. I never quit and I was never fired the manager just didn't let me come back to work and I'm unsure as to why, this was my only problem with the manager. I would have never quit because I loved my job."
good,The joy i get helping others find what they need and the joy from there faces when they leave happy great customer service and the work we do as a team to help us grow
good,"Well Family Dollars Is a very busy place to work you have to always stay to yourself but remember you are a team, Everybody keeps the store up to date and neat, and Everybody make sure the customers feel welcomed"
good,pay was great. very hard work physically. work life balance virtually non existent. customers were usually great but had to play security guard a lot to deter shop lifters
good,I have worked at Family Dollar for eight months and overall it is a good short term job but due to the lack of benefits outside of management and low pay.It is best to have it on your resume and move on to a better job.
good,"I loved working at Family Dollar, I love retail; the environment and workload made your work day go by fast. Management wasn't too bad; the District Manager was very helpful and informative."
good,"It’s a nice temporary job for someone trying to start off work or just coming out of school ,the place is clean and easy to organize and keep track to f and stock the cashier job is really simple and very easy going"
good,Schedule was subject to change workout prior notice fair for flexibility on your part is a must. Management was very understanding when it came to personal or Family Matters especially to single parents
good,"a typical day at work would consist of paperwork, deposits, change orders, stocking shelves, customer service, answering email/ phone calls.  The hardest part of the job is finding hard working employees for the pay rate and best part of job will be meeting customers and making company goals."
good,Honestly this was my first job and I enjoyed it until they made a change in the store managers. It stopped being a fun loving crew and it was filled with miscommunication.
good,"It's a good job to gain some work experience, cashiers get strictly part time. Good job for people with children, someone who needs an extra income etc."
good,For Family Dollar holidays are the best time to look for like that the management was decent there's a lot of pressure put on to the cashiers not just from customers alike but from the company itself not only do we have to run our cashier but we also have to stalk their time even if we're busy or not
good,Perfect job for someone in college looking for a company willing to work with them for some what fexable hours. But not a fitting career for someone needing a set income
good,Never know what my shift was going to be. People call out or im asked to stay longer on truck day. have gone up 17hr shift. There is no overtime. can work up to 40hrs a week and not a second more or youll be written up. But paid well. I was a 1.30 over minimum wage.
good,I enjoy working at Family Dollars I really enjoy the customers. Meeting new people I also like my team members We are all hard working employees.My mangers are great to work with I learn something new everyday. I strive for the best for myself and also for the company.
good,You get to interact wit the customers it is very fast paced there aren’t any real breaks and you really only work part time good thing is you get paid every week
good,"A day at Family Dollar when I was working there, was being a cashier.. Stocking and making sure the store was presentable for the customer. I learned the importance of working as a team"
good,This is a good place for anyone to start with their first job. Not much money to be made and not much room for advancement but is a good way to learn the working life.
good,Great store to shop at. Has friendly employees and costumers. Has good working my hour. The managers teach you everything you need to learn pretty quickly.
good,Certain mangers are cool but also be on time because they don't play with lateness.Also work hard because it takes a team to succeed. Family Dollar is a family
good,The manager always ran out of bags or change. Good staff made you feel welcomed. Customers were kinda rude due to the lack of change or bags. Also had security guards cause customers would steal
good,"This job was fast paced and my days would go by fast. I always had something to go, which is good because i like to always go go. Managemnt could have been better, but over all an ok place to work."
good,I true my liked working their and my parents worked their too. It was very fast in new York we had a lot more traffic then here in north Carolina I enjoyed learning to bag items where I was just used to bag a few items and that's it. Some people went grocery shopping in their and you had to be fast.
good,"Its a fun place to work,  it's not that hard.  The hardest part is the customers. I would work for them again.  Quick advancement within company.  Flexible schedule."
good,this job had up and down but i had fun at work but some time people in and take things and need money but it was ok not the best job was happy place sometime but sometime at night someone try to get the money
good,My gm got another job quit district manager left me for 5 days to run store with no help so i left the job its self was a great job and the 2 managers i worked with were great but neither one stayed because of the district manager days went fast because we were bisy
good,Management not very supportive. Great career advancement. Long hours if your a manager. Faced paced environment.  Hard to get any time off. Great discounts.
good,Duties were the same as Dollar General. Fast paced. Customers make a job enjoyable. Learned how to run a store and its needs on a daily bases and working with good people
good,Long hours but good company. They are very family orientated when it comes to encouraging team members to be and do their best. They take pride in the stores that they take care of.
good,"Stocking shelves, cashier, and providing customer service. It was a long time ago when I worked there, not sure how much has changed from then to now."
good,It was an ok work experience but the environment was unethical at times to say the least. Management was unprofessional constantly but enjoyed the coworkers they made it bareable.
good,"fast paced environment , multi tasking is required must have good communication skill depending on the are your store is located in you must be able to handle un wanted situations"
good,Family Dollar can be a great company to work for. There are many great stores with excellent staff. Shifts change often. Not able to have much of an outside life because of that.
good,During the week its very slow. The slow pace gives you time to complete a lot of tasks. One things that should change is allowing more than two people to work at a time.
good,I absolutely loved this job from unloading trucks to stocking shelves to helping customers.   Until the new (at the time) District Manager stepped in and changed the whole dynamic of the job.
good,working  my main concern is customer service. I will go above and beyond to help my customers. i have learned a great deal from being a manager that i could bring to future jobs.
good,"my day consisted of being a cashier, doing stocks, and maintaining a clean work place. i learned how to operate a cash register and learn schematics for our products. the hardest part of the job was dealing with certain customers, the most enjoyable were my co-workers"
good,"Can be a very rewarding career but does come with unlimited challenges and very long hours. Overall the Company is a Good Company to work for with great benefits that include PTO, the potential for career growth is great as it is a growing company."
good,"Unloaded trucks and stock new merchindise. Setup Store for a opening day. Built shelves and other things. I loved all the movement, got a workout while working."
good,"overall good place to work as long as you have a good team, great boss, and flexibility which was the case. however the situation I found myself in was the neighborhood was very busy never enough staff on registers and long lines and other things didnt get accomplished"
good,"The work place depending on where can be dangerous, shoplifters"
good,Manager was a fair.  Hours are part time if you are not a manager. They will clock you out automatically if you ate not done by 10:30 pm then you need a manager over ride. Overall the manager was fair but store policy's were dumb.
good,It's an easy place to work at; not much required of you unless your team doesn't pull their weight. Inter workplace drama may lead to a team member being treated unfairly unfortunately.
good,Me gusta lo que hago pero no es justo para madres cm yo estar todos los fines de semanas cn turnos de 9 horas y no poder disfrutar con los ninos el ir al parque
good,"I love customer service, so working at Family Dollar was a no-brainer for me. I really enjoyed talking to the customers, helping them locate items and solve any other issues that arose. My co-workers were awesome!"
good,It's a nice job for your first job but then after a while you want a raise or more money. You always have to keep moving around recovering. There are only two registers so the line gets long quick.
good,"no hour available and no consistency in your schedule,  nice friendly people easy to work with,easy work with flexible breaks and responsibilities, would make a good temporary job"
good,"there is no balance between family and work, family dollar is all about work. It was mandatory to work 52+hours and you could not take a vacation unless your store was 110%. We got paid sick time but were never able to use the hours because of low staffing issues. It was not because I wouldn't hire anyone its because they would not allow you to. I was in almost a 2mil. store and only had 2 cashiers and 2 assistants. we all were in there 6days a week, blood sweat and tears"
good,"It was my very first job ever, and I loved the atmosphere of working there when I did, however shortly after I was hired on they switched store managers, and we did not get along at all. She wasn't a team player, and expected you to do her job as well as your own while tending to customers, and stock, and everything. She isn't the manager there anymore, and that's a great thing because I would feel sorry for the people who work there now if she was, but other than that it was an awesome place to work!"
good,"Only bad thing was the management she talked to"
good,I would clock in count down my register make sure that all items are stocked correctly and facing to the front while assisting customers with everyday purchases
good,"Family dollar is great, only problem is, the pay rate is low and the work hours are low as well, but besides that, Family dollar is a great place to work, very easy and relaxed job, but also quick paced."
good,Working at Family Dollar was a pleasant experience. The coworkers I had were good people and amazing. Supportive and caring. The job was never too hard though sometimes customers would cause more work for the employees.
good,You Learn a lot working there. All positions are great a good environment. Some days are better than others like any other job. Promotions come real quick if you have great customer service and a good personality.
good,Working here was pretty good but it was always hot and kinda miserable and the people there were very nice and respectable especially when I came to getting the work done
good,Great team to work with but management was not easy to communicate with. The scheduled hours were great for going to school. The customer's were for the most part very pleasant. The pay difference between store manager and assistant manager is big. The store managers are never there in the district that I worked at but district manager did nothing to change that once human resources reached out to them.
good,"Not very high-maintenance work. Employers and managers are laid back. Fellow coworkers can become pushy to require work to be done, as it is already being done."
good,Love the company the just have unrealistic task for one person. I work in one week over 52 hours and half the time i am by myself do to payroll issues.
good,there was no job security or security. the store i worked in a manager got shot and there was no security guard was sent up there to assist me or there other personal at all and hr didn't help as well.
good,"Family dollar company overall is a wonderful company to work for. It also have a lot of areas i wish they could improve over the years to come. My normal day at work can be pretty busy, From making sure my cashiers have enough money to run they registers threw out the day, Customers loading money on they Debit cards, Helping customers find things they need in the store, keeping the store clean and neatly stocked. However there is never enough help to cover the shift for the work that needs to be done, I deal with cashiers calling out repeatedly without dealing with any consequences. Cashiers told everyday what need to be done at closing time plus its list of nightly duties posted and they still don't do what need to be done and no consequences. But the job itself its pretty decent."
good,"Not enough people to work with"
good,"Working at Family Dollar was an very productive experience. From greeting customers to stocking items, I enjoyed working there. I learned a lot of things such as having more patience dealing with customers, as to working a register. I enjoyed being off the register and stocking because, I work at an faster pace off the register. Also, I loved working on the truck every Wednesday. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday, I also loved gaining relationships with everyday customers. The hardest part of the job was trying to stock items while on the register. But, overall I loved my job."
good,"The manager was not an understanding person. Quite rude. You could get everything on your to-do list done efficiently and still have to walk on eggshells due to the fact that saying the wrong thing, or making a minimal mistake would erase all your accomplishments for that day. "
good,"Co-workers are very nice and friendly. Flexible working hours or shifts but i haven't been working here long enough to really give a detailed review. So far, everything is looking up though except there are zero benefits."
good,this is not a job I would recommend to anyone. we never leave when we are suppose to. the pay is not good . the mangers are rude. they expect you to get all your work done( whitch is not that bad but) plus the work that the manger is supposed to do
good,it's okay. not my first choice for a job. not even my last choice for a job. family dollar company over work their employees for very little pay and are never happy about how their stores look
good,I enjoy working for Family Dollar. I wish they have more staff during the day to get more accomplished. You arr able to grow within the company and the pay is great.
good,Loved this job at first but I guess because I was only 21 at the time I got passed over for a management position (even though I was assistant manager at time) for someone who didnt even know how to do my job so I had to help her do hers
good,"A typical day at work would includes coming in, logging into your register, counting down your drawer to make sure you start at 100. Depending on the day, you would out out freight, ring in orders on a cash register, clean and stock shelves. I learned how to quickly ring in items into a register. It's very hard to get in contact with anyone in management higher than the district. He was not the best to work for, The hardest part of the job is working the hours for very little pay. Management barely makes over minimum wage, The most enjoyable part of the job was my co workers."
good,Great environment. Needs more hours issued to sales associates than managers. All around great up keep. No associate discounts. Getting paid every week was a plus.
good,Family Dollar is a nice place to work. It helps you build your customer service skills and learn work perspective. It also helps you build character. A typical day of work is stocking merchandise and providing customer service.
good,A great place to work at with plenty of laughter and ways to be a productive member of society. I learned how to operate an electric pallet jack the correct way.
good,"I love interacting with our customers, just looking for better job opportunities. The stall all get along. It's like we are one big family. There are a few things I would change if I could."
good,Safety is a major concern of mines working there with how many times we've been robbed and they still fail to hire security..... Turn over rate real high and as a manager I Have no life
good,As a salaried manager you are required to work 52 hours but in actuality you will work 60+ hours a week. You can not have a weekend off. Different DMs tweak company handbook to accommodate their beliefs. As an hourly employee you won't have any hours or work a set schedule to be able to work a second job. And no matter your position you are expected to be on call.
good,store manager position is hard with very little support from upper management. Salary position usually working way more than the 52 hrs required more like 60 to 75 hrs per wk. You manage yourself more than you manage others.
good,a lot of standing walking and greeting customers not bad your personality has to be a-1 but very rewarding if your a motivate employee
good,My days at Family Dollar have been great. I've learned so much during these months. Only issues I had with it is that we were so understaffed and I was the only that could be there for most of the week so I had the most hours meaning that I did the most work. i sometimes had to do the manager's job. There are no bonuses and you can only move up if there's a position empty. I got paid minimum wage while also doing manager duties which didn't seem fair to me. What I enjoyed about this job is the customers. I enjoyed helping them with what they needed. It is also very flexible if you're in need of a part-time job (unless the store's understaffed then you will get more hours).
good,I've aquired skills at being a cashier. Constant chance for growths. Constant change and adjustments. Promotion every two years
good,Working here was a good experience for it being my first job. The workers were friendly and I enjoyed my time working with them.The hardest part of the job to me was making sure that every customer didn't wait for more tan 2 minutes in the checkout line. The environment is welcoming and you'll feel right at home
good,"The work was fairly easy but interfered with my daily life even though I was only supposed to work part-time hours. "
good,"A Typical work day would be coming into the work place and having a register drawer that I have to count and make sure all the money is accounted for. Then I would go to my register and begin scanning customers and building a friendly report with customers. I learned how to be a team player by coming in to work everyday on time and being a leader by making group decisions. I feel it could have been run more professionally, meaning the communication between leads and employees should be more clear ; everything was always rushed and unorganized. My co-workers were good people because we all worked hard together and made light work with many hands."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of starting out on the register. After I'd finish up with my first few customers, I would go on to stocking. In the midst of stocking, I also worked register. Management was professional, but the co-workers were extremely lazy and unwilling to help."
good,Didn't really get to do much but rim the register .really couldn't clean or stock or help really just cashed the customers out did what I could then I changed to a place where I could move up in the company
good,Just do your job. Be patience with the customers. Help out as much as you can. Be consider of other people. Do what you are asked to do. Stay perspective
good,The work/life balance was tough as you spent a lot of time away from your family.  I was promoted often and was asked to do a lot of stretch assignments that I performed to the highest level as I help Milwaukee as a D.M. as well as Rockford in 2 separate occasions.
good,It's a very simple job and everyone is willing to help you out if you just ask. It's a very straight forward time that you have to work so theres not much time to do anything else.
good,Did everything the store manager should be doing but he never wa there and then got fired for things I didn't  know how to do.
good,"Work days go by very fast,some issues with different aspects of the job,if more would work as part of a team,the workload on others wouldn't be near as bad as it is"
good,It was a nice job for me to work at during my college breaks. I am now looking for something more stable and advanced. We really didn't have any breaks. I worked full time hours. The scheduling was very flexible for me due to the fact that I attend college.
good,open or close store unload truck fill in shelves complete the daily tasks assign tasks to employees help guests with any issues or questions
good,management could have been better. the pay was not good for all the effort that was put in. on tuesdays is when it was time to unload truck and then wensday mornings we had to stock shelves. our back room was small and the manager could never keep up with the work.
good,"Family Dollar in a typical work day was busy, meeting lots of people, providing cutomer service, unloading trucks, cashiering, training, marketing, merchandising, displays, pricing, flow of mechadise, dates for quality products. My overall experiance was great. In order to further my education I choose another career."
good,The best part was working with the public. I could give a smile to anyone even though they were not smiling when they came in. I love stocking the shelves and cleaning. The bad part was very little benefits. the scheduling was very inconsistent.
good,Family Dollar Gave me an incredible opportunity to grow as a mentor and a leader. I am now looking to further my career bringing with me extensive experience in single unit and multi-unit management.
good,"Being a cashier at family dollars on N Grand Ave. everyday was a busy day for. I had to speed on the pace and bring personality with me everyday. I enjoyed the co-worker I worked with.Hardest part about the job was dealing with customers. Sometimes it seem as if they were on edge or impatience, but I had to learn to keep my cool and keep a smile on my face. The most enjoyable part about the job is that it was around my area."
good,"I really enjoyed my co-worker and I like working at the store, I learn how to read label right and how to count your drawer and how to declare a register and what certain sections in the store are called."
good,"I have learned how to effectively manage and run a small staff of 4."
good,There were some long days like truck days.Also management was helpful.The co-workers are very fun and hard working. Hardest part of working there is relying on upper management for further details.
good,"Family Dollar allows growth, both personal and professional. Merger with Dollar Tree will allow for open doors to everyone and more improved time production and better purchasing opportunities"
good,I really enjoyed the training and growth I received while employed.  My manager was firm but helpful which I believe is effective.
good,Great place to work for a first time job. Great managers and fun people to work with. Fast pace environment with good experience. Opens you up to meeting new people through customer service and experience with cash handling. Opportunities to move up in positions.
good,Family Dollar was not the best job. The managers did their jobs correctly but the Assistant Managers never really work to the best of their ability. Although the cashiers seemed to work harder then the Assistants on some days.
good,"I enjoy my co-workers very much as well as majority of the customers. Management is very good, you are able to share any concerns with them and they do handle the situation as need be. I have learned a lot from the community, main thing is learning that the customer is always right, you don't know what that person is feeling or going through. Don't take it personally. The thing that is the hardest part of the job would be standing on cement floors for long periods. But that comes with the job."
good,"This was a great job for me, when I really needed one but due to it being in such a small town and having so little traffic, hours were constantly an issue."
good,Meeting new people everyday and helping who ever needs it. Making sure the store looks nice and presentable. Restocks of merchandise so customers can purchase more bringing in more profit for the company and helping them grow.
good,"Typical work day was very fast paced"
good,"The job is funny, unpredictable, and good to earn a little extra money. I have been working with this company for a little over a year and a half now. Priceless imformation that i will use for a lifetime."
good,"A regular day at family dollar is working the front register and ringing up customers, restocking products on the shelves, i also did truck shipments every week. i learned to handled different types of customers and how to organize truck shipments. i loved working with my fellow employees they all brought different personalities to the work place which made working more enjoyable.hardest part of the job was weekly truck day where we had to take items off the truck and organize them i the back warehouse. most enjoyable part, was getting to work with my crew members they always made my day better."
good,A typical Day of work at Family Dollar Distribution Center is picking up boxes and setting them on conveyor systems. I learned how to pick orders for shipping purposes. management is very professional and lets employees know what tasks need to be done for the day.
good,long hours and worried about my job at time i feel like Family Dollar dont care about there workers. Plus not sure how long this job will last
good,The management and co-workers were extremely nice. The hardest part was dealing with angry costumers. It was a little scary at night in the neighbor hood I was in but management never let my side and we have a great security system.
good,"If it had been in a better enviroment, I would have stayed longer. I was robbed at the store a customer came in went in the back and stole my coat and other belongings, which was a typical day there I just felt abandoned by my employers it just seemed as if no one cared. I was never given a bit of remorse or concern, I was actually ask to finish my shift."
good,"Awesome place to work, able to meet new people and learning."
good,My day at work was fun I loved talking to the consumers I learned how to become a better team player with my co-workers.The hard part was trying to keep people happy but I found ways to do so and the most fun thing  about my job was just knowing I have one so I can provide for my family.
good,"I worked days, nights, and weekends, learned more in the retail industry, management was good to work with, co-workers were good folks, hardest part of job would be the heavy lifting of products and watching for thieves, I enjoyed all parts of working with the company."
good,"I worked with this company for 4 years. I enjoyed it, I wasn't happy about leaving but I had to for heath reasons, I have luckily been able to put in my past. This is a job were you need to be 100% you need to be on your game at all times, the areas I had stores in the customers would try to steal right in front of you. The freight was timely, every week you had to come up with game plains as to what you were going to do to sell out of all you were shipped before it went on sale. Gross profile was your goal, minimal loss that include the payroll and the product. Everyday the cash was checked and re-checked, the registers were maned, the freight was handled and inventory was checked, the store was cleaned and picked up. Schedules made, people interviewed, drug tests administered, training employees and new managers to take their own store. Customer service being at the top of your list."
good,My typical day at work I open store and I learned alot about assistant manager position. My co workers were very easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was unloading the weekly truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and greeting new people that I still see and remember today and they remember me.
good,"I enjoyed the experience as it was. The employees were interesting, there was some fun to be had, the work was very demanding and often overwhelming, all and all if you go in with a positive attitude and a strong will to succeed it was a very pleasant place to be employed."
good,"Handling cash, working with retail, food/groceries, electronic merchandise."
good,"The majority of my shifts i go in and sign onto my register and immediately start customer service. Depending on the day of the week (Thursdays-Sundays) i will put stock away while ringing on the register or i will solely focus on unloading the Family Dollar Truck and getting stock out onto the floor. At the end of the night we recover where we pull everything forward on the shelves, make sure items are forward facing, the shelves are stocked and cleaned, finding room for over-stock, ect. When new merchandise comes in i will help with the resets and getting old items out and the new items in. For just almost all of the past year i have been there i have been training for management but keep getting ""stepped over"" and the hours are too inconsistent for me to raise a family on. I love working as a team and being able to ensure that a store is running smoothly and that when customers come in they are welcomed by a clean environment and they know they will be able to either find what they are looking for on their own or an employee WILL be there to help them. I enjoy making sure a store is stocked and ready for every day business and personally see myself being able to help a company grow. The hardest part is never knowing if im going to have hours from week to week and as a mother i need more stability, and now i feel like my abilities are not going to be able to be put to use because i do not want to over step anyone's toes ect."
good,Show good customer service. Checkout patients at cash register & also meet all expectations of store.
good,"The job is fair, cooperation with coworkers was not good, the atmosphere is stressed which is not normal for retail and the management was fair."
good,"Assisted customers, stocked product."
good,Lots of fun. The owner is a little crazy with the rules though. Not very trusting of the employees.
good,"A typical day at family dollar was coming in making sure all paperwork and cash is correct from the night before. When store opens up make sure all customers were greeted and helping them with there needs. Management was ok ...the hardest part was truck day because your help might not show up ,the most enjoyable part was getting the work done and making sure the store looks great.The co workers great"
good,I liked my job .The people interaction was great. My manager was very helpful.
good,"A typical day at work would be keeping up on the store "
good,Opening or closing sometimes.Cashiering and assisting customers with questions as well locating items.Counting Till at the beginning and end of everyshift sometimes worked doubles
good,"Family Dollars is a great place to work, but not enough advancement opportunites."
good,honestly I only worked there to help out a family member and my work wasn't being appreciated but overall family dollar is a wonderful place to shop and have great customer service
good,"I believe that some managers favorite people, then there was a few rules i didn't get that wasn't fair, like mangers have there phone listen to music but employees could not."
good,Most of the workday is spent doing recovery and helping the customers at register.  There are usually plenty of opportunity for management advancement.
good,It was for the most part what I expected it to be. I didn't like the fact that managers and supervisors were risking their lives to catch thieves that didn't care one way or the other if they went to jail or were caught stealing!
good,"i worked with money and customer service cleaning,repacks in ext."
good,I enjoyed being employed for family dollar until i relized the befifits where not realy good as far as health benifits
good,"a typical day consists of helping customers, operating registers, maintaing store inventory, and cleaning up the store everynite before closing."
good,I enjoyed where I worked until my manager was ill then things were different.
good,"Family Dollar was a small place so there was always so much to do. we unloaded truck and unload u boats, put the items in the correct places.we were on register,mopped the floor and sweeped the floor."
good,"It was okay .To easy to move up in management,lot of workfor no pay"
good,Terrible experience and had property stolen and the customers were very rude.
good,Assist customers on a daily basis.Hardest part of my job was watching unhappy customers have a bad. Making sure my customers leave happy and smiling.
good,"A typical day at work would be consisted of being a customer service representative as well as working on the cash register. It also consists of stocking and recovering the store. I learned a better way of multitasking and being available at any time. Management is good most of the time, I have learned how to do some management work as well. The team I work with works well with each other. The hardest part of the job is working with team members who do not do their job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customers."
good,"Assist customers with purchases and questions. Process freight. Manage store when store mgr wasn't present. I learned how to open and close the store following Family Dollar's procedures, I also learned how to count down tills and prepare store's deposits. As well as print out end of day reports and email it to the District Manager."
good,"Well maintained company structure, a lot of turn over due to downsizing on employees."
good,The most hardest part is unloading thedelivery truck and things arent stacked correctly.
good,"Learned something new everyday,Customer service was a must"
good,On Fridays we get truck and have to unload truck on that day and then have to put our frieght out. I liked working with my co workers because they did their share of work. The hardest part of the job i would have to say is unloading truck. Most of all I Loved the customers.
good,"The store was in a constant flux. With managers leaving, and co-workers getting fires and new managers coming in there was never really time to get used to the people i work with."
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
good,This company promotess within when able. You get alot of on the job training and work atmosphere is casual
good,"I worked at Family Dollar for a few months but overall I liked it. Awesome environment, employees were cool, and my manager was cool. It is kind of strict in the sense that everything has to be done at a certain time. Gained a lot of work experience."
good,I had no problems working there all tho I feel like they should pay more but other than that it was a nice experience and I wouldn't made working for them again
good,Working at Family Dollar was a great experience for me. So many friendly customers some what's not. Knowing when your customer is having a wonderful day or not. Can help you a lots when you're on cashier. If you customer has to be somewhere soon. You should be able to get them out quickly. If not you may ask if they found everything that was looking for.
good,"Working on family dollar helped me develop skills to work in a team, serve the client in the friendliest way and make it feel at home, so do physical activities of unloading merchandise"
good,Working here is a somewhat easy. It’s a hardworking job. It’s pretty much like every other customer service job. It’s pretty much helping customers and stocking and keeping area neat and nice.
good,At the time that I was working at Family Dollar I would only advise them to train their store management properly before the store management is to try and train the assistant managers other than that I enjoyed my job
good,It was ok just not enough matrix hours to keep store up . Not enough pay and they work you hard for that little check. Just make the best out of it to live
good,I like this job because it keep you busy and on your feet . There always something for you to do no matter the times of the day . You get a lot of happy people .
good,Family dollar was a great experience and amazing environment for me ! I take what I learned great customer service from there I take everywhere with me.
good,I would say the hardest part of this job was dealing with rude customers & customers who would come in & steal items from the store & we would have to run after them
good,No bad parts about the job I really loved being around the environment of helping customers find things they need and just having a great team Surrounded around me to keep me motivated and learning good customer service skills
good,It was a wonderful work atmosphere and I enjoyed my time there. The customers that were regulars we built a bond with. Altogether interacting with the customers was the best part for me.
good,"As a assistant Manager I feel I should be paid more than $10. We deal with a lot from store maintenance, theft, and computer issues. Overall, family dollar is a great place to work."
good,Worked here for a while it was nice alway showed up on time stocking was easy didn’t have any issues with employees we had a great team will go back maybe
good,"A typical day at work- Loading boxes"
good,The job was okay management could’ve been Better better pay at least more closed holiday there were some days fast paced sims really slow location was by local apt complex
good,They worked with you on hours and undertsood when there was an issue at home. At times we felt like family everybody was cool with everybody easy to talk to
good,As being a stocker always keep shelves neatly arrange. Be on time and well rested on truck day. And always no the cashier experience just in case there was a call in or no show.
good,The location sucked so I had to deal with the most irate of customers. The other employees there started telling me that I didn't need to come in. At first thought it was just not busy. This became a habit so I asked manager if I had done something wrong. They refused to tell me what I did over the phone. I finally go into my next scheduled shift to quit that same day. Never was told what I did wrong.
good,This job was community based but i had been working another job also at the time so it was my second place of business. I took it because it paid more than my first gig but i enjoyed the hours they gave me and the employers were really helpful and inviting.
good,I loved working for this company but .....my truck tore up on me and I had no way to get to work and also...I wasn't making enough to travel how far I had to go.....
good,Raises every year and vacation time was nice. Security was awful we would work by ourselves just one person a shift. We would unload trucks weekly and stock daily
good,"Working for family dollar is ok. It’s not hard to move up in position in the company because of the high turnover rate, but the job does require you to have open availability and requires you to be flexible."
good,The people I worked there with made it a good job and my customers  the company sometimes made things confusing but you learn to work with it.   You do what they want and all is good
good,As long as you work hard and do your job you get promoted. It's a good place to work. Management is good. The system is easy to learn. There is always something to do.
good,Family dollar is okay it’s enough to get me by . The pay isn’t so great but I can’t complain it’s keeping my bills paid with food on the table to feed my kids
good,It’s a great place to work always meeting new people and doing new things.  It’s a very interactive company As far as conference calls and manager meetings to help us keep learning new and better things as people and as a business.
good,Family Dollar gave me the opportunity to have that manager experience.The management was pretty sloppy but overall the experience was great just very low staffed.
good,"It was my first job as a teen, I liked it. But thinking about it now they can do better with their employees. And they need to have better cameras a lot of customers be stealing."
good,A typical work day is pretty balance with pace and things to do. When the inventory truck arrives the day is more fast paced with things to do. The culture is pretty comfortable depending on your coworkers.
good,Working at my job has its up and down  has to look out for people that come into the store go take things some customers are rude have to be always polite no matter what is the problem
good,"It’s a great working environment days always seem to go by fast, flexible hours great co-workers mostly. Decent pay, the hardest part of the job has to be dealing with customers they’re know for being brutally rude. Management is a10/10 for me they help you out with replacements anytime you have emergencies."
good,I liked working at family dollar at first til they started making me do more then I was allowed. I was very good worker customers would compliment the way the store looked because I always tried my best to keep the store clean and organized and the manager took that to the head always tryna make me do their work plus mines..
good,"i really enjoyed working there. it was a great experience with some great people. i was able to move up in the ranks fairly easy, and enjoyed every minute of it"
good,"When I began my work at Family dollar, I started as a cashier  and was very quickly promoted to an assistant manager,  where I had a variety of responsibilities and would began my day by opening the store, handling inventory, interacting with customers. As a manager I was also trusted to open and close the registers and count the money, deposit the money for the bank, and close the store at nights. I also learned to build my communication skills along with my leadership skills. The workplace was very cultured many different nationalities and people from all over the world. Good customer interaction would be the part I enjoyed the most but dealing with shoplifters/ theft was the hardest part about my job there."
good,"I really liked working there. The co-worker was nice and friendly, it was a nice experience. There were always something to do there, example; stocking shelve, cleaning, helping out with customer etc.."
good,For me to have been a manager i shouldve got paid more. For the work that was done is alot to be 10.50 i really think we should be gettn paid way more then wat were getting paid
good,You meet a lot of new people is a great atmosphere a space sometimes is relaxing the team members are fun to be around loving caring respectful they have great hours and flexible times
good,"It was a really good job, good people to work with, amazing customers, I just needed a job that paid more than they did, but overall enjoyed my experience there."
good,okay pay for cashiers... not so much for a assistant but I guess that was because I wasn’t experienced... bt still warehouse works make more..........
good,Very stressful very overwhelming with no help at all ! The job was ok at the beginning you work work work and just keep working when ever you fall on your face no one is coming to help
good,If you can handle lifting 50+ pound objects and being on your feet for 12+ hours this is a great job for you. Everyone keeps to themselves and has their own quota.
good,At family dollar depending on the location at times it was stressful being that it was only a cashier at the register while the store was full of customers.
good,Depending on your job title sometimes the days/nights would be very long due to being short staffed sometimes but we always I figured out a way to handle those days and it always worked out.
good,It was an ok job I guess ........... I would work there again but me and management didn’t end on the best of terms due to the changing of hours I’d worked..... I’d work and not get paid for the overtime
good,It is a nice place to work.  I enjoyed working there and made a lot of new friends.  I liked my customers.  For the most part I liked all my managers there were some I didn't care for but I respected them and did my job
good,Manager wasn't uplifting to her employees. It was hard for me to assist my manager because she was back and forth with her decisions. So I had to continue and work as Asm and also Store manager.
good,I really enjoyed working there. The enviroment could get sketchy due to customers and some employees but over all it was pleasent to work there. My manager was amazing and super caring.
good,I liked the job and the people! it’s fairly easy and time consuming. The job is pretty simply really i liked the fact that it was quite usually and you’re really by yourself majority of the time! I’d recommend the job.
good,"I’ve learned at work that in order for you to receive raises and achievements like that you have to be dedicated, determined, & disciplined or you’ll be distracted from your responsibilities at work. Although I never been a manager I can tell you that being an manager isn’t easy as it looks from me being in the outside looking you’d have to have very much patience an ect. The work place culture  wouldn’t really change because in some way it feels like your around family majority of the time.  Also The most hardest thing about the job was finding the sku numbers on the merchandise so that I can locate the items homes in the store.  Lastly but not least the most enjoyable thing about the job is being apart of a team an doing whatever it take to have each other back while providing great quality customer service."
good,I was promoted three times to same assistant manager position within a year.  The biggest issue that I had with employment there is there is no training and you are left to fend for yourself.
good,For the most part its an amazing job especially if you enjoy working the register and stocking. you get to interact with the customers. So if your a people person then the job is perfect for you. There are some slow days then there's days where everything picks up and becomes face paced.
good,"The work days would vary every day it was a pretty easy job assignment."
good,It definitely kept me on my toes in a good way. I enjoyed going to work and there being different goals to be accomplished every day. My boss (store manager) was very understanding and worked with my schedule in every way possible.
good,"Everyday consisted on stocking shelves and cleaning the store, also taking care of customers. Unload the truck once a week and stock. Hours were being cut every week. Had a good work environment"
good,"its a nice place to work just stay to yourself and focus on your work"
good,as assistant manager the days were long but usually not too stressful. the hardest part was dealing with loss prevention and bad customers. good job all in all
good,Working in the family dollar was sometimes slow paced. have to keep the store clean and try to memorize whats in each aisle so when directing a customer to their wants you know where to point them out at.
good,Over all I enjoy work for this company not stressful keeps you moving . if you're a great worker they are willing to go let you work at different locations to maintain hours
good,It is a great work experience for some one starting out in a work field to build up a work ethic. Teaches you hard work management skills and much more.
good,"Fast-paced job, teaches you to be organized, teaches you how to maintain patience, how to manage money, it also teaches you about inventory. And how to understand what items goes where"
good,Overall great slower paced job to have however with as much work that's required to be done the pay is fairly low. Our responsibilities remain fairly high with fewer hours for cashier's so many times you're left alone working which is also not the ideal situation.
good,"My duties are the usual clock in, clean work area, count down my drawer money, and greeting the customer while walking in family dollar. I've learned how to suggest a sale and be more of aware of things and issues. The work place is very friendly and helpful. I enjoy working there especially when I'm scanning customer items and bagging them."
good,"The hardest part of the job wasn't the job itself, it was the environment. The store was cluttered when I got there and when I left, it looked so much better."
good,I would have to take the stocks down. I had to move the things to different parts of the store. I would have to use the items Sku numbers to figure out where the items belong and restock multiple shelfs.
good,"You get to meet many people and talk to them, I've made some life long friends when i worked here and some great coworkers. I got to assist customers and interact with so many people."
good,"I don't really remember all this. I was in High School when I worked this job. It was ok, but I hated running the register. Pay was fine when I had no bills."
good,"What can I say about the family dollar... They had rats!!  Period, The inspector came shut us down until it was cleaned up.  I had to inhale both bleach and aroma while having to lift each aisle to not only see dead rats but rats in tramps, rat droppings and urine that was the cruelest thing I've ever endured in my life for $8.50. Just thinking about that makes me wanna cry and your lucky I haven't sued you. A rat fell from the ceiling.... the ceiling omg."
good,"Positive engery, plenty of work to do whether it's cleaning, stocking, fronting or helping customers. Great place to learn managment and climb higher."
good,"With 9 year in this company,  I've learned they are not very good to their employees, schedules are ridiculous and never even close to the same from week to week! They treat you like and let you know you are replaceable anytime,  no backup for employees,  you are there to make them money and could care less how they treat you to do so!"
good,"The company was flexible with my schedule. As I worked here, I was also a full-time college student. They made it easy to study and earn a living. I was satisfied with my experience."
good,The people I worked with were nice and it was a good environment. They were very short staffed though so it was very fast paced and too much work to get done in your shift.
good,Family Dollar wasnt a bad place to work for. It just really lacked of employees being on time or even showing up for their shifts. There where days I would have to do open to close. Wich I didnt mind it would just be like if I can show up everyday on time and not ever call in others should be able to do the same. Other then that awesome workplace.
good,I worked at 2 different stores due to moving and the first store I worked at was amazing and was well organize and kept together followed rules as well as keeping a good environment. The second store was all over the place not organized the store manager was unorganized unprofessional and very rude.
good,It fun to do peaceful ah little bit too. The stocking does get kind of boring and stressful looking for the correct spot if there's no items out but it Is also fun and a cool job for a beginner
good,I loved working for family Dollar very easy work to do people are great but I wish gave more hours than I got have kids to take care of and bills to pay
good,This position is very fast paced.  It orients around truck inventory.  Truck comes in and needs to be stocked immediately. I learned to work as a crew and expedite inventory very quickly.  The most enjoyable part of this position was helping the customers with current sales and finding specific items.
good,"Overall as a company, it is a good career choice. Very easy to advance within the company. Rewarding and challenging. There is room for improvement within store level, but a great company to start and continue a career."
good,Was ok short term job manager was cool but lazy just talked a good game. Favoritism again with managers and certain associates. Small discount but workers don’t value their jobs
good,"It was a great opportunity, too much to do for the pay. Enjoyed the the customer service experience recieved. But there was too much to do. Running register and stocking shelves."
good,It's an ok place to work if you have a significant other to help back you up on the bills. Or if you have a steady second job. I've learned to communicate with customer easier.
good,Family Dollar is a fairly decent place to work. In my experience I enjoyed working there but the store manager who has become the DM never really did anything. He would sit on the computer for hours and be on his phone taking personal phone calls. He wasnt the best manager due to his micromanagement operating style. Few employees liked him and fewer customers liked him.
good,"Cash management, team building, property maintenance, developing coaching, training and mentoring, customer relations, inventory management, shrink management"
good,Its an ok job but not if you are trying  to live alone only way to actually be able to live with the paycheck  from there is if you're management. $7.50/hr and less than 36hr a week didn't make the cut for me.
good,"Decent work, although a lot was expected to be done within the very few hours that were given, management was poor however got better during recent times"
