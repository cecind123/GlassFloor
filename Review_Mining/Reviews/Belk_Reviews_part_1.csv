rating,review
bad,One should expect to work hard with no return results.You will not recieve fair pay for the many jobs you will be assigned. Managers are unfriendly and love to mico manage employees. Not a family friendly company.
bad,No communicatuion disorganized do not offer any extras for part time. Do not offer enough hours does not recycle cardboard negative team building intimation from management
bad,Worked in the Coolsprings Belk and in the beginning the Management team treated everyone with respect and everyone was happy. New Management was brought on board and the Store back a different place. Unhappy employee's and management that thought it was better to do things in a way they learned at a different company instead of learning how things worked in a new business to them. Good employees left because of these people and customer appeal in the store dropped too.
bad,"Morning meetings begin with opening credit cards for customer. And as many possible daily,email capture. All they care about are credit credit credit."
bad,I would not recommend anyone work for this company. It hasn't been the same since it was sold. Poor management and no support for long term employees. Their is favouritism towards certain employees
bad,"Good benefits for part and full time, management not too receptive to ideas, store policies are not followed, great holiday dinners and decor, management plays favorites, also talks about employees as if they are beneath them, merchandisers are not appreciated, truck team might as well be invisible, never get to have thanksgiving dinner with family, no time and a half on holidays."
bad,"No upper management supports you until you complain. After you complain, you have a target on your back. No one is friendly and they're all very judgmental."
bad,"Terrible management -lost view of what happens in store and confused to what is needed in the bigger picture"
bad,I feel very mistreated and there was only small shore hours for seasonal and I feel very unknowledgeable very disrespectful I feel the hours that they gave me was not right and they could have gave me more hours for seasonal help
bad,They never have the schedule made two weeks in advance like they say they would. They expect you like to revolve around them. They don't let you know when they've approved or deny your schedule request or when you change your availability so if you're working more than one job don't this one.
bad,Horrible management all around. They change your schedule without notice just epic you to check your schedule 24/7. Always go back on things they tell you. Had a manager always talk about me behind my back when I was a hard worker and did what I was suppose to do. Never trust anything they say cause it usually lie. Not a place I would ever work at again.
bad,Poor management style. Very under appreciated unless you open credits. Nothing else seems to matter. Not allowed to speak up with ideas or criticism. Favoritism.  HR does not support employees. Most managers only care about their particular departments. Not treated as human beings with lives beyond Belk.
bad,Terrible managment. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!! This place was good at first and went down hill fast. They dont treat their people right and expect way too much. Pay isnt enough and others are rude.
bad,Belk changed there insurance and it covered nothing and charged associates more.  Belk allowed management and human resources manager to talk to managers and employees horribly.  The Human Resources manager from corporate never came up and spoke to any body on how they we're treated.
bad,The supervisors and managers were very messy and unprofessional. The co-workers were nice enough and helpful. The pay isn't worth it considering how much work they make you do. Security was awful so don't even both trying to call them for help. Overly forceful about the credit card process. They make staff basically harass customers until they are uncomfortable.
bad,Regional mgrs tell you how to catch shoplifters when they have never caught anyone. L.p. is a joke in every aspect. Shrink is so high they will get control
bad,"Literally was the worst job I’ve had, management was horrible and no one had a clue of who was who or how anything worked. The way employees and even customers were treated is not acceptable."
bad,Management is not good. You have no hours & even if you beg you don’t get hours. There is completely 100% favoritism. You are expected to do more than what your job title requires without any communication. No matter how hard you work no one will thank you or care at all. Not enough hours or pay to take care of a household.
bad,"My experience at Belk was very poor. I came in at a time that the store manager was let go due to medical reasons and we didn’t have a manager for a while. Corporate treated our Assistant Store Manager poorly, she deserved so much more for all her hard work keeping that store afloat. Staffing wasn’t handled well, it got messy with too many people having a hand on it. Overall store moral was AWFUL!"
bad,"The employees here are very friendly and easy to work with.  Management turnover is high.  No employee reviews therefore, no raises.  No room to grow.  No hours to work."
bad,Horrible experience.  Management was very unprofessional and uncaring.  I was assaulted by another employee.  I was let go and she was allowed to keep her job.
bad,"Always changing your schedules. Never give you the correct information."
bad,"Terrible place to work management talks down to their employees like a dog store manager has no backbone in the take charge role they are responsible for. Poor communication with employees and customers , along with terrible pay and little room for advancement unless you are part of the click."
bad,"Ethically, this is not a good place to work. There is minimal room for advancement. They do not respect the opinions of the employees. They seldom give raises and when they do your evaluation, it does not depict your hard work and dedication towards the company."
bad,"Training is non existent, horrible human resources department & hostile work environment. You are expected to perform & be held accountable for a job that you have never been properly trained to do."
bad,Staff mark management sucks you really left out to dry without any lead way. I would rather go back to amazon because they are more organized than Belk distribution center
bad,Belk does not care about its employees. Never given help to complete tasks. Very political there. The store manager is very immature. Corporate does not support the employee. Sacrificing your personal life to work at Belk with no appreciation or compensation. Hard work is not appreciated.
bad,Perfect for someone that want to earn extra money especially during the holidays. Excellent markdowns and great employees discount. No room for advancement
bad,Belks takes advantage of their good workers. They have a I don’t care type of attitude. If it’s not benefiting them or their company then they really could care less. They show favoritism towards different employees. Management I feel is poor.
bad,"I worked at the Shreveport Belk for about a year. It started off great, plenty or hours, decent pay. After Christmas there was a drastic change. Everyone in the store received raises except for a handful of people. We were getting scheduled 4 hours a day for 2 days out of the week. After having numerous talks with him about issues, he would joke about us not leaving the company because he felt we couldn’t do better. The store manager himself was very rude. He’s only in his mid twenties and talked to us like we were children. When talking he would point his fingers in our faces and never handled altercations like they were supposed to be handled. He would always side with the people who were at Belk longer “his leaders”. He gossiped with employees and never showed the respect to his team. Managers are supposed to manage, but I don’t think he is ready for the position yet."
bad,Belk isnt a place to work if you have a family. They pick and choose who is allowed full time. Belk doesnt want to pay out for insurance nor vacation is why they dont have many full time workers. Belk will keep people on part time and work some full time hours. Management is poorly the drama is high level.
bad,I worked at Belk for 11 years and was fired for being out with the flu and a temp of 104. I trained 2 people and worked 3 weeks after I returned back from my sick leave and they fired me because of attendance (being out under doctors orders with the flu). I also had sick leave and was paid for the time I was out of work. I would never recommend anybody to work for Belk. That company is horrible and the pay is low for what you're expected to do.
bad,"The management is poor when it comes to training. There was cliques. They would give me no hours, no matter how much I tried to get more. Which is completely unrealistic when it came to getting all the work done that was required of me."
bad,Very unorganized and no trading. Get out ther and do it yourself kind of thing.  Everyone thinks their the boss. There is no direction and scheduling is a disaster and never on time. Constant changes. Just crazy period
bad,They are bad at training  and they blame their employees  for their mistakes.  I hope the company  parishes. They really need to be investigated for  poor employment  history.
bad,"The store manager was not concerned with the employees, only the bottom line. The training is lacking. It is not easy to trust the management. There was a very stressful enviornment."
bad,"This store is a JOKE! (Especially ladies dept). The Management is horrible, if I can give them -1 star I would. They expect way too much and are not appreciative. When the store manager is in a bad mood she takes it out on all the little people and talk to people like they are not human. The sales managers are lazy and will not help you with anything. Scheduling is terrible they expect you to work 8 hours and not give you any one to cover your break. If you do good in credits and emails you are their favorites and can get away with anything. They want you to act like robots, smile and don’t talk to your coworkers. Feels like slavery working there. They do not care about what you have going on personally, even if its a family emergency. They are really selfish. They will hang up in your face and talk about you. There’s a lot of gossiping and if you think something is going to stay between you and management ha! think otherwise. Advancement is no such thing there, they do not advance from within. People that physically work hard are treated the worst. Pay is definitely not competitive they give full time people low wages and will not give them more than 30 hrs a week. The store is a mess and they blame you for it but they will not give you any help during the day so you can clean. They want you to check out customers, clean dirty fitting rooms, clean the whole store, stock and meet your metrics with you being there by yourself with no help and no lunch. It takes a positive person to work there and stay because there’s simply nothing but negative people (management) and too much"
bad,Schedule not posted in a timely manner.  Work til midnight for November to December.  Time off requested was not communicated to employee requests.  Had to ask three different people about time off requests the old pass the buck.  The only way to get time off is to call out sick! On your feet long hours and expected to clean disgusting dressing rooms quickly and frequently. By no means flexibility in schedule by flexible hours
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, unappreciative,   not enough hrs , you have fo work every single holiday, no opportunity for advancement"
bad,There is nothing good I can say about this company.  The management is selfish and doesn't care about the associates who do all the work.  My experience was horrible.  2 years of nothing but stress.
bad,Any advancement was already decided. Management hoarded overtime hours for themselves. Unethical management. Hostile work environment. Slanderous and unethical culture.
bad,Very stressful constantly made to feel like you would be fired.  60 + hr workweeks Job description constantly changing not enough help on sales floor.
bad,"Do not work here.  They tell you to drink the koolaid and do what management says, even though management is poor and has no direction.  Your ideas do not matter, there’s a reason why positions are always open."
bad,"Race/gender base pay, no organization, bad management, blatant favoritism. Overall I wouldn’t recommend his job to my worst enemy. No opportunity for advancement. Was promised full time when first started, but they lied. Don’t waste your time. Put in at literally any other store."
bad,Stressful and lots of fake people working there lots of favoritism pay was great but I just couldn’t do it anymore if I did have to complain to the store manager or a manager they didn’t really care to fix my problem
bad,"There is no consistency in the store."
bad,"I work in the stock room. As such I'm expected to unload 1000 box trucks in 2 hours, stock racks that are over crowded, and set sales that they give little to no time to do. I currently work 9 hours a week because my departments hours got cut and I'm still expected to get trucks unloaded completely and all  merchandise tagged and put out in the 4 hours i work in one day. My top issue Is my department runs this store and we get paid less than every other department in the store. On top of all this the managers do nothing all day and complain that your too slow the entire time. Would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Had to take this position just to help out around the house.  I came with managerial experience and they low balled the pay rate. At the time of evaluation they wanted to give a ten cent raise.  With all the hard work and praise I received.  I left due to feeling unappreciated for my work ethic.
bad,"My experience was less than desired. No opportunity for advancement. Environment was hostile and executive management, managed their managers with threats of loss of job all the time."
bad,Under pay . over worked. Mandatory working holidays and blocked off days during inventory time. Not enough workers in floors . cleaning all day after customers that trash store. Store is messy all the time.
bad,"Used to be a fun, family oriented company, with decent pay. Now, it’s stressful, no one cares about you. It’s just about credit, save the sale, e-mail captures,  phone number and then there is finally your sales.  It seams like they are trying to get rid of all the full time and people who have been with the company for years. Not to mention that they have cut everyone hours drastically."
bad,"While my job as a full-time sales associate was surprisingly enjoyable and rewarding - interacting with customers and most of my coworkers was truly wonderful 90% of the time - the disorganization, poor communication between employees and management, and abysmally low pay made the job unbearable. Management was erratic and overwhelmingly unhelpful, and during the six months I worked there I found it completely baffling that nobody had seemed to make any connection between the ""problem"" of chronic employee turnover and absenteeism and the stressful work environment that was its primary cause. The vast majority of my interactions with management involved being criticized, insulted, or ignored when I asked for assistance. I was given practically no training but reprimanded for not doing things I'd had no idea I was expected to do, and my attempts to ask for guidance resulted in inconsistent, contradictory information or more often were ignored...managers always seemed to be rushed and too busy to help associates, and often the only time I even saw a manager during my shift was if I spotted one or more of them hanging out and chatting with each other in the cosmetics area. It was almost a blessing when I was fired for taking off too many days (3) immediately following a close family member's death, allowing me the chance to find a more suitable (and much better paying) position in a healthier and more supportive work environment. I'm mostly sad about having seen firsthand why a store I've loved my whole life is failing and not likely to be around much longer. I would not recommend"
bad,They don’t give you more than just 5 hours just do the job and they want you to leave Poor management don’t have the supplies and they expect you to work that way worst place ever to work .
bad,Disgusting workplace! Dirty! I was embarrassed to work there. Rude manager. Constantly asked if I had gotten a credit app. Had to badger customers for their emails so I put down fake ones! Upper management could care less about you as a person. Your job is always threatened. Stay away!
bad,This is the worst company I’ve ever worked for. They have no compassion for their customers and only care about sale goals!! If they focused on the cleanliness of the store and the happiness of the customers as much as they focus on making a sale then this business would do a lot better!
bad,Has adopted a discount store mentality they have tried to dress up with poor quality house brands.  The workload is way more than it should be for the compensation.
bad,"Only fit for people who are ok with being pushed around.  It sucks.  You only advance if you get suckers to get the stupid bell card."
bad,They lie about a lot of things. Everyone is barely trained. And all different. They can’t get the info correct. It was very confusing. I’ve worked in retail for 25 years and this is a very messed up store. No one in charge never knows anything. Very poor operation. Don’t work at the Hagerstown store.
bad,Extremely stressful. If you had a problem or question you where pretty much on your own. You had to call management to rectify the situation. Extremely HIGH TURNOVER! All about the money!!
bad,"Horrible culture, pay, and schedules are a nightmare. They expect 21 days advance notice for PTO, but will change your schedule daily. No training is given, just put on the floor to sink or swim. Unrealistic goals for credit card applications and email captures. 30 hours is considered full time. Management is really unconcerned and uncaring for it's employees. If you have any other choice what so ever, do not work here."
bad,"Made me physically sick. Probably because the building was overrun by rats for more than a year. Management is awful. The insurance isn’t worth having, extraordinarily  expensive but doesn’t cover anything if you go to doctor. Used to be a great company, I worked there for 12 years loved it for about 8 year but the last two years were absolute h*ll. With the exception of Christmas Day and Easter I never spent a holiday with my family. During busy times the work you to death then cut your hours so bad when it’s not peak time that you. Arely have a pay check. I can not say enough about how bad this company has become."
bad,This place is a joke. It's one big revolving door.  They cant keep employees bc they dont value them at all. They will tell you you can have certain days off then 2 weeks later write you up for taking said day off. Worst place to work ever!!
bad,"Horrible!!! The salary listed here is a joke.. there’s no way you could make more than 25,000 a year.. The turnover in this position is very high.. 8 people in the last 2 years at the Farmville location, and none of these people stepped down from the position, they all quit due to the lack of professionalism at this location..there is no training and you are expected to perform the duties with no help. Management constantly gossips about employees, there is no confidentiality, they discuss your pay, your personal life and cant wait to talk about people and there performance. They pushed so much on me when I worked here I actually suffered from stomach ulcers when I left.  They constantly call you on your days off and send threatening text messages. This place is not worth the headache. Keep looking!"
bad,If I could give this establishment a zero out of five stars I would. I asked the manager after working there for almost 7 to 8 months if there was any way I could get a pay raise and she laughed and said get a new job.
bad,"They had multiple people train you and you where often taught wrong. Then you would get in trouble and it wasn't really your fault. Also, they don't accept doctors notes. If you call out sick and come with a doctors note the day still counts against you because you where scheduled to work that day."
bad,"The managers did not care about their employees, they seemed to care about things that were only convenient to them. They say the school is a main priority in the company, however if you give them a school schedule the get hateful with you."
bad,This is the worst place you could ever work please for the love of god don’t do it get out. They will give you no hours and hire more people and no hours. They will set unrealistic sales goals and credit goals and attack you for not hitting them. They are very heavily playing favorites. Don’t do it unless you want to be treated poorly and work three hours a week.
bad,Worst company I ever worked for. Management was horrible only did things once they new cooperate was coming. Didn’t appreciate there associates. Many customer complaints because no workers. Wouldn’t recommend this company or at least the one off glade Euless tx to work at.
bad,I didn't really like the job that much because of the things most of the management did. I also didn't like the way they would show favoritism to certain employees.
bad,Avoid working at the HHI location at all costs! Store Management has no idea what he is doing. Short Staffed because everyone quits after a few weeks of working there. They will have you working non regular full time hours and every Sat and Sun! Manager also makes up a random pay rate for every employee. Does not care for employees only about money $$$. ! Worst job ever. Would not go back if it was the last job on EARTH
bad,"Worked at Belk for over a year!  Never a manager around when needed.  Different rules for different people.  Managers really don’t care about employees."
bad,Too much drama and too many suck ups.  There are too many lazy people getting away with so much and them taking advantage of employees that will work. Most of the work is easy and good pay its just the environment and people
bad,"managers are disrespectful and often makes inappropriate jokes about racism, low pay, fragrance and Lancôme workers are amazing they have the best energy"
bad,"I was hired for seasonal work in September and told I would work six hours a day two days a week to help unload the truck as part of the operations team and would have opportunities to help with stock and fulfillment for more hours. Was also told if I didn't like the operations team I could switch to the stock team. Benefits was employee discount and the ability to put items on hold for two days only the next day it would already be removed from hold by store security even though they saw the date and the employee on the hold tag."
bad,"Once Belk was bought out, things changed bit by bit. Over the past few years, there have been cuts to employee benefits, cuts in merchandise quality, cuts to giving back to the community, and DRASTIC cuts to commission. Pay is messed up on a frequent basis. Training is dreadful."
bad,Rude Customers Even if you try to be positive and kind some customers everyday try to find a reason even if a coupon does not work to be mean and take everything out on you! Best part is your colleagues they KNOW what you both go through so you suffer together Good luck getting those credits!!! A Constant Pressure!!!
bad,"Belk was awful to work for. I was hired as a pt time lancome beauty advisor in Concord NC. And I received incredible training from Lancome but Belk truly set me up to fail. They offered a ""self-guided"" training aka no training. "
bad,"Coworkers and managers at Belk are very sorry. They are rude and don't care about anyone but themselves. Managers are always bound to punish workers when things aren't approved when corporate comes and they gossip way to much for them to be ""professional."""
bad,"awful place to work, no training, never get told what is going on so i look dumb to customers while trying to help. very embarrassing and manager is rude to customers as well."
bad,"Not flexible on hours unless you are one of his favorites. Can't manage that store whatsoever! Customers walk out daily because there is never enough associates to help them. Can't tell you how many times there was only 3 associates on the clock because he wants to save his own budget! They lie to you about hours and offer full time and don't follow through! If you're his favorite, you can be sure to get whatever you want plus lunch."
bad,"Managers only care about themselves.They use you until holidays over then let you go . Favoritism is at an all time high .They don't care about employees....They show Favoritism and cut hours so you can quit after holidays...A typical day will be cleaning rest area that was disgusting at times, taking trash and vacuum floors etc...They pay was not good and the manager only sitnin their desks and eat all day ."
bad,"I took a seasonal position with Belk during the holidays. This was the most unorganized place I've ever been employed. The management and the compensation were trash. I don't know how an adult can work there can keep their sanity. The management speaks to you as if you're only worth what they pay you. I'd never do this again. And one would assume since this is ""Belk"" you would have a good staff and management to work with. WRONG!"
bad,"Horrible transition from Mercantile to Dillard’s to Belk1997-2000. Hopefully they’ve changed since 2000. I always heard the corporate office was a great place to work.  However, local department managers were paid less than half of the mercantile stores salary.  Due to local managements overall lack of respect and support only  3 department managers were left from the mercantile stores merger after four years.  As department managers, we were used to working 12-16 hour days with mercantile and enjoyed our jobs, however,  Belk upper management was unreasonable and biased towards pre-merger branch managers. Processing payroll manually was the biggest challenge.  Had to create my own spreadsheet to get through the process."
bad,soon as you hit the door your running hard to get a break no help you dont see your manager none in the day. Breaks are short and  the pay is way too low for the employees.
bad,I was hired as a full time employee and at first I was working fourty hours per week but then out of nowhere the employees would be lucky to get more than 4 hours twice a week. They cut our hours back tremendously but we’re furious when we were unable to meet the increasing job duties that they piled on within that now insignificant time frame. They had no regard for our safety whatsoever. The store manager was toxic and incompetent calling me various racial slurs during my time there. The only upside was that the employees were bonded in friendship due to our mutual loathing of the managers at this store.
bad,"There are good legitimate reasons why Belk was named among the worse  companies in North Carolina to work for. Middle management has ignorance policy regarding problems. In time these problems fester and become worse. Morale is very low."
bad,Managers are all hateful and uncaring!!!! If you have a family don't work for Belk!!!! Pay scale...JOKE Rediculacto require associates to push credit cards as this creates a stressful and hostile environment!!!! Stressful and Hostile Environment are the best words used to describe working at Belk is like!!!!! MY ADVICE IS DON'T WORK FOR BELK!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Standing on your feet all day. Belk dollars and rewards keep you from meeting your sales goals. No compensation for other work, restocking etc. which drives your sales goals down again!  Then they will cut your pay right after all this.  Point attendance system does not allow you to take care of yourself or your family. Your only promoted when you Know Someone.  Management ""Never"" upholds policy concerning returns, again drives your sales down. Management reduces prices for customers when they ask, again drives your sales down!  Late nights, employees have to do the inventory themselves so 4am early mornings.  No time with your family on the holidays.  No real training for new employees- they unleash newbies straight out onto the floor to deal with customers that have full knowledge of how to beat the system with the couponing, rewards and Belk dollars. All new managers are youngsters with no experience.  Time clocks are manipulated manually with managers code so some people get special treatment.  They push you into working off the clock because of pressure to get things done with little time to do it.  My particular department manager was fantastic but knew all of these issues and did their best to work with it and help in our department but people still got their pay cut, resigned and got fired. Quality of the merchandise has dropped dramatically, so discount wasn't a big deal. Read this carefully before you decide to work at Belk because these are facts."
bad,"i wouldn't want anyone to work here, especially for the holiday for sure because the you get screwed over and they just dont care about the associates. they dont train  anyone to the belk standards but yet expect you to know and the set you up to fail"
bad,"Management was terrible in both belks that I worked in. They did not offer time off and they were unreasonable amounts of time that you could take off, meaning, never. I had to quit due to not being able to take more than one shift off for thanksgiving and my entire family was going out of town"
bad,It’s the worst place to work ever they are rude and don’t care about the people no sick days being 1 minuets late gets you fired so I wouldn’t suggest this job to anyone
bad,"Assist customers with existing credit accounts payments, cashier duties and customer service"
bad,Management is very poor.  Pay is based on matrix and if you don't meet them all not only do you not get a raise - you get a cut in pay!!!!  Pay to too low for the type of work required and there is no management direction or support.
bad,i dont know about belk they seen pretty stuck up to me. You will have to kiss major butt to get anywhere in that company and you will start at the bottom.
bad,"Belk doesn't care about anything but their sales and doesn't care about how the employees were treated or whether the environment was toxic. I quit this job after three weeks because the pay is low for how much stress they put on you. "
bad,"If you don’t look like the basic southern belle you won’t get promoted.  This company is great to start your career, get exposure and learn the trade. Once you gain you experience leave! The pay is horrible the benefits are the worst! You pay out of pocket everytime you go to the doctor full price until you meet you deductible or it’s preventive. Vision and dental are decent plans only upside. They senior leadership team doesn’t care about retention and most have top of the line luxury cars. No need to be concerned where the raises or bonus are because the parking lot says it all."
bad,I have worked for Belk for 11 years and they used to be a great company.  But every since the sycamore group bought them out they treat their employees and managers awful.  They are by far the worst retailer I've ever worked with.
bad,hated job rude co workers awful supervisors very demanding and not family orendtied and changed schedule daily i hated it i would never recomend this place hole to ANYONE
bad,"Everyone is miserable there... store manager is so full of himself. Rediculous in their pay and raises are lousy if they choose to deem you are good enough ... you are lucky to get a dime raise. They treat you disrespectfully and that you are replaceable. God forbid you stick up for yourself. "
bad,"Is never consistent with being regular. Daily people are always calling in and giving short notices or no notice to come in or call. The immediate staff is asked to work overtime to cover the schedule. There is no room for advancement because evaluations are not realistic to meet,"
bad,"The managers are a who’swho of carnival side show from who knows,a reflection of low budget corporate environment Belk bestows rotting from head down."
bad,The customers were very nice and responsibilities were very easy. The management is in need of serious repair. We were told we could do one thing but get written up by a different manager for the same thing. They did not give you the chance to explain yourself when you made a mistake.
bad,"every week a different schedule, you have no time for a part time job ,they wont work with you if you have school, they dont need you are easily replaceable, promises raise if goals are met but only a few are chosen"
bad,"You are trained by watching videos, reading the operating and procedures manual then put in a department by yourself. The team managers are hard to find if you need help. The Store Manager is never seen on the floor during business hours. I was smart enough to fake it until I made it. I enjoyed meeting new people. Customer service is priority. Some customers can not be satisfied and can be very rude. If asked for a manager by a customer, the management will throw you under the bus because the customer is always right. So go ahead and exchange that item. Loss prevention watches on hidden camera and if you aren't constantly working, they tell on you."
bad,"Belk is not the best place to work unless you don't care and just trying to get a paycheck and work part-time. They cut hours, yet increase workload. The managers work A LOT more then the associates. Associates think all they need to do is check customers out instead of also putting up/organizing products, meeting goals, etc."
bad,"The turnover rate in the Belk I worked at was UNREAL! I have never seen a rate that terrible. The company that bought Belk is running it into the ground. They run skeleton crews, under pay staff, cut back on needed supplies, cut positions without notice ... All to show a ""profit"" when they dump Belk to resell to another buyer."
bad,"The only good thing about working at Belk was the discount. if you were one of the fortunate ones to have hours you were responsible for selling even if you had no customers.  Getting credit apps another thing that you had to do daily, if not, your head was put on the cutting block. New management seemed to appear every 8 months or so.  Some of the customers were the most racist people I have ever come across."
bad,"They have been posting this same job since last year, they are nothing more than resume collectors. They wanna stay open so they use the public to show that people are interested in jobs there. Don't fall for it, they are using people who really need work to make themselves look relevant."
bad,This place treated its employees poorly. Expected way too much of everyone but gave way too little in return. I carried entirely too much stress because of this job it was impacting my health.
bad,cleaning dressing room and making customers happy and taking over other people shifts in different departments when they had no call no shows and staying productive
bad,"Very hard worker"
bad,"I don't recommend this workplace at all. Hours are hard to come by, pay is way too low, the pace is slow. No one in management knows how to communicate."
bad,"Bad management, got smart mouths, Don't schedule enough, people that work there pick on people. Does not get appreciated or a good job for working extra hour shifts or get mad when I work my shift and don't stay longer."
bad,I honestly can say this is the first job I have ever hated. I worked in the cosmetics department for a high end brand. The brand I worked for I loved but the management is a joke. The store manager is mean and lacks compassion. The sales team managers let the power go to their head. The benefits are awful. And if you want a social life outside of work FORGET ABOUT IT. they expected for everyone to live their life in belk and forget spending holidays with your family because those are black out dates and you definitely can't have those off. This place is absolutely horrible.
bad,"Poor management, lack of respect for family life, hours long, no weekends free, work every Saturday and all holidays. Extremely competitive, fear of losing job if you do not exceed quota."
bad,"Simple review for those who think about working at Belk's, take my word and DON'T do it. Everything is unfair and the associates will talk pure dirt behind your back, and make you do all their work while they hardly do a thing."
bad,"Mostly of the people that work here are drug addicts and alcoholics , they come to work high or intoxicated not knowing what they're doing o supposed to be doing."
bad,"I worked in an extremely unstructured and toxic environment.  Upper management refused to support your growth or upward mobility.  Job expectations were unrealistic with hours and staff provided.  You wore the hat of every position in the store, from Housekeeping, Sales Associate, to Loss Prevention!  Just know as a Sales Team Manager, you will be expected to get it all done on a minimal salary and with very little support."
bad,"The limited time I worked at Belk I was the only full time employee in the accessories, junior and petite department and was expected to do one job that really needed to be slit between two or three people. I performed all tasks asked of me but could not meet my sales requirements due to all other tasks required of me before I left. Also, they continued to put on my schedule that I am to leave at 9:00 pm but wanted me to stay until 11:00 pm to clean up other departments and be expected to be back at 7:00 am. "
bad,I am terribly disappointed with the culture of this company. You are told one thing and they do another. Very negative environment to work for.This is a terrible company to work for.
bad,"I was recommended for a sales position in the Women's Department. A typical day at work, was intense but productive and fast-paced. The management was amazing. The most enjoyable part of this job was definitely the other employees. They were good friends. The hardest part of the job was probably the starting pay."
bad,"This job is great for teenagers who are entering into the work force. It is not a job for any adult that has any bills other than a phone bill. Their Christmas season starts in Oct. So by December they are replacing ""seasonal workers"". There is no room for growth. You only get hours if you are on the sales floor. And you have to make their sales quota or you will penalized. Also management dangles hours in your face like its a reward."
bad,"The manager of this store is a complete pompous idiot, with no regard to the actual employees working under him. What a terrible establishment, I do not recommend it as a good place to work. I don't know who put this clown in charge."
bad,"I loved my hours at this job, management was a joke!! They did whatever they wanted and made rules as they went.  I didn't like the holiday schedule as management."
bad,"HR manager is terrible- would not give flexibility to students who had classes/exams.  Very stressful, received no training and therefore looked stupid in front of customers.  Older employees are catty and gossip."
bad,"You have to work extra hours and not get paid just so you can keep your job.  They work with intimidation and do not want to pay overtime.  Management is lazy and over paid,  constantly taking breaks while minimum paid associates need to work extra hard. Horrible place to work and favoritism takes a big role, management bend the rules but regular associates are expected to follow them and get written up."
bad,management was very lazy and unfriendly. Management gave you a really hard time if you needed to request off by cutting your hours for the following week or two. They just weren't pleasant to work with
bad,"It was a vary difficult job. They would give you instructions then once you did what they said, they would change everything. There was one instant were I was holding a pair of earrings, that had fallen on the floor. Well, 'the manager claimed I was texting on my phone, which was not true and made me clean all the shoes racks. It wasn't a big deal, but it was vary annoying because I didn't even keep my phone on me."
bad,"Everyday or night on the job consist of the same routine. You learned nothing from management, Their were no hard parts to the job, but none of it was enjoyable."
bad,"crowded, cluttered low quality items. inept management, low pay...work you to death...low morale...customer complaints, horrible schedules...since the take over the whole store is imploding..."
bad,The pay is an insult compared to all the duties I had to perform. It was very stressful. The management team are very low down and dirty. I couldn't take it no more. The managers are supposed to set a positive tone. That was not the case. The managers show favoritism. The ones who work hard and don't cause trouble get treated the worst. There was no real on the job training.
bad,"everyone is overworked and under paid. No team work, lack of leadership, poor management, long hours. It is to much to put on the minimum staff you have"
bad,"very mismanaged, managers do not do their jobs in most cases, they delegate their responsibilities to people who should not be doing what was asked. very hostile."
bad,Working at Belks is a nice company to work for. Don't like working Thanksgiving or Black Friday with Belks being opening 24 hours on those holiday. Most employee are friendly to work with.
bad,Mangers are mean and yell at people and threat you and treat you bad also the hours are bad when they cut hours i was only getting 4 ever 2 weeks and the hour pay was bad to
bad,"The Training was all videos took 3 - 7 hr days to complete, no benefits, if you get close to 40 at 38.5 they pull your hours.  You work your tale off and never feel rewarded.  Just a job."
bad,"Managers are always coming and going and each have their own agenda they expect followed immediately, without introduction. Little to no opportunity for advancement. In general, intolerant of employees who want to attend school part-time- due to hours. Unprofessional management - it's retail, you cannot expect much."
bad,Don't do it unless you want to be known only for your ability to get credits and nothing else cause that's alk they care about even if you get top sales
bad,"The store is infested with bugs, always filthy, management treats you like garbage. They expect the floor to be spotless which is impossible with constant foot traffic! The new store manager is extremely arrogant and will talk down to you. Do not work here. If you're lower down they will treat you like garbage and walk all over you. If you're OTA or a sales team member you'll get treated like royalty."
bad,"I have been at Belk for 8+ years. I have been a cashier and operations associate. Belk was sold to 'Sycamore Partners', an investment group, in 2015. I am never made to feel like my presence is appreciated. No increase in pay with the exception of a few cents in the whole time. No incentives and never asked to move up. Schedule changes might be made a few days before the week. Intimidation from some employees, and so much work because of staff reduction, I come home more tired than ever before."
bad,I hated working for this company. The work load was overbearing. Employees werent doing their share of the work. My boss favored some employees over others and aloud that to show in the work environment.
bad,"No organized schedule for employees. I had to drive 30 minutes to get to work daily just to make it and get returned home. I enjoyed the work but it was a waste of time to drive so far and then turn around. This can really be frustrating to anyone, especially when you have priorities and a family that depend on you."
bad,There are great sales weekly.  The Charity Day semi annual sale is a great time to buy.  There are some great items to purchase online.  There's free shipping if item not available in store.
bad,"Belk has very poor management.  They were always understaffed and would try to put so much work on limited people that would come into work. Everything was unorganized and no one took ownership for any of the problems. You were never told Thanks for your hard work, but always criticized."
bad,Not much to say about this place to work I would not go back and would not recommend it for any one the ask me about it. The customer service of this company is poor and it reflects on how they treat their employees
bad,Competitive salary. Part time employee's scheduled too many hours. Management needing more training. Management exspressing  appreciation for all employees. Customer servise very much recognized positively by customers.
bad,"I enjoyed worked in the Cosmetics department just because I loved the brand I worked for. On the other hand, I wouldn't recommend working for Belk to anybody. Managers are fake, they underpay you, they expect your life to revolve around the store. Schedule is never out when it's supposed to be, no coverage on the floor so you end up doing several people's jobs."
bad,It.needs too go out of business management sucks they think they are better than you dont.know how too talk to you and they need too do some work.they do nothing.butsit in that office
bad,it was a stressful job. Always having to clean out fitting rooms and have mountains of clothes to hang up and put back where they belong and of course working the cash register.
bad,By far one of the most unprofessional places I've worked at. The manager of the ladies department was extremely rude. She would treat just about anyone with disrespect and she also held favoritism when it came to employees. She on several occasions insulted and harrsssed her employees and would verbally assault customers. She made the work environment unstable and hostile. I would NOT recommend working for this company.
bad,I was an sales employee at Belks through my High School years. Didn't really care for retail. My job was fun but not for me.
bad,"the company did not care about school schedules at all, would call while in class to see if you can cover someones shift at the time your in class."
bad,"Working for Belk,Inc. as a company is a great experience. Working at this location has been the most challenging experience ever in my 6 years of working with this company."
bad,"really not a place to work if you want to be happy. long shifts, not enough coverage, limited in advancement opportunity, cramped spaces, the company does not care about its associates."
bad,"Pay was terrible. First time working there it was ok. But, later on it was terrible. No workers there on time to help get anything out. But we made the best of it. Not a bad company. Just needs more pay for the work."
bad,"The company has had so many cut backs concerning hours and people.  As a manager you wear so many hats.  Your expected to be a manager, an associate, HR, an OTA associate.  Your paid for 40 hours per week but you are required to work anywhere from 50-60 hours per week without any additional compensation."
bad,Starting pay isn't much more than a regular sales associate but they expect you to take on a lot more responsibility. The City Manager was new and tried to micromanage everyone. The regional isn't much better and both were in way over their heads. They just react to everything and have no plan in place. Just about everyone has quit and they don't know how to keep employees. Bad experience for me overall.
bad,"Your typical day  is to see how many people you can get into debt. If you're disable and looking for a job this, not the place to work. The consumers  nasty, but you have nice people the bright your day"
bad,"Training was not good, I am a female they had me unloading the truck and it was constantly yelling and screaming smh I left I needed peace of mind and not stress. Everyone talked about everyone! It's not a good place too work"
bad,"Very rude manager's for no reason. Treat everyone like a kid.. You're told not to talk while working!! I was told I'd be censoring & labeling clothes & I haven't done that yet! Instead I was in the back unloading ridiculously heavy boxes, breaking the corners flaps off, stacking, doing a bailer for cardboard, help unloading the bailer which weights about 100lbs, merchandising which is WAY in the sky on a ladder. DO NOT WORK HERE! worst experience ever."
bad,"Management was a joke. Training was a joke. Very little opportunity for advancement. Open on Thanksgiving. Only closed on Easter and Christmas. High expectations with little guidance from management. Poor benefits package. Very little work/life balance. Horrible pay. All around bad place to work. The company cares about making money, and not about employee satisfaction."
bad,"Belk was a good and bad experience. I loved experiencing working retail, although I did not like that the management was rude and mean and talked about you to other co-workers. It was a bad atmosphere to work in the Richmond Belk."
bad,Treat there employees HORRIBLE .. wouldn't recommend that company to NOBODY ... the more you work the less you get recognized for what you do
bad,"Extremely low wages, poor working conditions, poor employee morale, management who are idiots. Unless you're a teenager needing some spending money, get an education so you won't have to work for substandard retail stores like Belk."
bad,The store is overcrowded. The managers and other associates are very hard to work with. I started with 20 hours a week. Now I only get about 10-15 hours. It sucks overall.
bad,Belk has poor management they are unorganized and they do not care about you. They never sent me to training EVER. The store manager never knew what was going on . And they are all over your back about item locator and presell
bad,No advancement for associates. pay is not in line with other retailers. Management sits on their butts in the office while associates work their butts off.
bad,"Not a good job, does not have steady business. Also could not stand being rushed to pull the only two orders in the plant. I wish i never got the job thru staff mark"
bad,"This is a decent place to work.  The drive is too long for me. If it was a little closer, it would be good. The time goes by quickly at this job.  During peak season which is November- December, the company offers several incentives for working the extra hours.  So asside from getting overtime, you could win money or electronics."
bad,great employers and company. I've grown in various areas from my customer service skills to personal skills.  This company is like a family and we all work together
bad,"This is the WORST company I have EVER worked for. The store manager was asst. manager before becoming manager and is clueless on how to treat people. The issue of not being home to raise the kid and having someone raise it is enough to bring the personal problems and discontent attitude to the job. "
bad,"I worked here for 18 months as a contractor.  Everyone at Belk is so set in their ways that there is no listening to any suggestions for change.  Contractors are treated VERY poorly and also do not get to sit with the rest of the ""team"".  You are forced to sit in a ""contractors"" section with a smaller monitor/laptop, smaller desk and in bench seating on top of the person in front or next to you.  Forget about every having any privacy for your work, even though I was in IT Security, there was no respect for privacy. I would  be conducting investigations visible by anyone that would walk by.  Getting anything done from an administrative perspective takes an act of god to get done in a timely method.  I also offered to travel out of town to fix an appliance in another data center and was never reimbursed for my mileage or money spent while there.  It was a complete lack of respect for employees, especially contractors."
bad,"the managers were very rude and judgmental, a lot of people will not go there because the employees make them feel awful about themselves  which is so sad to me"
bad,"I made certain the area was always neat and that no clothes were strewn about anywhere."
bad,A typical day at work at Belk Department Store consisted of monotonous tasks that were required for each Department within the store. I had developed many skills within the the Working/Professional world.
bad,"Absolutely no concern with customer service or sales...all we do is move displays and products from one side of the store to the other. When customer complaints about moving brands around are brought to attention of management, it falls on deaf ears. Management is convinced this technique forces customers to hunt for stuff and they will inadvertently come across new brands. In fact, many customers, especially our older customers, assume we are out of the item or no longer carry the brand. No concern with having store ready to open for business in the mornings, staff expected to finish helping unload truck instead of being ready to work on the floor. The company has so much potential, but they are going to have to decide if they want to be like Kohl's or TJ Maxx, or take more of a Macy's approach. Best thing is the one hour lunch which gives you time to calm down, collect your thoughts, and go back to the second half of your shift with a good attitude. It can be difficult to remain upbeat in this negative oppressive environment. Keep your brilliant ideas to yourself, they are not welcome.Your years of experience and knowledge of the customer base is irrelevant. Your raise will be a dime, which you should act grateful to receive. I don't advise working for this company until they figure out what they want to be and get back to the basics of retail. If you have experience, take your talent elsewhere where it will be appreciated. If you are a silent worker who doesn't like to interact with customers and you enjoy being left alone to fold things, it might be a fit for you."
bad,"The  store was always organized and customers was  very nice and polite. The clothing was of class."
bad,there would always be people that hated to work there and there was always fussing and fighting going on
bad,"unorganized, bad management, conflicting schedules, bad attitudes"
bad,I would not recommend any body to work for BI-LO. The management was the worse. I did not get along with hardly any of my co-workers nor the management team.
bad,"Everyone drags thru the day due to terrible scheduling...you may leave at 11.30 PM and have to return at 7:00AM, over and over again. Never the same schedule from one week to the next. You can not make any plans with schedules like this. The Management is over worked and tired due to corporate demands. It is clear that everyone there works here simply because they must. (to eat) Staff is cut to the bone and does the work of several. One sales person may open as many as 6 registers in different departments and bounce back and forth throughout the day. No time to assist customers, only time to check them out. Customers complain about the lack of staff and help to deaf ears.... They demand sales and profits to increase always in order for the top brass to continue getting their huge bonuses, at the expense of their front line poorly paid sales associates. Also, the merchandise quality has gone to pot. Everything in the stockroom is labeled from China. The bargains on clothes and such are not bargains if only after a few washing they look like rags. I have never worked so hard and so long for so little pay. I don't even recommend  shopping there, much less working there."
bad,attitude with customers was not always pleasants working together was always easy.
bad,"IT was a horrible ...they accused me of misappropriating funds after I spent all the paychecks I earned working there BUYING  Clothing there...."
bad,"management was less than adaquate and did not conduct themselves in a professional manner. Very clicky, just not a nice place to work at all. Would suggest it to my worst enemy."
bad,"Management is always HORRIBLE, because they are treated horribly themselves from the high-up executives that run this entire company.  A retailer who's trying to keep up with Northern-based company's like Macy's, when it should be sticking to its southern roots in treating its employees and customers as they once did.  It is a rat race within a rat race and the pay continues to dwindle.  I have many friends who still work for them and they tell me it continues to get worse.  They're screamed at for not opening up store credit cards (where they actually racially-target people by offering ""free gifts"" to open a charge account.  The gifts are usually left-over samples or testers from Cosmetics Vendors who would go throught the ROOF if they knew how their product was being used!)  "
bad,"Very negative environment.  Would not advise intelligent, upbeat person to apply for a position with this company."
bad,"Being a beauty consultant was gratifying work, however Belk had some very harsh work environments and policies"
bad,Mangement doesn't care to stopping shoplifters and its not a very good paying job.  You work random schedules on a weekly basis and you never know what to expect on any day.
bad,Turned down other seasonal Jobs for this job because they promised better stuff they don't want to put you to work they don't want to give you a schedule have no idea when or what you're supposed to be doing don't train you're absolutely sucks ruined my holidays for less than 20 hrs a week they lie and management is very rude
bad,I've been at Belk for some time now.  The job is pretty easy and you usually get out of there on time.  But the management at Belk that I've encountered are rude.  They treat certain employees as if they're beneath them.  I don't believe it's all the management there but it's a handful that don't think you matter.  The operational managers feel they can do anything because of there title.
bad,"Shorter Hours"
bad,"(2010) Caused life crisis due to pay, hardest were accepting harassing just to make ends meet at home. Co worker's didn't have must interest due to going behind back of other employee's to reach credentials around work place. Learned retail experience, also learned to protect yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally at work places and be your best at all times no other credentials like gods. Most enjoyable moments were when weren't harassed at times because it does affect your drive to work, during times weren't harassed felt relief and drive to enjoy my customers and all responsibilities of the job. From my last shopping visits former employee's seem to like it now because of the major change in management (2012)"
bad,Hostile and hazardous work environment. Discrimination issues.
bad,Unprofessional all theway around
bad,Store manager is cruel and targets employees to fire. Very stressfull and unhappy place to work. Associates get their hours cut and schedules changed EVERY DAY! They want you to get huge amounts of credit cards opened in a time when people want yo get out of debt. Manager is cruel and doesn't care about her associates or managers. Not a place to work if you want to be happy! I got out as fast as I could! If you have a family this is not a place to work unless you don't want to see them.....hated every day I was there!
bad,The duties and areas worked were changed repeatedly without the department manager discussing it with the associate. Providing the quality service to the customers.was difficult in all the confusion The most enjoyable part was working with the customers. The managers that came in when the store was closing were organized and enjoyable to work with.
bad,"This Company is only worried about its image and money. The pay is horrible, they work you to the bone and still complain because they have more for you to do. They are not organized at all. The CEO and COOPERATE people sit at a desk determined what should be going on his the stores. Then issue a complaint to the store, cut hours, up the unreasonable sales goal over and over. If you enjoy Politics this is your company. If you are a little man....a little man you will remain!"
bad,All this company wants to pay is minimum wage and you have to come in at 12am to 6 am depending on shifts. Do you really want ot unload trucks for this pay with gas prices being this high think about it !!!
bad,"This business borderline harasses customers with applying for the belk card. It is difficult in some departments and if you aren't a shark and a top performer, you're basically not important."
bad,"The management is terrible, you're limited in everything that you do and it's not a safe job to be in. Hours are always fluctuating and there's little to no advancement opportunity."
bad,"I worked at belk for a year. In that year I was dragged through h*ll by coworkers and management. I got written up for nothing multiple times and ended up just quitting because it wasn’t worth my mental health. Corporate is a whole issue, if they don’t like someone they take them out, they only back up their management and when they do something wrong they’d find a way to blame it on someone."
bad,There was absolutely NO ORDER working here and the management is the worst!!! It’s like workers against management and when the manager gets mad at you then she cuts you down to 5 and 9 hours a week!
bad,"PLEASE READ BEFORE APPLYING WITH THIS SPECIFIC LOCATION (Suffolk, VA). I remember working there years ago. It was an awful job. I would meet employee expectations and above. I worked part-time and was the top credit app employee for many months but it was never appreciated. I was never Employee of the Month. They rather give to the employees that barely work and randomly disappear off the sales’ floor to take a cigarette break. "
bad,You can go out of your way and bend over backwards to help out and no one there appreciates it! It’s sad. They have ran off almost all of their good works. They praise the lazy ones and let them do whatever they want. Management is the worst part about the job. You go above and beyond and it’s still not enough. They’re never happy and always wanting more. Never appreciate what you do and just complain about more that could’ve been done. It’s such a stressful and toxic environment solely because of the management there. Pay is also definitely not worth it. It’s VERY  unorganized
bad,The customer is ALL that matters. There isn't much concern for employee well-being and they pay is NOT competitive. You will be lucky if you get a 25 cent raise with your yearly review.
bad,"I worked here for over a year. During that time, I saw three different store managers, three different HR’s, tons of new employees, and no positive changes. They work you do death and they do not care about your well being. They just want their money."
bad,"I would not recommend working at Belk to anyone I know. It's a lot of work for low pay, poor benefits, and poor management. There is no job advancement available."
bad,"Many Managers play favorites, aren’t truthful at all and never recognize hard work.  Wage scale is crazy and change without notice.  Never schedule enough people to cover floor to give the customer service that should be given."
bad,"Belk offers long hours on your feet with little breaks. Corporate has fired or demoted workers who had been there 20+ years without warning, as well as moved workers to other areas. There is a lot of favoritism and gossip amongst the managers. Would not recommend."
bad,"well having to drop trucks that 1200 to 1600 on top of several hundred boxes is very annoying cause our store manager kept adding trucks to our week. Management is garbage, pay is trash, the only good thing was meeting new people and the hours. Would NOT recommend"
bad,Worst experience ever they did not value me as a manager I always was on the floor running the store while the OTm and store Manager sat on their butts in the back all day. It was a sad day when I left because I was really close with my employees. I did not feel appropriated or important. Target actually came in and recruited me and matched my pay for a less stressful role and also being promoted to a higher role within 4 months making more money than even a store manager at Belk. It was definitely worth leaving and you guys lost a great employee.
bad,"Except for the 20% discount they give you it's basically not even worth it. If you take this job you will no longer be able to see your family nor spend time with them. The management is poor and doesn't know what they are doing. They live by a ""Customers always right"" Motto even when the customer is in the wrong. They don't stand up for there associates but instead makes it seem like it's our fault  the couponds never work and there isn't any culture there. I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy honest 10/10 wouldn't recommend"
bad,"The managers always in a meeting,and still not accomplishing nothing. They want you to do your job and everyone else. Always working every weekend and no time for family. But managers get weekends of but not employees. Tell you to request weekend off and still they deny your request."
bad,I was a manager for Belk. I can honestly say upper management was mean to staff and to the management team including myself.  I desided to leave because of the way they expected to much from staff.  I was expected to work from sun up to sun down.  I was not able to see my staff nor was talked to with respect and witness mult time staff being treated horrible!!!  I will not shop at belk and never work there again!!!
bad,"Conference calls all the time, too much to do for a HR employee . Had to work on schedules st home , no time given on regular work days . I never got a lunch hour in a month . Too stressful ."
bad,They NEVER follow their own rules. They punish hard workers with hour cuts and reward slackers with extra shifts. They refuse to fire people who never show up on time or call out. Which makes harder workers left to deal with it.
bad,"poor management, rude employees, no consistent hours. never a pay raise. expected to work without breaks or lunch. AWful horrible work place. haven't gained anything from working for belk."
bad,"This place is a trap. I worked at the Lexington, NC Location for a while and the managers are disrespectful and condescending towards any employee they do not like.  They choose favorites, which are mainly the people that get the most credit card applications (mainly from elderly people and people that don’t understand credit cards). One manager specifically began targeting me and constantly being rude since I didn’t sign up enough credits. The managers always said I was not doing enough no matter what I would do and all of my work went unnoticed. The Human Resource rep was extremely unqualified and chatted with the makeup women instead of working most of the time.   Overall, this is the worst place I have ever worked in my life and I have never felt so disrespected and loathed by any managers I’ve ever worked for. Do yourself a favor and go work for a company that doesn’t have a 70% employee turnover rate and a toxic work environment."
bad,"Their point system makes this company have a revolving door for associates. Training modules don't work well, and associates are placed out on the salesfloor with very little training because of short time allotted for training"
bad,"Now that cross sales is managements focus customers are not, most days 1 employee per area. Employees are constantly bullied to do what mangers say without question. ...cosmetics employees are expected to. Cover mens and shoe departments....even if customers are waiting at their counters...loosing sales & commission. ...while they've been specifically train by each cosmetic company! "
bad,"too competitive, desire too much for such low pay, treated disrespectfully, customers were too by a certain manager at laurens, workers hogged the registers and got credit for my sales"
bad,"Low hours, low pay, management doesn't know how to treat employees with respect. Career advancement will never happen at this place, so if that's your goal don't even waste your time."
bad,"The job itself was very demanding but fulfilling. Horrible management. Manager uses the ""f"" word and ""ethics"" of Belk's policy does not apply to her. The manager talked to workers horribly but would change on the spot when speaking to customers. Loud and obnoxious, used profanity a lot, talked down to people."
bad,"My operations manager was awesome. However when we got a new manager it all seemed well. But she lied about everything and if corporate was to visit she was super nice. But she made the environment horrible changing hours, canceling vacations it was awful. Health and dental benefits are outrageously high for a family. No room to move up. Completely understand why this is a southern store."
bad,Coworkers can be competitive at times and there can be a lot of labor work (lifting and pulling). Sometimes I’m asked to do things that are not in my job description and that are on others but they don’t want to do it.
bad,"Friendly environment. "
bad,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with and we all ended up being close friends. However, the atmosphere in this store was absolutely awful. Not a single person was excited to come to work because of the terrible management here. A couple of the managers were sweet and helpful but the store manager and other managers were absolute terrors to work with. Scheduling was always messed up, management doesn’t consider your availability when scheduling, the store managers play favorites and are unfair to those that speak their mind and disagree with them. The workload put on part time employees is ridiculous. Only one person would be scheduled all day for multiple departments. The hours sucked unless you were full time. Part time employees got every closing shift while full time somehow got to pick their hours. The store manager would talk about employees with other employees and make jokes. Overall, I hated my time here and would not recommend anyone who has a passion for retail to work here. It only makes you hate the profession and hate work. Hourly pay was different for everyone, seemed liked the store manager just made up whatever rate they decided on that day."
bad,"Management was rude, gossipy, and very unprofessional.  The cost of living in Charleston/ Mt Pleasant area is high- Belk wages are dreadfully low.  You can get paid better working at Chik-fila.  Their health insurance plan is TERRIBLE- hope you don’t  need to use your insurance or you will get a dreadful bill.  On that note you are offered PTO but if you use because of illness will count as unexcused absence(s), even with a Doctors note.  If you need to miss more than 3 days due to illness your Doctor must put you on medical leave to keep you from being written up!! It’s a joke!  There is no work life balance with this company.  They will stay open until midnight for their countless “ One time only Sales” with no customers in the store but then will cut hours out of nowhere so when you salespeople are actually needed they would have hardly anyone scheduled.  I have worked many other retailers and enjoyed the environment until Belk...I would give this place zero stars if I could.  There were some very nice customers.  But the environment on the sales floor at times was so toxic and cutthroat that If was embarrassing.  Sales associates would argue with other sales associates and fight over customers.  Complete nightmare!"
bad,"I would rather not give a review about Belk. I think some things are better left unsaid. The only thing I will say is, Belk does not have the best reputation."
bad,very unrealistic place to work.  all ways had a smell. constantly forcing you to get credit. never enough staff to serve the customers and did not feel like associates mattered.
bad,"This position was temporary, however, my time here taught me a great deal of what kinds of customers and detail are out in the work world. I noticed that an abundance of, not only the staff team but also the clientele, has a more superior outlook."
bad,"Absolutely poor management, the main manager (store manager) is heartless, and puts herself over every body in the workplace, got made fun of and called names by the store manager,  favoritism is strong, if you don't sleep,eat, or breathe Belk, then you're a waste of space and a waste of air .."
bad,I absolutely hated this job i would not recommended it to anyone. I worked at the one in waynesville NC ans ig was the worst job ever. Your fellow employees would tell the manager lies about you. And would complain about you all the time no matter how hard you worked. I would work till i had bruises on my hands and arms and get yelled at ny store manager for not working and asked why i just stand around all day doing nothing when obviously i worked my butt off. The store manager would take other employees word that all i did wad stand around and did nothing and would yell and me constantly about it. So i finally got tired of getting yelled at when i worked my butt off so i quit and i will never ever in my life go back.
bad,"I was very excited when I first started working there. I've worked around different departments and I learned a lot.  But things started going downhill.  Poor management, HR is barely ever available, not enough people are scheduled, so I've had to work at different areas at once. They hold you responsible of too many things and there is also favoritism."
bad,"Constantly pressured to sell Belk Credit cards (which hit customer's credit report causing potential harm), constantly pressured to meet sales goals, reduce theft, keep area clean/tidy, etc but rarely given support."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. Management is unappreciative and degrading. Overall, would never work there again. They do not treat employees with respect. Will force you to work long hours."
bad,it sucks   cut throat never cares about anybody  human resources is a joke...stay away  do not accept a job for any reason...ecspecially in the Wilmington nc region with carey ann as a vp...stay away
bad,"This company is one of the worst ive ever worked for. No communication. No direction. Half of the management there doesnt know what the heck is going on half the time. There is no follow up with them about the questions that you ask. There is absolutely ZERO training. There arent enough employees for each department. Theres no accountability for managers or for associates. Theres heavy favoritism. Associates (and a couple managers) are super catty. The day to day operations set by corporate resemble that of a newly opened mom and pop shop, not a multi-billion dollar company. They say they value their employees and their families but give them little time to spend with their families. There is absolutely NO room for advancement.  If you could avoid this place i would."
bad,No job security and no regard for the workers. They only concerned about getting people to open a credit card with the company and getting presells for all the sales events that they have weekly.
bad,HORRIBLE company to work for. I was a counter manager and hated every minute of it. Management is awful and lies to manipulate you. I wouldn't wish working for this company on my enemy
bad,"I would  not recommend anyone to join this team at this particular location.  I really hope other location are not run like this place.  It is so unorganized, managers do not take accountability for there action.  Very unprofessional and they talk down to their associates.  They do not follow thru on any plans and pushes it's workload on others while they sit in the office playing on there phone."
bad,"This was the worst company I ever worked for. The company and management care nothing about you. There will be loads of work and you will be required to do tons of things for little pay. No one stayed longer than a month, which explains why they are always hiring."
bad,"I passionately love what I do working with cosmetics. Clinique is a wonderful company to work for, but Belk is a completely different story. The store is very poorly managed and on top of everything else, management doesn't know how to follow their own Belk policy. If you are applying for full-time, know ahead of time that this particular Belk will NOT hire you if you have any job restrictions what so ever. Meaning an actual life outside of the store, school, children, etc. Management is very sketchy and doesn't properly communicate with their employees. Their job is to make you feel safe like your job isn't at stake and then when you least expect, they will terminate you. You will be required stay and recover the entire store at closing. Meaning, that you will go close registers in other departments and spend the next hour folding clothes. You cannot leave at your scheduled time. You must wait for a manager to tell you that you can leave. By the way, if you're hired for cosmetics, recovering the entire store, is not listed in your job description when you're hired. If you go over 30 hours a week, then you'll be written up. If you call out for any reason at all, you'll be written up. Even if you have a doctors note. They show no mercy and could care less about their employees. The store manager does nothing except sit in his office and watch employees on the cameras. You will feel like you're in prison. If you were to walk into that store and ask any employee if they enjoy their jobs, none of them would say yes. I highly appreciate Clinique and the education you receive working"
bad,"I've been with Belk for almost 6yrs, and have not moved up with the company yet. It was a good job at first while I was a teenager. But now it doesn't have way cover any of my bills. I feel like I've been mislead by a lot of things, they tell u there going to give you so many hours just to get you to work there then they deny you the hours which is not ethical. There's also a lot of unprofessional things that go on here. This is my only source of income and it's hard to find a second job, I feel they could careless about me having any hours. Being part-time at Aiken Belk means you can be on the schedule anywhere from 0-25 hrs, don't let them fool you. They talk so much about being a big family and trusted advisors,but I don't by that, because I don't get any compassion about my situation. I'm a hard and loyal worker and I love what I do and I feel like with me being with the company this long I should be the last one denied any hours. It's very hurtful and upsetting, because I love what I do. I just wish this problem could be solved!!!"
bad,"* Poor communication between upper and lower level management"
bad,I'like my job at beik distribution center the problem is lock of work. I get long good whit my co-worker
bad,"No one is going to give 2 thoughts about my review. Coworker clicks sandbag you to department managers, no one is a team player. Managers under man their departments and then get mad because you can only do so much as a human with 2 legs and 2 arms yet they want you to be in 5 different places at once but don't offer to help their employees who ask for help."
bad,They don't care about employees.  Just numbers.  I have worked at some bad companies before but this is by far the worst . The management here cares only about numbers. It's almost legalized slavery.  I was recruited from another company and promised so much that was never to be. They will lie to you just to get you in the door. Very unsafe as well. OSHA needs to drop by sometime.
bad,"Working here is awful. The employees are fake, managers pick favorites, and goodluck if you have any problems with someone who has been there for 10 years because managers will not touch them. The pay is awful they do not base you off experience. I would not work here if it was my last option. ESPECIALLY ANDERSON! look at the turnover and see for yourself. They also have the most RUDE customers and management expects you to be a punching bag with a smile on your face."
bad,The management is terrible they are all rude and they stay in the break room or they hide in the office all they do is sit on the computer and gossip the store is cluttered they put alot of hours on me and I didn't ask for alot of hours when I did my interview and don't even get me started on the store manger!
bad,"Lack of leadership, support and available resources to perform tasks and to get the job done well.  Complete disregard for associates who are the worker bees in the store."
bad,"Management is absolutely toxic. Employees are treated like children. You have to call the manager on duty every time you need to use the restroom to ask permission and you are scolded if you don’t. Store manager is a manipulative bully who engages in “gaslighting” behavior, so you never know where you stand. Expect to be blamed for for things beyond your control such as the number of people coming into the store vs the number of employees available. Expect to have a meeting every morning where you are made to feel worthless and are sometimes shouted at (as a w group) for not living up to expectations."
bad,Run while you can. They expect you to sacrifice everything including your family to meet the needs of the business but give little to nothing in return.
bad,"From corporate down, there is a lack of communication coupled w/ confusing business plan. Terribly disorganized. They don't take care of their people."
bad,"to get a manager on the floor during an issue is almost impossible. They always use the phrase "" empower yourself to help the customer"" which is the way they tell you to handle the customer/issue yourself. And when they def have to make an appearance , let's not even discuss wait time. the employees who don't do anything don't get punished. but the ones who go above and beyond get reprimanded when they slow down just a little. a raise is impossible. they actually cut your pay if you don't make sales goals. which is also almost impossible bc the store is never busy."
bad,"Management is never available for feedback or direction.  Confusion even among the management team.  One would give a direction to move right and the other manager would give direction to go left.  "
bad,"When you work at belk, you are owned by belk. You can never be absent, regardless of personal illnesses or family emergencies. Regardless of the reason, all absences count against you. This includes doctors notes and even a death in the family. The company sucks. Bad management, and they view you as a piece of property."
bad,"Only worked about 10 hours a week when I asked for 30-35 and had an open schedule.  Human resources took a long time to correct payroll errors, inefficient training that's only computer based and none in person"
bad,"Definitely not a great place to work unless constantly stressed, undervalued, and waaay under  paid is your thing. Oh and let’s not forget about the rude managers who always talk to you like your basically sub-human, or the cliques among the employees that work really well at completely isolating you"
bad,They kept repeatedly cutting hours also it was always poor management and there was no respect there at all when you requested days off they wouldn't put it in and the dressing rooms were filthy
bad,"I would recommend this company because I don’t want to judge a whole corporation because of one management. Belk store at Ahoskie NC. The last month working at that Belk affected my health in a way that I never thought it could happen and it was just because of all the stress that I was put on. My face broke out like it never did,  I was having constant headaches at work and they’ll last all day even when I  got home, I had no peace at home receiving almost threatening and humiliating emails. All of that stopped the day I put in my two weeks notice. The manager thinks he’s God behind his computer and in the intercom but when it comes to talk he hides and prefer to talk about you behind your back. The same with the other two “ladies” that work in the office, they think they’re above and better than anyone else but they’re far from that, they think they can step on their employees and even the ones that already left and they joke about their new workplace. Just two days after my last day I went to the store and I wasn’t even at the door when they started talking about all the acne scaring in face when all that is because of them. This is just a little bit of how UNPROFESSIONAL THE MANAGEMENT AT AHOSKIE IS."
bad,"Managers have no clue as to what is truly happening in the building.  No chance of advancement for people of other ethnicities in the upper management positions. Fulltime only given 30 hrs per week, no real time off. Constant pressure to push credit cards. Always fighting for sales with coworkers who just stand at registers."
bad,I was hired as a Bridal Consultant.  My job was to help brides and grooms with wedding registries.  More importantly selling fine china.  The demand for our generation of fine china was little to nothing.  I was given no resources or opportunities to market china or move to a different position in the company.
bad,I would not recommend Belk as a stable company to work for. No work life balance due to the amount of work load that is expected of management. My position was eliminated without any notice.
bad,Part time associates rule here. Full time work long hours and do most of the work to make their departments  run. Full time work the worst of the schedules. Long weekend hours so there is no family time. Part time get off at 3 PM on Saturday and don't work on Sunday.  The new management doesn't give a flip about the people  that make this business  run.  I know several people that are looking elsewhere for  employment.  Never thought I would  see this happen  to belk.
bad,"Firstly, the stocking manager and main floor managers are racist. I was told to not offer services to select minorities. After, the same manager who proclaimed that showed 'other' customers how to rip off security tags from bed sheet bags. The customers are demanding with the coupons. I was told to choose between school and my part time job. The main manager is running this place into the ground. They are the most incompetent people I have ever encountered. If you're in college, avoid. The palmetto bugs that crawl all over this store should be left in charge."
bad,"I worked at the Asheville Belk for a little over a year. I worked there because it was the only high (high for me at the time) non-customer service job I could find (which is why I stayed for so long). The store manager doesn't care about ANYTHING, especially his employees. He kept bad employees because he was too lazy to fire them, or encourage them to be better workers. He didn't try to make me stay when he learned I was leaving (employee turnover is really high). This company brings outside people for higher positions, rather than promoting in the store. The customers are the rudest people that I've ever had the displeasure of talking to, and the supervisor I had before I Ieft was NOT fit for her job whatsoever (the one I had before her was one of the best supervisors I've ever had). Favorites are played a lot, most of the sales associates don't do anything, and the people in operations (where I worked) are treated terribly, and have to pull everybody else's weight, while getting paid not enough for it. "
bad,"It wasn't bad at first starting off,everyone was nice and sweet when they were busy during the holidays but afterwards everyone's true colors came out, and you basically have to kiss their behind to get hours!"
bad,"If i could give zero stars i would. Management is completely backwards, and know nothing about running retail. All the managers do is push you to hurry with your task, without actually knowing what it takes to get it done."
bad,Place sucks they are rude and unorganized no one ever shows up on time and plays  around or talks no balance at all I would never recomend any one working there
bad,Management has terrible people skills and are incredibly rude. They do not know how to run a store and have poor efficiency and prioritization. Would not recommend working here.
bad,I would like to say they need to improve work life balance.  Schedules are terrible and can change at any minute.  There is too much work and not enough people to handle the voluminous amount of stock work and daily tasks.  This  falls on the already overworked and underpaid managers to handle.  The associates are paid almost nothing and expected to perform like a commissioned associate.  They have so many blackout days you cannot plan a vacation..Corporate does not handle problems in a timely manner and favoritism is shown.  This makes for a poor work environment.
bad,"Long hours, little pay, negativity,discounts, sales down, morale low, schedules not consistent, other work ethics not good, cover too many depts, bathrooms disgusting."
bad,"It was great when the Belk brothers owned it. But now it's a very sad company to work for. They cut hours, expect you to do the work of 3 people because of it. Changed the evaluation process so that most employees can't achieve a raise. They push each employee to get 3-4 credit cards opened per week and if you don't achieve it you can't get a raise or promoted.  Terrible medical insurance high deductible no copays only covers preventative until deductible is met. Will not work with your availability, unless you're in school or have a second job. Some part timers only get 8 hours per week. You can only be abent 3 days or 6 tardies in a six month period. Employees are friendly, and vision/dental insurance is good. 10 vacation days after 1 year, 5 personal days for full-time position."
bad,Belk culture is a big popularity contest. Promotions and advancement are  based on favoritism and in some cases tenure. Experience does not matter.  The pay is below industry average and raises given on an annual basis are 1% regardless of how great your performance review is. There is not enough appreciation to balance the negatives.
bad,"Poor management, usually late (waited outside for 2 hours one day) just to be sent home and lose a days worth of work, very disorganized and dirty store out on the floor and in associate areas. slightly rude staff, help requests were usually ignored by most, if they were answered very quick and brief. Left to my own devices most days. Never had proper training."
bad,"Belk was purchased by Sycamore and everything began to change. The friendly work environment became cold and rigid. Sales environment is cut throat. The associate is pressured to open credits and improve customer service scores, but pay is only based on sales per hour. Pay is cut, if you don't make goal. Employees are routinely yelled at for doing anything wrong but never trained how to do things correctly. Everyone walks on eggshells thinking they will soon be fired. This job morphed from one of the best to one of the worst jobs I ever had. "
bad,"I enjoyed my job most of my years at Belk."
bad,"Do not work for Belk. Do no apply for belk. Just run away. There are so many problems with Belk, and sycamore investment company is trying to rebuild the company back from the ground up. Sounds good right..Wrong the ground is sinking beneath them. More stores are up for the ballets to close and more jobs are being deleted. The Belk family from North Carolina sold the company for a reason. They sold it because they needed to get the best value for a company they believed was dying. There is no value in Belk. The internet shopping commerce world is killing the company more and more year by year. More demands are being placed on the store employees and unfortunately there is not much support from the declining margins ( money) that propels the company. Belk will go out of business within the next decade. It will start with a chapter 11 bankruptcy."
bad,It was fun working there at first. But there is always a lot of gossip going around non stop associates and managers! Pay was not good!! They don’t give raises if they do it’s a few cents which made it seem like all your hard work didn’t matter. When I started they knew I was going to school and Alittle after half the year I was there they we’re not willing to work with my 2 days I needed off for school. They changed your schedule multiple times without even telling you. I hated it there after a while!!
bad,"belk was a very bad place to work they push people to far with no breaks. and people you do nothing get promoted and more hours. management does not communicate there for no one truly knows whats going on, there for stressing out the employees who just want to do there jobs and go home."
bad,Belk is not a steady place to work. The work only last long enough to get through peak season and then they start laying off those who they don't need which leaves some people without jobs. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,Managers focus on making friends then running to store correctly. Associates run around the store instead of them focusing on assistanting the customers in the area that they are assigned to. There is a lot of favoritism with in the store for certain employees
bad,"many people are being let go, all of the new employees are being taken from one particular competitor."
bad,"Not the most healthy environment I have ever worked in.  You are expected to work 10 and 12 hour days. HR is almost nonexistent.  If you have a problem, they get rid of you."
bad,The stress and lack of work life balance is bad. Management is all new and not up to speed on exactly what is needed from our daily jobs. New structure is forcing people into roles they may not want or be qualified for.
bad,No A good work culture with too much of red tape and politics. Worked full time for 2 years and left the company. Used to be a privately held company but sold to venture capital firm by owners.
bad,I've worked for 2 different Belk stores both of which hold promotions over your head to intimidate you and make you feel like you have to stay with them. One manager released personal information about me and other employees.
bad,Employees are currently under great stress daily with the threat of losing their jobs.  The new CEO is making many changes and has eliminated hundreds of jobs.
bad,"A typical day at work, I would Greet and Assist Customers with merchandise, Ring up customers, take payments and order merchandise that was not in the store. I would also have to do mark downs and markups, follow planograms, when putting out merchandise, Some managers were pleasant, and would not be available to come and help you solve situations with customers and left you to make decisions own your own. The hardest part of the job was trying to satisfy every customers when they where not able to use coupons. I really enjoy meeting new people and getting to know about the customers on a regular bases."
bad,I will never recommend Belk.  As an associate if you don't make your sales goal by the end of the year instead of getting a raise you will get a pay cut.   As far as management most of the time you work more then 16 hours a day
bad,"I currently work at the Belk on Friendly in Greensboro, and I'm advising you to look elsewhere. Been here for a year as a part time associate and every time i ask to be put at full time, they deny me. They will give you full time hours, but you will still be considered part time so that they dont have to give you any benefits. Management is a complete joke and have no leadership skills at all. Please, do not apply. You will/can find something a lot better."
bad,My co-worker are like family!!! I love the interaction with my customers. I enjoy the fast-paced atmosphere. I have learned so many different things while working there.
bad,"I was hired in Sept 2014 and did not meet my vendor for training until right before Christmas. Poor upper management and hr staff. They didn't code me in correctly and notify the rep I needed training until she came up and introduced herself to me.  They use you to cover other departments and then complain when you're numbers are low. If you do not make sales quota they cut your pay. I started at the end of a quarter and was still held to the full amount of $5000.00 for a three month period. No training provided and you are never actually scheduled with your ""mentor"". Your schedule will be changed at the last minute. Never have a weekend off and requesting days is a joke because hr never reviewed them. No coverage to get a break or lunch. There were plenty of times I had to just walk off and leave customers standing to get lunch in order to avoid passing out.Then got in trouble for leaving department unattended when there were only two associates including myself in intimates dept."
bad,Some of the sales team managers worked really hard and did more work because the operations team manager never did their job. Store management was awful and the overall morale in the store was deflated. Only positive was that the pay was decent for a retail position.
bad,I don't reccomend working here. They do not care about their employees especially regional all they care about is the store and meeting numbers. This i
bad,Belk is a really disorganized company. There are many issues that they need to fix however it is getting somewhat better. People there however can be really cut throat
bad,Store manager is the worst manager this store has ever had! She is very manipulative and fake. She’s rude and doesn’t know how to talk to her employees. And she chased majority of her good workers away
bad,"cannot keep managers"
bad,"This might be a good job for a very competitive back-biter. Selling Belk credit card highly important to management. No fitting room attendants so there are piles and racks of go-backs all the time. I covered a holiday shift for a co-worker and mgmt used the opportunity to write me up for missing a previous shift. If you enjoy constant slaps in the face, I recommend working for Belk!"
bad,"You’re paid $9 an hour. you make commission AFTER you pass your $900 daily sales goal. Returns make it difficult to receive commission because if your customer makes a return at anytime it’s deducted from your daily goal, and must be made up in order to receive commission."
bad,"If you really don't have anything to do, and would want to spend all your time working in a department store, then this job is for you. I would no recommend any college or high school student to apply because the work/life balance is terrible. The management is one of the most unprofessional ones i've ever seen. Sometimes I had to work 4 registers by myself because no one ever lasted longer than a week."
bad,"Poor management! If management had a problem with an employee they would not give a one on one with the employee. Instead they would approach the employee with multiple managers on the sales floor in-front of other employees and customers. They would tell people they could advance in the company but that was never their intention. Pay was awful as well. I would not recommend this job to the guy on the side of the road that ""will work for food"""
bad,"job is super easy! sometimes the totes come down an that is a bit challenging when there make up involved we tend to get hit by it or totes ""derail""  other than that it is a very fast pace job and i have zero issues with it. however security personnel are rude not the kind of environment i would like work in. sends employees away with a bad taste in our moths an we have to work with a smile ."
bad,"So I went in being very excited about this job! I had great memories of belk from my childhood and really high expectations for the store. However that was a big mistake. Belk has really let it self go. I remember how beautiful belk was here when I was younger and how clean the store was,and how friendly the employees were. That is over!The store is filthy and run down and looks worse than a big lots! The employees are free to do what they want without support from the management team. The managers have little to no involvement with the store! The managers hide upstairs all day doing little to no work and have unreal expectations for the employees. The store culture is oppressive,abusive and employees have  unrealistic sales goals they can't reach because the mall that this belk is attached to is not a shopping destination anymore. The managers only care about employees signing people up for credit cards because it makes them money. However the  employees get little to no training to know how to do their jobs correctly and get  treated poorly if they are not performing well with no training. The store is completely a mess and unorganized and under staffed. You will have to do the work of 3 people just to stay afloat with no support from a manager or anyone. You will get blamed  for things that have not been getting done before you were hired in. It is truly one of the worse places I have ever worked!"
bad,"A typical day at Belk includes stress, and that's about it. I never really learned anything other than how to fold clothes properly and how to deal with old ladies screaming at you because their coupons didn't work. Management were some of the nicest people i have ever met but that didn't make up for the absolute nightmare that it is working at Belk."
bad,Leadership at Belk has changed dramatically since the change in ownership.   It used to be a great family place to work where you felt appreciated and part of a team.   Now with constant layoffs and changes in leadership and roles their is now consistency and loyalty to the company.
bad,Love the people that I work daily.  Didn't like how it felt like there was favorites in the store from management.  Past couple of years a lot of changes have happen some good and some not so good.
bad,If you were a good employee they over worked you. They couldn't get anyone hired that would stay so they were always understaffed. Management constantly was on you to get credit card applications and it grew tiresome. You had to work there for years and years before you were ever promoted. There was no opportunity for you to advance unless you made Belk your career.
bad,"I was always told I was one of the best employees in the store and was praised for going above and beyond but thats all i received, praise. No raises or opportunities for advancement,  just words. Very inconsistent work  place, management style is poor except a select few."
bad,"Managment is grossly unprofessional. There is no such thing as"" lead by example"". There is a bullying atmosphere that is rampant, if you are not in a management click then you are targeted and treated as a non-factor."
bad,Before the company sold out it was a great company to work for but after it became to cut throat for jobs.  There is a level of stress on all management positions that makes working for the company miserable
bad,"Working here is a bit stressful. Too many of the good workers are being overworked due to the laziness of others. Management is ok, but could be better."
bad,"The store manager is an awful person, and is miserable to be around.  She has no sympathy, and will not help you get a shift covered if an emergency comes up.  She doesn't give her employees the discount cards required to get the employee discount at other locations.  I would rather be unemployed than ever work under her again."
bad,I was a seasonal employee.  I enjoyed assisting the customers. The store atmosphere was good.  I got along well with my co-workers.  I was also trained to work in other departments within the store.
bad,"With the sale of the company and the new management team, the culture has changed. They don't value employees like they once did. The compensation is good at the corporate office, bad in the stores."
bad,"Belk definitely wasn't the best job I've ever had, all management sucked. NO body was treated equally, a lot of favoritism."
bad,"Lack of structure and not family oriented. Numerous political strategies which produce negative results, lack of trust and support for fellow employees, management and subordinates. Management is disorganized and bordering on incompetence and ignorance. Open disrespect and often advantageous.  Negative competition with obvious show of favoritism and prejudice."
bad,"the overall environment is ok but the expectations put on you to make sales, get credit applications, item locators, etc. is overwhelming.  Especially when you're barely making ends meet because they give out few hours. Some of the associates are really nice and helpful while others are sneaky and will steal sales given the opportunity. Which affects you because when they give you your evaluation they can decrease your pay if you don't meet sales."
bad,nothing was hard about the job. the management treated people unfair based on personal like and physical condition
bad,We were told we would be working 40 plus hours. We ended up working only 8 hours a week.
bad,They do not treat the people working for them right.They do not praise the people that are doing a
bad,It's always something to do. I think that if management was more stable then everything else would fall in place.
bad,"A typical day consists of meeting sales and credit goals, learning new things about new merchandise that comes in. Management was not helpful at all. Co-workers always had attitudes toward one another. The hardest part of the job was with dealing with people in management. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the customer was 1000% satisfied when leaving the store and them returning again and persuading other family and friends to visit me in the store for whatever needs they may have even if its out of my department."
bad,They have bad management as the store manager and one of the assistant store manager. The store manager sits in her office all day and don’t come out.
bad,The management @ store 0587 is a joke. At first they try to be really nice to you until you get your job and everything you need to do and then they constantly have attitudes and are nothing but drama. You can tell them issues and they do nothing to help you. & do not expect to go higher in your job unless you’re a management pet and become their friend. Your work and improvements mean nothing if you’re not in their clique
bad,Full time employees expected to sell 3 credit cards weekly. Coupons that don’t work. Impatient self important customers. 10.00 an hour and no overtime
bad,"this location doesn't even have a HR person. They can't keep new hires here because of their long term employees. They do not handle ""competition"" well, which is how they view new hires. At the makeup counters and in the women's section there were multiple reports of older employees attacking and harassing other team members, but management does not care."
bad,"The job is a stressful environment, not enough space to feel relaxed or secure and still keep a steady speed to meet production. Not a friendly environment either, my first day there a coworker who was training kept leaving me to go and talk with other people, I introduced myself to another co worker who I became good friends with helped me around my first day. I did not report the one training me but I wish I did. The dress code is another thing, a lot of people there wore leggings as well as tank tops, though when I did I was stopped through security and wrote up for it."
bad,"This company is a joke.  Wasn't too bad at first but they like to bounce good managers around and completely ignore their associates.  They also like to allow managers complete control over who can move departments and who can be ""promoted"" which is terrible since they like to hire and keep rude and self absorbed managers.  Turnover rate is a total nightmare, even for retail.  Should be ashamed of their ""benefits"" for part timers.  They tend to blame associates for issues when really they are just trying to follow their store managers instructions."
bad,"The Charlottesville Belk's lower management was very unprofessional. The management needs training. The company, itself, was wonderful. The company does put too much stress upon the shoulders of their employees. They don't acknowledge the hard working employees. The lazy employees and hard-working employees get the same measly 30 cent raise each year."
bad,"It all depends on management, could be great or the worst! Some of the management can be so petty and childish. they seem to forget that its all teamwork"
bad,Working at Belk was by far my worst work experience ever. The management and staff were very unprofessional and everything seemed very unorganized. I did not stay there long
bad,"I didn’t like the job because it wasn’t good teamwork. Bad communication between workers and supervisor. I complained about a problem I had at work,the next day I was let go."
bad,"I was treated unfairly from the moment I got there by management and HR. It's hard to be recognized for your accomplishments. Not a lot of room for advancement,  they don't alert employees already with the company of open positions for advancement."
bad,"Very little opportunities for promotion, zero work/life balance, extremely unfriendly and impersonal workmates, very clique-ish environment and no one interacts with anyone else, even within the same departments and teams.  Great money, but not a great place to work if you want a collaborative, friendly environment.  Way too much time spent on formal training classes that don't teach you how to REALLY do your job."
bad,"The past two years with this company has gone downhill quickly!  Corporate associates are not empowered to make decisions regardless of experience and professionalism.  Forced fun is an exhausting past time to try to build a positive culture.  The theme in the area I worked was, ""get on the bus or get off the bus"" meaning, speak only when spoken to; do exactly what you're told without having input on decisions and instructions; pretend to love everyone; never have opinions, etc.  The culture is toxic and unhealthy and I would NEVER recommend the corporate world of Belk to anyone!  Yuck!"
bad,"You have a goal in sales, credit apps, and item locaters. If you don't get your numbers shame on you, and you get a pay cut. You can bust your butt all day doing tasks and never be appreciated. But someone who is crabby and hogs a register gets praised because they have their numbers, yet did nothing productive all day."
bad,A typical day was consistently rotating around to various department.The hardest part of the job was dealing with bad management.
bad,Belk is a terrible company to work for. Hard workers are used and abused while lazy employees who do nothing but socialize with management are rewarded. Management is clearly incompetent and abusive. The company does have some structure but is incredibly disorganized. There is no value to human capital to Belk. It is all about the bottom line for the shareholders.
bad,"This department is a complete joke.  Its a turnstyle for professionals. "
bad,Hostile environment. Lack of knowledge of the tasks at hand. Guesswork. Inconsistencies. Quick to complain about other people's inadequacies to make themselves look better in the eyes of management. Act privileged due to promise of being hired permanently by management. Dysfunction and consistent discord amongst co-workers and manager.
bad,"Used to be a great place to work until we got a new store manager in March 2013.  There began to be much negative discord within the store between the management and associates.  Policies were being created almost weekly to the point no one could keep up with what the current policies were.  The store manager is almost never seen as he stays in his office and watches monitors to look for reasons to write up associates.  I had worked there 7 years and never had a write up, I didn't last a year under this new store manager. I truly loved this job, my customers and co-workers.  We had a great department that we kept thriving, lots of times without a direct manager.  Actually it was a better department before the the current department manager came into place.  I worked in the Home department.  Currently there is only 2 part time employees to run the whole department now.  Three have been fired, and two have quit from that department alone in the last 6 months.  The three employees that were fired from that department all had worked over four years for Belk, and none of them had any write ups prior to the current management.  The employees know they are being constantly watched, not for management to see how well their doing, because that could be used as a great training device, but to intimidate them which only adds more pressure.  It has also became a very racial atmosphere.  As if I had of been a different race, my tardiness would not of been addressed and I would still be employeed there and so would the other two that were fired.  Was a great place to work!  Too Bad!  Beware"
bad,"Belk is family owned and it shows. This company is all about what you can do for them, and not about what can be done for both the employer and associate. It could just be store #688 in Turkey Creek Knoxville, TN with the horrible HR manager and assistant store manager John that will give you a bad experience but otherwise the job while currently employed is what you make of it. I had to leave in the beginning of the year for personal reasons and was misled and lied to about how and when I could come back so in turn was tricked out of my job. Was told no hours were available but all the while people were being hired and transfered in even at Full Time. I can't speak for the rest of the chain but do not work at this location if you wish to be mistreated at least do not apply and work at this location if you are a person of color because you will be disrciminated against (they were given the oppourtunity to do so and they took it.) They care more about how many credit apps you can get in this 2014 economy than you as an associate and if you do not achieve these numbers you will not get an adequate raise. The only way I have observed that you can get a good or reasonable raise is if you are full time and work in an area with high traffic. They are very unprofessional (HR manager and Assistant Store Manager) and they obviously have not been trained to deal with the store's employees well. This was far from my first job so I know the difference. If they wise up and turnover these managers the culture of the store will change. Until then save yourself the trouble and go and apply"
bad,"You have to get credit which is very hard for me, but they don't care."
bad,"It’s a very bad place to work , unorganized and makes one person do all the work . Not enough people working in a department. It’s overall overwhelming. You don’t get help when needed ."
bad,I would not work here unless you know your managers are amazing! My managers are terrible and it makes working at Belk awful! They do some shady stuff there
bad,One of the worst companies I’ve ever worked for and I worked for McDonald’s so that says a lot. Management and the HR department just threw new hires to the wolves and made us learn everything for ourselves. Plus don’t get a pay card ps. They don’t know how to activate it.
bad,"The Belk at Turkey Creek in Knoxville, TN is one of worst environments I have ever worked in. The management is beyond terrible and the lack of care they have for their employees is astounding. There are 5 managers, and I can't name one that actually shows that they genuinely care about anything but money. The managers show a lot of favoritism and only care about how many credit cards you get people to sign up for because it helps them get bonuses and raises at the end of the year. They allow customers to horribly mistreat employees. I was once threatened by a customer and management accommodated the customer with special discounts and more to ensure the customer wouldn't leave a bad review. They also only schedule one employee per register everyday through the week except Saturday's and expect us to greet every customer, have personal conversations with them, help them in anyway possible, clean dressing rooms, put back clothes from dressing rooms, organize, fold, and hang clothes, keep the floors clean, all while ringing up customers and making sure we don't allow a customer to wait more than a few minutes to get checked out. They expect too much for what they pay and they expect too much from an employee working an entire department alone. The hours are also obscure and most of the full-time employees get 30 hours maximum. One week I'll work 10 hours and the next I'll work 30. Besides management being comparable to the Circus, the customers that shop at Belk are the absolute worst group of people I have EVER worked with and the fellow employees are a bunch of gossiping drama"
bad,"I worked at Belk in North Carolina from June- September 2018 in the processing team. I was initially told I would work whenever truck shipments arrived, which was 2 times per week. My hours were set at 4:30pm to 11:30pm. I soon came to learn this was not the case. The processing team was highly understaffed as 4-5 people including the Supervisor, unloaded and unboxed 1,500 piece trucks in one night. Some nights we couldn’t finish unloading an entire truck, forcing the team to work long hours 5 nights a week. The management didn’t notice this issue and did absolutely nothing about it. I stuck around for a few more months dealing with this problem. Both loading docks were stacked ceiling high with boxes from many months prior from being understaffed. "
bad,"I worked at their Phipps Plaza (Atlanta, Buckhead, GA) location for 12 years. As a sales manager for 6 years and then 6 years in a support position. I was a sales manager there for 8 years before Belk purchased Parisian."
bad,"management may see that you are working hard and wont advance you. wont take up for you or advance you in any way. Especially when you are from north, they see it as a problem."
bad,"Belk can be a great place to work when you have a management team that values and listens to their people. When you get a manager that thinks people are expendable, that trickles down negatively, and those who are passionate about their jobs lose their passion due to lack of investment and help on the part of management. It sometimes feels that they play favorites and work against you at the expense of creating a successful business. It is clear that they are not concerned at all with their turnover rates, and people come and go like a revolving door. There is no implemented plan for career development or path. The store is often filthy."
bad,"The Newnan Belk is a beautiful store to work at. There are a lot of nice people working there. Belk is not a place to work for those who need to make a living however. The pay is very low and the hours are very low. It is good for people who already have income from another source or are married and don't need to support themselves. If you need full time, it is better to try and get hired on full time from the beginning (if at all possible) because trying to get full time after you are hired is EXTREMELY HARD. Even if you are offered full time by one manager, if HR or another manager or coworker doesn't get along with the manager who offered it, you will never get it."
bad,Worked in private brands and it was horrible! The culture is bad for African-American. Run don't to walk from this place!
bad,"worked with a good group of people, no room to move-up, no raises"
bad,"Belk offers it's employees good benefits. Pay scale however is another story. It expects employees to work through inventory, remodels, and freight maintenance all while still on sales time ie: get your sales goal and greet customers while your loaded down with stock and floor moves."
bad,This is not a good place to work at even for PT seeker. This company can't even provide 20 -25hrs. A week the most you will get here is 5-10hrs a week.
bad,"Management is the worst part of the job. They are all unorganized and do not communicate with each other. They say they want you to succeed but do not do anything to help you succeed. If you need additional help in the department it is hard to get a hold of them and when you do, they never send any help. The hours as a part-time worker fluctuate from week to week. Most of the time I worked 10 hours a week and I would rarely be granted at least 20 hours."
bad,"Not enough hours and yearly raises if your lucky. There is a healthy competitiveness inside the workplace, but unrealistic goals to achieve. Very flexible when it comes to scheduling but hours are already limited."
bad,Definitely don't belong in retail. Job was boring and other employees grouped into cliques. Shift leaders definitely already had their favorites picked out
bad,This company has a lot of growing together as a whole to do.  I have learned that I love the E Commerce business and fixing all the problems that come along with it.  The hardest part of the job is proving that you do know what you are doing to upper management.
bad,Chaos everywhere. Incompetent managers who never check the schedule to make sure they have coverage in areas that need it. They think everyone is “replaceable” and they do not care how well you preform. Zero recognition to the employees who deserve it. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"The way the employees treat their housekeeping is terrible, they're always running of out gloves  but still want you to work imagine if a customer threw up."
bad,When I worked there during the holidays things were pretty good. But it changed after the holidays. They didn't have enough help and I continued to pick up clothes off the floor. And the dressing rooms were always in shambles.
bad,You aren't looked at as an employee. You are looked at someone who makes the store money. They want you to make a certain goal but never keeps you at your register to make. Management treated me like trash.
bad,No respect for position or work done...management not trained to be managers..no goal setting for associates...no feelings for work injuries or problems
bad,To stressful to work in the company. It's to fast past. Not enough workers. the management is wake. You don't get breaks. You barely get any hours. And it's just not a job I would like.
bad,Challenging for an open opportunity in an interesting environment to work in a retail store and the hard put into the store...........................
bad,"I applied for a position at the whiteville, NC store, when I went to go ask if the position was filled, I was told told that is was, that they will not be needing anymore help. Yet I see a post stating they are hiring seasonal help, pitiful. It would seem to me if a person puts in all the effort to apply and go ask in person about the job, management would at least be honest and straight forward. Needless to say I am very upset."
bad,"I worked there and was promised a transfer to where I was relocating to. I even waited a certain period of time like they said and then at the end they acted clueless about my transfer. Also never ended up getting my final paycheck so I'm a unhappy about that. Was pregnant also so pretty furious actually. Company is untrustworthy, in my opinion."
bad,"I would not recommend working at belk. The pay is awful the hours awful and the customer base there was you guessed it.....awful. They cut me down from 40 hours, to almost nothing."
bad,"the job is not enough to get by, management is poor, I learned how to set sales, and disburse merchandise"
bad,"My prior managers were great when I was first hired at Belk on November 23, 2018. Our store manager left and corporate brought in a new manager, and she brought in her own people to be managers and the culture changed. The new store manager and merchandise manager treat you like the scum on the bottom of their shoes."
bad,"I worked at Belk at hanes mall for a year and it was bad in many ways. Never had help from coworkers, part timers never got more than 20 hrs a week, it’s a lot of work to do by yourself, management was terrible and they didn’t even pay me what everyone else made and we did the same job and they write you up for being sick or having an emergency.  Hate it hate it hate it."
bad,"I have worked for Belk for over 4 years and it stared off very well until the store got bought out. They don’t believe in family, can never keep anyone, don’t work with the schedule that you provide and all poor management. The managers don’t get alone they all gossip about each other. The only thing good about working at Belk is the people you work with."
bad,"If you don't make the OUTRAGEOUS sales quotas, they dock your pay drastically. The hours are not consistent and there are way too many people playing both ends against the middle at this location. People will accuse you of theft if they dont like you, as well as file false complaints against you. You can have management roll video to prove you did nothing, and they still believe heresay.  I have never worked in such an unjust environment in my entire life. AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"the managers were extremely unprofessional, the hours were long, the work load was greater than the compensation. the store was never busy and the workers could care less about their jobs."
bad,"The belk in franklin, va was the worst place i've ever worked! I worked hard since my very first day there and got nothing but a .25 raise 8 months later. The pay is too low for the work being put in!! The managers show favoritism. It was a waste of my time working with 10 hrs. a week. Had to leave!! If you apply at this job, be prepared for all these things! The only thing I can say is good is the awards they give. Very annoying job."
bad,"Worst retail store I have ever worked. No communication and good luck trying to call in and speak with someone. Moved me to a position I didn't even want because of budget to keep me on and then hired new employees for the position I had/wanted to go back to.  FYI: More you do, the more they want..  while some do nothing and reap rrewards."
bad,"I would not recommend Belk. I was hired as a seasonal merchandiser and went thru a training session. After training session, there was no communication between human resources and store management. It took them 9 days from training to scheduling my first day of work. They called me the night before I was supposed to start my first day and asked me to come in at 5 am the next morning. Very unprofessional!"
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job is marking down and you get to see the merchandise before anybody else. Setting a sale isa typical day at work and merchandising clothing
bad,This is not a job to work at i did it for a while they will tell you they will hire you on permanent but it will never happen they work all the temps very hard and there employees do hardly nothing
bad,I worked as a department manager for the children's department then managed a cosmetic counter.
bad,"Belk Treats their employees with unfairness, they don't care weather you get a break or not, they'll make you go all day with no food even if you have a health issue that requires you to eat."
bad,Working with people and customer  builds a good foundation with your customers.  Being in time and helping customer find what they need or seeking. Being able to work in all areas of the store was a lot of fun as well .
bad,"It was a pretty cool place to work at. I enjoyed working there, but however I was only seasonal. I really liked working for the company. I would go back If i could"
bad,"While at Belk, I loved meeting new people everyday and assisting them with locate products that they were shopping for but Management was strict on areas that didn't benefit the company."
bad,"Management is a joke. You’re constantly forced to work alone in busy departments on busy days, during the busiest time of year. Rarely ever fully staffed. Hires holiday help but barely schedules them. If you’re not a favorite of the managers, then good lick succeeding."
bad,The location that I worked at was not very good at treating there employees kind. The store manager had her boyfriend who was a registered offender in the store constantly. Even had him selling cookies that the employees had made.
bad,I spent 4 years with belk. After 2 years the whole brand changed. All the care now is selling more items to customers and open store credit cards.. raises are non existent. One year it was .19 and the next was .22. You can get a bigger raise if the store hits all its metrics and you hit your individual credit goal. Hated it. They promise you things you will never get
bad,"The expectations from this company are unreal! It’s like you are a trained robot to make Belk money, but you don’t! Time and attendance is taking so serious; to top it off they just changed how you request time out to one request per month unless you use your pto time. Run far away from this place, unless you want to become a Belk slave!"
bad,"Not having flexibility, very strict culture. At the time of employment, there were no opportunities for advancement. A lot of changes  in management within the company and lay-offs."
bad,"Worked in merchandising for a week and my knees started to hurt and got bleeding cracks on my heels that was painful. Was offered 4 hour shifts per day-making less then $37 per shift/day, not including gas expenses, after requesting more hours per shift . Offered me dental insurance that did not offer any benefits until 6 months-while I was to pay for it out of every check. Had penny items in the store that employees were told by management that we ""could not"" buy, even though we worked for their company. Schedules got changed too often to the point where I would show up on a day I wasn't supposed to be there and wasn't properly notified by scheduler- I say, post the schedule once a week & don't change it so your employees won't be confused about the schedule & NO ONE in there right mind is going to check a work schedule everyday because they don't have time for all that! Had to get up super early for this merchandising role. Employee discount should be more then 20%!"
bad,"Unrealistic goals are set. Getting a raise is impossible.  It’s crazy trying to get customers to open a credit card.  Your reviews/position is based on how many credit cards you get in a day, week or month.  The managers want you to chase after customers to the point that you are going behind other associates asking the same questions. I get it but I don’t get the run behind them method. Customers can become irritated.  The hours they promised are never there.  I see this company closing some stores soon.  Need a real part time job that’s not based on credit applications, item locators and surveys. How about being a vital part of a team that gets the daily job done. Dependability ,flexibility and creativity are good qualities that seems to be no longer in demand are appreciated."
bad,"This was one of my least favorite rolls. Long hours, never compensated for all of the effort or hard work. "
bad,"Long hours with limited breaks. Manager has difficulty scheduling. She relocates associates from one work location to another with no warning. Called in to work on days off, belittles employees. Toxic working environment as noted by the high turn-over-rate."
bad,"Over worked and under paid. Not enough staff to help meet customer needs. Never really saw much leadership from most of the management staff. They really push employees to sign customers up for credit cards. I like retail, but did not like working here."
bad,"Store was large, and not easy to navigate, difficult to find  scanners for employees when needed. Bathroom breaks were not long enough when bathroom was located on the opposite side of the store when needed to go. "
bad,This company does not pay well at all.  They will pay minimum wage but expect you to move mountains.  Forget about spending weekends and holidays with your family.
bad,"Belk is an unpleasant work place. There is never any coverage on the floor, the mangers are highly unprofessional and give you outrageous goals but will never give you any help to do so. They're Never satisfied, and the pay is not great."
bad,The people are not bad but the Management is just quite horrible. The new scheduling system doesn't work and the pay is horrendous. I sold close to 400K for the year and will receive approximately a 20 cent raise.
bad,Belk is a company that I would recommend for your college and high school students needing to make a few dollars to cover books and other basic necessities.  The company is not designed for professionals to develop or have any productive career advancement.
bad,"I enjoy my job itself as a sales associate, but the management is uncooperative and clueless about almost everything from day-to-day operations to the fact that we are in a sales industry. Also, a team attitude is not fostered for the associates, rather management shows blatant partiality to some and the opposite to others."
bad,Have to do your job plus other peoples. That you have to look out for your own job because even mgt is not helpful. Turned something I loved to a job i hated.
bad,"Typical day at work was customer service, sales, and straighten up the store"
bad,"Unless you’re older, they won’t keep you full time and by full time I mean 30-39 hours a week so they don’t have give you benefits "
bad,If your retired but can't seem to not work this is a place for you they will work you to death but they won't pay you much you honestly have to beg and plead. Also keep in mind the holidays are the busiest they really want you to work if you value holidays with your family this isn't the place for you.
bad,"Cons:"
bad,"I worked in the ladies shoe department for a year and a half , and I dealt with the rudest customers,  and the managers didn't care , how I was treated and i was left alone by myself during busiest hours for 4 hours or more with no help , couldn't even go to bathroom , managers hardly ever came to help , i left do to extreme exhaustion and stress . Do yourself a favor dont work here you can find better"
bad,"Hired to many people for peak season. Literally laid off because of their own mistake. 1/10 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Everyone is told to mind their own business, but that clearly doesn't happen."
bad,"Was hired as a seasonal employee. Training was minimal at best. Managers often were not available to help, and were stressed and were rude. There were workers who showed up hours late, and were not repremanded for it at all, as the store was so desperate for help. More returns than sales at this store. Coupons were confusing and often made customers angry as they did not work. Would not recommend for employment."
bad,Belk apparently prefer to hire visa candidates to its IT division. Those are working numerous unaccounted hours without any option to quit. It's culture is highly technical leadership centric than people centric.
bad,"Poor management. They do not care what happens to their employees. They only want someone to fill the position and be there. The pay is almost always starting at $8 or $9/hr. They do not give you enough hours each week, even if your availability is completely open. If someone from management is friends with a coworker and that coworker dislikes someone then the person who is disliked, is treated poorly and given hardly any hours. At one point, a few people were given as little as 7 hours for one week. I had a horrible experience with belk and even became depressed from working there. I really do not recommend working there. You are a human being and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity."
bad,"AI was an HR Professional at Belk's corporate office.  My dept was one of the most toxic work environments ever.  The leadership is horrible & there is no oversight and accountability. They do whatever they want.  The only way to be successful in Belk is to be liked by mgmt & leaders.  If they are not fond of you,  it doesn't matter what you bring to the table or how well you do your job, your success is doomed!"
bad,"The Store Manager, Operations Manager and HE Managers were lazy and did nothing but sir in the back office and gossip. They played favorites and hard working emllotess were overlooked for advancements so their favorites could have special treatment"
bad,Management is rude to sales floor employees. Crazy hours during the holidays. Even during Thanksgiving when they’re 1 of 2 stores open in the whole  mall
bad,"The company has lost its way and has alienated its core customers. Sales revenue is down significantly and that has translated to increased pressure on employees, making it a miserable place to work."
bad,"Higher Ups are too concerned with email captures, phone numbers, presells, sales goals and credit apps than good old fashioned customer service. The fact that there are no shopping carts to put kids in safely makes it an inconvenience for shopping parents with kids."
bad,The management is always changing and your hours are often cut with no explanation. They were not forgiving when you are late clocking in or late leaving. The Lunch breaks were the only peaceful thing about the job. Sales targets were often too high for the low level traffic we were getting on a regular basis and management kept pushing us to sell Belk credit cards that no one wanted to buy. They based time off and other benefits based on how many credit cards were sold. Belk was always calling me in when I had the day off and often had bad schedule mishaps that resulted in conflict between the workers as well as management. I did not enjoy working there.
bad,I appreciated the opportunity to work at Belk but there were not enough hours of work to compensate me.The best thing about working at Belk was that I got to meet great people everyday and that is why I stayed at Belk as long as I did.
bad,Belk expects its employees to work  even when they are too ill to do so. There are favorites among the Assistant Managers who receive preferential treatment and the rest of the associates are required to pull the extra weight
bad,"To many complaints from customers regards to coupons never work , no returning policies , customers complaining dirty fitting rooms , sales were never successful"
bad,employees feel very unappreciated. The work environment is very competitive therefore the employees are not friendly with one another. Management hires everyone at part time hours and works them up the full-time hour limit. thereby getting full-time work without having to pay full-time benefits.
bad,We had to have a minimum of 1 Belk credit card registered with a customer. i was let go because I was going to have a surgery that i really needed to help with my health
bad,"A typical day was going in and marketing for the salon, then the clients come in and would book with another stylist.  I  learned very little. As far as management.....the general manager does not even have a license for hair, nails, or aesthetics!!!  The most enjoyable part of the job was the other stylists that I happened to know from other salons, it gave us plenty of time to catch up."
bad,"I'd only recommend working here if you're looking for a summer gig or something short term. The pay is horrible and honestly the stress is not worth it. You'll be required to work most holidays and work crazy hours at times. Also, opportunities for advancement are slim to none."
bad,I have had more experience than all of the current cosmetic employees combined and was given hours from 6pm to 9pm at night. Closed every night. Commission was taken out from under me. Wasn't given a fair opportunity to move into management positions even with the prior management experience because I wasn't friends with the right managers.
bad,if you have children or may catch a cold do not apply... it will only work if your a college student . all they care about is credit...the discount is good.
bad,Management is poor at best. Management treats associates as stupid worthless people. There is virtually nothing enjoyable about this company and working there.
bad,"Worked there almost 7 years, and while its true you won't get rich in retail, last 3 the top management attitude to work conditions changed as completely as can be imagined. Cutting hours to 30/wk. for months after Christmas is most often described as economics, but customers weren't served well by having skeleton crews on days deemed ""not primary sales days,"" and anyone with bills, kids in college or mortgage was flattened."
bad,I worked this job during the winter to pay the bills.  Management doesn't care about you at all.  I was let go after the season.
bad,"I was there while in college and only stayed because the pay was decent and they were able to work around my school hours. Other than that, there was no reason one would not hate the job. The customers are awful, management is incompetent, and Belk's Upper management expected unattainable goals, otherwise you were demoted. They were always short staffed. Nothing but bad things to say unfortunately."
bad,"Belk mgmt was terrible. Only interested in the credit card quotas- not your ability to sell your actual product line. Very demeaning. Not flexible at all with requests to switch days/times with other employees willing to switch( reason: too much paperwork involved, in other words, just a supervisor's signature. One employee asked off half day to be with family at visitation when grandfather died."" No "" was the answer with a threat to terminate employment. A floor mgr's grandmother passed away shorly after and was allowed to take off a full week!!! Major announcement to other employees with requests for prayer for the family. Funeral arrangements info displayed in break room in case other employees wanted to attend. Really!!! "
bad,"I learned a lot about people, how to manage and how to deal with management. Having worked in 3 different locations, my experiences differ vastly based on the location and the manager that I reported to. I believe there is opportunity for improvement with certain procedures, as well as building a better relationship with all levels of workers. Even though a learned a lot, I wished I had chose another career path, knowing what I know now."
bad,Managers only care about themselves and what their bosses want.   Employees are not appreciated. Employees are looked at as disposable commodities. Easily  replaces.
bad,Working for Belk over the years had its ups and downs. The holidays are the worst. You have very little time with family during the holidays. Thanksgiving
bad,"Not what it seems, not a career job, no room for advancement. Ok for seasonal work or college students  or someone looking to make some extra money. Employee discount."
bad,"Had a moderately promising chance of growing within the company, but management was brisk and inflexible. Did not provide a sufficient amount of hours on a week-by-week basis."
bad,"The workplace culture at belk is very vile and filled with so much negativity and gossip.  But, at the same time, there are some good thing about belk. Some of the staff are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly customers, as well as having to deal with the incessant gossip that plagues the place. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with sensible customers. A typical day at Belk is filled with endless folding and folding and folding. As well as, helping customers find whatever article of clothing they are looking for. I have learnt some things at the job, most among them is patience and understanding."
bad,"I was in HR. The overall job is easy but they don't train you properly and if you voice your opinion you're automatically a target. The ""management"" has its favorites and protect them. If you are not a favorite count your days. The ""pay"" for a specialist is laughable. But Directors and Sr. Obs are making 175+. "
bad,Management would understaff to make their ratios look good. Opening credit cards was the main incentive. Management was a mess. Favoritisms common. Not impressed.
bad,"Belk is a fast paced work environment which means you would think they’d have plenty of people on the floor to cover everything from, checking fitting rooms, to helping customers, cleaning departments & cashier. Well you’re wrong. This is the worst company I’ve ever worked for, VERY unorganized, they can’t seem to keep up with who works when so that means when they don’t have enough people to cover some of the departments or really anyone at all, you’ll most likely get called in on any of your off days or get dragged (not literally) from whatever department you’re working in to cover another department. All because they don’t know how to schedule anyone correctly; which can be very frustrating for employees and customers. I know customers can get frustrated waiting at a cash stand to check out yet no one is there so they’ll walk away to either leave out of frustration or to another area that is probably already really busy. Hours aren’t good at all especially for part time, employee discount is okay.. just an overall bad experience especially for me, I work 3 days a week 12 hours a week.. pay is biweekly so I’m only making less than $400 a month, who can live off of that?."
bad,"I think it should be a requirement to work in retail at least once in your life. If you don't like it,  hopefully you gain some knowledge or insight into the real world from it!"
bad,"Was a seasonal part-time sales associate and work a full-time job. They ignored my availability and scheduled me to work until midnight during the holidays, which was difficult since I had to be at my ""real"" job at 8 a.m.  They wouldn't even discuss changing my schedule. Very physical with carrying armloads of clothes. Often had to cover multiple departments and close multiple registers. Very little training. Coupons and promotions have so many exclusions till they are almost useless and customers get angry.  The employee discount was, however, very generous and double discount days were great!"
bad,"High turnover ,constantly training new people management never can be trusted never have your back tension very high hear complaints constantly no praise for good job only negative for the bad never enough"
bad,"The sales associates were nice to work with. Howeve,r the managemant  department could use some work. The pay is okay and i did get to get some more retail experience that will help me with getting another job."
bad,"Belk only worrries about 1 thing... and thats sales. The pay isnt worth the stress! Management expects to say jump, and you to reply how high?!?! They concentrate only on the negative, and never the positive. You will rarely ever get a thank you. High turnover rate because of all of this!! I warn you....stay away!!!! Its not worth your breath!!"
bad,"I worked at Belk several years, in several different positions. Once I reached a mid-level store position I was forced to take another position. Once in that position, the position was eliminated and I was moved down to a regular associate. I was not eligible for any more pay increases because my salary was capped because of the position I have been moved to. Advancement seems almost impossible in the store I worked in. I would not recommend Belk to anyone unless it was a last reaort"
bad,"The management is lacking, training is insufficient, the store is unclean and messy, no pay growth, low morale. The only pleasant thing about Belk are the products they sell and the sales. As an employee the discount is all you have to look forward to. Better to work for Nordstrom."
bad,Not doing too well for the company. Managers are constantly having issues with staff. Terrible at scheduling and professionalism is almost completely nonexistent.
bad,Was told there was room for advancement but there isn't. The current store manager doesn't promote from within or care to train beyond your current position.
bad,"Management constantly pushing for credits. Morning meeting sometimes consist of talking about credits. You are constantly preselling which consist of your brand’s GWP, Charity day, Beauty Sense, and Elite day which are all 2 times a year. At my store if you don’t make the credit goal you have to stand at the entrance asking  ppl to apply, so if you make commission it’s great not being on the floor selling. Treated like a queen or king nearly untouchable if you make your credits goals even says so in the attendance policy. My Cosmetics’s manager wouldn’t sign a a corrective punch in sheet so I couldn’t get paid because it wasn’t a good enough reason because I didn’t punch in correctly . I had to go to HR to get paid and was paid late. Store manager would post who was failing in credits and sales on board for everyone to see.  If you like to be embarrassed, harassed, and told what you lack everyday Belk is the place for you."
bad,Management is not understanding of school + work load. Company would often send completely wrong sales signs for sales promotions. Would go days without speaking to the store manager. Department manager was never around.
bad,"Worst training, management were nice but too nice. HR played favorites and politics. Made us take 30 minute breaks after 6 hours of work when only scheduled for 6 hours and 30 minutes."
bad,"No hours, no decent pay, no loyalty to good workers, high turnover rate, no advancement, lots of change, hopefully it will get better as time progresses."
bad,"The working environment was okay. However, the female managers are rude, unprofessional, and can be bullies. If you’re new to the job, they will disrespect you. There are better Belk stores to work for but not this one."
bad,went in put up merchandise. helped customers. the manager wasnt to nice. coworkers friendly. nice place to work just didnt pay nothing.there wasnt really nothing hard about the job.
bad,To demanding company low pay high demand ratio not advancement possibilities there at all company seems to be changing drastically when i first started working there overall systematic changes for worse
bad,"Work here if you have a support system that help financially, otherwise you will be living from paycheck to paycheck. You have to push credit and sales!"
bad,This is the worse place that I have work the management is very rude they have no compassion for their workers my checks where always short and I never knew what time I was getting off.
bad,"I worked here for two years, and I can say that I've had better experiences. The management refuse to work with you on your schedule, there was favortism so bad some of my co-workers quit because of it. When I first began working my coworkers, my direct manager and my manager's manager tried to make me quit. It was pretty bad. The turn over rate is awful and the company doesn't even make the trouble worth while by giving raises! I would not, and have not recommended to anyone that they apply to work for this company."
bad,The best part of working at Belk was the employee discount. There are long hours and no overtime for Managers. It is a good entry level job but I would not recommend this as a career path. Black Friday gets crazier every year.
bad,Very poor communication and management. No medical benefits or paid vacation to part time employees. Hours are not steady and Operations Team Processors work is very physically demanding for only $10 per hour.
bad,"Not great at working with your availability.  Managers rarely care about their associates.  Store manager is a nightmare. Great products, but poorly run company."
bad,The pay is horrible they show alot of favortism not enough pay for about all ten jobs+ u have to do lead person doesnt help out at all bark orders and walk around
bad,"Do not work here unless you have too. The store manager sucks, if you have to miss work they act like its the end of the world. Over worked and under payed."
bad,Even though company expanded by purchasing Parisian stores the company still literally runs like a mom and pop store.  Its not what you know but who you know that gives you advancement.
bad,"My advice is to not work hard for Belk. Hard work is recognized and taken advantage of... but not rewarded. The way to get ahead at Belk is to flatter management, participate in gossip, and speak negatively about coworkers to management. I would also suggest that you perform carnal favors and buy gifts for management. That has seemed to work out well for one of my co-workers."
bad,"A typical work day consists of placing merchandise on the sales floor, setting sales for the day, assisting customers with purchases as well as working on mannequins and markdowns if necessary."
bad,Go in talk to your supervisor get to work. I learned how to pack very quickly management was ok. My co-workers was ok no hard part to the job the most enjoyable part was getting off
bad,"No respect for upper management, but upper management has no respect for employees - even going to far to insult employees behind theri backs. It's a gossip filled mess full of employees playing on their phones right in front of customers and providing no customer service what-so-ever. The few good employees don't stick around long."
bad,This is a great first job to have.  The managment there are not that great and the turn over rate is crazy.  Always new faces
bad,"I worked at one of the busiest belks in Alabama for three years.We were always understaffed and overwhelmed by our sections and were expected to take care of other sections when we closed, but they never could return the favor. My first manager was excellent! my manager was horrible, worst than any manager I had ever worked under, eventually it got to the point where she was so incompetent, we did our job ignored everything she said. She was rude and unprofessional and weirdly would try to start drama. Most customers were fine but there were always a few regulars that were snotty because they were obviously better than you. most people i want to slap and tell them ""this is not what life is about!"" they cared more about coupons and sales than you as a person and they were very ignorant and materialistic to the point it made me sad every-time i worked. They were very selfish, ignorant and rude. my experience with shoplifters were the same way. I wish i could have just told them i knew it was stolen. The whole experience made me hate modern society and made me realize I just never want to be in a mall again."
bad,"Hostile work environment, be prepared to work every day with only one day off as the manger creates your schedule around her families. Be prepared to close every night and every weekend due to the manager not closing at all or working weekends. Be prepared to do your job plus the managers job while she eats, sleeps and burps. The manager doesn’t know to communicate with her staff she constantly belittles and talks down to her staff and also talks about her staff behind her there back."
bad,"I loved this job when I started, but after the manager that was there when I started left, if went down hill quickly. The company is all about money and cutting corners to save money, the store manager is very unprofessional, the store is always a mess and employees are treated like dirt no matter how hard they work."
bad,By far the worst job I ever had. Management sucks and coworkers was extremely unfriendly and rude. What I learned by working here is you can be the nicest person but still will get talk about like trash.
bad,It's only retail and the bottom line is selling. The management does not care who you are or even if there is enough staff to unload trucks and merchandise. Use to be a time building work setting however the poor lack in management and human decency evades this location. Fake it until you make it.
bad,"Easily the worst job I have had. I applied for part time seasonal and I was made to work about 8-10 hours a day about 5 or 6 days out of the week. It was extremely difficult to try to change your schedule or take days off. Management was a mess. The work wasn't exactly hard, but I ended up doing quite a bit of work that I didn't sign up for. Also I had to teach myself everything, although I went through the little training course online, I had to teach myself how to use the register, find merchandise, etc. I would work 6 hours straight and then be told I couldn't take a break LOL. Overall horrible experience, I stayed there a lot longer than I should have..."
bad,Little to no support from management. Did not offer proper training but expected assignments to be completed without any notice.  It was a cut throat environment.  Other associates expected to meet their quotas without giving any consideration to you.
bad,"You get a 15 min break after standing for 6 hours. You are told that even though you hired for this specific role you will be doing all things to all men. Meaning you will be ""trained "" for EVERYTHING. If you don't like being salesmen don't take on the job because you'll have a quota to sell credit cards. If you have any kind of knee, back or feet issue don't take on the job because you will be walking and standing for HOURS. Training is sitting in front of a computer all day for 6 hours. No interaction with other fellow employees. PLUS: they do pay you a little more than minimum wage and the clothes are nice. This job is good for high school, college kids who are fit. (They make you work weekends)"
bad,Managers are mediocre to poor and lack the skills to determine quality candidates. They work the sales staff to death without reward and don’t hesitate to let someone go who complains about the lack of appreciation for their hard work! They are not appreciative at all of the extra efforts made by their staff to meet the strenuous agenda.
bad,Look elsewhere you will not regret it! They will yell at you if you communicate with other co-workers. They do not recognize being sick with a doctors note. Overall not a good company!
bad,It sucks and I need another job. I can’t pay my bills with the minuscule checks I get from there. And I get paid $11 a hour. It’s sad and I need to find something better so I can pay my bills and feed and clothe my kids.
bad,I was a sales Associate at belk. Working there was horrible the managers were horrible lack of communication. They would blame the workers there for their lack of knowledge. And for breaks good luck because they didnt not care if you had one or were going to get one.
bad,"I Enjoyed it at first but after a while, the demands for you to work at least 2 midnight shifts during holidays, is what finally made me look else where for a job.  They have you working these shifts while managers are at home with family."
bad,"I worked for Belk for a while, and I always loved it until I moved to Belk in Griffin and moved to the women's department. At that point, it quickly became just a job. The management team is dysfunctional and not understanding at all. I got along with my coworkers fairly well, my only real problem was the managers. I had family circumstances and personal problems arise that were ignored and overlooked by the managers when I needed a day off or to leave early they were very reluctant and almost angry about it."
bad,"Managers talk about employees to other mangers and to other employees, even personal business. If your not their click then they find a way to write you up, move you to another department without the employee knowledge and or fire you."
bad,Only good thing to come out of belk was meeting my department Manager. She would get in work hard. She would never ask one of us to do something she wouldn't do herself. Great Manager
bad,"Must produce sales even when given schedules with no traffic in store-75% of customers already have credit card with Belks, so getting one to apply is HARD work!  As a FT associate you are expected to get 5 apps a week-hard to do unless you are in Mens Wear!  Sales goals are given ONCE and you are expected to remember THAT and keep up with that, no matter how unrealistic.  People are constantly being hired for PT and seasonal, but rarely do their share or care if they skip a day, a week, or are late, since they are not invested in staying!  Listened to SM give a shoe boy (stocks boxes and empties boots of paper stuffing) an hour and half of all the details of Belks and their CHARM system, getting brownie points and so on, while leaving the sales staff in the dark and untrained.  Store does not give BREAKS AT ALL, since there is no law stating they must, you get NOTHING-You get a lunch/dinner break (unpaid) and that is it, no matter how long you work!  Customers are upscale and expect good service, tend to come in for deep discounts and have been weaned on coupons, Belks Bucks, and Credit Cards.  Fun atmosphere, pleasant work environment, lots of contests (credit cards-SPIFS-Belks.com-CHARM), pleasant co-workers, pay is low, its RETAIL, hard standing on feet ALL DAY! You will work all holidays except XMAS day, weekends, and go from closing to opening the next day-Hours are inconsistent, this is no nine to five!  Pay and advancement is minimal even for qualified employees, but if you are alternate, you have a good chance of moving up the food chain-otherwise, no chance!  Management"
bad,"I think it could use better management/HR/Schedulers.  You had no work/life balance.  There is no room for growth.  I did, however, enjoy meeting and working with co workers and customers."
bad,"The management wasn't that bad. They had to answer to corporate, so they did what they had to do to survive. They didn't look out for employees at all!"
bad,"ok work place. The people I worked with made the job enjoyable.  My supervisor was one of the best supervisors I'ved had the pleasure of working with. The open availablility was my biggest problem, I like to have a set schedule so that I can plan accordingly."
bad,"I worked at Belk for over a year. I never recieved a raise and everyone (I mean everyone) who came in after me received higher pay. We're supposed to have a status check once a month, I've been there over a year and only received two. There are a couple good and Ginuwine managers, the rest are awful and lazy. My coworkers were the only thing that made the job worth it."
bad,"They will screw your training up. Not only that they ask you in the beginning the days you can and can't work on for personal reasons, school, or anything else. They will schedule you in on those days no matter what you say or do and refuse to change it."
bad,Management was cruel to employees and pay was barely above minimum wage with no chance of earning a raise although pay and hour cuts were common place.
bad,They pay is an absolute insult for the work you put into this job. You do more more than the cashiers but are brought in making a dollar and a half less.
bad,"Poor management, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.  You go to work not knowing what you are doing, and the management yells at you for following rules that are posted but not changed to the current requirements.  Very stressful and hours get cut if you work hard."
bad,goog place to work at close to home a lot of different job titles if there is no work in one place you have the opportunity to go to another department and train there which is a good thing
bad,A typical day includes insuring that the my department is fully prepared for customers.
bad,I had The worst experience ever with Belk! Not only do they not want to pay you but they also don’t want to let you work. And transferring from one store to another takes forever and a day and then when it’s time to come back to your original store you can completely forget that! I’ve never in my life had to deal with such a terrible store in my life.
bad,"Since Belk was sold, the culture has shifted 180 degrees at the corporate office. The new management doesn't have large scale experience and they are bringing in their friends from small chain stores that don't really know much about how to get the job done. They are cutting budget and reducing headcount; eliminating the people that that know how to get things done.  Everyone remaining is working around the clock trying to meet deadlines that are impossible to meet so we can keep our jobs."
bad,Leadership team does not have long term vision or growth plans. Looking to sell the company for quick profit within short period. No growth Opportunity. Trying to keep just the lights on and minimum workforce to do that. No Work Life Balance. Nothing interesting to learn & grow. No challenging opportunities to keep the job interesting.
bad,I didn't work there long so I don't got much to say and all I can say is for the little time I did work there. It Was a long commute to and from and I could keep working there
bad,It's  retail and it is ever changing. So you have to be adaptable to change. The most enjoyable thing about this job is the people being just one big family.
bad,"A typical day at work for Belk consisted of cleaning the floors, checking the dressing rooms, restocking clothing, and typical customer service. It was good job if you had nothing else in your life going on. Like school, or family emergencies."
bad,"always something to do to make the day pass"
bad,"They are going through a transformation in their corporate offices. If you are on the right team with the right leader, you could be a part of something special."
bad,"hard work, if there is a raise it will only be .10 cents, the guy who was in charge of the receiving area was always mean, to much drama, and micro management."
bad,"Working retail was a great experience for me.  I learn how to deal with people and I loved helping people.  I just did not like having to work every weekend, and not being able to enjoy my holidays with my family."
bad,I dealt with a lot of customers and stood on my feet all day with one allotted break even I you worked 8+ hours.  I had a good manager
bad,"not a good place to work , cuts everyone hours you can make more working in a fast food place. management is terrible they dont  want to help nor add more hours to people schedule"
bad,"Job was in receiving, unloading various sizes of boxes from trucks, some of them very heavy. Company has unfair firing/termination policies. If you call off one day for a reason, you are terminated with no eligibility for rehire in the future. Whereas, Amazon, you can be terminated, you can come back. You can call off one day, and be back the next day. Favoritism, gossipers, unfairness, low pay."
bad,"I would not recommend Belk as an employer. The repeatedly disappoint their customers and expect employees to do more with less. They do not supply you with the necessary tools to perform your job. I was always disappointing my customers by not having the necessary basic products that they required. I was only receiving stock sometimes once a month or less. They still have not corrected this action and I doubt that they will. They will reduce your pay for not meeting your goals but will not supply you with the necessary tools to do your job. The employees who work hardest always eventually leave. The have an extremely high turnover rate,"
bad,"For a retail store the benefits if your full time are great. Some that will compare with large Corporations. But the work environment is not ideal. As receiving area was the better area to work. Never enough help and you had to wear more hats then you could handle, for the amount you were paid. Which wasn't worth what you had to endure. Stress through the roof. Lots of favoritism. But it was overall a learning experience. One that will last me a life time. You can't supply great customer care with one person in each department and with no one in other areas. Company Executives need to actually work in the stores and just see how things really work. I've worked in both areas, from Corporate to sales. Unless you walk in those shoes, you can't imagine what its really like.  Computers and papers don't tell the whole story. Ideas on paper can look great, but trying to use them in real life, doesn't always work. Cut backs will cost you in the long run."
bad,A regular day at belk is okay. You may go to work like i dont want to be here but when one of your regular customers come see you everything change.
bad,The job position was ok and they really need to improve the system. I guess that job is not really for me but it's wonderful job position as well.
bad,"My duties included helping and greeting customers, selling products an stocking.  I enjoyed working with some of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to please unhappy customers. The most rewarding part of the job was making a mad customer happy."
bad,"Without overly disparaging the company, they were a family owned retail operation that was successful for 125 years because their employees were known for great customer service. That they decided to forego that background and simply pound and denigrate the contributions of the hourly workforce is unfortunate. One simple fact of life there was NO MATTER WHAT level of sales an associate accomplished or how well-maintained their department, the only factor that management was concerned about was getting credit applications, a result of putting their corporate card with GE Financial. "
bad,Irregular hours and unpredictable schedule.  Poor work/life balance.
bad,"You will do most jobs here. Start with unloading stock and merchandising it according to your flow and floor plan. Recover the floor and fitting rooms. Clean fixtures and sweep floors. All while trying to meet a sales goal per hour and soliciting credit applications for EVERY customer. Oh and you'll be understaffed. There were many days where only four people were on the top floor. Usually five. There are SIX stations and there should be two associates at each. The managers will dart in and will not answer calls from you. They do not follow policy. I even got in trouble for checking id for a check until I pointed it out in their training manual. Seriously, management is a big problem there."
bad,The review and issues with Belk's Information Technology group will be limited to the span of control of the information security function as it existing upon my departure.
bad,"Running a register, helping customers, cleaning out dressing rooms."
bad,I have nothing to elaborate on.  It is a part-time job and that is all. The most important thing to remember is that all jobs have peaks and valleys.  That is all.
bad,I really enjoyed working with the company but it's to much favoritism and I was definitely over looked and I have a lot of potential to share. The employees that have been there for years feel like the new employees were out to get their position when we just wanted to be a part of the Belk team.
bad,"Management  Favortism to certain employees , hostile environment And discrimination to disability and age.  Managers do not treat all employees to same."
bad,boring work.  not creative.  output per day is measured and then they ask for more.  they try to do 'fun' things at work to gloss over the fact that you are chained to your desk.  avoid it if you can.
bad,"You barley get hours , i was only working 1 day out the week ,sometimes no days and every time I ask for more hours they would just tell me they don’t have hours to give but they stay hiring new people."
bad,"I have worked for Belk for over three years. There is no room for moving up, because our managers hire in their friends and give them the higher positions. You will not get a raise every year, or even every three years. Even though the raise would only be ten cents, they will find a reason not to give it to you. They do NOT respect your time outside of Belk."
bad,"Professionally challenging work environment.  Management regularly looking for innovative ways to do business in a changing retail industry."
bad,"Starting pay is $8.50 an hour at the Johnson City, TN location. Compared to most retail jobs, the pay is decent. I worked in gratis-based sales, as well as freight. I personally don’t like being involved in the sales process or with customers, so that part wasn’t great. Working freight was awesome. Unload a truck and go home. If they had hours to spare, I would still be at that job."
bad,Belk does not care about it's employees. They do not offer flexible scheduling like they say they do. Your schedule is always changing and they schedule you for times that are marked closed on your availability chart. They expect you to stay over when there's a call in instead of mangers picking up the slack. The employees resent training you so there's a hostile work environment.
bad,Management was very bad. No one in the manager position cared about helping me with any problems I may have had. First starting the job I had to figure everything out on my own. HR didn't want to issue me a discount card. Wrost job experience ever!
bad,Pay is low  only yearly raises given. Overall an ok place to work . Not enough workers present in which makes your job hard..the hardest part of the job would be the fitting rooms always packed with clothes
bad,"I loved this job at first, as a young and impressionable woman. I slowly but surely began to dread my everyday duties. With constant problems such as understaffing, improper training, and unrealistic metrics, my position became far more stressful than what I was being paid to do. Maintaining a balance of my regular duties (sales, keeping my department neat, interacting with customers, etc.), plus additonal duties in a lead postion (auditing inventories, planning events, monitoring and encouraging others in my department, etc.), plus covering the duties of the poorly trained and severly part time operations associates (unloading trucks, merchandising, floor moves, etc.), was nearly impossible. I always perservered, and I was paid back with a full $2 an hour pay cut. Not because my perfomance was poor, but because of others in my department. As their supervisor, but not a manager with actual powers to motivate and reward progress, I was punished to the point of poverty. I could go on and on about this company. Put simply, don't bother."
bad,"Management do not really care for their employees. They only want you to breathe, sleep and eat Belk. The benefits are not that good. And they want everyone to work every holidays . . . ."
bad,"Some areas have only a couple of associates . Others Areas  that are not busy have  4 to 5 on one day. They've  hired more people only to cut the hours of someone  that has been there for yrs and has to do the work to keep the department  running. You're  constantly  given work to do with no hours to do it. Then get in trouble for not getting it done. "
bad,The job is good if you like working in retail and meeting customers . The location I was in need better communication and teamwork . Store manager was not hands on w.
bad,Management is poor and it gets very boring. They drag you in with the promise of a good pay (if you’re 16 that is) and give you very little flexibility. Hope you don’t enjoy having Saturday’s or Sunday’s off cause you will work both almost always. The lunch breaks are the only good part.
bad,"They consider 30 hours to be full time. If you should work over 30 hours one week they will cut your hours the next week. They are not considerate when you call in to say you will be late due to a train, traffic or weather which is beyond your control. There is no support from management when there are disrespectful customers."
bad,In store management was a mixed review in lieu of better or worse. No advancement regardless of desire to work and move up. Would not go back to if given the chance.
bad,Store manager ran building like it was her personal business played favoritism for all women and belittled men. She was abusive in every possible way. She hit me on several occassions.
bad,I loved all of my coworkers BUT they made me work almost 32 hours a week even when I was going to school and only was part time. My manager constantly micromanaged EVERYONE. She took out her stress on her employees and on holidays upper management would not give us our schedules till the last minute. Most of the other managers were good. I loved the assistant store manager. But I would NEVER go back unless that manager left.
bad,"They don't want to work with employees schedule. poor management. department manager are pushy to open credit cards make online and in-store sales. its just bad and very stressful. No sales, credits you'll never get promoted even when you can be the best hard worker."
bad,Belk is a good time part time job. Its a good environment to work in. The best part of the job is leaving. And the managers are understanding willing to work with you.
bad,"I would normally clock in and have to go find a manager to figure out the job for the day, then half way through one task i would be pulled away to do another task, none of which ever got completed. Goals never were achievable unless it was a goal set for a well paid worker. 8.25 per hour is not enough pay for the amount of work expected in 5 hours. Being brought in an hour before the truck came and being sent home an hour after it came felt very discriminative because i was the only person with that schedule and i was the only person under 25 working with a completely different generation that looked down on me. The manager was older and had her own ideas about how everything should be, and already had a dislike for millenials before i worked there. The only enjoyable thing was the fact that there wasn't much customer interactions, so if you have anxiety its a great job, but there were more deficits to the job than benefits."
bad,"Being a blue collar job, the hours were long and the work environment was tiresome. Nepotism is rampant, there is little to no respect for employees that aren't part of the ""in crowd"". Infractions for the people that are the favorites of the managers get overlooked, while the most minor incident for the quiet people results in immediate termination."
bad,"When I was first hired at Belk it was great.  However, since the company was purchased, the changes have been terrible.  Over the past six months, almost our whole management team has been replaced and it is very clear that the new management does not care about the employees.  We are treated like property instead of people.  The only reason I have stayed as long as I have is because I love the people that work in my specific department, but outside of that the environment is stressful and unwelcoming.  Employees that have worked there for years are leaving left and right.  Raises are almost impossible to obtain and you are definitely not treated fairly.  The only way to get a raise is by meeting six different goals, all of which are set at outrageous levels, such as extremely high sales goals that are based on a twenty hour work week (when you only get ten hours), an overall store goal (which you have no control over),  and getting at least three credit application a week when everyone already has the card or definitely doesn't want one (working in my department I was only able to get 16 all of last year).  When hired, I was told I would be given at least one Saturday off a month but I have not been given one in over a year unless I requested it.  Even when you request time off, you hardly ever get it.  I am also a college student and they do not work with my school schedule if anything pops up.  They also keep cutting hours to the point that almost no one who works part-time can afford their bills.  I was told I would work a minimum fifteen hours a week and I am averaging"
bad,"There seems to be little to no organization.  The HR people leave you without answers or access to answers.  I’m still waiting, for example, for my password that would allow me access to their computer system that does EVERYTHING.  I’ve been there a month.  I had to beg to be put into the time clock system."
bad,"it was a very slow paced job that didn't  schedule a lot of employees. We did not get very many customers to assist. "
bad,The location I worked for treated all employees as replaceable. A highly stressful work environment.  I made more money than the average belk employee since I was working originally for the company they bought out. I was a good employee with no wrie ups and because of this they kept applying more pressure and adding more duties on me until I quit.
bad,"This job was okay,staffing was always problem and because of that associates were relied own to make up the slack . Pay was okay for the amount of work you do I feel like you should be paid more or at least have it so that the excellent associate can get promotions quicker .Overall it was an okay place to work"
bad,"Belk was a fantastic place for growth and career development until it was sold several years ago. Co-workers, culture and a company rich in tradition has changed dramatically since the acquisition by Sycamore. No work/life balance, poor management."
bad,I loved all the Associates that I encountered while working at Bellk.  The workplace environment had a lot to be desired.  The new management ruled with fear and intimidation.  She would begin each morning meeting with a positive quote but if she could not control you she would call you into her office and yell or intimidate you or threaten to write you up enough times so she could fire you.
bad,"I was injured on the job in 1994.  I was given work in the back office because of my physical limitations.  In 2005, our company was sold and my position was changed.  Despite my physical difficulties, I became a regular sales floor associate-it was this or nothing.  Working on the sales floor was difficult for me because of my physical weaknesses.  Standing and lifting stock for 6 or 7 hours a day was difficult.  My position was ""eliminated"" this year, after 26 years with the company.  Retail is not for everyone, by any means."
bad,"I started during the holiday season, at a time where the attitudes of my peers were not that good. I made the best out of a few uncomfortable situations, with a smile. I've enjoyed working with the public, and try to make the best of each day."
bad,"I would not work for  them ever again , I Worked for this Company before years ago,  wonderful place, I worked "
bad,Many years ago used to be a great place to work. Anyplace that will terminate an employee for not obtaining a set number Credit Card applications from customers does not make a very pleasant work environment.
bad,"The pay is low, the management need some work. It Doesn't matter if your sick as a dog and have a drs note they are still going to blow up your phone and tell you to come in."
bad,"Clothing, shoes, accessories, lingerie and a home department. This store has everything. Trust me. Youll find what you need with the help of the helpful sales associates."
bad,I've been with Belk for 1 year. I love the company but the store in Valdosta is a complete joke. They aren't an equal opportunity employer. The managers do what they want but associates are expected to follow the handbook. Wish I was able to relocate to a more fair and appreciative store.
bad,"No longer family owned"
bad,"Used to be a good company to work for until late 2016. New management has brought a negative environment where focus is on punishment instead of praise.  Goals are centered on phone number and email capture, as well as getting customers to apply for Belk credit which prompts employees to be pushy in order to meet their goals (or cheat the system as some do).  Not enough emphasis on the customer's experience, or sales.   Not enough people scheduled on many days which makes it hard to straighten areas, or help customers much of the time.  A strong sense of division between some management and employees."
bad,I t was a seasonal janitor job and they act like they liked my work but after the holidays i was let go even after great reviews form my manger over my department.
bad,"The people are great, I love my customers and coworkers. If the hours were regular and not so scarce it could be so much better for me personally. But the people are nice."
bad,"Worked west knox ,great if your single and no life due to ever changing hours and ping pong schedule..and benefits as in ins and days off suck,oh you get 20% percent emoloyee discount if you like there over priced outta style clothing .."
bad,"After I started making a lot of money my hours was cut to 2 days a week, 4 hours a day. I worked on commission. If I didn't reach my sales goal for the week (they never told you what it was) you'll get penalized and would only get paid an hourly fee. I was asked to come back after I quit, I declined."
bad,"It's like everyone that works there is extremely salty and they look down on you for being a person pretty much ."
bad,Management and co workers were rude. They put on a fake family vibe but they don't really care about you. A terrible place to work.
bad,"If you work in the cosmetics department, don't expect to be appreciated by store management WHAT-SO-EVER. We received an award but weren't notified about it. Cosmetics drives a lot of the business in the store since it's never discounted, but our success continues to go unnoticed. Management plays favorites, allowing some employees to come in late, leave early, call off work and never get written up while they write up other employees for being 6 minutes late three times a month."
bad,they let a system schedule you which made your hours go down and they never tried to give you days. I wish I never worked here
bad,Not a good place for job security or advancement for contract employee's
bad,"Being full-time mean you are only guaranteed 30 hours per week. They make these hours fair - It doesn't matter if you are a manager, a top producer with a great work ethic -or- someone who behaves disrespectfully, does not follow the rules or is a half an hour late for every shift. There is absolutely no reward for being a good employee and on the flip-side, no recourse for being lazy. "
bad,"Our particular store has the WORST store manager. She is disorganized, forgetful, micromanages, and can be very spiteful. I loved this job but she made it completely miserable. I wouldn't work here unless you can stand your ground and deal with a rude and pushy boss who takes everything you do personally."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job dealing with the customers or merchandising things. Management were not always around and when they were had a attitude about everything. 
bad,If you like to be bullied by passive aggressive management then this is the place for you. Unless you open credit cards by the dozen you are not worthy Lol! What a joke
bad,Merchandising
bad,"It's a good place to work if the managers would just get replaced there all really old and cant relate to todays world. They change the rules and job duties every month to ""try and make things better"" but it just makes it worse, so then you have to fix there mistakes!"
bad,Left because it was understaffed did not want to give me a raise after hired on fulltime didn't want to give me information about benefit packages didn't respect my availability several racist customers called workers of color names.
bad,There is no flexibility in a full time work schedule... Management does not consistently communicate with the sales staff for a successful outcome on the floor.
bad,"When it was good, it was good...but don't trust anyone at any Belk. People are out for themselves...at ALL levels of management. Sad. Really sad. You worked really hard and were promised the world but never got it."
bad,"When I worked at Belk , I felt like the other employees tried to injure me,.When we had a 2 man job . One of my co worker started running through the store with rack of clothes and turned a corner and I almost fell down. I really don't want to relive my time at Bells."
bad,I worked here part-time to make extra money for the holidays. Management cared more about customer happiness than they dis employee happiness. The flexibility of my hours were good.
bad,"My role was in a leased department where they cut the lease short a few months and left me with 4 days to find a new job. Had I not been paid more by the other company i would be working for $9 an hour with VERY MINIMAL commission, like most belk employees work for which baffles me.  The management of this company is the WORST and will not do anything to help whether it be on the floor or help with anything else. My manager was never around and when she was she’d constantly excessively force credit cards on our customers causing loss of sales.When speaking with HR, nothing ever seemed to get done about our concerns. I would never recommend this for anyone who wants respect reciprocated in the workplace"
bad,"The company was much better when it was McRaes. Customer service in most areas is basically nonexistent due to lack of staffing. All stores aren't held to the same standard. Regional managers will call a store out for a ""problem"" that needs to be corrected, while the exact same ""problem"" exists in their own store. Overall, not the worst place to work, but if given the opportunity to work elsewhere, take it!"
bad,"If you work at belk the typical day isn't stressful, its more of the staff that is stressful more than what others may stress. Clock in and get to work."
bad,I didn't mind working at this location back when i did but I didn't agree with management. The managers wasn't great at communications and working out their problems.
bad,"Working at belk really isn't for everyone. You have to walk a lot and it gets really hot. The work isn't hard at all, just the atmosphere is really depressing."
bad,Job felt like a great fit at first. Very much a clique/favoritism culture.  Negative competion is set up by management.  You are set up to fail.  I had great sales but I and others were bullied repeatedly by fellow employees. No magement support in disputes.
bad,"workers are nice,  mangers are nasty they have bad jugdement. they hire lazy people and over work the good workers. the pay is not good. they have high turnover rate."
bad,"I worked at Belk for about 6 months. I was a merchandiser but I worked on the dock as well. I liked the actual work itself. It wasn’t hard at all. I also liked the people I worked along side. The hours were pretty good as well. I got pregnant and needed certain days off for doctors appointments. I told the HR manager as well as the store manager. The HR lady said that would be fine and they could work it out with my schedule. The store manager however immediately started to treat me differently and began to pick at everything I was doing. She would give me tasks she knew I couldn’t do because I was pregnant and try to make me do them anyways. I went on intermittent leave because the store manager wouldn’t let me off for my appointments. She mentioned multiple times I should probably just quit. When I wouldn’t quit she then began to change my schedule without me knowing and would then say I just didn’t show up. She would constantly call and harass me at home saying I wasn’t showing up for work or that she didn’t believe I actually was approved for leave even though the store received a copy of all the paper work. I eventually just quit because even after talking to the HR manager about the issues the situation never got better. I wasn’t the only employee to leave because of the store manager. There were some others that she picked at for different things as well. Other than the store manager, the actual store itself wasn’t ran very well. Nobody was on the same page and a lot of people weren’t trained well at all. It was not a professional work environment at all"
bad,"It's all about bringing in customers and opening new accounts.  Yes you have to wear your nametag, however even with the name tag on, management will call you by a different name. The insurance is TOO expensive. You are just a number.  Cutting back employee hours, they tell you it is due to business. In actuality they mark-up their brands, Saddlebred, Kim Rogers, Crown &Ivy etc., and place them on sale but with the base price marked up, the sales are not as good as they used to be."
bad,First thing when you get on the floor you check for things out of place and the dressing rooms.  Customers always leave clothes in the dressing rooms.  That was the worst part of the job.  The best part was seeing someone happy with something they found.
bad,good job if you need money or work but not a place to dedicate your career. Bosses were fine but they force to to try to give out their credit cards and mandatory to reach a quota
bad,I started school while working here they where very supportive in me going until I actually started then after a couple of months into my first semester they decided that they did not need me any more and let me go.
bad,"I was hired as seasonal staff. I had very little contact with anyone in the company up to my first day. I was returning the call of my hiring manager and when I finally got an answer on her extension it was a male voice saying ""How may I help you?"". I said I was calling to schedule an interview. He said okay I said may I speak to *Interview Managers Name* he said I'm *Name* and that was it. He didn't say what he did there or anything. Well, my interview was scheduled. When I came in for my interview I had to find an associate and tell them I was there for an interview. My interview wasn't even with the Hiring Manager, it was with the Store Manager. My interview lasted a whole five (5) minutes and then I had the job. When I arrived for my first day I had a lot of questions as I wasn't given a tour of where to go what to do when I arrived or anything. I had to find an associate again. They understood the pain of starting out they said and helped me along the way. I was thrown onto a register and told the very basics of how to log in. Now here comes the CRAZY part. Let me remind you this is my first day. I had to close two departments by myself, six registers and a lot of ""recovery"". I also had never been shown how to close the registers or what to do. It was rough getting started. If you like somewhere that you aren't consistently watched then it is great because a lot of the managers have friends come in and talk to them for hours! There are is only one manager that I like very well and she wasn't even my boss unless she was over the shift at that moment. Now I was hired on as"
bad,work load not evenly distributed. crowded floor space. holiday hours awful. there were no pros to this job. Management was rude and hateful. Pay checks constantly wrong.
bad,There is a lot of frustration in the employees. There is so much product on the floor insomuch that customers are complaining that they can not move between racks. Racks are crammed which causes merchandise to be on the floor. Work schedule is all over the place. The schedule can change and you not know it till they ask why you were not at work. They want you to go online to request time off but they themselves do not look at it. Pay is very low compared to what they ask and expect of you.
bad,I worked during the holidays as a temporary assistant and cashier. I did not stay there long as I do not enjoy workking in retail. I did however like the discount i received as an employee
bad,"It is a retail establishment, therefore there is no work/ life balance. The focus here was always on the bottom line. Minimal time off during holiday season. A lot of pressure to get credit applications."
bad,"I was an Area Manager and we were referred to as ""the help"" by the store manager.  We complain about this and many other things, but nothing was done."
bad,Retail in general doesn't pay well enough to live on unless you are in upper management. Retail in a specialty store environment in the south like Belk is really bad.
bad,I worked as a sales associate by assisting customers with their purchase of men's clothing. I am also required to return the store to an acceptable and clean place for the customers who return the following day.
bad,"I've worked for Belk for years, while in school. When you are a sales associate, there is high turnover and management knows because you are treated and paid like you can easily be replaced.It is very tough to move up and you have to be willing to work when and where they want you to."
bad,The time that I spent at Belks afforded me the opportunity to learn more people skills.  I was able to serve and help others which was my ultimate goal.
bad,i am not a people person and i did not like it. the customers expect too much. I am in the medical field now and i think it better suits met and makes me happeir than belk.
bad,Lack of consistent communication with management.  Staffing is minimal and therefore customer care lacks many times and store is lacking in cleanliness due to poor housekeeping.
bad,"my hours have decreased when I was told that I would have 25 hours minimum per week,  co-workers always complaining about hours being cut.  Schedule changes and management not informing employees ahead of time."
bad,fun work place and it is competitive you always have a challenge. the goal is to make sure you are making all customers happy and helping them with whatever they need. We are responsible for certain goals such as sales and orders and credit.
bad,"My typical day at work is to help customers with their selections by either finding what they need or suggestive sales."
bad,"Loved working for Clinique! But, not at Belk. No management support. Low Pay. Retail hours are not ideal when the company you work for makes you feel unappreciated."
bad,"training was minimal"
bad,I was a job that got tge bills taking care of got my kids what they needed from time to time... I was just there to work not for friends and that's a big problem there..  Other than that it's a good job
bad,i dont advise anyone to work here you will regret it they pay you close to nothing the hours are bad they never tell when theschedual has changed always being asked to stay passed you time student or not
bad,Belk was a very simple yet complex work environment to be apart of. Honestly was not a hard or difficult job it can just be very tedious or stressful at times since you're constantly dealing with customers and managers.
bad,"The pay was good, however the women I worked with were very selfish and would half way do a job and then expect others to finish it. The mangers were rude and very unhelpful. I did not enjoy the atmosphere of this job"
bad,I really loved working at Belks Warehouse because it was just clean and relaxed atmosphere but the pay was horrible and there was no room for growth with in the company
bad,"To remain  professional, the main store manager does not need to be a manager! Not encouraging,  self conceded as well as contradicting! He  need to show more engagement with the store associates and needs to have more confidence in his sales managers!  He never participated in any type of associate engagements. Glad I left that store! Very hostile working  environment !!!!"
bad,"High sales expectations with little real reward. Didn't keep to their coupon or return policies, always had to override to appease the customer. Managers didn't have your back through customer complaints."
bad,a typical day at would start off slow and end up cleaning up all departments. I learned not everybody will do their part. the managers were nice .the hardest part was cleaning up other departments because no one else did.
bad,"Management was poor, training was vague and almost non existent. I was expected to work in another department and just thrown in there without any training. Clientele was snooty and mostly obnoxious. I was almost always having to stay past my scheduled hours. You were never allowed a 10- 15 min break."
bad,The co-workers are very dedicated hard working people who cared deeply about the work they did. The under-staffing makes is difficult to accomplish many tasks.
bad,The hardest part of working for this department store was working weekends and holidays. We also had to be very competitive because our salary was based off commission. It also usually meant that the lead in whatever area you worked for got first pick and sometimes you did not get commission for the entire day you worked.
bad,Working for belk you work tou butt off day in and day out with no rewards. Plus there is no communication within manages. It's a real stressful place to work.
bad,Management sometimes plays favorites and doesn't always support employees as it should.  It is a fast-paced work culture with slow periods in between.
bad,"if you enjoy sales this place is for you, but if you dont want to stay on your feet more then 8hours then this place is not for you! also late hours during holidays"
bad,I do not have a review to give to anyone who would like to know about belk they should go and experience that for themselves and not go based on what previous employees have to say.
bad,"to much work for the pay, hard department to work for when you are putting back racks of clothes and attend to customers and the same time.  The associates were great to work with, but they need to hire more people"
bad,"The combination of the strenuous and physical work they require you to accomplish in your shift combined with the constant pressure of wanting you to sign up people for credit cards, plus the other pressures makes this a miserable place to work.  They want you be a personal shopper to everyone, plus have a spotless dressing rooms and show floor, plus sign everyone up for a credit card while getting all of their information for their marketing purposes.  This might be something you can accomplish, but they are constantly short staffed.  They then punish you by not giving you raises if you do not accomplish all that they asked regardless of the circumstances.  The Management of the individual stores are wonderful, but their hands are tied, it is the corporate office that demands such unrealistic expectations."
bad,"Fast past working environment. Plus always something to be done or do. Customers are great, and its a good job to have if you need or want something while in school."
bad,"I enjoyed the interaction with customers and co-workers, however there was a very low work ethic among the administrators so things were chaotic in scheduling as well as too few employees assigned per customer ratio."
bad,"Always on your back about credit, item locator, sales, phone numbers, emails... it was always something. You are never doing enough. Not one time do the management stop and say thank you, good job, nothing. It gets old"
bad,"Belk is what you make it. If you are willing to work, even if it is slow and boring, you are guaranteed to stay here. It can be viewed negatively if you wish, but I consider this one of the easiest jobs I have ever had in relation to the pay. I think I am compensated well for the work load that I have. Overtime is very prominent for my position. The major down side is working on holidays like Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, Christmas Eve, etc."
bad,I enjoyed helping customers. You are required to put out merchandise and wait on customers to and clean dressing room depending on the department that you work in.
bad,I can only say that you would have to work there to understand how anything gets done. It never seems like anyone is ever on the same page. There are a few people that do the better part of all the work and are never truly recognized. People that should not be in the positions that they have. It is just baffling to me at times.
bad,"I am always ready and happy to help or assist my customers in cosmetics, perfumes and throughout the store I treat my client as part of the family with care, and respect."
bad,"My experience is this company does not know how to treat their employees, and the management staff does very little to train their associates."
bad,I enjoyed my job.I help Unload truck  that was the hardest My coworkers was very hard working and I enjoy working with them .Management did not know how to treat employees.
bad,"i learned about retail and everything included in it. my coworkers were ok, the hardest part of the job could be the customers, especially when they are unhappy."
bad,"A typical day started with waking up at 4am to make your 5am shift. You would start unloading the truck which would always vary in size. After unloading, you would place clothes/items on racks/shelves, which were often already over packed with items. After you had stuffed as many items as possible the rest would be sent to the back to be left there until a space is open. The rest of the shift would consist of cleaning/vacuuming the store or putting out more clothes that were left in the back from other days. I learned that you have to try hard to balance work and social life which I was able to do. On the topic of management, the manager in charge of my particular department expected, in my opinion, to much of my team and I. We often had people calling out randomly or leaving halfway through the day, leaving us with only 3 or 4 people to carry out the normal day's tasks which usually required 6-8 to accomplish in a timely manner. It was very stressful and very frustrating to work under people who would get upset with you when you're trying your best to make up the slack that others had created. Management would also often change your work schedule frequently. I would be scheduled to work Monday-Wednesday and Friday with my Thursday off, but my manager would call me Tuesday night telling me I'm off Wednesday but I have to come in on Thursday, forcing me to cancel any plans I had Thursday but leaving it to late to do anything Wednesday. My co-workers were mostly people around my age, 20-24, and were alright to work with. Some were lazy, i.e. the ones who left early/called in sick"
bad,"The work is enjoyable and not hard labor. The best part of the job is the people you work with. For a part time person, the schedule if very flexible is available on nights and weekends. Management is okay, but the company cares little for its associates. The hardest part of the job is the cut in hours and schedule changes that occur at the last minutes."
bad,"Belk, under the leadership of the Belk brothers, has changed its corporate philosophy. Many, if not most, retailers have adopted the same practices: firing employees for not meeting sales and/or credit card enrollment goals, reducing the number of sales associates working the sales floor, and using a computer program for employee scheduling. Belk now uses a workforce management program called Reflexis for all employee scheduling: regular hourly scheduling, vacation, days off, and time off. The goal, as stated by management, is to remove ""the human element"" from the scheduling process. There is no part of this new scheduling process that protects the interests of Belk employees. In general, Belk is converting its workforce to predominantly part-timers and seems to be unconcerned with the prospect of high employee turnover rates. Each employee is now a smaller cog in what the company hopes will be a much bigger wheel. Good luck to all retail employees!"
bad,It was okay. i unloaded trucks and prepared clothes for sale every morning.
bad,"Very Busy"
bad,It's always a lovely day at belk. Nothing is too hard. Not many customers but it makes the day go by much smoother
bad,"they lack energy and good management. the benefits are okay ,but management cares nothing about families and you personally to them you are just a number that can be replaced."
bad,Belk is a fun place to work during the busy hours/season. Other than that it is very boring and slow during the nonpeak season.
bad,Worked for Belk for almost 9 years. Advanced to STM however no life in management! Little pay for a lot of time and work!!
bad,"I worked at Belk for 6 years. This past year we got a new store manager and it was all downhill from there. Their policies create friction among employees and at the end of the day, no matter how hard you work, if your sales are down you will be penalized. As with most companies, who you work for really sets the tone for your job, I had an AWFULL manager!!"
bad,"The job was not bad, but the atmosphere at the Gautier store was not conducive to personal and professional growth as they provided little or no training that was hands on."
bad,"Job was stressful and had to many people telling you what to do, Corporate would tell you one thing the Manager would tell you to do something different. It was a constant struggle to do your job. Enjoyed my coworkers but the Management was terrible."
bad,ive worked various positions from sales floor associate to housekeeping to working on the dock loading and unloading new merchandise. I currently qork on the dock or sometimes on the loor before hours of operation to set sales switch signs or lay out new merchandise.
bad,"belk is an ok place to start and is fun for the first few months. they push credit too much and expect you to get several in one day even if there’s close to no one in the store. everything is a number to them and that’s all they’re concerned about. most of the managers are easy to work with which helps tremendously. but overall the job is very stressful regardless of the department you work in. they constantly cut hours which pushes full timers back to 30 hours some weeks, and it’s like pulling teeth trying to get more hours. i’m also not crazy about the fact that the managers override discounts just so customers will stop complaining and hopefully come back and repeat the process, they let the customers make the rules and then blame the associates for not maximizing their sales."
bad,"Great Pay, but very competitive and stressful in the creative fields."
bad,"It started out good but after, to ""stressful."" Never enough time to get your work done and it didn't seem to bother anyone. Fast Pace and the store is always messy."
bad,"I’ve been there over 2 years and have had 7 STM’s.  Constant hiring and turnover.  Scheduling is a nightmare.  Not getting the amount of hours that an employee wants.  Have to constantly ask for additional hours. Any STM or key holder, or store manager should have to work a minimum of 6 months on the sales floor to know what all the employees have to do."
bad,"I'd prefer not to work in retail ever again. It takes away so much of your personal time, but if you have a spouse or someone helping you, you can make it"
bad,"My job starting there was picking and processing orders for fulfillment.  The system linked to the website had some issues (UPC numbers not matching, showing items in stock that weren't or vice versa). Often times, merchandise would already be on inventory while still in transit.  The metrics we had also conflicted (not finding an item resulted in a cancel, but spending too much time on an item worth only $5 on sale would ruin the ship rate). We were given increasingly higher and higher numbers to fulfill as well as in store pickup orders which were at opposite ends of the store. The two tasks would inevitably take up each others time and resources. The system wouldn't show the in store pickup orders until sometimes an hour after the order was made, an hour that we were supposed to spend looking for it. We had to constantly come back to the computers to check for orders decreasing our time spent looking for current orders.  Corporate would add new tasks without fixing the current bugs or allocating resources, which was incredibly frustrating. We would explain over and over why we had hiccups, slow downs, and high cancel rates. Our store was actually one of the more consistently reaching our goals even though we had to source people from other departments to get the job done. We just tried our best.  The store changed hands on the corporate level and one of the regional guys actually asked if we could send something that was not what the customer ordered! After a while quality control went out the window in favor of quantity."
bad,"The coworkers were the only reason I could come to work and put on a smile. Management was decent, and everyone was nice, but it’s a really slow paced business, and just wasn’t the right environment for me."
bad,You never really got the days you requested off off because you can't request off during sale weekends...but every weekend was a sale weekend.........
bad,I would not recommend working at the Belk in Greensboro. The pay is not adequate for the amount of work done. You also do not get to enjoy holidays with family because Belk recently decided to remain open for holidays. Management is poorly run and they have no regard for their employees either.
bad,"They were very quick to hire and offered a decent pay rate so i accepted a job in Merchandise Recovery. We were told in orientation that the first 2 weeks we would have a ""work buddy"" to show us around and how to do our job. This never happened and when i asked my manager she clocked out and said i dont know. So i never really had a set task or rules to work with, which was more of a pain than a good thing. Nobody knew i existed at that job and everyone would always reintroduce themselves to me, including upper level management and HR."
bad,"This would be a great job for college kids, or just some extra money during the holiday. However, this is not a good forever job. For starters, this is a very hostile work environment. Belk pushes their employees to make sales goals, and push credit cards on to every customer. If you don't make sales goals or credit card goals, you are constantly reprimanded, and may have your salary cut. This makes coworkers go against each other to try to steal each other's customers and credit card sign ups. The departments are very gossipy and hateful towards one another; even if you don't want to be in the crossfire, you are. The managers know about the drama, but very little is done. Working at Belk also requires you to have to run around all day and balance everything: you have to deal with cleaning the dressing rooms, managing the phone, managing the register, cleaning (vacuuming, sweeping, dusting, etc.), putting back inventory. Oftentimes, this goes hand in hand with coworkers not helping each other maintain the store, because no one wants to leave the register (or they will have less sales for the day)."
bad,The company is undergoing several changes. They have not meet their performance goals or paid out bonuses for several quarters. Leadership is consistently changing which is deeply impacting the hiring and lay offs. It's not the family company it once was.
bad,Not very flexible with work hours. Management not very responsive. Very fast paced and understaffed at times. was able to meet sales goals. Not very organinised .
bad,"Seems the overall company does their employees the same. No hours, low pay, expects you to do the job of 5 people and not schedule you enough hours to do it in. The employees at this store are so lazy. No team work . They hide from what customers they do have. Management treats you like you are so beneath them. No communication. No one gives a darn in this place from the top down. Customers are constantly complaining no one is on the floor to help them and their having to walk around the entire store to find someone only to NOT. Feel sorry for the Senior Citizens who have to suffer for this companies b.s. only because management will not schedule anyone.  Wonder why their losing sales??"
bad,"Hard to make production at the fulfillment center when you're tripping all over other associates, narrow aisles hard to move thru. The put away job is easy if you have the floor to yourself but that doesn't happen very often."
bad,Belk wasn't a bad place to work but they often didn't care about our personal issues if they caused us to have to take off work. You didn't get any benefits unless you worked there for a certain amount of time. I did love that they gave me a lot of hours. I enjoyed the money.
bad,"Belk was sold out of the Belk Family several years ago and has since undergone a lot of changes in terms of the vision for the future and the management style. Many perks were taken away and replaced with a nice open atrium with a Starbucks, and a Gym that's complete with showers. Nice as those things are, people would rather receive a higher annual raise or annual bonuses. I don't think that Belk is making smart decisions in terms of keeping an eye on morale and making sure that only quality candidates move up."
bad,The majority of employees are great but management is not loyal to employees.  Small store with some great ideas but did not execute the great ideas in a timely manner if at all.
bad,"If you have good manager working there isn't too bad, but as anywhere a bad manager ruins everything. Not only that but a lot of policies have changed since the Belk brothers sold the company, it feels like corporate doesn't care about their associates anymore. There is also a lot of focus on credit applications and meeting sales goals. If you do not meet your sales goals for the year they will cut your pay."
bad,"Miscommunication. Lack of work hours.  Poor pay. I work in merchandising. It's a fast-paced job that requires lots of organizational skills.  I love interacting with the customer, assisting them with finding items and giving suggestions.  I am grateful for the employee discount on items."
bad,"The focus is on younger people who are less expensive while the more experience people get overlooked. The company is not focused on work life balance.  Almost everyone I know who currently works there is unhappy, stressed, and un-fulfilled. This maybe a great place to start your career but I would not recommend for long term."
bad,Change everyday can't have a family there. We go in every night and there's a new change and you get one day noticed there mot. Your not allowed too use your PTO time on those MOT days.
bad,I was a ROCC associate for Belk for two years. In theory it should have been a simple straightforward job. But the management team went out of the way to make things far more complicated than they should be. Every day there was a different set of rules as to how things should be done. No one ever knew how to do anything there.
bad,"The Belk experience left me with mixed emotions."
bad,Management always had us doing the same thing over and over again due to them not agreeing on the same thing. By the time we finished the project it was time to go and then they wanted us to stay longer to finish what was left.
bad,I was hired for seasonal work. I understood this at the beginning. The other associates were horrible. Left messes for me to clean up. Spoke in unprofessional ways in front of customers. Total lack of respect for me and customers. The cash register scanners didn't work half the time.the store was  not clean and simply put...chaos.the only thing that kept me there was my immediate supervisor...she cared but so much was out of her control.
bad,Belk is not a career job where you can make enough money or have enough time to raise a family
bad,"A typical day at work is the same as my review for Estee Lauder. I am employed for both."
bad,"Belk has changed a lot of the ways they currently operate. They have spent millions of dollars on programs that do not function properly and increase productivity. They expect minimal staff on the sales floor to help multiple customers at the same time, and pay very little. Upper management is inconsistent with their decisions, it is more of a ""he-said-she-said"" type of management. They do not help you balance work and personal life with too many rules and restrictions on when and how you can request time off. Overall it is not a family friendly place to work."
bad,I stopped working here and went to work for Nordstroms doing the same job and nearly tripled my earnings. I did not have great esperiences with management here.
bad,"This is your typical retail position. Long hours (especially on holidays) and a lot of standing on your feet ( comfortable shoes are a must! ). After the holidays, sales were down so commission was non-existent. There were a lot of hostile employees."
bad,"It seems like a fun and nice company to work for at first, but once you’re comfortable you quickly realize they don’t care much about the employees. The discount is nice, but that’s about it! Upper management only cares about the customers and will belittle you and call you out in morning meetings for not reaching quotas, and even openly threaten your job. It’s very demeaning and embarrassing. All management seems to care about is drilling everyone about getting credit and email! I loved my job for the first few months but it got old super quick. I wouldn’t recommend Belk to anyone, especially if you’re looking of a first time job"
bad,"With a decline in B&M Retail in the past few years, Belk is one of the few Department Stores that appears ""safe"" for the time being. They are adapting with the times--re-branding to follow more of a ""Target"" Marketing campaign, and they are offering Buy Online Pickup in Stores options, as well as an updated/more user friendly website. "
bad,"First time I've ever worked for Belk. All and all I think the Company in and of itself is Good. They've been around for Decades, so some part of the organization. Has it's head out of the sand! I will tell you this: your Title may be Sales Associate but you're doing everything But Sales.The Job Consists of Cashiering and putting merchandise away. That's it! All day long."
bad,"Belk is a fast paced, demanding retail store.  It can be enjoyable with events, good people and fashion as well as extremely demanding by both customers and corporate. Unfortunately like a lot of retailers there just aren't enough payroll hours given to accomplish all that's needed to be done."
bad,"Belk has very limited benefits for it's employees. The work slows down to a crawl. The moral is extremely low. To many chiefs not enough Indians. Too many clicks, and if your not among it you will not be promoted or rewarded."
bad,Although Belk wasn't the best place on Earth. I stayed for so long because they were very accommodating with my hours. I was able to be a full time student and work at the same time due to their flexible hours.
bad,Morning meeting and them sell sell sell. Push credit apps and assist clients with makeup application and choosing their products.  Management was not always available but you were not empowered to take care of the customer.  Systems are outdated
bad,"The environment was easy going, but could turn on a dime. The work is largely metrics based (store credit card apps, sales, online orders) so expect to hear a lot about those. I learned how to handle some very difficult, and sometimes gross, situations while here. After working here, it's pretty hard to shake me up. The work is usually pretty standard and easy, but expect to do quite a bit out of your area (e.g. working an afternoon in Home Department when you were hired in Ladies or Shoe Department). It is also fairly common to get scheduled to work on the processing team (Unloading merchandise from the truck, putting out new merchandise onto the sales floor) which usually work overnight shifts, even if you were hired as a sales floor associate. Sometimes this wasn't a big deal, sometimes it leads to high stress situations since they don't cross-train you for other areas. However, most of the associates are really nice and always willing to help out whether you are a new hire or have been there for years."
bad,"If i could give management ZERO stars i would. Was lied to about many things when hired, compensation is not very good. Management is rude, hostile, and plays favorites."
bad,They never made me feel welcome and allowed another beauty advisor to conduct my sales as if she were my boss. I felt as if I was only being allowed to work in a way to make her sales better rather than mine.
bad,"Since the company buy-out new management teams have been replaced, this organization has sadly lost its vision and direction. It has taken on a quantity over quality approach and focuses more on growth of dollars than the quality of work and growth of the employees."
bad,"Belk can be a fun place to work if management didn't always schedule so lightly. Many times I find that I am required to work in other areas besides fine jewelry, which is what I was specifically hired for."
bad,needs vacation days. be more caring about workers and different things that may go on line life. they have no excused absents. to confusing and change last mintue hours. they tell you the day before.
bad,"Great place to learn about southern fashion.  Belk is southern in all aspects from pay and charm to work ethics.. I learned that Belk applauds their employees with verbal affirmation when sales goals are met like mine over 98% but they fail to compensate or reward according to the sales acquired as promised in their contract. No stability Belk is an At Will Employment for any reason they release employees. They spend millions remodeling & modifying the store, even new bags..yet employee compensation was a fail."
bad,Good place to obtain entry level sales experience.  Some ability to advance to management training. Shift work creates poor work life balance.  Compensation not in line with other industries.
bad,"Associates are not appreciated "
bad,"The people at this store will not talk to you. I can go all day and no one speaks to me. I try to have conversations with various people but have not had any luck. Hours are great and I love merchandising but not much fun if no one is very friendly. It must be the area. Charlotte or Pineville is more diverse, might have to try them next time. I just moved to Rock Hill and most people here are very nice. Must just be this store."
bad,It was fun at first working with my coworkers and loyal customers here at Belk but the management staff is very inconsiderate and Unconsiderate to sale associate. Some of the manger play favoritism to some co-worker. They talk to you any kind of way just because they're mangers and also to the customers as well. No room to grow with the company. This company is full of s**t when it comes to it's mangement team.
bad,"I work in the shoe department.  Shoe's is the stores core and we work the hardest.  Salary is base pay, which is horrible, and a very low commission. Everyone thinks employees in shoes makes so much money but it is not true. You only make your commission after you reach your sales for the day.  Management is TERRIBLE!!  They claim to be a family orientated store but do not support their employees and often do not hire within. I'm a single parent, the only single parent in the department, and they've often had me close 3 nights in the week when 2 are ""supposed"" to be the max. Mngt. is more concerned with the fact that it is a commission job than team work. Although this is not a requirement, I pick up shoe boxes belonging to others when I see the need and think we all should help to keep the area presentable, but have been reprimanded, in stead of praised for assisting my fellow employees. Credit is the most important thing to Belk's!  They don't care about how much you get but the question is..can you get more! Customer service is what they talk about but they rarely acknowledge the service you give or the compliments received to management from customers, but are quick to jump on you when 1 customer complains and ignore the 10 that praised you. You can't please everyone regardless of how hard you may try. But as I said earlier...Belk's does not stand behind their employees."
bad,This was on the worse places that i have ever worked. I was so glad when i found another job. Fast food is just not for everyone.
bad,we had great customer but a lack of management. we couldn't keep a store manager very long.
bad,It can be a nice place to work if sales associate is your thing. It was not mines because I don't really see retirement in a job like this..
bad,"At my particular cosmetic counter there was very little training having to do with .selling and product knowledge. Belk does have a sufficient training program for register use and company policies and procedures. They have recently implemented a new customer service program to insure excellent customer service from their employees, which has been quite sucessful."
bad,"This job is okay for part-time work. If you already have a full-time job and are looking to supplement your income, it may be okay. This may be perfect for full-time college students looking for part-time work. I do not reccomend this as a full-time job.Pay has decreased, so you won't make much. There are a select few who do okay. Be prepared to work any hours of the week. You will not have a life. Part-time workers generally get the best hours. They get to choose unlike full-time associates. Apply at your own risk. I understand if you are desperate. Full-time associates generally work between 30 to 38 hours a week. It depends on the time of year. Working 30 hours a week feels like 40 and working 38 hours a week feels like 50. That is why 30 hours a week is considered full-time."
bad,"Coming on as Cosmetic Concierge was a dream come true to me, the position was new and I was ready to make it my own. Unfortunatly, the manager who hired me left a week after I was brought on. The replacement treated my job as a floater, I was asked to mop, clean bathrooms, help with stock, cover areas of the store that were short-staffed, basically anything but help direct clients in cosmetics. I went to lots of training for cosmetics, which I loved, but I was never able to use that knowledge. I had 5 different direct managers in the short time I was there, and only one understood what I was supposed to be doing. The store managers weren't much better, and no one was around when you needed them to be."
bad,In my experience working at belk I have been thrown out on the sales floor without training nearly every day. I am never put with anyone else which makes learning extremely difficult (this is my first job so I have no prior experience). When I asked the manager for help with learning something I was blown off and told that she would have someone do the task in the morning. Pay is good but management has been a deal breaker.
bad,Lack of formal training for management is detrimental to future leaders moving up with company.  Way to much insecurities with upper management.  This is reason for lack of training.  Belk as a whole might not be this way but it is certainly the case in the South Georgia area.
bad,I’ve worked at Belk since high school. At first the job was fulfilling because I just did what I was told and went home. Then the supervisor of my department quit and was replaced by someone who had no idea what to do so I had to pick up responsibility for them. At the time we were on commission and I was doing operational duties such as merchandising and planning and setting floor layouts and tracking department sales (doing managers type responsibilities) getting paid the starting salary plus commission which I was not making because I could not focus on selling. Finally I had to convince them to move me to a position where I was not penalized for not selling and to give me a decent raise for what I was doing because it was way more than I should personally have to. After I moved to the new position my workload only increased because now I could tackle all the operational responsibilities head on. After that the company came out with buy online pick up in store which they made me and my coworker responsible for and supplies was moved to my stockroom to maintain in addition to my department responsibilities. Now I’ve just kind of given up on Belk. I still go in and do my job but I do not stress or overwork myself anymore. Being in college and working at my store is such a great experience. My store personally is one of the best in my opinion. Managers are so friendly and sweet. They’re like my own family which is the way Belk culture should be if it’s not at your store. But the company at higher levels expects so much from people that they pay so little to. In my opinion all
bad,"There are no benefits despite the promise of a bonus. Should not promise what they cannot deliver Seem to just miss bonus each quarter. No stock options, no other benefits."
bad,"not flexible with personal life. calling in 3 times will get you fired even if you come in on a your off day to make it up. Great staff. Great pay, poor managers and leaders"
bad,"Upon my experience working at Belk, there have been times when they did not approve of my availability, after it was previously approved. "
bad,"No comment. I do not wish to comment I do not believe that forcing a comment is the correct behavior. Obviously, I do not have the time or want needed to provide a satisfactory answer."
bad,"Before Belk department store teamed up with the Investment group it was a family oriented happy place to work . After that it was just that a job . I wish they had never changed. They lost employees that had 10 and more years , they lost customers that had been customers for years . The focusing on money cost much more than profit"
bad,Lot of turnover and questionable executive direction. IT teams do not work well together which causes issues during implementations.  Nobody takes responsibility and blames any other team except their own.
bad,"If you work in management here, you can forget about a home life. The store always takes priority and work times can vary drastically. The benefits are sub par and the time available for family is nonexistent."
bad,The Belk that I worked at had horrible managers and the company in general did not have very good policies. The schedules were all over the place and often were not posted until the beginning of the work week so you had no idea if or when you were working that week until the day of.
bad,"Working at this location is a handful. They definitely need to hire more people because it is way too much work for the amount of employees that they have. Management is the main issue here. Seems as though they are more focused on micromanaging and treating employees like they don't matter. Managers tend to make cliques with long time employees, and are mean to newer employees. Also you have to request taking 15 minute breaks even though you have worked the ample amount of time to receive one."
bad,The work environment was very stressful.  Information Technology area was very poorly managed.  This area had a high rate of turnover.  I would not recommend this company.
bad,The job at hand was a physical job which was the work I was looking for. There was times that materials needed was not available. More time to do detailed cleaning was needed.
bad,Poor job in hiring store loss prevention and very bad job in hiring upper loss prevention Management. Loss Prevention Managers come and go as they want as well as upper Management. Lack of concern for issues in the store.
bad,"Get ready for a ride on the crazy train! This particular Belk store has an awesome store manager but most department managers are awful. In cosmetics the manager runs the department through threats and intimidation. He's never on the sales floor and business or counter manager are talked to worse than a dog. Yelling, beating you down, no recognition of successes just ""coaching"" on opportunities. It's a very negative atmosphere. Then he wonders why no one asks for help and there's poor communication. Then there's the whole credit thing. That's really what Belk cares about, opening new accounts. In cosmetics you'll also have a vendor coordinator and executive. Most of them are pretty good but they'll manage based on the vendor standards and Belk manages on its own standards and it's a tug of war for your loyalty sometimes. They don't always communicate well. The best part about this job is the experience you'll get, your co workers and you clients. You'll meet lots of new people. And you'll get vendor gratis. Overall I wouldn't stay there too long. Get your experience, network and move on to something better. Brick and mortar stores, especially in big malls are becoming obsolete. People like to shop online now."
bad,"Belk's Inc has a been around for quite sometime; rich in history."
bad,If waking up early is not your forte then it can be tough but you have your whole day and night pretty much. Communication between employees and management needs improvement.
bad,Over worked.  Is the best way to describe any store leave position with this company.  Corporate levels are saturated with managers of different positions and they spend their time telling store level how to do their jobs quicker with less people. You’ll never do the same job the same way
bad,We are treated like slaves. We rarely get more than 5 to 10 hours a week. Also they expect us to unload 1900 piece trucks in one night. They also give us no space to work or move around.
bad,Hours are wildly inconsistent. You could work 25 hours as part time help one week and not even be on the schedule the next. No opportunities to become full time either and full time hours are often 32 hours a week or less. The pay is pretty decent for retail. I really love the manager I work under which makes staying worth it. I would not recommend unless you want like one 6 hour shift a week and already have a full time job.
bad,"Work environment was very slow paced and dull. There is little to no room to move up and grow with this company, The points system for employees is rigid and unrealistic."
bad,"Associates get by without a huge work load customer service is a first, however, difficult to maintain with skeleton crews most of the time. Friday and Saturdays their are to many associates. Management has to do most of the workload while maintaining customer service, shop-able areas, sales floor, receiving."
bad,I worked in the accessory department. It was tedious and boring. All I did was organized jewelry and handbags. My boss was really awesome. I actually followed her from the job before.
bad,"At the location in Conyers, Ga. could be a great place to work with the right structure and team. Also, with the demographics the appeal options for men, women, and youth could be better."
bad,"Jobs not really to hard, its just the pay is very little so you wont have much to work with when you have an off day. plenty of nice people but management is very picky about small things."
bad,"Its a nice retail store to work and my co-workers are nice people to work with. Going to work each day has its challenges, but when the days end, accomplishing a days' work and taking care of the customers are the things that make the day fulfilling."
bad,"Low pay, no benefits, good employee discount, no health benefits, great products, great sales, mangers were nice and laid back, fun place to work, not enough hours, make overtime"
bad,"I left belk for a reason, the job was toxic and so was management. Lots of fellow employees were not friendly to work with and they messed with hours and pay"
bad,When the company was Hudson Belk it was truly a wonderful place to work for you felt loved and respected by all management on all levels now with this new company it's not the same it is so not the same and it's so sad
bad,It was the worst job I've ever had. They tried to make me come home every weekend from college after offering to work around the schedule I needed knowing that I went to school two hours away!
bad,"Once again all retail stores either succeed or fail because of your management team. Unfortunately the Belk I worked at did not have a great management team at the time. Not to mention the District Manager was located at that particular location therefore, I believe that contributed to the micro managing culture they had adapted. They did not treat their customers as importantly as they should have. Hiding coupons and not one area of the store excluding the fine jewelry dept kept client books. They cared more about the immediate numbers than the customer service that was needed to keep your credit card customer coming back and suggesting to their friends and family to also shop at your store. Therefore, you would have greater profit and numbers by playing the long game. However they do not posses the wisdom or confidence to implement such a plan. Ever since they sold the company the culture of belk in general has plummeted greatly."
bad,Management out do each other never enough coverage so you have to work horrible pay sucks no real raises around .20 hours are inconsistent rarely get a weekend off
bad,"Write ups come if you do not open credit cards, get customers email addresses or order enough online for a customer. Hours cut and hardly any registers opened."
bad,"I really enjoyed my department managers, and my fellow staff members, but upper management was awful.  I know that this is relative from store to store, but at the location I was at, the store manager at the time played favorites and encouraged gossip.  The department I was in was always poorly staffed, and the staff that got the most credit applications were always allowed more leeway when it came to scheduling and tasks."
bad,"Very slow-paced environment, somewhat stressful and very disorganized most days. Can be very unrewarding to work there and does not pay enough or give hardly any hours."
bad,"There were only four other associates that were team players. Others were only worried about themselves, do the bare minimum and quick to take your place. I worked in fragrance and cosmetics and when I would go to the restroom, someone from shoes would run to try to take sales to get commission. One time I came out while she was conversing with a customer and I politely thanked her for watching my station and that I could handle it from here and she was arguing saying it was her sale so she should get the commission or she would constantly ""accidentally"" put commission sales under her number."
bad,"It was not bad, I had the chance to meet nice people and very peasant to work with. Management wise, as a business student while working there, I think they can do better."
bad,"Training was in-depth, but did not prepare for the hands on nature of the job. Unclear with benefits and commission, with very long shifts with short breaks."
bad,"A day consists of being expected to balance tasks with helping customers, a lot of the time with little to no help in each department. The management is absolutely dreadful. They are mostly hypocritical and very unprofessional, and make promises they can not keep. Not all of the managers are like this but most are."
bad,"A typical workday begins at 9 a.m. and it entails the opening of cash registers, making sure assigned departments are ready for business operations, and perform daily duties.  I have learned many things pertaining to management as well as human resources. Management at Belk Inc. is very relaxed and could benefit from new personal."
bad,"Management is inflexible with hours needed for personal reasons, including even being sick. Very hard to work with and expect more than we were trained for or capable of doing with the availability of staff."
bad,"Held various jobs through the years and have quite enjoyed some of it, not so much in recent years. Have found my job to be tedious, unrewarding and boring. Not stimulating enough for a creative individual, too many restraints and corporate hoops to jump through for my tastes."
bad,"Typical day is folding, hanging, and cleaning up after customers all day. You WILL refold the same shirt at least 5 times during your shift. Management will take advantage of you if you actually care about your job. Most people there don't care about being there and so everything gets lumped on the one person that actually cares about doing a good job. Pay is terrible. Good luck getting more than minimum wage. Unless you are older and have no aspirations to do anything else in life than customer service they MAY give you a raise just cause they know you wont move on to something/somewhere else. I would not suggest working here. Co-workers some are nice but most of them don't care and will throw you under the bus in a second. Hardest part is getting cussed out daily by upset customers over coupons. Maybe a different Belk will treat you better, but this one I wouldn't even bother."
bad,Retail was not really my thing. Too many politics in the workplace.
bad,This Company has not been an enjoyable place to work because of the environment. The company has now changed managers twice in the year that I have been there. I have however very much enjoyed my fellow coworkers and have learned many valuable skills.
bad,The employees in this workplace tend to bicker and not get along. There are unreal expectations put on employees in the interest of making 1 or 2 other employees happy.
bad,"Go in, help customers, listen to them complain about prices and coupons, keep the store clean and ready for the next day."
bad,"At this job a typical day included sales to customers and cleaning up after your shift. I learned how to be a better sales associate. The management at Belk, Inc. was okay. I was told that I would be put into a better position and never moved up. The co-workers were not productive in most shifts."
bad,"This place has my heart in mixed areas. As an SA, I've found that I enjoy the people I work with, but I am unsatisfied with the way this place is managed. It seems like upper management doesn't know how to handle their own budget or distribute hours evenly between their employees, because myself and a few others on my team are constantly having trouble maintaining sustainable hours within a week. I average 10 hours in a week, which is barely worth the time I spend there. I originally joined this company looking for a full-time position, which I was told I would recieve after I'd been there for an allotted period, but I'm still barely managing to upkeep my way of living with this job. I've recently had to resort to getting a second job due to the minuscule amount of hours I recieve. I'd say this place is only a great option fkr those who are searching for a side job, until management can straighten out their situation with how they distribute their workload amongst their employees."
bad,The workers policy is NOT MADE FOR ASSOCIATES its to cover the company’s behinds The goals that some managers try to push are impossible to touch and they write you up for the smallest occurrence but let MANAGERS BE SLACKING OFF the company only cares for the the sack of their “numbers” and not for the sake of the people who sell their products and OUR CLIENTS NOTICE ! it’s a shame to go to other sister stores and to be referred to as different names it’s embarrassing Belk FIX IT
bad,I did not enjoy working here. We went through 4 different store managers during the 4 years that I worked at Belk. The only good thing about working was the discount.
bad,"Belk is a retailer along the lines of Khols or Penny's. Clients are often lower to middle class people looking for a sale. All that's really important is opening Belk credit cards. Sales associates are pressured to get clients to apply for a card and often the stores resort to unethical tactics to get the applications in. I wouldn't advise anyone to choose Belk or retail as a career.,"
bad,Not organized . Not enough employers . Not that many hours to give . Not friendly  this store is a mess and needs way more help than they have in the store.
bad,Coaching from managers after having a rude customer is aggravating. They should spend some more time defending their loyal and hard working employees. Work life balance is not bad once you ask for the time and it’s approved. New store manager appears a little arrogant for someone who’s never been a store manager.
good,This company rewards employees who do absolutely nothing and employees that work hard daily get nothing. If management decides they don't like you they will do everything imaginable to get you to leave or cook up instance to get you fired.
good,Management didn't listen to us when we had a problem and didn't provide us any tools to succeed (i.e. stock on certain items that many customers wanted).
good,If you need a second job I would recommend this although the company is not the best the hours are not horrible. However if your looking for a second income I would recommend doing anything that pays more then $10/hr.
good,hard to get time off and not work every weekend. the other employess were the best part of the time.
good,I didnt like how they brought us on then did lay offs after two weeks
good,Unrealistic goals set to accomplish in a 50 hour work week. Not enough staff on the floor to complete tasks or assist customers. Excellent working relation ship with in the store between managers and associates
good,"Part-Time position."
good,Belk is a great started job. Get retail and customer service experience and move on. Low hours. Low pay. Terrible management.  Belk is a retail store.
good,The management was a joke. Not very helpful when asking questions. They only would work with people that went to school and had a class they had to go to. If you took one class and it was only online they would not help you out at all. The store manager preached about god all the time(unprofessional). I had a manger tell me that I shouldn't worry about my grandma who was having her 2nd open heart surgery. Very unprofessional. Loved the people I worked it.
good,"Management sucked! They did not have a solid foundation. Constant turnover due to unreachable goals. Great discount, but that is the only plus. Have to work on THANKSGIVING!"
good,"This job is a pretty ordinary and quiet job, but the management and higher ups choose to spend more of they're time gossiping with one another than to help the employees they recklessly hire. While working there, one of the (now fired) managers sexually harassed a friend of mine."
good,"In the area Belk is one of the better retail jobs but you cannot rely on a steady income nor the management. If management likes you you will get hours if they don't people try to push you out the door. Store manager it's fairly new and looks to make brownie points with corporate. Most employees know this about him and just tolerate it for their job. He criticizes, puts people down that he doesn't like"
good,I work in the receiving end of the store which means me and 4 other people unload the trucks hang all the clothes tag everything and sort it all. We work for about 4-6 hours then have to come in at like 6am to put it to the sales floor. They don’t even let us take a break. They schedule us less hours so leagally they don’t have to give us one even though we end up having to work longer then our scheduleD time anyway. What I don’t like about my store at least is my group is the hardest working people we work is the heat doing the most work but we aren’t allowed to be full time meaning we aren’t allowed any benefits the only people who are part time are sales associate they get health care 401k the works plus a $200 per person benefit for who they get to have sign up for a credit card. We don’t get anything. There aren’t even fans in the back room to help with air flow. It’s also a very petty place. If you call in one time management will cut your hours the next week to almost nothing as punishment. If management doesn’t like you they make sure you know it. I don’t know what it’s like at other stores but the store I’m at is terrible. The pay her hour would be good if I could get more then 13 hours a week.
good,management doesn't always handle situations in a professional manner but as people the staff was all very nice! I would recommend if you're looking for a part time job or a temporary position
good,"i dont have much to say it is a department store they work you with very little pay but the people are very nice."
good,Managers not very considerate of employees unless they or of some type of relation. Overall clean work environment. Runs out of work and you are required to walk around and look like you are working or you will be terminated.
good,"the best thing about my job on a daily basis, was working with my customers on a daily basis. the associates I worked with awesome also, there was manyperks..like the associate discounts, and there clothing product was awesome..."
good,It would be great if there was better management.  made some good friends while working here; both  employees and customers.  hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers.
good,"For retail, Belk is a great place to work.  Benefits are much better than most businesses these days. Pay not too bad, except wages go up and down according to the economy/sales.  Not paid on commission, but wages ARE determined by the amount sold and not by how much work is performed or quality of work.  "
good,Enjoyed working in Ladies Wear and Lingerie. The customers were great to work with. Company did not have a very good supervisors that would help their employees with training or problem solving
good,Its an ok place to work at times. Being a partime worker you only work at night & all weekends. Some partimers don't though just certain ones. Usually a typical day at work isn't too busy. I learned to cater to every customers need rather they had an attitude or not. The hardest part of my job is not being able to enjoy time with my family on weekends or at night because im always at work. I enjoy some of my co workers they help me get through the days when its rough.
good,Rewarding enough to be able to service clients to meet their shopping needs; I wish the companys HR Department had more compassion and awareness of their employees. There is no work/Life balance. Only Working.
good,"When I was hired I was told I would work one weekend shift every other weekend. And then about a month in my manager was wanting me to work every shift every weekend!!!! I had just found out I was pregnant and I was about to get married, I couldn't work every single weekend the major stuff going on in my life was more important. So long story short they lie to you about how much you'll be working. The overall job as a fulfillment associate was fun and enjoyable though. Didn't have to fool with customers very often you just mind your business and get your work done. If they had better Management I could've worked here for a long time."
good,"Working for Belk exposed me to an adventurous experience. "
good,"Store appearance was great.  Management was very unorganized and there was no room for job advancement.  Pay was low.  I really liked the ""work"" and would have loved to advance if given the opportunity."
good,I do not wish to participate in the review process of Belk. I feel that I am being forced to answer questions that I do not want to answer. This section should be an option for those who wish to participate.
good,Great starting place if you are starting out in retail and want to learn the business. Benefits arent great but the pay is comparable to other retail stores.
good,"There is a lot wrong with the day to day feel in this store.  Most of mgt is way below what most would consider tolerable and the push for credit/item locator/and more is ridiculous.  Raises are often denied based on the most ridiculous of matrixes-email cappture, credit apps, more..."
good,"Working at Belk was something I decided to do on a part-time basis to supplement my income. It was very stressful, and management only cared about getting credit applications done and not very much about the staff and the customers."
good,If you want to deal with people who aren't very friendly and expect you to be at their hand and foot the entire time then this is the place for you. It has its downs just like any other retail position.
good,"Absolutely NO training before they put you out on the sales floor. You must learn as you go, from working with other sales people, which is stressful. Mgmt is quiet and reserved and they dont breathe down your back. Store is messy and there is never enough time to fix it. Customers can be difficult because of the use of non-working coupons."
good,No comment. I loved working with the associates but not the manager. He hd his picks and the hours were not the ones that were discussed but I did them anyway.
good,Schedule always change. Part-time never got good hours. Pressure for store credit. Managers talk about the employee. Loss prevention watch employee more then costomers
good,"I wouldn't suggest this job for students who are involved in other activities. Disconnect between upper level management and assistant managers...Assistant manager didn't seem to understand that school came before a part time job, and even though the head manager was very understanding and flexible, the assistant manager did not seem to get it. Scheduling conflicts, etc. It was a mess....the customers were great though!"
good,"Think of your average department store but with a tinge more class."
good,"When I first started at belk it was enjoyable. I was always willing to work extra and stay beyond the end of my shift. Things began to change when management changed. Ota employees get very little respect at my location. We do the most with little to no recognition but when something is wrong we will most definitely get talked down to. We do not get invited to any morning meetings when something important is being said, well with the exception for the one time that they were annoucing pacesetters and than we were dismiss while the meeting continued. Alot is expected to be done when most of the team leave right after truck. Management look out for themselves and HR is the last person you should talk to is there is any problems."
good,"The store manager at this location did a lot of preaching and talking about God, very unprofessional. The pay started at 7.75, which for retail is not uncommon, but the dress code was very strict, and made it hard to afford to dress like they wanted. There was no set schedule, I would have preferred working same shift everyday but that didnt happen. Most of the employees and customers made it a fun work environment, but the pay and the store manager made me look for better work."
good,"Belk is a great place to work if you want a career--and that's it. There is no work life balance, you will miss every holiday with your family (but that's what you sign up for when you work retail). The raises are minuscule and not worth it, the best raise you can get is to receive a promotion instead. Management is either great or too focused on achieving their year-end bonus which most achieve by cutting the hours of the associates and forcing the exempt staff to work 6 or 7 day weeks with 12 hour days (but only they only get paid for 40 hours, no matter how much overtime they work). The vacation time for full time and exempt managers is fantastic; you get quite a bit after 6 years of service. However, finding time to take it with all the blackout days is almost impossible and you will end up losing time off that you earned. However, if you want a supplemental part time job with no benefits, Belk is the way to go. They can work around your full time job for the most part and it’s worth the little extra cash and associate discount. Just know what you’re getting into when you work retail, either you’re into customer service, or you’re not—there is no in-between and you must make all your goals, even the ones that seem unattainable."
good,Limited areas for advancement. Little to none in the areas of family consideration. Poor communication between managment and sales force
good,"Belk strives to achieve upmost customer satisfaction above all. If a customer is displeased, we are encouraged to do anything in our power to improve the customer's shopping experience that day. An associate typically mans the register, clean out the dressing rooms, straighten up the merchandise, and occasionally help out with anything the managers need assistance with. The hardest part of the job is trying to please customers when so much is out of an associate's power. A lot of what the customers want, only management can do, and sometimes management isn't available. The most enjoyable part of the job is flexible hours. If you have another job, Belk will work with your schedule."
good,Human Resources at any job including this one threatens your livelihood without any remorse or sympathy towards a person(s) situation. They over work you without any flexibility in time or schedule
good,"I clean fitting, go-backs and help customers. I enjoyed it first. Management was ok at first. I did enjoy getting a discount. I did enjoy talking to the older employees, they always helped me when I needed it."
good,"Hired as seasonal, but lucky to get 12 hours week!  They keep advertising for more help but they don't need to hire more people they need to use the people already hired!   Pay is very low oly $9.00 an hour.  Most workers there are very nice."
good,"pushed to sign people up for credit cards with no personal gain. mangers are rude, no hours, small pay, no room for advancement and usually hires from outside the company. mostly just a job for students."
good,I truly loved this job & had pride with it. I did whatever was asked & worked shifts no one wanted to work.  But the management at this store seems to drive people away.  Seems management has the right to criticize & write up you up but you are not allowed that option.  When you try to stand up for yourself & do formal complaint nothing is done.  I was told there was nothing that could be done.. they are holding everyone accountable but at this time there are others still employed with more violations or tardies. Certain managers show a lot of favoritism & make it a very hard environment to work in.
good,"It’s a nice job but it’s not the best one on the world, didn’t like the fact of busting my butt and being lied to about opportunity’s to expand my work skills. And the “ If by Friday we meet or exceed our numbers for the week you’ll leave early”. That only happened once I was there for three months"
good,"The company is undergoing a lot of changes."
good,There were not consistent hours. The hours started off well but then they got to 5 hours a week. They said they didn’t have enough hours but they were still hiring people.
good,"The best part of my day is the associates I work with they make my very long days enjoyable. The customer base is great we have a large group of loyal customers that shop here all the time. A typical work day would involve answer customer complaints/issues. Merchandising product out to the floor to new directives. Helping ring out customers when needed, help in cosmetics, Fine Jewelry & Fragrance selling as needed. Fund registers with cash if they have giving out cash returns or just need change."
good,its a job not different from any other! its not as diverse as it should be and the pay is low. managementis a little childish and overall not as objective as they should be most enjoyablepart of the job would be the interaction with the customers and the downfall of the job would be the disrespectful coworkers.
good,"Management needs to be trained better. "
good,it was okay at first till they started picking about every little thing while trying to get the job done and they want to keep messing with people trying to do their job correctly.
good,"I worked for Belk for five years selling suits and while I actually enjoyed the work I did, my enjoyment of working there declined due to poor management.  The biggest issue with Belk is their focus on credit applications.  It is all they care about."
good,"The management is not interested in you or helping you  unless you’re one of their favorites. I didn’t even get the job applied for, they just put me somewhere else and cheats me out of hours that I’m supposed to be getting. Also the training process was bad. They don’t even try to help you learn they really just want you to do task and even the task they don’t want to do."
good,"Belk corporate used to be an outstanding place to work: good pay and benefits, work/life balance, great culture. You could advance, move around and you felt valued. Ever since the Belks left, that has changed. The new owners haven’t cut salaries, but they have cut jobs, so everyone has much more work. Flexible schedules were all taken away and now there are no boundaries on where work stops and life begins. The new management runs around like a bunch of crazy people, overreacting to everything, and treats those left as minions to micromanage. No one has any say over their work anymore, nor is your experience or input valued. The culture has become toxic as reactionary chaos has taken hold. So many people are unhappy and looking to leave - it’s difficult seeing a company you once loved run into the ground. And while the new owners have done some good things - built a new gym, renovated the corporate office and some stores, and improved the product - a terrible culture of fear and loathing is impacting business. You can’t employ that many unhappy people and expect it not to affect things."
good,Enjoyed working to assist employees and fundraising supporters.  I learned a lot from supportive employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with candidates and providing them with the services requested to the best of my ability.
good,"I did like my job when I started but many things had changed in management. Too many micro-managers to the point of being unable to complete original tasks."
good,There was no job securety. They would limit the number of employees they had each day so you had to cover many areas you knew nothing about. You were often asked to stop your work and do takes belonging to management then questioned when your job was not completed.
good,"A typical day at work was hurry hurry hurry cleaning up dressing rooms and checking out customers with their purchases. I learned a lot about retail, from displaying the merchandise to actual sales. I was learning to be a better sales person as my sales were increasing. I found my peers to be quiet enjoyable as being new to the area, I was beginning to get to know the area through their opinions. I found the management to be a bit chaotic, as so many aspects of the job were learn as thrown into the fire, and do your best, however friendly, but lacking some professionalism. Being a member of the Belk family for the holidays was the best introduction to the neighborhood"
good,We have to set too many sales a week. we unload the truck 2 or 3 times a week and put all of the merchandise out on the sales floor in the correct departments. We do markdowns once a month.
good,"It would not be a bad starter job. I would tell someone just starting in to work force to try them out. There is not a lot of teamwork,if you are a self starter this is for you."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.  When I was first hired, the management was partial to employees who were hired when the store was first opened.  Where I was stationed, there were two employees who received the best hours to work (those hours were the busiest, so you could make your sales).  To qualify for awards you had to make the sales goals.  Even though I qualified on every level, I did not make the sales goals, therefore no award."
good,A demanding job that required an adaptive ability to provide an wide variety of customers proper customer service. A job that required outside research to learn about merchandise and sale to customer.
good,I would check my sales to see how much I needed to sale that day. I would check customers out. I'd also assist customers in finding what they were looking for. Management was strict and demanding. My co-workers were great to be around. The hardest part was the thought of working there. The most enjoyable part was the people i worked with.
good,The hardest part of this job for me is the lack of management support when dealing with customers.  When you are used to following rules it's hard to work in an environment that disregards them regularly.  Customers dictate the rules not management.
good,"A typical day was selling, customer service, and stocking.  I learned about taking inventory.   Management in this store for the most part was good.  My job really wasn't hard.  The most enjoyable part of the day was working with the customers."
good,"A typical day included ringing up customers, doing returns and exchanges. I learned how to do credit accounts, how to fold clothes there way, and how to be generous to each individual. Management was horrible because there is one person in there who thinks they are the boss and they are not. Instead of the manager calling you back its always HR. She is very disrespectful to the workers and rude. She makes up everybody's hours including her own and that is not fair because she will make sure she has her 40 hours even if no one else does. I really don't think she deserves the job. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management. Enjoyable part of the job was my happy customers!! :)"
good,Fun place to work. Had your usual lazy bones but otherwise got along with everyone. Management really needs to work on keeping its good workers around by offering raises and more hours
good,"A typical day consist of helping multiple customers with returns and purchases . This is a self sufficient position, there is not much help provided. The co workers stay in their on sections and provide little assistant."
good,"I would help with sales,I learned how to set up new credit accounts.Management showed me how to set up displays and organize the floor to attract the customer attention. I worked well with coworkers. The hardest part of my job was midnight audits.The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction of customers faces when they were satisfied with the purchase."
good,The customers are the most enjoyable part of this job.  Upper management does a good job of communicating company goals and direction.
good,If you love meeting new people and enjoy a job that keeps you busy then this is the place for you during the holiday seasons.
good,"I was only a seasonal employee, but I enjoyed my experience at Belk."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me being the only associate in my department, which includes running to the other department to help customers with merchandise from multiple departments, finding coverage for lunch, and staying at work sometimes an hour over until the part-time associate comes in. Through it all I have learned how to multitask, be patient, and understand that I am only human not superhuman. But through it all my relationship between my coworkers and my customers keeps a smile on my face."
good,Belk is a great place to begin to understand what it means to work and the diversity that it takes to deal with the Belk culture and the customers.
good,"Management is not flexible, likes to change your work hours without informing you and threaten your job position if you question the change. Likes to add to your job title and requirements without added compensation."
good,"The manager and her clique were all untrustworthy, the pay is awful , holidays I wouldn’t get a break even though I worked near school now I barely had time to come and visit family"
good,"It was fine. It was sort of interesting working in the shoe department. Management was completely unstable, I had a crew manager be fired for throwing a case of shoes at myself and two other employees. The store manager was also fired shortly after for unknown reasons, but the shift of all of this personel was disturbing."
good,Belk is a great company to work for . Only if you do not have any bills or major things in your life to do . I feel it is a job for younger people who are still in school because they are flexible . They encourage happiness and success in the company and that is the reason I do like working here .
good,The pay rate is Not fare and to low . Employees get treated Unfairly . Have to be friends with Management to get places. Other then that I do low working here .
good,The stress from not making sles is real after all the shootings at the mall. And sometimes it feel as if the mangers if you are not a favorite they will try to get rid of you. But all my co-workers are amzing to work with. But witha ll the hard work I have done feel like i jave had the short end of the sick some days.
good,If you really like retail and don't like stationary hours. If your able  and willing to work any days and nights. Especially the day before and after holidays. Must be able to keep up with changes on the sales floor.
good,Not much room for advancement if you are looking to increase your salary. This is a good starting point for getting your feet wet in the business but it is very easy to get stuck where no where to advance
good,No work/life balance. as hard as we work never seems good enough and not enough recognition to associates. working with other team associates and building friendships within department has been great
good,Working for belk is a lot of work the main thing is a sales each week Belk had a requirement to for each sales section to reach the sale goalfor the month.
good,"Never know hours of operation, management is poor, and a lack of senior leadership. Also, training team is awful they don't even know they're SOP's they hand out. Great coworkers throughout the plant but all will tell you pretty much the same."
good,"I’ve worked at Belk for a year, and this job is defiantly for those who are In college or want a retirement job that prefer part time hours. Pay isn’t the best, I’ve never received a raise, and always working weekends. Very high turnover rate which means management never hires enough people to replace the ones they lost. In turn other part timers get long full time/overtime hours. If you can do customer service and sales, this is the job for you. Co workers are another story, they are way too competitive and you can make or break relationships over sales, credit or email capture.  If you can handle customers, coworkers, and the quotas you can make it."
good,"I worked for the company as a first job in high school, but over the 4 years and 2 stores had no advancement and minimal pay raise, with them basically working me to death at the end of it (asking for part-time due to schools , but scheduled 40+ hours anyway) . Co-workers were great and the company held constant sales prizes and benefits for employees throughout the year (gift cards/awards/etc.), but the management was always terrible and a constant turnaround and turnover."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of opening registers, check purchases out, accept returns (except fine jewelry and cosmetics), help customers throughout the store, clean fitting rooms and straighten clothes. At night we would then close registers and clean up throughout the store. "
good,"Working in retail during the holiday months means compromising valuable time with my family. "
good,New management changing too much.  Not the old Belk I joined.  They are getting rid of all the old vetern associates.  Sycamore a private equity firm now owns us.
good,"I would help unload the truck in the mornings. Then took out my merchandise to my area. I would open boxes and take merchandise out, take all plastic and cardboard off merchandise. when finished opening and unwrapping merchandise I then put merchandise on the proper racks in the proper order. The only time I needed a manager is when I had a question about the prices. The hardest part was handling the big boxes. I enjoyed working by my self."
good,"As a Belk employee, one can expect generous discounts and a supportive management team.  The most enjoyable and important part of the job is leaving customers highly satisfied."
good,"The coworkers were rude and immature. They made the work environment hostile, many made fun of each other and judged each other on outfits. It was like being in high school again."
good,"It was hourly based and commission as well. A very competitive and demanding job. I love interacting with the customers majority of the time.  "
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the people at Belk. Management, communication and compensation however are far below par. Very much like being in high school with favoritism and a complete lack of communication. This could be a really good place to work, however management needs to realize that petty drama and professionalism do not go together. Lots of turnover, but good people to work with (other employees)."
good,"a tipical day at work would be to put all freight away in a timely manner. making sure sale signs match the product."
good,"The scheduling was eratic like most retail places from week to week, and there were many teens hired so there was high turnover and they often didn't work to drive sales but to put in their hours.  The junior's department was a mess and later, I was able to see improvement in time while I worked there."
good,"Not the experience I expected. The company is giving away its'  profitability. I thought it would support the Brand more, but it gave away its' profitability.  It is garnering a reputation for such.  Does not believe in promoting dollar volume for the company."
good,"The job it self is okay, a day of work consist of standing and walking long hours assisting customers. Management doesn't really train you, it's a learn as you go job, others on the sale floor may assist but management doesn't properly train and are sometimes too busy to assist."
good,"Working at Belk was like having a second family. What I had difficulty with was the hours during certain times of the year that made it very difficult to enjoy the holidays with our family. I did like the fact that not including blackout dates if you gave the notice to have a certain day or time off, It was normally given to you."
good,My coworkers and managers  were good but they very rarely offer full time and they expect associates to do everything. The pay is decent and there are no benefits or advancement opportunities.
good,"The culture has definitely shifted from laid-back to stressful and tense. Changes pile up to the point that you cannot continue on the work you should be doing, but have to go back and rework things from 2 weeks ago. Peoples' opinions aren't valued anymore.  If someone is hired to do that job- value their opinion/knowledge and trust that they will get it done. "
good,Management of this job could have been better. Some employees did feel they we're better than most. Way too much favoritism. I did learn that you do not have work friends come to do your job and leave.
good,"learned how to do returns, exchanges, inventory and refunds. management was ok. high pace workplace. working holiday hours was the hardest part and at nights. Enjoyable part was doing visual merchandising."
good,Typical day as a sales associate is coming in an touchbase with the customers to make sure that they are finding what they are looking for.  Then ringing them out with their purchase.  When not helping customers then you are recovering your area.
good,"The customers were often very rude, managers didn't help with anything, coworkers were two-faced, the merchandise was cheaply made and over priced, and the store was often dirty."
good,managers are all over the place and dont know what theyre doing. talk about how they need more people and then dont hire anybody. dont give good hours. treated poorly.
good,"Management was nice and so were coworkers. The job itself was laid back with reasonable sales goals. However, scheduling was hectic. I do not recommend if you have an active family"
good,"Belk was a great company to work for at first, but there is no room for advancement and the customers are awful sometimes. Its nice that you can get credit money for every application you get someone to fill out. Big con is the management, they are awful to their employees. There is one last problem, working at belk there are tons of women and ALL it is is drama."
good,Upper management seemed to be controlled by lower management. No room for advancement. Poor work/life balance. Incompetent HR department. Leadership qualities in employees were stifled and unrewarded.
good,The my coworkers were very nice friendly people typical day was I got there at 4:30 in the morning we unload the trucks put stock out on the floor tagged and price every item put them in their sections then when I was done with that a clean clean the whole store beverages included then change clothes and got ready for the sales floor
good,"Great job if you're a loner. Associates that have been there for a long time aren't very accepting of new faces and ways to do things, regardless of Management requests."
good,Working for Belk has taught me a lot! Patience and endurance are key. You must remember everybody doesn't have good days everyday. This is with the employees and the customers. My advice would be to start a clean slate everyday and remain positive.
good,"I have work at belk for a year now, I work part time I work very hard for my commission which I never experience it before very challenge. Management and co-workers"
good,"The best of the job is definitely the freedom that you have. Also, the employees are friendly... they just have a tendency to not pull their weight during their shifts. Management is a toss up. One second everything is great (usually just in time for when the big bosses are coming which they never actually do) but then other times (most of the time) the managers don't care about anything but running their mouths. The discount for employees is a joke and the way that the store manager allows the employees to be ridiculed just to honor the that the customer is right is just ridiculous."
good,"Good place to start your career, but little opportunity for advancement.  Get out after a year, you aren't going anywhere."
good,"I learned a great deal about the retail industry to know I can do the job but not fond of doing so. No quality of life, you work from home on your off days, I've been known to work past my paid hours to make numbers and to find that it wasn't appreciated and they just wanted more."
good,"Belk is a place to work, if you do not need to know your hours from week to week.  Belk provides excellent benefits if you choose full-time work.  Belk is a place to learn what not to do on your next job/career.  Management was poor.  Not personality wise, but knowledge. The rules change in Belk on a constant base.  Working with co-workers is what made the day short.  Most of the time I was in a department alone.  Example:  During my hours at I was in a selective area alone. Men's Department, Accessories, etc.  The hardest part of the job was, effectively maintaining the department in all 5 assets: 1. customers (always #1) 2. dressing rooms, 3. maintaining a clean area 4. Merchandising: putting out new line of clothes. 5. Shutting down store, which consisted of shutting down all registers in your area."
good,The truck is unloaded and merchandise is merchandised on the sales floor. I learned how to take control of a project and get it done in a timely manor. Management could use a lot of work but overall the job got done because efficient co-workers. Co-workers worked very hard each day to make sure that each task has been completed. The hardest part of the job is placing new vendors on the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers making sure that their every need is taken care of with relentless customer care.
good,"Coworkers are great. It has a tense atmosphere at times, sometimes playful, other times very stressful."
good,"All I have to say that in the months that I worked there, the managers SUCKED!!!!!!!! I hated working there, I couldn't even go to the bathroom without my manager asking where I was going. I even had to ask off on my day off, because the manager without notice had us working that day and most of us were off and I was one of them and since she had not said anything I had planned to go to the doctor that day and then the day before she decides to tell us and I told her that I couldn't go in to work because I had made a doctor's appointment because I saw that I was off. And she had the nerve to tell me to reschedule it and then she also told me to bring an excuse because our store manager was not giving out anymore days off unless we had an excuse. They make you work hard and I feel like they didn't appreciate it at all. I always tried to enjoying by working with my coworkers, that would make my day go by faster. All the managers would do is be in the managers office and just hangout and gossip, when we needed them we could never find them, we couldn't reach them on their phones."
good,I didn't enjoy working here to much free time not enough to do or there was to big of an area to cover with just one person while the store was open and customers where around. Also the management was not so great.
good,"Sometimes work is very stressful when there are too many employees and customers in the shoe area.  For example during certain sales events especially Thanksgiving/black Friday. Our hours are long usually 12 hour shifts.  Once we place shoes on the floor for customers to look at, mismates can happen where there will be only one shoe in the box and we have to physically search for the mate.  We are paid by commission so if a purchase comes back as a return the amount of that sale is deducted from your sales that same day.  Our managers are more impressed with the amount of credit applications than actual customer service.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when your customer thanks you for your help even if they did not find what they were looking for.  Displaying new shipment of shoes is fun as well when you get to see the new arrivals."
good,I would not recommend this company to any who wants to make a career out of it. They do not advance a lot of people inside the workplace.
good,"I enjoyed working retail, customer service comes easy to me. Belk has alot of great people that work for them. I wanted to cut back on nights and weekends."
good,"When I began working for Belk, I was in college and employed part time. Throughout college and after starting a family, I was able to work flexible hours and spend much needed time on homework and with my child. I was promoted to visual manager after three years with the company, a position that I enjoyed very much. After four years as part time visual manager, I was promoted to full time Lancome Counter Manager. Over the last year, I have enjoyed working closely with clients and developing my customer service skills. The most enjoyable part of my time at Belk was working with people and building lasting relationships and customer loyalty. The most difficult part of the job was not having a set schedule and getting to spend less time with my child as a result. I feel that I have advanced as far as I can within this company, which is my reason for seeking alternate employment."
good,I would come into work in the Loss Prevention Dept. and sit in the office and start watching the CCTV for shoplifters or any other forms of loss to the company. I learned a lot about law over the years I have worked for this company. I have always had some good co-workers that would always have my back when it came down to detaining a shoplifter. The most enjoyable part of the job is chasing down a shoplifter and catching them and bringing them back into the store for further processing.
good,Belk is a great company to work for depending on your experience in retail and your position within the company. I felt like less of an employee compared to some of the others who had been there longer. It seemed as if there were far too many managers and not enough general employees. I would not recommend this company simply because of my personal experiences.
good,It is an ok place to work. the hours are long and you are standing on your feet for hours.
good,"I work in cosmetics and my sales are great but they continue to concentrate more on getting customers emails, when I  explain customers do not want to give emails out they tell me that is more inportant than my sales."
good,"The associates at belk treat you like family, but you can tell management let’s their authority get to their heads & everybody must be perfect or your work isn’t right."
good,"The best part about working here was the people I got to meet along the way.  My co-workers were amazing people and I was so happy I got to meet them. Every day started the same, with a staff meeting about what goals needed to be meet which was very nice."
good,"Working at Belk was a good experience, but I was a senior in high school so I had to focus more on school than work. Sometimes they would put me on a morning shift on a school day."
good,"More about who you know, not how much or how hard you work. Store manager has her favorites and caters to them only which causes alot of tension in thestore. Too much favoritism  and not enough communication. Store Manager is not consistent with treating management and associates fairly. Over worked and under paid due to cutting man power, hours, and too many sale sets. No work life balance."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the discount and the customers. We have to help the customers while we're putting out merchandise which is fine, Customer service always comes first. But then it's time for us to go and our job is left incomplete."
good,"Honestly, the pay is terrible for what you do and there is no advancement. They always want you to push credit cards which people don’t need. Management is good though. Only problem is that it is a lot for one person to do."
good,Loved the customers but hated the push to get customers to open a credit account. I loved helping the merchandiser and making sure that the department was organized and clean.
good,I enjoyed the type of work I performed but the drive to get there did not make the job worth while. It was a very clean place to work and kept you busy at all times.
good,"Belk should only be a part time company.  Only part timers should work there,"
good,"Everything was going well, until they started the point system.  Managers are Backstabbing ,  favoritism , too faced ,  micromanage  , buddy buddy .  In general  They all suck! Work at your own risk ! 9 hr is not much if you don’t get the hours and days ."
good,This is an average retail job. Management is OK but not very friendly. They do not work with your schedules. They often give you less hours after a certain amount of time.
good,"The particular department store that I worked for was horribly mismanaged, despite the fact that we had 5 managers. The managers did not communicate well with one another which often led to much confusion on the workfloor. The managers seemed to begrudgingly do their jobs and were generally not very supportive of the staff. They only seemed to care about sales and anything that negatively affected sales was dealt with swiftly and promptly. Sales quotas always came before the well-being of the associates and whenever there was an issue with a customer, the managers would usually side with them over their employees. There is NO promotion from within, despite the fact that they tell you otherwise during the interview process."
good,Belk was old fashioned company that did not care much about stepping into the now. We all worked very hard but it always felt like you never got to accomplish your set goal.
good,Company culture has completely shifted and is a challenge. Management values nepotism over work ethic. Pays well but not worth it most days of the week.
good,This company has a tendency to ask things of employees that are above pay-grade and expects employees with disabilities to withstand harsh conditions. They are quick to sweep problems under the rug and do not address them properly.
good,"If your just stepping into the work force, Belk is a great place to start.A typical day is starting with the morning meeting and making sure the products are out and changing the sales signs. I think the hardest part of the job is getting yelled at by a customer for the first time."
good,Sometimes management doesn’t work around life situations. Availability is something Belk thrives upon. Annual raises only range up to .25 cent per year. Sometimes some associates don’t even get that. Great if you don’t plan on moving up or moving off anywhere. Not much job promotion within the store.
good,I was hired as part time at age of 17 and I loved it I loved my co workers and everything but I think you get treated better as a seasonal hire. Just my opinion I've been at Belk's for a year and 5 months
good,I have worked at Belk for 3 years it took 2 years before I was given a $0.13 raise and looking for new jobs when I was raised to $9. Most managers are nice and understanding aside from being overworked by corporate leaders. Highly understaffed store not given enough hours to schedule enough workers this puts a lot of stress on employees. Very flexible with school schedules.
good,The most enjoyable part of working at  Belk is interacting and assisting our friendly and loyal customers. We ere empowered to provide the best service possible. There is no micro-management.
good,"Used to be a fabulous company but since being bought out is slowly circling the toilet bowl.  Instead of competing with store like Nordstrom and Dillards, they now consider Kohls a direct competitor.  Merchandise has declined and so has the clientele.  I used to book appts for suits and now all my client book is good for is kindling.  If you can score a commission position it's not as bad but, enter at your own risk I guess."
good,"Felt like i was overworked most of the day. From the very first day besides being trained by coworkers on the register, my daily routine was left up to me. although working with little supervision was not challenging for me, my direct supervisor only barked orders that never felt like actual supervising."
good,"Coworkers made this job fun. That was one of the only only perks, the other was cake for birthdays. Company takes money away from paycheck if you do not meet sales or credit goals."
good,Good for those who have full time jobs or like to keep your wardrobe up to part. The communication throughout the building is horrible. It’s a dog eat dog world.
good,"4am shift unloading truck great team effort supervisor even helped out everything thing after that was good everyone got an area unpacked and stocked items where they be long, good group of people to work with"
good,I do not want to participate in this portion. This is very irritating to have to input information in this section. I am more concern about my job search then this
good,"A typical day at Belk is challenging with most customers being rude."
good,"There are people that work there that are nice and friendly. Everyday is busy and when you think that you can relax, you can't because there is something always that needs to be done. There are some managers there that are willing to help their employees and they are willing to take the time to sit down and talk to you about what is going on at work. When you first start working at Belk after your 90 days probation, you don't get a raise on you paycheck. If you are a Part-time employee, you don't get any sick pay hours and you don't get any vacation hours. As a part-time employee, you only get (maybe) 25 hours or less depending on who is your department manager. Make sure you make all your sales goal, get all your credit card goals, and make sure you ask customers for their phone numbers and e-mails and then log those information in the computer system; because those count toward your yearly paycheck raise."
good,Hours are not guaranteed and inconsistent.  Staff to be flexible.  Hired for part-time work and would work me 30-35 hours per week than would drop me to 11 hours per week.  This happened to all employees who were not salary.
good,"Retail environment has changed over the past few years and everyone is doing more with less resources.  Retail also comes with nights, weekends and holiday schedule so work/life balance is non-existent."
good,Typical day is working 15 hours a day.  Managing 15 people and helping customers.  Hardest part of the job is not seeing your family.  The most enjoyable part is getting to see the regular customers.
good,"Very short staffed and the management lacks professional skills and portrays a very negative environment. They cannot manage to get people to stay long and work for the company do too their lack of respect for their co-workers. Therefore, people who do get called in for an interview only last a few days then quit or leave. Would not even recommend this as a starting job to college students nor would I recommend this as a part-time job."
good,"There appeared to be poor communication among management for  seasonal temp regarding job duties. Confusion! However, I really enjoyed working with customers."
good,"The managers there are absolute garbage. One will tell you to do something for them and before you can even begin to do it another manager will call you and have you do a task for them without instructor the other manager they were using you, thus creating tension 24/7."
good,A typical day at Belk consists of providing each and every customer with assistance in order to ensure that he or she has a great experience with a Belk employee.
good,I loved my job at Belk when I started 5 years ago. The company has been going through a lot of changes over the last couple of years. It was just time for me to move on to something new & different.
good,"My experience as a sales associate was very pleasant. I enjoy helping customers. "
good,"Belk is your typical retail work environment. It has its up and downs. A lot of the employees are great to work with and work hard, upper management is the real problem. Too many people wanting too many things and no coordination or communication. This makes it difficult to actually get your job done, when you have to do everyone's as well."
good,A great place to learn how to work with the community and help women feel beautiful about themselves through makeup sales.
good,"long hours, for little pay"
good,What a great place to learn for a first job. You get the responsibility that will help you in your future career. It is a better position then most people will think.
good,"Working at Belk in Sandhills, the first thing you learn is that you will have about 5+ authority figures that don't necessarily communicate with one another so you'll end up doing more work that required (especially in the fall). Co-Workers are great people,I learned a lot from them in my time there. Hardest part of the job is the physical labor, you'll go from unloading a 1000+ unit truck to immediately putting the items out, breaking down the boxes, moving the fixtures around in the departments,etc. Not the worst job in the world but ex military would lose their minds (literally) from the level of disorganization that goes on there."
good,"With this position I dont feel as if I gained any type of new knowledge other than working with a large amount of people and a high volume of customers. This department store was located in the largest mall in Columbia. There was never much down time, which I consider a positive."
good,"Co-workers all work as a team to achieve success"
good,"Very boring, with little to no feeling of accomplishment."
good,"Don't get me wrong, I worked for this company for 12 years and it had it's ups and downs. Sadly at he end more downs. If it weren't for the support and encouragement of my fellow associates I may have left long ago. The Lack of support from management was mind blowing a lot of times refusing to come out and deal with customer issues. I would hand them the number to corporate and just pass by the managers all together."
good,Ton of work but you can advance if you want to. Management was awful when I was there. They do not communicate with each other at all. Pay is okay for retail.
good,"A day at work consists of helping clients by processing transactions, recovery of stock, sale sets, and markdowns of stock."
good,I loved my job here but the manager made the job difficult. The environment outside the loss prevention office is amazing and nothing is a thrill like catching a shop lifter. The pay is good and when you start the hours and attitude you get from the manager are good but that changes the longer you are there.
good,i give this job 3 out of 5 stars. Simply because i did not like the way the store was ran. could have done better with the other staff members also
good,"The people that I worked with were great people. I enjoyed my time selling with most of them, especially when we learned to work as a team and not a bunch of sharks in a commission environment. Upper management always seemed uncertain. My direct manager seemed to be the best manager to be under and I enjoyed her leadership. I believe most of the shakiness had to do with the fact that Belk is looking to sell the company and there are many uncertainties about the future."
good,"working in fulfillment there is a lot of things going on when I first come in, I have to log in the computer and see if we have and expedited orders those orders get pick first which means we go find them first because those customers have paid extra money to get their orders shipped  within 2days instead on the standard shipping days, next we pick the regular orders, after we have found all the orders or at least half we start processing them which means getting a shipping label and printing slip after that we pack them and get them ready to be picked up by Fed Ex. Working in customer service is a little different I am directing calls to managers or certain departments depending on what the customer is calling about and when I am not answering phones I am doing gift wrapping so it keeps me busy."
good,"In my years of working with Belk, at one time it was a place that I was sure that I'd have the hours I was promised as well as enough assistance in the position. Over time, hours have dwindled, management is no longer there for assistance, and the quality of employment is better found elsewhere. For the amount of work the employees do, as well as what they endure, Belk does not accommodate."
good,I go in at 5am and get off by 2pm Monday- Friday. I have weekends off. I love working with most of my co workers. Most of us get along and share similar interest. The common goal is to overall finish the truck or do as much as we can within that day.
good,I came in and worked very hard. Benefits was promised and never given. People took advantage of my hard work. I am a very outgoing person and will do anything for anyone that needs help. Lets just say a lot of management realized this and used it for their own benefit. I became very depressed and brought my work home with me all the time because I was so stressed. I tried to go to HR and Corporate with my complaints but was never successful.
good,"Work was pretty much how you would think it would be.  Customers would ask for fashion advice, so you would have to be pretty trendy.  you cannot laugh when you want when they pick out something really tacky but that's what you are there for, to help out.  Inventory was stressful along with holidays. If you are really good, the customers would ask for you by name when they need help."
good,"putting out clothes all day. management ok co-workers,  the hours was the hardest part for me. Going shopping was the enjoyable for."
good,a job that i will always remember and be grateful for the opportunity and doors that opened for me just by working for the company
good,Coworkers were great and th e jopb was not hard to do.I learned how to use RF scanners while I was employed at this particular company.
good,"I WOULD WORK THERE IF I HAD TO ON PART TIME BASIS.   My experience was not the best, but it was not also the worse."
good,Great part time job to have as a college student. Be prepared to work most all weekends and holidays though.
good,I learned time management as well as how to multi-task in a professional environment or manner. Working in the Professional Belk center also helped me to improve on my customer service skills. Although my job was to work as the personal secretary of the centers director; i performed many other task such as managing workshops required to graduate from the univerity.
good,A typical day is full of customers. There is also a lot of running around all day so it's a good workout. When I'm not selling I am usually recovering the store.
good,this company is nice to work for if you do not have a lot of bills to pay . hours are not stable at all.
good,"assisting customers and merchandising"
good,"In Brief, I manage multiple priorities  to reduce retail shrinkage both internal and external. I have learned over the years how to read behaviors help defuse hostile situations. The management could improve on development and retention of its talent. My peers and I work interchangeably to insure our overall success. The most challenging part of my job is to use the proper use of force to detain shoplifters. The interaction with my peers makes daily tasks enjoyable."
good,The company's goals and mission are not aligned with the expectations given by management. This unites the employees of a store but can separate them as well. A typical day can range from strenuous work to mundane tasks that can take any amount of time. Management are expected to fill in the hours not properly given to hourly employees to complete any number of assignments.
good,"great place for a first job but not long term work"
good,"Great for college students, flexible hours, diverse workplace"
good,"Helping customers make satisfied purchases customer service important, arranging displays"
good,I would sort the merchandise and load the trucks. Sometimes I would scan boxes.
good,This job use to be a great place to work at but then they changes Store Managers and everything changed. They made it very hard to work for them and had high standards that made it hard for anyone to compete with also they do a lot of favoritism...
good,Friendly work place
good,Belk is a decent place to work. The managers are nice and I get along great with my co-workers. The employee discount is awesome. The medical benefits are not that great. My regular customers are nice however we do get complaints a lot about the coupon's exclusions. This started out as a second job for me but ended up as my only job due to being laid off my main job. I said that Belk is a good second job because your hours will get cut badly at times and can suck if this is your only job.
good,Nothing more to say. The managers hate to come when you call for help. The customers do inappropriate things in fitting rooms. There is no job security.
good,If they had a better selection of clothes they may get more customers
good,It’s was very fast and a lot of questions about unhappy customers and clothing dress well always smile Always be on time be dressed to impress always  smile
good,"I worked for this company as a sales associate and manager. The environment started out mostly pleasant. Belk has and is doing a lot of big changes attempting to stay relevant and afloat in a dying market. I would recommend working here if you are just looking for a job, if you are seeking a career I would recommend against this company."
good,"The overall job itself was decent.Lack of communication was a big issue. No one ever knew what was going on, and therefore it was hard to get things done. The management was sloppy, they wouldn't do their job. For instance, if their job didn't get done a lower employee would have been blamed for it. It always was excuse after excuse there. Unnecessary amount of drama and conflicts as well, but that goes back to the huge lack of communication."
good,not a bad company to work for. Competitive salary and pleasant working environment. The company could use a bit more training in their online services for employees.
good,I would warn anyone wanting to work here. Not to do it. Management is lacking in personality and  expects everyone to do ALL jobs not just the ones you are hired for.
good,"Schedule is inconsistent for merchandising. Recent change from 6am-3pm to 8am-5:30pm. Days off are random, rarely two together. Constant state of more work from less people for low pay. Ridiculous expectations for work completion as a company standard."
good,"Management is constantly changing what you are doing.  The manager may tell you to do a task using procedure ""A"" one day, then the next day decide to change it to procedure ""Z"".  Often this means recreating the whole look of the store and displays and presentations of the clothing."
good,I was a lead on first shift. When i first started working there i enjoyed my job. As managers began leaving for different reasons and new ones came in associates moral lowered immediately. I believe because every new manager wanted to make major changes to fast.
good,Belk is a slow paced work environment. In cosmetics you receive a base pay and commission. The company is flexible with schedules. The downside of my experience was poor management.
good,Nice place to network. You meet new People and there are great ways to help you meet sales goals. Not to mention the great discount and new inventory that comes in.
good,"There were no people of color so to speak in positions of leadership.  This was no accident. White  people were consistently encouraged to do more and black people were not encouraged the same way "
good,"Management was intolerable; were prone to gossip and spreading rumors about their employees. Customers could be absolutely horrid, while some (on the rare occasions) were delightful. The ONLY thing that made this job tolerable was my coworkers. they were amazing."
good,The pay wasn’t high enough for the required jobs. Most managers were not willing to help. You are expected to work  overtime with no extra pay and also fast paced work.
good,It’s not bad work. It’s just I’ve been there a year now and as far as I know have not received a raise. I’ve worked in all areas of the store. Most of the work is very simple. Communication with our HR is sometimes lost and it does get frustrating. I also find the point system for attendance to be rather ridiculous.
good,The job at Belk was part-time. I did not have too many problems while working there. I enjoyed working with the customers. I would have stayed there longer as an employee had I not returned to school.
good,"The hardest part of the work is not having set hours from week to week. The holidays are more important than the people home , family and church responsibilities. "
good,Belk overall is not to bad of a place to work. But management is not good. They are not on the floor enough and dont really want your opinion on how the store is running. The benefits suck and you do not get paid nearly enough for what you have to deal with.
good,Used to be a great place to work but I would not recommend them now. New management is horrible!  No one is happy and the morale is extremely low. The people running the advertising department talk a good game but they have no idea what they are doing. Just look at the current catalogs. A high school kid could do a better design.
good,"I worked with BELK for six years, it was bitter sweet, I learned a lot about myself and meet many new friends and built myself a beautiful wardrobe for myself and my children over time. The thing I hated the most about Belk is the work schedule and hours, you work pratically all day and every single weekend unless you take off three weeks ahead of time, which I thinks now and at the time is ridiculous and greedy on the behalf of the company to take peoples days and life away for money."
good,The schedule is flexible and changes every week.  The work environment is very clean and pleasant.  It is a great way to work with customers and help them with their needs.
good,"Belk used to be a great place to work.  Today, not so much.  Used to work part time and management could work with my schedule.  Today, they want part timers to be available 24-7.  For just over min wage."
good,"Change is inevitable but this is too much change.  Nothing is consistent so you never know where you stand.  One day the work is one way, the next, another way.  No defined career path and the pay is very low."
good,This was my first job. I started when I was beginning college and resigned when I was about to graduate. Great learning experience. Met and learned a lot about people. Helps you learn patience. Do your best work and always be on time.
good,"If you don't hate retail, then this isn't a horrible job. The only thing that is particularly bothersome is trying to get people to open up Belk credit card accounts. Management will hound you day and night about this."
good,Definite Top-Down Management- employees seemed engaging and benefits were fantastic-
good,"The job was okay , but a lady did put her hands on me i didn’t think of it as aggressive at the time until i spoke to a manager . The work hours was okay until they hired more employees and couldn’t pay me so i relocated."
good,Communication was not a strong point within the store. Being short handed cause added stress. Some managers and associates were lazy. Pay was not worth the headache.
good,"When I first  got there , weekend work and working on holidays were mandatory. People  didn't  like being  made to work  during Thanksgiving. Now there is an option that  the  employees there are pleased with."
good,"Belk has taught me, not only how to merchandise, or cleaning fitting room.  But how to react to irate customer, different culture as well as different nationality.  My experience is has matured me and boost my studies in psychology."
good,I did not work at belks long enough to have an opinion on this. I worked in the summer full-time but was given part time hours. Our store was extremely slow and I was bored.
good,"A typical day started off by getting to your register and having to attend customers, fitting rooms, clothes racks all before being able to put your personal belongings away. It was always fast paced, but there was lack of effort coming from the managers."
good,I worked at a small location for about 8 months in the shoe department. Sometimes there wasn't enough staff in this department so there were occasions where people didn't take breaks. For the most part management was fine. My coworkers were great and easy to get along with. Some days it would be super fast and busy and there was only one person working in shoes. It could get a bit hectic but it made time go by faster.
good,I worked part-time for the holiday season.  You don't get many hours but it is a fun place to work.  Everyone gets along well.  The holidays get hectic but it's not bad.  I think everyone should work retail to find out how to treat people in daily life.
good,"The management do not communicate with each other. So you are told multiple different ways to complete one task. Also, when the holiday is done hours are cut way back."
good,"This a great place to start in retail sales. It is a consistent part of the community and one of the last family owned companies.  It is a perfect place if you need flexibility in your schedule to go to school, or have a second job.  Keep in mind that it is retail so you will be required to work weekends and holidays."
good,Not a good long term career. Retail is not for everyone but it gets you interacting with customers. Teaches you patience and how to provide really good customer service
good,"Makes employees feel small!!"
good,"typical day is  slow mostly "
good,"Belk always maintays that we have a southern spirt, but we need to have more sales associates in the store to help, We need to go back to helping customers and listern to what the customers are saying and not how much the store is making and how many credits they have."
good,My experience at Belks was not very good because their wasn't much room for advancement. the management could have been more supportive with the employees.
good,"Stayed busy I have learned a lot from the store operate a register, markdown prices math is was very helpful. Learned merchandising. It was slow for the most part though I took a lot from this store as I do any other work place"
good,"Although I enjoy working directly with customers and selling merchandise, it is a stressfull job and you are on your feet all day.  We are required to ""sell"" customers Belk credit cards.  If you don't meet the corporate requirement each week, you will not receive your full raise.  Hardest part is keeping up with merchandise customers leave in dressing rooms.  Management favoritism."
good,"High paced sales job, if you are in fragrance you do have to assist the customers who are in the makeup counters if nobody is available. It is good to know how to color match with makeup and also good to know a little about each type of foundation or makeup product."
good,Never ending focus on pushing credits to your customers.  Management isn't bad until they start pushing you on getting more credits.  They will work with you.  Usually understaffed so you're doing so many side jobs that you don't have time to really focus on sales.
good,Very little job security and stressful. If you are planning on making a long term career out of it then I wouldn't recommend it. Pay for the amount of hours you will end up working is not worth it. If you are not on anti-anxiety medication you will be.
good,Mostly busy when they have special sales other then that it's not to busy. Enjoyed all my co workers. Management was not the best. Since management was so bad I learned how to handle upset customers in a better way. The hardest part of the job was inventory very an organized.
good,"Assisting customers in finding shoes, making displays for shoes, running audits, doing markdowns on clearance items."
good,"A typical day at work consists of loading and unloading trucks, making cardboard bails, and organizing the stockroom. Helping customers on the sales floor and making price changes in accordance with the sales ad are routine. I've learned quite a bit since working for Belk and also brought some of my previous knowledge in retail to the table. The workplace culture is a bit laid back but everyone is very friendly and cooperative. The hardest part of the job is the early shifts which start at 5 or 6 am most days. "
good,"spend all day on feet and comfortable shoes not allowed."
good,"Working at seemed like an ideal, however it didn't meet my expectations. I had heard from former employees that it isn't worth the time. I enjoyed working the there because no one was standing over me constantly seeing if I am doing the job. The only thing that I have a problem with is not working on the schedule days and not making enough money for the type of work."
good,"I loved the sales position I was in and was almost 200% over my sales goal.  I love people and loved helping them find the perfect item."
good,"I've worked for over 5 years as a cosmetic counter manager for a major line, always doing well, exceeding numbers, building a great business, always have a great review, but it's never enough!! Horrible raises, constant pressure for more opening credit ( which is a MAIN focus), item locating product( also a main focus).  Management  can be a joke, some good some awful. Most people are always looking for a better job. They do silly games and say phrases they think will encourage you but it's a circus!! They do not care about anyone, your a number. Only thing matters is the sales and credit!"
good,"There is never enough employees in the store, leaving one person to take on the entire department alone. Management could be a lot better, its more gossip than anything and would like for the one employee to do a 3 man's job. Co-workers, when there are any, tend to have this ""I DONT CARE"" attitude about a lot of things. Mainly customers service, and when you talk to the managers about it there is nothing being done."
good,"Never had enough people to cover shifts, would not hire more people, due to the fact that management wanted to make their own goals. Consistently berated employees in-front  of other employees. Refused to consider availability of all staff members, favoritism,  no sales coverage from one shift to another. consistently threatened staff with firing"
good,"The mobility in the company feels limited. Stressful environment due to mild management. If management was better than the environment would be less confusing and stressful. My co-workers make the job worth coming to work every day,"
good,when its slow you can occupy your time with projects. usually too much inventory for allotted floor space. Requires much work for what little man-hours may be divided up. Pay and benefits as well as a hours scheduled were subject to change.
good,"As a sales manager "
good,Great summer job good hours with a great team environment.The hardest part of the job is finishing all of the task given with my location being understaffed. The most enjoyable part is that its a pretty straight forward job.
good,"The Senior leadership of the company has little regard for the store team, often times ignoring them while visiting stores and berating them."
good,"On a truck day I take  freight to the floor. Unbox and hang freight. Sensor Tag Freight. Put freight to the fixture. Prep dock for truck unload. Unload freight. On a non-truck day I work on Return to Vendor order, Process defects, and Signing."
good,"I enjoyed my job, but there was too much work for one person in Visual.  There are never enough sales associates and some of the managers do not do their part.  It always seemed unorganized and in disarray."
good,"Long hours, no personal life. Management is not that good and benefits are ok. If you have a family forget about spending holidays with them."
good,"Working with strong technical team."
good,"Belk was a great place to start out.  The employee discounts and incentives for the sales staff was great. The support staff only recieved emploee discount and did not have any other incentives. Advancements only came if you were able to relocate to the stores that had open vacancies so good for those who can up root and move.  There was often a lack of seriousness when it came to safety training and accident prevention. HR reps depending on store you were with sometimes lacked the knowledge to help you learn your benifits.  I found that many of the sales staff did not have enough trainging on the floor and would often mess up the register count, give too much or too little discount. Overall I did enjoy my time there the get togethers and family vibe was welcoming.  If you are a fast learner and can self teach your self you will do good at this business. Also as with all retailers hours do get cut after holidays."
good,"My typical day at work was customer service, ad sets, stocking, and cleaning."
good,"Positive upbeat work environment where everyone is smiling and laughing with other co workers and customers."
good,Worked as a temp assignment. Strict hours and strict staff with lack of work. Non help towards career advancement. Team environment was ok but not too agreeing. Large turnover ratio. Tough work
good,"Overall it's retail....did not care for scheduling!!!"
good,I have worked @ Belk for 12 years and very much enjoyed my time there. Learned a lot about retail and worked with great people.
good,"I learned how to lead others in completing tasks, organization of selling and promotional plans, merchandising techniques, merchandise auditing, customer service, and troubleshooting techniques."
good,"During my time I have spent working for Belk, I have been able to interact with many different people, learn a lot about retail, business, and marketing strategy, and also build good work ethics.  "
good,Upper Management is not dedicated to the success of the sales associates.
good,"This is a company that stems from a well rooted back ground in the community. It was one of the most refreshing things about the company. I worked with a great team and we supported and complimented each others work styles and habits. Management is not much to be desired but if you love what you do than this is a small issue. It was difficult because we were consistently short staffed but in the end it made for a wonderful pay check if you had the energy to spend it. I loved my customers and servicing them, bra fitting may not seem like a life changing experience but it was for so many women and it feels good to help someone and make them happy. The down fall of this particular store is there is major employee turn over and management change."
good,"A typical day at work for me is checking out items to customers."
good,Was a fun place to work and management worked very hard to help get the work done for the day
good,I enjoyed working at Belk but there really wasn't much room for advancement.
good,"a very nice store to work in, its great meeting new people.  Management acts like they are so miserable, and they take it out on employees.   not professional at all. If management treated associates with respect, the associates would respect them. Some women managers think they have to be really hard and make everyone's life miserable to gain respect.  How clueless.!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of cleaning the fitting room, cleaning up the department from the day, putting product make where it belongs, helping customers, and getting the department ready for the next day. I learned how to do the credit apps, and that sometimes you will have amazing customers that make all the negative customers seem like nothing. The management for the most was pretty good. Most of the co-workers was very helpful when need be and a friendly person to talk too. The hardest part of my job, would have to of been dealing with the negative customers, and having to clean up after extremely messy people. The most enjoyable part of my job was finding that one person after a horrible day that was one of the nicest people you have ever met and them giving very encouraging words and advice to you. In situations like this, you have the opportunity to make customers and friends for life!."
good,"Check in at the managers mail box upstairs to see what your assigned daily store duty would be, such as MOD, CSL or both. Check email, and start your day. Usually we had a truck or a dept. move would take place. Fill in the selling floor and about that time, your ready to open the store. If it were Monday or Tuesday, your day was shot.  Mtg's, conf. calls, MOD in the store, usually hard to get things accomplished. Same as the night(s) you were worked. You interact with the entire store, help associates out with what their needs are, Give great customer service and take care of daily business."
good,"Being a Shoe Sale Associate for one of the longest running retail chains in America has been a positive one in many ways, yet it has it's downside as will any company.  I believe you have to be happy with yourself first before you can overall be happy where you work.  "
good,"This company has a good process of running their business.  The work might be little repetitive, but it keeps you very busy."
good,"A typical day at work for me is; getting there and seeing that certain people have not did their job and having that much more to do before I can get started on what truly needs to be done. I like for my area to be clean and neat, but that is not always the case."
good,"A typical day for me would include many wonderful customers and just a few not so wonderful. I'd help customers pick outfits and very much enjoyed that, and then I'd ring them up. When I wasn't doing that I would put up clothes from the dressing room, or straighten the store."
good,As an STMDP you will be required to be trained by upper management where you will shadow and at times do administrative tasks to prepare you to become a Sale Team Manager of a major department within the store.
good,"Pros: It is a job. People are friendly in a lot of places, with the exception of a few. Discount, not near as bad as some other unnamed retailers. Wouldn't expect to much from a low cost southern retailer."
good,Management was horrible my three years there. Some managers are great while others rather not have thier job. This trickled down to employees whose work became lack luster. Not a positive place to be.
good,"A typical day at work would be me clocking in, going straight to the floor to unload merchandise and set up dislpays for an 1.5 hrs. Reporting back to the employee lounge for a morning meeting and then out to the sales floor to start my day. Learned a lot from teaching myself, wish the company made more time to properly train employees. Management are the friendliest so sometimes I'm not so comfortable with asking for help. My co-workers are great, we've learned to teach n help each other. I learned to try not to focus so much on the negative things and appreciate the prize ahead. I converse freely and friendly with customers to make them feel special and not only like a customer. You never know who your entertaining"
good,good place to work while in college. Flexible hours and nice management staff.
good,"A day at Belk is working hard all day every day. I have learned a lot in the company, and they want to you at there uses, but there is no compensation to accomodate your hard work. ."
good,Management was open to provide support and friendly. All the employees worked as a team. It was a comfortable environment to work in. Hours started to get cut and was unhappy with that.
good,"It's incredible how the slackers get away with things and the hard workers aren't recognized or promoted. A friend of the manager takes a two-hour to three-hour lunch break, and no one seems to care."
good,There’s no hours but they stay hiring and it don’t make since all the managers are good except the general manager she’s kinda mean and I honestly feel like she’s out to get me
good,"Typical work days can be hectic.  Especially as deadline approaches.  Compensation, Leadership & overall culture are enjoyable.  Management can be a bit impersonal at times.  It is a large corporation after all.  Hardest points in the process were during color & concept.  Where all of upper-mid level management reviews future product designs.  The most enjoyable part is the level of creativity in which one can engage."
good,I enjoyed working here. I loved my co workers and assisting customers but the management overall isn't great. That is the main reason for leaving after almost a years time of working for this company.
good,Belks is good for part time employment.  I don't see it as a great place for career oriented employment. Ideal for college students seeking part time employment working around class schedules.
good,"Belk was a great company to work for when it was still family owned. Since the company sold in 2015, there have been numerous, gradual changes. While most of them have been necessary in the current struggling retail climate, some have been very detrimental to the successful daily functioning of a store. Cutting payroll hours so low to equal the 2008-2009 economy crash."
good,"Personally, I loved my job at Belk. The pay was decent, Coworks were very skilled in what they knew when it came to Sales, Benefits could have been better, etc. However, the management abused their rights countless times. Employees would have to work an overnight shift on a holiday season that would carry into the next day. I am a very optimistic person when it comes down to things. With that said, I was still a minor in school ( at the time I was in high school) and depended on a ride to and from work."
good,"As a cashier, the pay and benefits for part time do not outweigh the stress that the job brings. However, if you are being paid more and are full time then the job is worth it."
good,"If you are a salary position be ready to not have any social life. They will squeeze you like a lemon. You are expected to work overtime, work on your day off, cancel your vacation... Etc"
good,"Belks was a fun place to work with lots of discounts for you and your family. Discounts were the highlight and with the correct sales offered to bring in the customers, commission could be awesome as well."
good,Ok company to work.  Employees are required to do more work for little pay.  Management not helpful in assisting employees in their jobs.  Can be very stressful.
good,"working at Belk is not stressful, but the salary is low. Hours are few, especially after the holidays! Double discount days are awesome for employees."
good,"It was fine for a first job, but they are very strict about sales and didn't want employees talking to each other on the floor. Wasn't the happiest place to be, but the discounts were nice."
good,"I was trained online but felt kind of like I was thrown out to the wolves. Most of my coworkers were very friendly and helpful except for a select few. The management, however, was a different story. I was sometimes talked down to like I was a child. I am a full time student and they claimed to want to work with my class schedule, but would sometimes schedule me during the times I had class. The management wasn't completely HORRIBLE, but has a lot of things they need to fix."
good,"Working for Belk does provide flexible hours and the opportunity to increase your pay if you work hard. Unfortunately, it is bogged down by the fact that your starting pay is in the single digits. No matter what position you work, you will be doing several jobs at the same time without being compensated for it. If you don't make your sales or credit goals, Belk will reduce your pay. The unfortunate effect of this is causing competition to break out between the employees, much to the detriment of the customers. "
good,Good place to work if you are only looking for part time. Management was fine. You have to be full time in order to get benefits and they don't offer many full time positions.
good,I love my job and what I do. Its very exciting at times to be able to help customers find clothes that are looking for. Its shows me to be accurate with me my orders.
good,"cashiering is typically easy, the technology is old so it can have the potential to be a bit hard to learn. the dress. code is reasonable. management is understanding and easy to talk to."
good,"Manage is great, a good place to work, work culture needs a little more fine turning, work ethic is sometimes lacking in some departments but overall a good place to work."
good,"Decent work environment most of the time, but other times you are forced to work alone in a department with no help if needed. Managers only work well with certain employees, others they treat very poorly."
good,"Belk has a good team environment and everyone is cordial. Their management style is very laxed and new policy changes were tough to keep up with, as they were not announced in advance."
good,The job itself as a sales associate was not bad at and there were friendly employees but the management at the west gate mall location was not good. They rarely helped their employees and the top manager was always gone on vacations every other week.
good,"Shoe sales. Kept floor and stockroom straightened up.Each person had a certain amount in sales to do each day. and we had to open 3 new Belk credit card accounts each week. If you did not get 3 per week, sometimes they put you at the door to get people to sign up and you had no sales for the day.You received your 30 to eat, but no other breaks. If you needed to use the restroom, you had to tell someone and just leave the floor or hold all day."
good,overall it was a great job but they pick favorites and they turn a blind eye to the things they dont do on a daily work day. the employees are great but the managers arent.
good,It’s a good place just no enough work hours.I like the people I work with. It’s a fast pace.And I love the fact that I’m able to work on my own in my own pace.
good,Working for Belk you must be able to bend over backwards to get hours when it is out of the prime holiday season.  Management does not do well with availability or with days off requests and expects you to be there anytime any day regardless of notice.
good,"I enjoyed working there for the most part. It was slow during certain times of the year and very busy at other times (Black Friday, Christmas) It was a good learning experience and I was able to help customers pick out merchandise and recommended new products."
good,"A typical day at work involved counter sales"
good,"Some of the employees in this store do not respect management. Some workers are blatantly lazy. They expect the ROCC team to do everything while they stand around and chit chat. The corporate push for Belk credit card applications by sales associates is annoying. Nobody wants a hard inquiry on their credit report for a Belk card. It's not worth it."
good,A declining industry that continues to cut resources as a result of declining sales. Technology  is lacking thus creating a more complicated process for the consumer at check-out.  I joined the company five years ago when it was still a family owned business and the culture was about the people. Since being bought out by an outside company the culture has completely changed.
good,I think that Belk  should pay their employees more for the work that they do. I don't think they should push so hard for employees to get credit application because there hard to get. I think you should get better encentives during the holidays.
good,"I worked there for almost 4 years. The people that I worked with made my job better. The duties that were required of you were not unbearable, but at times you were unable to accomplish all of them. quite a few times we were understaffed. This made work harder. The overall atmosphere was good. You stayed busy most days. My experience wasn't bad when I worked at Belk. I just felt like I wasn't up to my best potential working there. So I found something better."
good,"If you are in the Office, are Management or are Full Time it is better.  I am not used to Retail and if you are Part Time you are never guaranteed hours.  I would think it would be better if they had set schedules for full time and used Part Time for nights and weekends or fill ins."
good,The management at my particular location was come and go. I loved working with customers. Hardest part of retail is the hours. Holiday hours for me became excessive.
good,when loading there was not any lacking had coworkers who did anything would not even bring my load where they supposed to and management was horrible was not respectful.
good,When I first started at Belk I loved it. But recently the store manager has lied to me twice. Some of the managers don't appreciate their workers. The workers down stairs all they do is have drama
good,"Management was constantly changing and so were policies. I would say, make sure you're on time, and don't upset upper management. One may be reprimanded for things twice and on purpose. The company as a whole has its pro's and con's."
good,I left because I was not put on the schedule for 3 weeks straight. Money is good but its only seasonal. No room for advancement or growth. Department mangers are generally helpful.
good,The managers were really cool. I took to one manager especially. She cared about her employees and never hesitated to show it. She had a natural balance of compassion and discipline. The only reason I left Belk was because I found a better paying job. If the pay was better I'd probably still be there now. It was such a pleasant environment.
good,"i didn't like how they lied to the seasonal workers who were chosen and told us we were coming aboard to work and cut us loose. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,"A typical day at work would be very steady great atmosphere, and everyone is friendly. Management was okay, but I also think Belk's managers should be more organized."
good,it's not a job for full time work unless your going into management.  The average hours per week for keep down to 20-25.  Part time is all you'll give.
good,"The job was good. I LOVED my customers so much!!! What I hated, unfortunately, were the managers. There were times when things were out of my control but they would still blame me for it."
good,"The benefits at Belk are good, work flexibility changed with the new management.  The work place environment can get hectic with the micromanagement style."
good,"enjoyed working here management could have cared less and my immediate boss had no respect for me due to my age"
good,"The job is consistent and helps you learn better customer service skills, as well as the ins and outs of how retail stores operate and manage people and products. "
good,"I think that with any retail job you definitely feel more worked than the actual pay that you are bringing home.  During the holidays, don't expect to see your family, make sure you wear comfy shoes throughout the whole year.  Management is not all on the same page half of the time, one manager will tell you one thing, while the next contradicts everything that was said initially.  Co-workers are great though, probably because everyone feels each other's pain, lol.  Management expects you to do for them(come in early, pick up someone's shift, get item locators and credits) but when the time comes for them to do for you(adjust shifts, go home early because you aren't feeling well) they hold it over your head and you aren't properly recognized for the hard work that is done."
good,"A new sheriff is in town.  No longer a family company, a private equity company is restructuring, streamlining and downsizing.  The hardest part of the job is not knowing the direction."
good,"I love the people I work with. However, the work is tedious and tiring without remorse. I can barely afford to feed myself. I'm fortunate enough to have my home provided free of charge, or I would be homeless. It's a good job for a student looking for spending cash. As a career, I wouldn't recommend this job."
good,"I love a work life balance work place. with stability, job security and room for growth. Belk does not provide any of the above. I have learnt patience is the way forward and continue to excercise patience."
good,"Customer Service skills improved. A typical day at work would be checking out customers, returns, exchanges, difficult customers. We are required to open as many credits as possible. We are required to place as many orders as possible. This company expects too much from their employees. Scheduling is a constant problem that not only affects the clients but the employees as well. Although employees can become stressed with so much that is asked for my Area supervisor understands and has creating a bonding team that no other manager has done."
good,"This job requires to much responsibility and not enough pay. I was overworked and underpaid. The hours were not bad, shifts lasted 3 to 8 hours."
good,As hard as I worked for belk in the last 8 yrs it didn't pay off.I went beyond and and above my duties and still was only making 11.65 per hr after 8 yrs it was time to do something elese.
good,"My first ""real"" job. It was fun, yet hard work.      .                                   .                                                                      ."
good,"The work was hard but fun and rewarding, the leadership skills of management was poor and made for a poor working experience."
good,it was a nice place to work but they did not appreciates good employees .the discount was great especially when we had sales. I love most off the people and customers i had the pleasure of meeting.
good,"Your time is spent running from task to task. Difficult to delegate and manage your time. Little control over schedule of your employees, no interviewing for your open positions, Your a dealt your employees and are  unable to choose who you grow within your departments. Day to day heavy merchandising, recovery can be difficult with very low staffing. Job duty's include leading staff, merchandising, planning sales event goals, planing individual events, goaling, training, opening and closing store, Leading credit, Leaading online sales, etc."
good,"Although I learned more about sales and sharpening my communication skills, the management was rude and did not want to help resolve conflicts beyond the employees reach. If you needed them to override a return error or any error at all they would either refuse and leave us with the angry customers, or they would berate you over the phone and take 30-40 minutes to come to your post. Helping customers find shoes for their wardrobe was fulfilling especially when they would make recurring visits and only want your assistance."
good,"This job dives headfirst into the customer service world. I learned everything I needed to know about how to interact with people, how to sell, and how to maintain a professional demeanor. My co-workers have become long-term friends that I'm grateful to have met. Management was the only thing that irked me and several other associates. Several of the department managers were great, but the store manager was very unprofessional. After over two years and three Black Fridays, I had to resign due to schedule conflicts."
good,"checked out customers, cleaned my work area most of the day, and stood at the door to make sure no one stole anything. I did returns and inventory to."
good,"This company employs a lot of temporary employees.  It is a production base environment where you work as a put-a-away, order selector or packer associate.  Most of the time Order Selector and Put-away associates can drive a Pack-Mule to make selecting orders and stocking merchandise easier.  Ladders are required to select and stock merchandise."
good,"Belk has a great customer service policy and wants to please their customers. "
good,"Fun place to work most of the time. Timely breaks, Nice people to work with. The hardest part of the job is when the line stops and backs up. The Cons is its more seasonal than fulltime."
good,Challenging role in staffing and maintaining a working relation with all levels of associates. Maintaining a balance between schedule needs to insure all sales plans are met within budgetary constraints
good,"this may be best place to work in Charlotte , well known historic company. being a well known brand in south, this is a family owned company and it takes care of people very well."
good,A typical day would include cleaning dressing rooms and putting back clothing. Talking to customers and checking them out. Management can be better. Most enjoyable are the loyal customers that return and meeting new people.
good,"-	Building personal customer relationships."
good,"I did not work here long, so I do not have a full understanding of Belk operates. My co-workers were very friendly ; most of them were older women, so we did not have much in common. The clientele was older, more mature people as opposed to my current job where the majority of customers are teens and people in their twenties."
good,The management team worked as a whole and gave great incentive to me to replicate their professionalism. Transparent communication and availability is truly at the center of creating a results at Belk. The customer is put first.
good,"A day at the mall, I clock-in, clean, straighten up areas."
good,"A typical day at work would depend on the season. If it was shopping season, then overall the store was busy. I learned a lot for the duration that I worked here. I learned tips and technics on skin care, makeup and product knowledge. The management was uncertain and unorganized. In 6 months, I had 3 different managers. My co-worker were great. The hardest part of the job would have been working on base and commission, because everybody would pounce on the customer. The enjoyable part of the job was meeting all the interesting people."
good,"Typical day at work would include décor of the store. I enjoy decorating and customer service, however I was not impressed with the management. The hardest part about my job was the heavy lifting of ladders and equipment."
good,"I did like this job. I really liked helping the customers and building relationships with them. I enjoyed the other sales associates. They made the job fun. However, the managers there did not seem to appreciate their employees."
good,"cleaning out fitting room"
good,"I was a fish out of water. I had little fashion knowledge or experience, so this was not a good fit for me."
good,Not compensated for the many hats that you wear. Love the company though.
good,"Every since I started in 2010,I worked my tail off doing everything that was asked of me with no problem,but as time went on after the big change that I played a big part in ( good change ) I started being lied to and neglected. Its cool though cause GOD got me. Im not here to tear them down cause Im thankful,but there need to be another change at the one in Oxford,MS"
good,"Supportive Upper Management team, but the Store Managers have limited accountability, so they handle day to day operations the way he/she wants too without regard to policy/procedures.   This is retail, so expect the hours to constantly change and a horrible work/life balance."
good,"The receiving team I worked with was my second family. My manager   accepted my inexperience and was able to turn it around into many things, such as punctuality, dedication and even social skills that I use in my professional and personal life."
good,"A typical day at work is very stressful for me, being responsible for so much with little or no help at all. However, I learned a lot from working at Belk. It really is a nice place to work, but I have been there for 5 years and still I can not make enough money to live on my own. It is very difficult to work you're way up in this company. My co-workers are very friendly and some are hard working people like me, but there are those few who really don't care and only show up to collect a check and show lack of care for this company. I believe if everyone was a team player and worked at their full potential this really would be an excellent place to work for. The hardest part about my job is being the only person on the sales floor with no overlap, which can be very difficult when you are faced with a work load of things to do and trying to take care of your customers in the best way you can. Also trying to find someone to fill in for you're lunch break. The most enjoyable part about my job is the wonderful experience I get when taking care of my customers. I love what I do and I am very good at what I do. I just wish the scheduling system was set up a little better, and I wish they paid you for what you're worth. Management is wonderful and will gladly assist you in whatever you need help with."
good,liked job but had alot of late night hours with 2 small children. The employees i worked with were great. everyone got along fine. Enjoyed working in the fine jewelry department because of the jewelry. It was an easy job to do. Liked meeting all the customers and the people I worked with.
good,I was able to balance my work/life schedule quite well with this position. My coworkers were friendly and management was solid.
good,OK place too work if you life retail hours are not bad and mgt is good
good,I enjoyed this job as well. Some good and bad to this job. one co-worker made it easier for me to let the job go. I loved the people I met and stocking new merchandise.
good,Oversee daily department operations and provide strategic leadership & motivation to a customer-focused staff. Work directly alongside the Area Manager and Store Manager to implement process improvements and develop effective sales strategies to increase department sales. Liaise between customers and management. Partner with upper management to resolve escalated and complex customer issues.
good,Focus is on sales rather than the customer.  Leave little room for personal growth.  Few opportunities to showcase talent.  Mediocre job.
good,"Taught me a lot, but extensive travel grew tiresome. A great job for a starting employee"
good,"management doesn't care about employees, customers are rude"
good,A typical day at work starts with outlined duties for each department but on most days this doesn't happen which can sometimes be a bother due to the lack of consistency due to management.
good,Putting our merchandise in a limited amount of time and space. Learned patience dealing with customers. Management was changed mulitple times in each department. Hardest part of the job was maintaining cleanleness of departments while assisting customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers with finding what they wanted most.
good,"As a department store, work was pretty normal. Working in men;s clothing you tried to fill the customers needs and find the perfect fit. I learned to tailor and develop that special client oriented customer service relationship to keep the customer coming back, looking for you. I also learned the importance of keeping a customer data base."
good,I do like to work there just me being the only person in that department my manager promised me $10/hr but i only receive $8.30/hr which the job requires alot so thats not enough pay other than that the job is fine
good,busy sometimes hectic fast pace at times like helping someone find what that person is looking for style color my co workers were good to be around.management pennys has gone thru quite a bit never really got to know any of them the hardest part of the job was commision sometimes it can be cut throat the most enjoyable part of of the job was being busy helping someone what i learn was shoe style brand names i like talking to people when i do a carry out i
good,I learned alot from working at Belk...most of it was very good. Customer Service was the first and main focus of the company. I loved all of the people I worked with.
good,"Typical work day whether I'm opening or closing is to open/close registers, reach a daily opening of credit goal process transactions and provide great customer service to our customers who are shopping with us. I've learned better customer service skills working at Belk since I deal directly with them. The management at Belk is fair, we each have our own Manager per department. The hardest part of my job isn't really hard, whatever I don't know I learn and everyone is willing to help everyone. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we are busy. When the store is busy I stay busy."
good,"Belk is a great store. They train you very well, but at times they can be very patronizing."
good,"Most companies are going to have snags here and there with their management. There was definitely that and some practices, such as repremanding some associates on the floor in front of others, that I completely disagree with. Over all though, the experience was better and things (schedule not included) were much more consistant. They also do seem to try more than most other dept stores to offer small incentives & encouragement to reach specific goals (candy bars, games, etc.). However, hrs and days that were supposed to be set, were seldom accurate and often changed. The schedules were very often messed up and had to be redone leading to further frustrations and confusion. They also had a lot of black out dates at the time. Also, the bickering btwn the shoe dept and cosmetics was crazy. Just be aware of that should you choose to work there. Again, if you're looking for a dept store, I'd recommend Belk over many of the others."
good,This place has its ups and down. Customers are racist and some are just evil. However I love the work I do and my managers are ok. They haven't given me any bad vibes thus far. I pray they remain the same. The work is easy and right now it's the best job I have ever had.
good,"When I was at Belk, they paid on the low side and no matter the size of the transaction, if you didn't have a credit card applicant, they asked why not?"
good,"I have learned to be more open on the professional,when speaking to others,very diverse,listen,teamplayer,enjoy  being helpful as a ateamworking  with others"
good,No opportunity to become full-time. Mostly part-time jobs available. No benefits. Flexible hours. Great atmosphere & work environment. Never get 30-40 hours. Perfect as a 2nd job.
good,"Typical retail.. never enough payroll to take care of task.... Management not easy to work with.... Their way or no way!  Company overall had some Wonderful,  encouraging people."
good,I was a processing associate part-time.  Job could be hectic and space was limited in the back. Some days were better than others. Just comes with the territory.
good,"I learned about customer service, open credit, pricing , markdown and,  shipping. "
good,"Working at Belk taught me great customer service, overall it was a great place to work although, over the years the scheduling hours changed which made it hard to maintain a healthy home situation."
good,Scarce work.  No steady work hours. When there is work. Not enough workers to complete the production goal. Overworked. I will more likely not return.
good,"not enough hours to do my job hours are always being cut back, was promised at hire at least 15 hours a week never did get what I was promised I have nothing else to say!"
good,"Need more hours, not everyone works in their own dept. to get their own job done.  A lot of complaining from the employees. A lot of employees chooses not to do their job and expect everyone to help them to theirs."
good,"When working at this environment, it has it perks but then didn’t doesn’t. When starting out of high school yes, it’s a good job to start with but to rise up in career wise I don’t recommend it to anyone. In fact, since now the management changed its a bit harder to have an easier flow."
good,Belk is an OK place to work part-time. The long term employees who have been there 15+ years were making less than $2 an hour more than I was. There is no room for advancement if you are hired as a salesperson. Constant dogging about email capture and credit apps makes your work life miserable.
good,Being own by private equity is different than working for a retailer that is a public company.  Profit dollars are desired over top line sale and/or marketshare.
good,They emphasize customer service. Must be able to balance the cash register. Must be willing to ask customers if you can assist them or order something for them that is not in the store. Opening Belk credit cards is important.
good,"It’s a classic retail job. You have to deal with needy customers while worrying about making your sales goal, keeping the store clean, and any other projects your managers leave you."
good,Belk is a great place to work if you discount a few things. For example poor leadership and management. The workplace culture has turn toxic. Things were being said by those in charge that should not have been said.  The hardest thing about the job was finding places to put freight. The most enjoyable was seeing happy customers. Would go back under new management.
good,I learned about sale goals and how to work with fellow employees to accomplish daily job duties. I also learned how to provide good costumer service. Overall Belks is okay job and relatively easy most stressful part of the job is meeting the sales goals.
good,The company was a great company but I felt like it was not helpful by some of their employees as much as they were helping others.  Wanted to advance couldn’t get a raise but I worked in polo hard so I was able to get bonuses.
good,"Overall its good, good people, good management, its just my dream to work for the Bank, because I have a bachelor degree of Economics, I would love to work for financial company."
good,"I worked in the fine jewelry department and was promised a pay increase and more morning hours. This did not happen"
good,It was a good working enviroment the hardest part about the job was trying  to ask customers to sign up for a credit cards.. you got to meet a lot nice people
good,"This was definitely the best job I've had in retail so far. I loved that I got to dress how wanted ( while sticking to company dress code), and I got to help customers shop for jewlery, clothing, shoes, etc. Though I loved the job, I just couldn't tolerate the store manager at the time. Due to him people constantly quit since he felt that he should always come before the customers. It even got to the point where he would yell and disrespect employees in front of customers. Belk should really be more careful about who they trust to run their stores, especially when the person has the potential to go on a huge power trip. Otherwise Belk will always have trouble hanging on to their employees."
good,No team environment. Great environment for sales associates but upper management has poor communication and no mentoring. No Room for advancement without a degree
good,I was harassed by my department manager and the store manager defended my department manager. I reported it to the harassment line but nothing became of it so I took FMLA and eventually quit.
good,"Sycamore Partners bought out the family owned Belk two years ago.  Some business practices have been made to improve the bottom line.  Unfortunately, this is accomplished in part by reducing the number of full time employees with benefits and overall number of employees on the selling floor. It is difficult to give the customers the service they deserve. Customers often complain they are unable to find an associate to check them out. Scheduling is atrocious. At times the schedule is changed in the current work week without notifying the associates.  The new management has a lot of opportunities for improvements. Employees are generally dissatisfied...but they need the job."
good,"I've been with Belk HQ almost a year and still have no clue as to what I'm supposed to do. My immediate manager NEVER checks on me and doesn't give me or her other direct reports clear direction when we have special projects or important meeting we need to prepare for. Management has their ""favs"" and the workload is unrealistic unless you're a salaried employee. Belk does offer general training classes their systems but the information given in the training is generic and you're still completely lost after the training classes. SOME of the people are helpful, most aren't. Some look at you like you're an idiot when you ask questions or need help understanding something."
good,"very strict on goal meeting and getting credits"
good,"Associates mostly stay to themselves unless they really need your help. Management has changed since I started working at Belk the first manager was excellent the second manager which is there now, is not good at all."
good,"very enjoyable job if you want to work somewhere, if your looking to pay bills full time is no more then 32 hours. also if management is told to cut hours the work load piles up and you can get a minimum of 6 hours per week."
good,"bad general manager. Low pay... not enough to pay the bills for a family. Wish the experience was better, but it could have been much much worse I guess."
good,"While some of my ratings are provided based on my specific work environment, other groups such as buyers, merchants, etc. appear to be much more engaging and fostering of a positive experience."
good,"I was in the pick as put wall at first, taking items out of containers and putting them in cubby holes. Then I was moved to buffering where I stacked boxes off a line from a truck"
good,When I first started the job place was a nice place to work. Once our manager changed then the whole department changed and everyone felt like from day to day if the manager did not like you then you may not have a job the next day.
good,"Working at Belk was a very discouraging job. It was never anything different. When you went in to work, it was the same thing never any type of excitement."
good,The typical day is assisting costumers and making sure they have a wonderful experience at the store! I learned a lot from co-workers about relentless customer service.
good,"Like several retail brands, Belk is also experiencing growing pains.  I am confident that they will find a strong leadership and development team in the future to lead the way."
good,worked full time hours but not getting full time pay as a part time worker never got a raise for good performance and hard work always got looked over as a hard worker.
good,The job is not a complicated one and is rewarding in and of itself however at the time I was employed the company was in the middle of switching managers which led to the job becoming more stressful than it was when I was first hired.
good,This was  part time job I enjoyed working with the employees who at the time were like a family. Over time things changed and the work environment became difficult to accomplish task.
good,"No response. I enjoyed the early years. Now, the scheduling is bad. Sometimes don't get a lunch. If you don't get enough sales and credit apps, you get a pay cut."
good,"Belk has changed over the years, but mostly since the new company buyout. There are a lot of great things happening, however, there is no company loyalty anymore with seasoned employees. New hires can come in with little to no experience and be in high-standing positions. Also, many of the influential employees have since-been ""retired"" or left the company."
good,"A typical day was consists of running merchandise on the floor, make sure counter is clean from previous night,make sure you greet customers.I think we were under staff, not enough people. It was hard keeping employees because of how the dept was being kept. The hardest part of the job was the up keep of the dept. Management was not around when you needed help on busy days, especially when people did not show up for work. The enjoyable part of working there were the people. Some of them were employees and some were customers."
good,Typical customer service job. Check out customers and help them find the merchandise they are looking for. The more customers you check out the more likely you are to get a raise. Not enough room to put out all you stock you have and management can be tough to deal with at times.
good,"Most co-workers and management were great and some weren't so great. The average day as a sales associate was filled with talking to customers and folding clothes. The most difficult thing about working there is filling time during dead hours, and the most enjoyable thing about it is conversing with your co-workers. Overall, it's a decent job."
good,"Great environment, room for advancement if you are the right/liked person. As a new hire I found my job stable and exciting, job stability has decreased over the years."
good,"For anyone in the retail industry, you have got to love helping people and love the art of sales to enjoy the job. Most retail jobs are going to expect you to work during holidays and nights and weekends are typically required so it is probably not for you if you are looking for a job where you can be home everynight with your babies or off on holidays. But I love the products at Belk so I was able to stand behind them when selling them so it makes the job enjoyable. Turnover at my store was slow so it was extremely hard to get from part time to full time to get benefits which is frustrating and ultimately why I left. Expect a slow climb of the ladder if you decide to make them a career."
good,"I learned the proper way of customer service through training software programs and hands on experience. Working at Belk in a department store had it's ups and downs but overall it was a good part time job, not a job you would want to make a career out of but pretty good money and flexible hours if your a full time student."
good,Working at Belk was a good overall experience but there was little room for growth. Hardest part was not being compensated for all work being asked to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning all aspects of the business through visual merchandising.
good,"My typical day would be to come in listen to meeting, count my cash drawer and then begin to organize my work area. When customers arrive i am pushed to have them sign up for a credit card, order something, or put something on hold depending on what specials are being held for that week. Management is not in favor of the employees, meaning we the employees are instructed to give out certain information upon our best intuition and when we do that and a customer complains we are made to look stupid in front of the customer, as if the information we gave was incorrect. There is no team work or support from management and we the store numbers go down they began to threaten our jobs, so we are forced to make customers purchase."
good,Not a bad job just need to be managed a little better and associates should be more of a teamplayer. Management should be more involved with associates
good,"This job is amazing, management is interesting. This job is what you make it, seems cool. The benefits are amazing and the schedule is kind of hectic but the job is great"
good,"Creating a great team and teaching them that  great customer service and Building every day clients is  number 1.  It's all about sales and finding ways to acomplish your goals through events,etc. Also understanding as a manager that you can't please everyone when it come to making the schedule. Lead by example.  Stocking,flexibility and inventory just to name a few is also part of the job. Multi tasking is very important In Retail.  Overall a great experience!"
good,"This is the first job I've ever worked for that had Very little to no training on floor and in the job position, they relied solely on the computer training even though I'd never held a position in that expertise before. Upper management needs to work on better communication and possibly being open to he rest of the teams ideas and opinions, it's painfully clear that none of the management is on the same page. There is rarely any coverage in areas causing the employees that are there two work 5x's harder. Overall, not a very supportive team."
good,I enjoyed my time at Belk. I was on Operations side where there is little room for advancement. There is much more room on store side but It was a good company with good benefits and job security.
good,Most of the people there are nice just don't really have much opportunity to get a lot of hours or advance. The managers are all nice. They try to work with you on your schedule.
good,Very demanding job for little pay. No room for advancement and management is not the best. The CEO and other top executives care very little for their team members.
good,"This company is trying to do more with less. As a  manager, they need more associate support, The poor associates on the floor are responsible for large amounts of area to maintain. Store Manager is great to get in and help, its the corporate people that have no idea what the store level does on a day in day out basis. The pay is good for management, but when you divide it by the hours you put in, its not that good. There is no work life balance."
good,The Support Team and I work well together to get the tasks done in the allotted time and the challenges we face bring new ideas for a quicker and easier process. Management trusts me with the Operations Team Manager's(OTM) tasks assigned to me and I enjoy having a variety of tasks to do each day.
good,they could have had better management...people were not happy working a lot of hours sometimes and didn't kno when they would have a day off
good,"long "
good,"not much to say on this job."
good,Belk has wonderful benefits and takes care of their associates in that aspect. Has generous discounts.  I've been in 2 different locations with this company and the first one had better communication.  Enjoy a lot of the associates I work with.
good,"Belk has recently been acquired and is no longer a family owned company, so it remains to be seen how things will play out in the near and long term.  However, in the lead up to the sale of the company many things changed and the company lost the ""family"" feel to it that attracted me to it.  Just an opinion, but it seems to have become much more ""corporate""."
good,"Very little to no chance of promotion among the sales associates; they prefer to hire new college grads or those already with management experience. All reviews are number based with no emphasis on how the employee preforms with customers, maintaining a department, product knowledge or loyalty. Changes are often made on how it will save the company money and not on how it will effect business. Management likes for employees to ""have the power"" so they do not have to be bothered as often, leaving the employees to deal with disgruntled customers. When a customer absolutely insists on seeing a manager, the managers often get upset that the employee called them."
good,"On a typical day as dock lead I would open the building check my emails, receive truck deliveries, unload, unpack, and security tag clothing received, stock the store, price check/manage, customer service."
good,Great employees that work there and Clinique takes care of there employees. Fair with scheduling. Good atmosphere to work in with great customers.
good,A typical day is opening registers and helping customers. I learned how to do markdowns and set sales for the next day. Most of the managers were somewhat helpful when it came to certain tasks. I enjoyed working with most of my co-workers and most of my co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was learning how to deal with unpleasant customers. I enjoyed working with my very friendly co-workers the most.
good,To much work to do in so little hours to do them all. To unload the trucks with limited hours and man power. Do having enough schedule manpower in order to complete the trucks in a timely matter.
good,"I am not sure how other Belk's are ran but mine went to heck in just one week. At the beginning of the year we were told that Belk was being sold but that thing would remain as they were. In late August it was announced to the public about the buy out. The next day, the store manager was fired. Nobody knew why. So all the other managers were scared about losing their jobs. This is where it went to heck. They were writing up the employees for anything. If your car broke down or you got in a accident and you were supposed to work, then you had better find a way there or you'd get written up. And they used the excuse that 'It's retail'. RETAIL IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO TREAT PEOPLE LIKE TRASH."
good,"A typical day in my workplace, consist of me setting up and opening up registers. Being involved in a lot of cash handling was a daily process. Mornings consist of sale setting and organization. As lead sales of the department my job was to insure the best customer service as well as to make sure Inventory was counted and that items were being merchandised correctly. Merchandise had to be processed and documented and reported to the area manager. "
good,Good or Bad? Depends on management. Hours are crazy! Pay is okay. Not the worst job in the world. But not my dream job. Just thankful to be employed. I guess its all in what you make it.
good,"A pretty nice place to work. Co workers were nice, most of the managers were wonderful to work for!"
good,"A typical day starts with a sales plan and highlights the good and the bad going on in the store from credit to customer service. Than helping customers and cleaning fitting rooms. "
good,typical day consist of calling customers and booking for events or pre-selling. get sign ups for credit cards if you want to be on the good side of management. otherwise beware they will be on you every hour until you get one or put you on display in front of the store  to solicit to people walking by. i loved working in the cosmetic world and when you have to solicit credit cards it will take away from what you really are there for. i learned very quickly to get credit goal in early in the week so that way i wouldn't have to be in front of the store on display. also l learned very quickly upper management had favorites and if you didn't play along you was an outsider. the co- workers for the most part were nice to get along with. but as any workplace there is always those few that makes it not so nice place to work(the favorites). along with the favorites came gossip. enough said. the hardest part of the job would be weather or not your comfortable cold calling or clienteling. i most enjoying expanding my makeup artist skills and meeting new people and the gratis. gift time was stressful but the commission was worth it.
good,"In any retail business it is a team effort to make the store work as a whole. When customers can complement your entire department for a great overall experience, then you know that your work is not in vain."
good,"I loaded and unloaded trucks,processed all the merchandise,helped cashiers when they needed help,painted walls,changed light bulbs in store and did inventory of merchandise in store. the co-workers were nice and helped you when u needed help.The hardest part of the job was the trucks. Anyone that has worked in receiving would tell you the same thing. The most enjoyable part was that we did so many different jobs that it didn't feel like you were doing the same job over and over everyday."
good,"Deliver an exceptional customer service experience, while maintaining and achieving daily sales and credit goals. Increase"
good,Good place to work. Sometimes get to do challenging work but not always.
good,"Assist customers in purchasing clothing and accessories."
good,"Ops team goes in very early, love that! Ops is very hard work and we are WAY underpaid for it! Our Ops team managers are GREAT! Department managers are not so great! Everyone wants to be in charge but nobody wants to take responsibility for anything! Love the customers!  Love most of my co-workers!"
good,very strong on SPH and dress codes would be very hard to make sales til end of season markdown unless you stepped on other toes most of tyhe time it was nice to get good sales and going home.
good,"Greet my team players have a morning meeting. Key orders for product placed for new customer and existing customers."
good,"It's not very easy to advance in this company. However I've learned how to increase my sales, how to approach customers and what to say so they're free to ask questions. Each day I assist customers with items selections, questions or concerns."
good,I like the job alot you get to help out those who need help with the fashion world
good,Each day consists of satisfying customer needs and working as a team to reach personal and departmental goals
good,"It's a great work environment, but you are not appreciated."
good,Store management at our store was terrible. Managers would pop up and spy on you from the loss prevention camera room to check up on you and babysit you and make you do things not in your job description like change light bulbs and fix terminal electronics.
good,"A typical day at work for me is coming in making my goal in sales and trying to make my goal in credit apps for the week. I also have to make sure my department is straight. I also I have to do stock when it comes in, markdowns when we have them. I have a lot of responsibilities. I have great co-workers. I get along with all of them. The hardest part of the job for me is trying to get my goal for credit apps. I seem to struggle in that perspective. The most ejoyable part of the job is the people I work with are fun. Management, I think, is terrible.I feel like they don't appreciate what all you do. I feel like we get underpaid for everything they expect us to do. We only get raises if we meet sales and credit. That's hard when you have everything else you have to do."
good,Belk is a place that you can get along with coworker and focus on your customers about sale products and suggest about clothes and jewelries that match with their items.
good,Make sure you made your daily goal and sold credit apps.I worked with some really nice people.I learned that sales is a cut throat job and dont take it personal when someone stills your sales.The most enjoyable part was working with great people.
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in doing your assigned job. I've learned how to multi task between different departments. Management was not so nice, the ladies were definitely focused on credit card goals mainly. Hardest part of the job was the selling of credit cards. The most enjoyable part of my job was selling and educating people on shoes."
good,Good company that continues to adjust to survive in hard retail times. Groth potential very minimal as there continue to be reduction in field positions and a limited number of stores in just the “South”
good,"I have no comment at this time about this company.  "
good,"Very quick to turn on you if you break a ""policy"" even if others are breaking the same policy. You have to be very careful with what you say to anyone, someone is always out to get you at this company. Even HR isn't someone you can trust in this company."
good,"I worked for this department store, for three long, long years. When I started it was a pleasant place and then later it became a Different Place."
good,"This store was good, but corporate greed is cutting in to moral. the wages are not great, and hard to get full time if it is not on the sales floor. great staff at this store."
good,"Fast paced environment begins with morning meeting motivating and laying out expectations for the day. Daily task manager followed. from corporate, checking at least 3 times daily.  Was able to form great relationships with co-workers.  As Manager on Duty constantly putting out fires. Great customer relationships build along the way."
good,College job that helped out with school for the extent of my employment working there. Learned a lot about the internal function of a brick mortar clothing store and how bif business runs from a retail level on a  day to day basis. Gained knowledgeable skills that Is still use today.
good,"Our Belk Store is located in an abandoned mall, which was supposed to begin renovation three years ago.  So far, the bulldozers have not arrived.  Our plumbing is failing and our roof is leaking.  Our managers are very brave and continue to serve our customers; however, the ""handwriting is on the wall"". Closure is going to happen.  I need to seek other employment."
good,It was ok. I didn’t like that I was a full time employee and part time employees were getting more hours then I would get almost every week. That’s the reason I left
good,Always follow you 5 steps in all circumstances. Stay competitive and dont get discouraged. Analys every case to detail. Be prepared to work long hours during the holidays.
good,"Staffing is usually the biggest problem. The workload is more than they provide hours, associate appreciation would go a long way for the employees. High turnover."
good,Not a bad place to work for someone who is willing to get moved around to different departments than what you were originally applied for. Very goal oriented and mission driven each day.
good,I enjoyed being apart of the belk crew if I could go back and get the hours I need I’ll most definitely go back. Nothing was hard at belk besides the managers.
good,Over whelmed with task no help with big projects. Not good pay for the work they expect from you. I have been there over a decade and some people make more than me. Drama between managers. No training.
good,"We did a lot of freight. Once freight was finished, we assisted in other areas as needed. Never sales. It was always sales-support. At the time I was there, we started our shift at 5:30am. I liked getting off early, but the early mornings were difficult."
good,"I like my position at Belk but like most retail companies it is constantly changing  to keep up with the ever changing retail climate. My position was re-located from the field, back to corporate based and at this current time in my life, I am not re-locatable."
good,I worked at Belk for two years and I'm thankful for the opportunity I was given. I learned to connect with my customers and grow in retail knowledge!!
good,"Belk has a great work environment and the people you work with are friendly. As far as advancing career wise, it can be pretty quick. It all depends on how much you want it"
good,Take out trash clean breakroom bathrooms dressing rooms offices mirrors doors sweep vacuumed strip and waxed floors. Dusted removed clothes hangers and merchandise sensors.
good,"Worked as seasonal worker in receiving department.  Scheduled to work less than 4 hour shifts (seems to be a Belk unique schedule), 3 to 4 days per week.  Dusty and dirty environment and a very cramped space.  Did not seem to be a workflow system to move product to the floor in a timely manner (different people did that from the receivers), so the receiving area was jammed with merchandise.  Manager seemed to find other things to do when shipments came in, but came by occasionally to encourage us to worker faster.  No drinking fountains available, so you had to bring your own water."
good,"I haven't worked here for a year, so take this as you will. During the spring and summer months trucks slow, which means you will only be getting about one to two days a week of work."
good,"With this job I was able to brighten my customer service skills, as well as learn the merchandise that Belk sales. However the managers sometime are not on one accord when they come to you explaining a task that they want to be done."
good,I enjoyed it. Great pay during the holidays. My coworkers were great. Did a lot of floor moves and sign changing. That’s what comes with working in support.
good,The manager started making changes with out receiving new scanbers first which I think is the first priority and the position I was in needed extra help n didn't receive it.
good,Other sales people in my department are good to work with. Manager staff is easy to work with. It's a well lit and clean place. Can be hard to get times off once schedule has been set
good,"When I started, I loved work.  We had fun and were like a family, the management worked alongside us and challenged us as well as trained us.  There were far more opportunities for internal career advancements.  Under the new management, the bottom-line rules, they seek outside the company for management-type jobs.  It is no longer a fun place to work and is very stressful.  There are even times when part-time employees receive more working hours than full-time employees."
good,"The store is great, The company just lacks in allocation hours to where they are needed. Difficult to move up with the company and pay is lower than competitors."
good,Management at the time was a bit out of wack. Do workers were stressed and didn’t know what was going on half the time. Got worse when holidays got closer.
good,In the shoe department where i was located we kept track of every shoe in store and made sure it was in the right place. Also i maintained and operated a cash register.
good,Belk has a typical retail work environment. There are opportunities for temporary and seasonal employment. Hours can vary widely depending on overall company performance.
good,Not very sure on how to review this company. I would not go back into management with them based on my poor experience with their restructuring that I was vastly affected by. The regional manager lacked honesty and integrity.
good,Was a very great place to work at good climate managers was alright an showed u respect love when it was peek season they would give away prizes an the hrs increase
good,"I love the customer service industry. Team members are like family."
good,"Each day was always the same. We would gather around the middle of the store for our daily sales meeting and then go back to our assigned areas. We would walk around the area, facing and straightening our area and asking customers if they needed help finding anything. The pay and advancement was poor though so it wasn't a smart choice for a long term career."
good,"I used to work as  sales associate for 5 month they changed 3 store managers. People comes and goes. Plus when it's management each one trying to bring something new. So it's hard to adopt. Anyway they best part it's crew, they are always positive. Pay low. 9 $"
good,More hours help the  truck unloaded the scary thing that I was moving around Thursday to recover quicker make sure the customers are treated right work hard
good,"This company is fine."
good,A typical day would start by getting up on time and getting myself ready for work and when  I need to be at work.  Doing all duties and getting along with others. Willing and eager to learn new tasks and think out of the box. Having responsibility. I like my work place to be friendly and getting along with others. Working together as a team. Hardest thing of my job at times is not being taken as serious and often times being doubted by others when I know myself I can perform the duties accordingly. Enjoyable on the job is when you'd told how much your appreciated when you're not excepting to hear it.
good,"Overall, I would have to say my favorite part about my very limited run at Belk while working there over the holidays was management. I didn't care for the culture of the store at all. It was denoted as one of the largest  grossing stores in the entire district, but it certainly didn't feel that way throughout the shift. I spent more time arguing and defending myself against other employees and having to remind vendors that they're there to assist, if at all possible, but not to try and tell you that you're not doing your job or in any way micromanage your selling habits. The vendors were not really every given any executive check by the manager in my department, but otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed working there. Most of the staff, specifically outside my department were all very sweet and welcoming. Management was great, but they just need to learn ways to combat the verbal assault from most of their employees in a much more productive manner that will allow them to reach the goals they want to reach for the store rather than be weighted down by a small group of overly talkative and unprofessional ""team players"" that are about as daunting as a school of great white sharks."
good,"Since the company was sold, the company has gone down. Schedules are never out in time, they expect more from you, pay isn't worth it. Manager are poor, they don't follow what they say and not enough employees."
good,It was my first job and a long time ago.
good,"In my opinion Belk was a pretty okay establishment when I first started working there. Over the course of the year and the change of management , My love for Belk decreased. The hours were okay but they were not fixed, the schedule was often change."
good,Most of the time you are fixing the clothes that the customers have dropped around or checked them out. Around the holiday season it super busy and you will not get time off for the holidays. It an alright place to work at a first job or something but you can't go up the ladder.
good,Great co-workers. Company doesn’t provide a good work/life balance. Benefits continue to get more expensive for less care. At review time company looks more at categories to place people in rather than individual accomplishments.
good,the airport would be lenient with when it comes to background checks. I have a simple battery misdemeanor from about 3yrs back and I did put this information on the application so I was hoping to gets some positive feed bck on this issue to easy my mind. I really want this job opportunity. ( I hated that Job)
good,"Good place to work and security good managers, and nice people  "
good,Got hired on as a seasonal worker. Entire team showed little enjoyment in the workplace. Hours would fluctuate from week to week with no set schedule. Not my favorite.
good,The staff here were always welcoming to other employees and customers. Most workers had a smile on their face 24/7 while in the building. They knew when to joke around and when to be serious.
good,This position was seasonal and the labor was not bad at all. I loved the people I worked with and loved the discounts during the holidays.They were not flexible around holiday days off.
good,It gets really busy when they have good sales other than that business can be slow. They feed their employees around the holidays. Starting wage could be better.
good,"had to give people shoes  "
good,it was great working at belk as we had equal chance to potray our skill eventually and have fun on friday's. we used to have a great workplace culture and its always worth the time you spend.
good,"Competitive company that strives on making goals.Workload is heavy depending on the day of the month, Friendly associates, nice management team.Nice place to work."
good,"Worked on the floor for a year and then moved to the loading/unloading dock, it was fun for a bit and then everything was expected of the ROCC team to get done in the store."
good,"Great place to work with good hours and good scheduling, nice coworkers that helps with some things you may need help with, outspoken supervisors with a great motto to start the day with"
good,"Fun place to work, and good people to work with. The best thing about working at Belk is you got to see the new products before anyone else! That was my favorite, other than the people being friendly."
good,Belk was a great company but unfortunately is undergoing various changes within the company.  I enjoyed my time there but needed more growth opportunity for my career.
good,"The job was a temporary job. The make up counter can be a cut throat environment. When you work off commission, everyone wants that one customer who is willing to drop $400.00 on skin care product."
good,I enjoyed working at Belk. The environment working there was great. The co-workers made the days go by. Working there helped me further my peoples skills and communication with others.
good,The workplace environment was fun and interesting at times. The incentives for meetings weekly sale goals were good. The management staff were disrespectful at times
good,was hired seasonally for Belk. no benefits. no discount great place to work great people great management made great friends everyone complained abut the lack of benefits
good,"Shorts breaks and poor management.i learned that some worker can get by with everything while some always get mess over.Nothing fun about working at belks,need more paid vacation and sick days."
good,Some days were better than others. Didn’t always feel like management was supportive. Co-workers supported each other and helped in other sets. when needed.
good,"Typical retail work culture.  Must be people oriented and able to help customers locate what they are looking for.  Have to deal with difficult customers; therefore, patience and a good attitude are must haves."
good,I was young when I worked there.  I liked my job. It’s tough during holidays but what retail isn’t? Once you get the hang of things everything just comes second nature. And once you’re there for a long time you get repeat customers and that helps build your sales.
good,"I enjoyed doing my job , it was a easy job , the supervisor there will not stand behind there hard workers.  I left there because I was having medical issues and they fired me because I missed days but I have dr excuses."
good,management all work together to make sure the sales associates on the floor get the correct answers to their questions. majority of mangement is really nice and listen if you have any concerns.
good,"nice placed to work, no real benefits but its enough to get you by. I wouldn't recommend living off it alone but you do get quarterly raises. employees become family here."
good,Great customers and relationships with customers. It was great to work with people you could depend on and call family. HR manager was amazing when you need help with anything.
good,"In all jobs there are pros and cons, the cons for this job is that it is so corporate and competitive that you know that your opinion does not matter no matter how much you'd like to help. The only pro for me was certain co workers who became life long friends."
good,When I left the store was not in a good spot. With a turnover to a new manager the turnout rate skyrocketed. She doesn't really care for you unless she benefits from it with my experience.
good,It was a regular work place. It wasn't really fun. They changed up a lot of their rules and some to me was not fair to everyone. Some of the workers were rude and not always unhappy.
good,"Enjoyable place to work, great team and environment to be in. I learned a lot while working there made a lot of great friendships between staff and customers."
good,It's customer service all together and I enjoy working with people and my coworker we a great team. We come to work wipe down glass and recover merchandise that is not in proper place get ready for customers. the area that I work in is fashion jewelry . I really enjoy it I love fashion and helping people to pick out what they are looking for.
good,"Management is inconstistant across shifts, attendance policy is not enforced, no real rewards for meeting goals except that you remain employed, but full time employees get pretty good benefits"
good,enjoyed working with my co-workers and meeting new people. Enjoyed working with the manager i had and getting to work in different departments and seeing the different kind of clothes.
good,"I was just a holiday associate, never was late, i never was taught anything new, or taught why i was doing something and how it impacted the buisness."
good,"Decent work place, fast paced and always something to do. Can be stressful, and while offers benefits they’re not the best. Discussing raises is like pulling teeth. Overall not a bad work place but has really started to go downhill since the company was sold so we’ll see how this lasts."
good,I worked in the vault and was in-charge of doing the daily deposit for the company.  In my down time I was to help out front with wrapping gifts for the customers.
good,It was a seasonal position. Slowly they started to cut my hours and I needed a stable job at the time. I liked working for them. They were nice.......
good,"I enjoyed doing my job very much, but it was the negative working environment that made it miserable.  I tried to deal with it but it was getting to me.  Other than that, Belk is a great place to work.  You will meet some amazing people."
good,"Work hard and offer great customer service "
good,"Developed and executed sales promotions. Completed purchases."
good,Not bad for a part-time job. I took this job while waiting to start school in the spring. I enjoyed working with people from all walks of life. The atmosphere was usually upbeat and friendly.
good,The IT department I work for is a collaborative group.  The work is manageable.  There is no real training available for job responsibilities.  The company is good to its employees.
good,"good work place,the people that i,ve meet at belks are polite,and always willing to help co workers advance....belks was a job that i really liked...."
good,The management do not know what they are doing. They never have enough people to cover shifts. They will pressure you into working longer shifts to have covered because they do not ever plan accordingly.
good,"Advancement is more about timing and politics than qualification. Pay is below average for the industry. Overall, a positive team dynamic is the driving force for happiness in a position."
good,"Belk fulfillment center has a nice, laid back environment, but it is a fast paced working speed so that workers are productive, yet relaxed while working."
good,"I liked the culture of the company, very multicultural.  I enjoyed working there and the benefits were good at that time.  I hope the company continues to do well."
good,I started my career working as a loss prevention associate . I was promoted within two years to a manager . My time as an associate was pretty good . I helped reduce the shrink and turn the loss prevention department around . I don’t like how the company promoted a competition between LPA’s . Once I became a manager I like how I could pretty much do what I wanted . My reason for leaving Belk is a combination of a few things . Pay was a concern considering I was an investigator . Customer service rep and a teacher . I almost forgot safety manager as well. I had way too many roles as a manager considering the pay .  I would recommend working at Belk as an associate only if you are looking to deal with drug addict shoplifters and spend countless hours researching internals . I left because my store manager was addicted to prescription pills begging associates for them and the company did nothin about it but a mock investigation. LP  is not a great career for someone with a bachelors degree . My advice stay away from retail period don’t work LP for any company. To much stress and way too many responsibilities
good,"In my position, I was required the overall task of running the Lancome Counter. I enjoyed what i did. It could be stressful at times but frun at times"
good,"Fast paced always on your feet competitive credit goals, sales goals, item locate goals, depending on the season really tells how your breaks and lunches are scheduled"
good,"I worked at the Belk store in Christiansburg.  It was a long commute from my home.  Some coworkers were nice, but some were very competitive.  It was stressful."
good,The store manager doesn't take initative.  People are not getting paid their right amount of money. The store manger doesn't appreciate the workers in the store.
good,"Worked Customer Service during the Christmas rush, wrapped presents and answering questions. Also assisted with inventory that is done at the beginning of every year."
good,Physically demanding job and helping assist customers with product questions and locations.I really enjoyed the conversations had with the truck driver who delivered our inventory!
good,"If you like waking up really early in the morning I would recommend you to apply for the job. I really didn't like working there, because I would always have to wake up really early in the morning. It's a good job if you get used to waking up really in the morning and having to unload huge trailer loads of product."
good,Overall good part-time position. Good for first time work experience. However this is retail therefore you won't get holidays off. Not enough flexibility for those in school. Schedules differ each week but they are on time.
good,they lay off entirely too much you can only miss 2 days even with doctor excuses you will be shipped right out the door but overall its not a bad place
good,"I worked here for around a year and had to leave due to time commitments, otherwise it was a great place to work. Decent benefits, management worked with you, etc."
good,"There is never a dull moment, whether your helping and advising a customer or working with your coworkers. Most important, theres always busy work!!!!"
good,Belk was an enjoyable place to work. Minimal drama between coworkers and management. The job was simple and easy. Management was easy to get along with and helpful.
good,It was sales I enjoyed I liked interacting with the customers. This job has been a very long time ago and I don't remember a lot about it to be honest.
good,"busy office "
good,This store's management team needs to learn some people skills immediately. Speaking to associate should be the norm. A very negative place to work. ************************************************************************************
good,Belk is a very clean but stressful work environment. I had several horrible experiences at the store. However none of them were ever handle professionally.
good,"A typical day at Belk is extremely competitive if your on the commission based side. Greet costumers, open credit accounts, and make your daily sales goals is really all there is to it."
good,"Engaged with customers, helped and provided the right information for customers regarding certain shoe lines, provided customer service, helped maintain stock, clean up cash wraps, promote all sales and applying for credit card"
good,Lots of goals. Good rewards. Pay for performance policy is for the most part unattainable. Good perks for cosmetics. Lower management is horrible. Very childish and gossip filled
good,When I worked there they didn't really work with days that you had to have off. Breaks were practically non existent and the environment was stressful.
good,"very stressful, many changes in company culture. hours cut, no feel of job security after over 13 years. each week changes in work policy, "
good,"My co-workers would take sales from me, which everyone had a daily sales quota they had to make. The manager would make me do all of our floor stock because the other coworker was taking majority of the sales. Therefore, it was unfair to the rest that actually worked."
good,"This job required a lot of time management.  I was able to multi-task very well.  My manager was great and very supportive."
good,Belks had awesome sales and associate discounts. Work was very laid back but demanding as well. Even for seasonal employees. If you had any kind of questions someone was there to help.
good,"I have been with Belk since 2006. I have learned a lot through the company. It has recently been bought over and has changed with the work environment I was used to. There is little growth within the company now, they find resources outside of the company more than on the inside. I want to be part of a growing company with many opportunities."
good,I enjoy working with the public. You must be a people person to deal with all the different customers. I would like to see the management staff a little more friendly and helpful.
good,"Belk had good sales and the employees were very nice.  The schedule was Monday through Friday. 100 people were employed there, I was employed there a long time."
good,Great place to learn about retail sales.  Very accommodating management.  Very supportive in career advancement and career goals. Drawback is the pay.
good,"sometimes my days are as stressful as ever simply because of the limitation of help we have in my department and on busy sale days, we never have a chance to clean up until the end of the night and by us being short of people, we have clothes for days to put out until someone comes in on a off day to clean up all the left over go back clothes. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO MULTI TASK."
good,if you had a good manager everything was great. if not it was sucked. i have have plenty managers at this store if the manager was fair and knew what there job was and did it things ran much smoother.
good,"I can only say great things so far. Everyone has been so welcoming and it's truly a fun, laid back work environment where everyone seems genuinely happy to be coming to work everyday. The atmosphere is extremely open and collaborative with open workspaces and no offices, however, there are plenty of comfortable more isolated spots to hang out if you need to get away and concentrate on something. So far, nothing not to love!"
good,"This is a place to stay busy in clothes, but I was not interested. I do like helping customers but not one after another. I love helping people match their outfits. folding and straitening up clothes was not fun"
good,"a typical day consist of standing up eight hours a day until your break it is very fast paced consisted of lifting and loading, unless told otherwise."
good,Would recommend working here if you were looking for a little extra money to put in your pocket.  This is not a place to stay for a long period of time.
good,"I loved my co-workers, they are what kept me at this company so long. What is terrible is the management. Half the time there is not even a person assigned to the desired management position, which makes work confusing and hectic. But otherwise it was a nice job."
good,Awesome teamwork when trying to get the work done. You come in and start taking merchandise out there box's. You're assign to a areas work until it's time unload the truck
good,"A typical day at Belk would be waiting on customers, putting out new merchandise that would come into the store and cleaning, organizing clothing throughout the store site."
good,"Tough, learning to outsmart people, new methods to arrest. My team was the best part about the job. They were always there when you needed them. I learned that with a great team you can accomplish anything."
good,"•        Picked and prepared merchandise for shipment"
good,"Good job to work at, but they keep you working for months before they hire you on. But other than that its a good job with benefits.the people are friendly and you see all the different clothes that they sell. Mainly you are packing clothes for people who shop online. The job is not hard at all."
good,"It's a good working place just doesn't get all the hours we will work for like two months straight. Everybody work wonderful together and get alone, the pay rate is ok the check and hours are not."
good,"Working at Belk Distribution was strictly business. You really didn't touch on first names bases with other employees. You were given your duties and expected to do just that. I can't really speak on the management there, because i was temp to hire and we didn't deal with them. The hardest part of the job was maintaing a steady pace of the line production. The most enjoyable part of the job , is that the job itself wasn't too demanding."
good,Learned about retail and about Clinique skin care.  Most enjoyable part of the job was interaction with customers.  The most difficult part of the job was how much hours can vary.  No regular work schedule.
good,Belk will definitely keep you busy with trucks and sale sets which is fun. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with many huge trucks back to back. I enjoy merchandising the clothes and making areas look beautiful.
good,productive great learning environment friendly staff. learned how to sell and raise commission rates very well. hardest part was keeping my sales up which I accomplished
good,"Management does not care about its people"
good,"This is retail and the days and hours don't give you a lot of time to spend with family or go to church"
good,"New management has no concern of retaining top talent or offering opportunities for career growth if you are less than a VP. Belk's culture has a funny & frustrating characteristic that the good people never stay. Even under Tim Belk's leadership, all the good people get fed up and leave and sadly, this hasn't changed with our new management. Unless you are a VP or higher, the current management treats you like nothing more than a pawn... but they remind us that we're getting better coffee at the office! (Fail).  For those reasons and so much more, this top performer is on Indeed to move on and find an employer that appreciates top talent."
good,"You don't get enough hours when working part time. Was willing to work with my school schedule. Bosses were great. Some mother employees, not so much.."
good,"This job is a good job for someone starting out. There is room for growth and management is okay to work for. I was, however expected to work on a day I was in a car accident."
good,Decent job but no advancement opportunities. My co-worker worked hard for 20 plus years and was not offered pension or any benefits for retiring. Good short-term job.
good,"Opening/closing the store, morning papers, running morning meeting, creating lunch schedule, making sure departments are running correctly."
good,I take care of customers. I learn to work around people. Management is ok. I get along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is being away on holidays. The best part about this job is working with people.
good,Sold shoes and interacted with customers.  Became familiar with merchandise and assisted with organization of the of sales floor.
good,Its ok if you know what your doing! just keep calm and Smile! I like my Co workers there awesome we have to watch each other backs. never be afraid to ask for help....customers can be a bit hectic but i always just say ok ill get the manger for you!
good,"The company is nice but they could really improve their compensation. A lot is required but little is given back, especially for those who are not sales associates. No extra incentives for support associates. Say good bye to your family during the holidays. Good discount, extra discount for a year if you meet pacesetter or consultant criteria."
good,Long days standing but not a strenuous job.  Steady paced but not overwhelming.  As long as you don't mind warehouse work its ok
good,"I worked at Belk for around 18 months in the HR department.  During my time there, the company was sold to a private equity firm and after a few months of relative quiet after the sale, significant organization and leadership changes started occurring.  This lead to my role being eliminated and several other people moving to new jobs or out of the company."
good,"Hard work, takes alot of patience with customers. Requires you to really sale in order to get enough pay. Can sometimes be a slow Occupation,."
good,"Due to the sale to a private equity firm, they are in the process of cutting many departments and leaders in the organization. Things are unsettled and will need some time to calm and stabilize."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and helping customers find items. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep areas of the store recovered at all times.
good,"Project Description"
good,"-co-workers are great and majority of people are young and enthusiastic and willing to teach"
good,"I enjoyed the customer interaction and assistance.  Very busy atmosphere, constantly interacting with customers, other departments and employees.  Management was available when needed.  At times, it became difficult to greet customers and provide quality time and service due to sale set requirements and not enough employees scheduled."
good,"I think it was okay to work there but I came in at a time it was selling so therefore it was stressful and emotional."
good,"I've worked in cosmetics with Belk for almost a year. Management definitely favors other brands and provides special treatment and accessibility to these said brands while leaving others in the dust to fend for themselves (who are then written up for not meeting standards and goals). We are supposed to receive monthly status checks and I got 6 months handed to me at once- during this whole six months I was unaware of what was working well for me and what I needed to improve on. Because of that I now have a lot of things to makeup before the end of the year that I could of been working on. "
good,"If you work for Belk it's because you believe that the southern style is one that people enjoy and can be promoted. While that may be true what it is is the fact that unless you know someone up high in the company, you'll be the pawn they want you to be. Nothing more nothing less."
good,My time at Belk was valuable and taught me management skills and the importance of sales. My co-workers were helpful and supportive.
good,This was a fast paced stressful at times place to work for. I really enjoyed the customers other employees. The scheduling was horrible. You did not get your schedule for the next week till 1-2 days before Sunday (which is when the next week started). By then you could never make personal plans for a Sunday.
good,Enjoyed working for Belk. Enjoyed working with fellow employees. Did not like working Thanksgiving Day. Enjoyed the customers. Never a dull moment.
good,"Management does not communicate well with each other nor with the staff. For the most part, amazing team work with co-workers."
good,"Working at Belk requires a great amount of customer service, plenty of walking and lifting, and several different employees in and out.The most enjoyable part of this job is getting to know the customers and building relationships within the store and outside."
good,Just another retail job. Nothing bad to complain about and nothing good to praise about. You deal with good and bad customers just like any other retail job. Management was okay.
good,"Very first Job; I enjoyed it for the most part, because I was able to use my gifts and talents. It was an enjoyable experience."
good,"Communication between upper, middle, and sales associate not cohesive.  There are favorites played, peers are supportive but upper management will pick and choose who they support."
good,Overall Belk is a great place to work and the training is simple and easy to pick up. They say in the interview that they promote from within which is good.
good,"Belk sometimes has unreasonable sales goals to obtain raises. Returns from months prior take away from current sales goals. However, I enjoyed having a fast paced workplace. When they offered commission in shoe sales the bonus on my check was very good."
good,"steady work day. meet new customers and make lasting customer relationships. the management was wonderful, always there to help when needed. hardest part of the day was making sure everything was clean and the new sales were set and correct. the co-workers were always friendly and wiling to help each other."
good,"high energy environment, Business casual dress, dedicated to client excellence. Very detailed in the companies product."
good," Handle each customer transaction in a professional and friendly manner  Use suggestive selling techniques with all customers and exceed personal sales per hour goals  Follow procedures for all systems including counts, markdowns, re-tickets and inventory control  Work professionally and pleasantly with co-workers, customers and managers to accomplish defined tasks   Accept additional duties or sharing responsibilities during busy times and/or as requested by Sales Team Manager  Maintain floor and stock areas consistent with store standards"
good,"A typical day at Belk is to provide the best customer service to every customer. I have been employed at Belk for 5 years and it has been good and bad. I work in a commission environment, so it can be a cut throat situation. These associates have no respect or boundaries for one another as it relates to sales. They steal sales and act as if it's ok. Management rarely address the issue because it doesn't affect their salary. You can make some decent money if you're allowed to sale. The job does come with flexibility and a good discount."
good,"I do not  have anything I would like to say about working for this business, but  I do appreciate you asking.   Thank you.. Im done ! "
good,"A typical day at work was selling. I got along with management and coworkers. The hardest part of the job was standing all day. I had surgery and as a result, my left calf would swell up by putting to much stress on in."
good,Loved everyone I worked with! I still go in to this day and see everyone! I loved helping customers with their purchases!
good,"Here at belk yu stay busy, there is plenty to do. plenty boxes coming down the line. My coworkers are all friendly. There really isn't a hard part its just a little bit of labor. I like that everyone over me are ok people we just get our job finished and clock out."
good,"It is ok as far as retail goes. I am only working here until something better comes along. I only get between 5-10 hours a week, not enough to pay the bills."
good,Working as a lost prevention associate was a good job but it required to much to prove that a person has stolen something. Compared to other lost prevention jobs this was the most boring job that I have ever had.
good,"making sure you know where everything goes, making sure new merchandise is out, making sure you greet everybody,and just have fun."
good,I have really so enjoyed to work hard and help  one another. I have really missed my position which I love it and it was fun to say working hard and busy.  They are very nice  and friendly people which I have really enjoyed..
good,"•	Started as sales associate and within a year was promoted to Department Manager"
good,"Belk was an okay place to work. The pay was terrible, the staff was nice, management wasn't too bad although once the store manager left and we got a new manager everything went downhill."
good,I worked here during my early college years. Its good seeing familiar faces when I go back and shop. Shows that there is a lot of job security within the company.
good,"I enjoyed working at Belk, simply because of the different kinds of people I dealt with everyday, and being able to make them happy and comfortable. Belk is where I really learned the sales/retail culture, and simply fell in love with it. I had always had customer service experience from previous jobs. Working at Belk took my customer service ability to a higher level."
good,"The work schedule fluctuated, working weekdays and weekends, days and nights. Loved building relationships with customers by applying their makeup, discussing skincare, keeping in contact, etc."
good,Typical day at work was to assist customers. Help them find anything they may have needed or was looking for. There were a lot of older customers that would come into Belk and that helped me learn patience.
good,coworkers nice . not much training  managerment nice but need to go training classes. Does not have everthing you need to do you job for the day.
good,Very flexible environment - also very lean.  Friendly people.  Systems are quite difficult and very antiquated processes.  Requires a high level of flexibility.
good,A typical day at belk is providing customers with relentless customer service. Folding clothes and giving customers options.
good,"Working at Belk was a fun experience. What made my job fun for me was the customers and my co-workers. I loved helping and making my customers happy when they left the store. As far as my co workers, we were nothing but a big family and that's what I loved the most. The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy my customers whenever we didn't have the merchandise they wanted."
good,"The way things are put together are a complete dysfunction.  At times it can be ok, but the associates are over worked and under paid.  It is nothing I would recommend if you are looking for a serious job that is fair."
good,very slow place to work. he people there was ok to work with but didn'tike working on sat. some supervisor was ok to be around
good,I worked on a part time basis for the operations team while I attended college full time. I liked my direct supervisor and the main reason I will leave is because I am finishing my degree.
good,"The day would start with a morning meeting of expectations and upcoming events. The most difficult part of this job was giving personalized service to each customer since we were so understaffed. Management did what they could but had little recourse. My co-workers were helpful. Most of us worked as a team. "
good,"Can be a very good company to work for, depending on area.  Cross-functional teamwork needs a great deal of work.  Corporate goal attainment, functional area effectiveness, and job satisfaction would benefit greatly by facilitating priority of goals and resources across functional areas."
good,great company with excellentt team members and staff. benefits were good and great oppportunity for a college students.
good,"A typical day at work is very upbeat. Helping guest, customer service is very important. My co workers were the best part of the job."
good,"To them you are but a number. The name tag is there because they only care when they walk in the door what your name really is. As long as you make them money and brown nose you can do anything you want. Yes the oldest privately owned department store, but they do not treat the associates like family."
good,Belk is a good company. They tend to not offer ideal flexible schedules that coincide with my personal needs. Benefits are good if you are full time.
good,Typical day consist of merchandising department per company standards and assisting clients in their apparel needs all while maintaining weekly/monthly sales goals. Good work life balance with flexible schedule
good,"I was suppose to have 13 hours of training with another person while out on the floor, but they were too busy to do much of my training, which left me vulnerable to mistakes because I was not trained or getting in trouble for voids that were not my fault because someone decided they did not want the product after it was rung up or simply someone saved so much money from coupons and still had to get CSM clearance. When things were running smoothly I enjoyed the job!"
good,"Belk is a nice place to work but I wouldn't make it a career choice.  The pay is quite low and you will be doing a lot of standing.  However, it provides valuable training and opportunities."
good,the staff was great the hours conflicted with my school however Belk is one of my best Jobs
good,I was in the shoes department and I loved helping people and got along great with everyone
good,"Associate"
good,"Love learning about the different seasons of different clothing lines and other products as far as kitchen ware, shoes, and jewelry lines I learned that there is a season for everything"
good,"Typical clothing retail ""first - job"" experience.   Belk treated their employees well and rewarded them for a job well done.  I was given the opportunity to find my own style of working and they understand that retail is often a stepping stone for youth into the professional world.  I enjoyed my years here."
good,Great place for an artist. Great way to learn the industry and stay up to date with the latest trends.
good,okay when first started. new assistant  manager not doing so well taking care of employee's needs
good,"Merchandizing, how to further deal with people from a different work culture. Management is adequate at best, coworkers are supportive, believe in a team mentality."
good,I worked there going on seven years and my particular store has been downward spiraling after a new manager took over.  I can say its an easy job for part time wages.  I know it couldn't be my career choice though.
good,Complicated work flow. Internal process need streamlining
good,"It was ok, but you must be willing to deal with crazy customers."
good,Typical day consists of actively approaching and providing assistance to customers and potential customers who are purchasing clothing apparel  in a department store environment. Hardest part is standing on your feet for most of the workday.
good,Just like any other customer service job. Making pizza is the best part
good,"Good place to get your bearings. Flexible work hours, good management."
good,Belk offers a great work life balance but the pay is poor. This is an good company otherwise.
good,Working with the company gives you the chance to build a loyal relationship with high end customers.
good,"assist customers with purchases. check and clean fitting rooms. keep department areas organized and functioning for shoppers. high turnover ratio management. co-workers were mostly friendly, some were not. hardest part was being on your feet all day. most enjoyable part was the employee discount."
good,I worked at Belk during a transitional time-frame. It was satisfactory; but I only worked there for a short period time
good,"Belk consisted of folding clothes, folding clothes and folding clothes. I had to start the day off by opening up my cash register and checking my department to be ready for customers. Most of the time I worked by myself all day but help wasn't needed. Working in clothing retail wasn't much of a challenge, besides working on customer service."
good,The overall job was different but not my likeness as I prefer to be in an office atmosphere.
good,"Belk is one of the smaller Big Box Retailers, operating on in southern states. Due to intense competition and current market trends this organization is focusing most of it's efforts on innovation. Great time to join the company and have a voice."
good,"I had all different hours to work, no day was the same. I folded clothes, dressed manikins, and also was cashier. I liked working for a big store, my co-workers and managers were always enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job was the hours and working weekends. Also I did not like the cleaning up the store part."
good,"Learned the basics of retail - mannequin display, recovery, customer service, and sales."
good,"Continuous changes in daily sales promotions keeps all employees"
good,Good work environment and very easy job just messy when it comes to the hours and schedule
good,Expect to be moved to different departments based on staffing for the day
good,Belk is lacking in the latest software. I enjoy my co-workers and my associates.
good,some employees are nice the managers not so much they talk down to you like you have no feelings
good,Sales associate job and worked well with adjusting schedule with school schedule
good,"Some Supervisors showed favoritism, Most of the co-workers were great to  work with. Hardest part of the the job was lack of product and not making sales or credit goals. Enjoyed the Christmas Holidays was busy and exciting."
good,"As a Customer Service/Sales Associate, my daily activities included, pricing merchandise, creating and advertising displays and arranging merchandise to promote sales, assist customers with various request including by not limited to purchases and specific orders, assist customers with location, price and use of merchandise, using a computer based register and calculator to assist customers with purchases, ensuring all transactions were accurate at the end of the work for financial deposits. I learned how to deal with complex customers, dissatisfied customers, and some very wonderful customers. Most of my co-workers were great, we really cared about one anothers trials, successes and tragedies in one another's lives."
good,"meet daily and monthly goals"
good,"Seasonal worker. Operated cash register and greeted customers. Wrapped gifts for customers, and established credit line for customers."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of: Assisting Customers/Clients in selecting the products which would suit their wants and needs, Stocking, merchandising and recovery, Cash register procedures, Assisting Customers/Clients on the phone as well as in the store, preparing Mail Orders and setting a sale. While working for Estee Lauder I also performed Make-up/Skincare Consultations on a diverse Customer/Client base demonstrating and suggesting which Estee Lauder Product(s) would best suit their needs. Scheduled appointments and set-up for National Make-up Artists Events."
good,A typical day for me was mostly spent behind a register finding something to do because most of the day was boringly slow. The management and co-workers were pretty cool though it was slow most of the week.
good,if you're looking to start off for your first job or just need the extra money this will be a good fit.
good,"Fast pace,fun workplace love meeting people. Lots of work for everyone. Just great place to start working."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service working here. A typical day included stocking and marking inventory and helping customers with their purchase. Some of my coworkers were difficult to work with in that they never wanted to help with the ""behind the scenes"" tasks that required being off the sales floor. Other than that, it was a good first job and part time job to have during college."
good,Interesting job meeting people and helping with their needs.
good,"Depending on the schedule opening or closing, typical day helps customers, cleans and runs the register. I learned that sometimes people just need a simple hello to make their day. Hardest part of the job was the pay.. and the most enjoyable part was meeting many people from all walks of life, and ages.."
good,help customers with their purchases
good,"Typical day is managing associates, processing merchandise, setting sales, driving credits, reviewing sales reports, maintaing floor standards, making schedules, and motivating others to deliver great service."
good,"A typical day at work; fold, smile, greet, and repeat. The environment is ok , no major issues. The hardest parts of the job is dealing with one, the pay rate, and two, the lack of hours availble. What I like most about the job is the employees base. Everyone is pleasent."
good,"Clock in at post, open cash wrap areas, assess the sales floor for needed care and replinishment, set sales goals accordingly, process new receipts and inventory stock. Received the public."
good,"Stocking, meetings, great parties, loved the customers and people I worked with."
good,A pretty lay back work environment. First time in retail.Coworker arent always the friendiest. They can be very territorial since it is a commission base store.
good,Making sure that the floor is stocked and shopper friendly.
good,"Belk is a great starting job. The managers are stressed and there is alot of work to be done, but the people that work there become your family."
good,"I think this job is great. I could have never imagined myself being a shoe specialist,but I am. This job has given me the chance to work with and get to know people I otherwise probably would never have met."
good,I like working there.  I like helping the customers get what they wanted and needed.  The pay is low and they do not give me any hours during the week.  The computer system makes up the schedule for the week.
good,Belk is full of driven professionals eager to deliver customer satisfaction and financial results.  Management empowers employees to make data driven decisions to move the organization forward and test new ideas.
good,Belk is no longer a family oriented business and I don't agree with the changes in their policies. I don't feel like I can succeed in my future work goals.
good,I really like it at belk most of all with the employees and enjoy working with costumers the most about my job and helping other when needed. Management was cool and had to work with each close.
good,"A lot of times you'll be stuck, 1 person doing a million things at once. Then a mess is caused. The schedule is generated by the computer but none of the managers take the time out to review to make sure it make since. Most of the customers are terrible bc belk lets them get away w. ANYTHING. Even with policy. They give you a hard time and the customers have bad attitudes. . my current manager is the bomb but its clear he doesnt have the adequate support from the other support members. If you want to work in a negative environment where you sweat like pigs everyday then belk is the place for you."
good,Very nice people and most managers are friendly. I came in as seasonal and they moved me to part time when the seasonal term expired. I initially applied as visual associate and interviewed but didn't get that job. Came back as merchandiser. Many long time associates warned of stores impending doom and either left or was fired.
good,"I enjoyed working with this company as a seasonal worker, but I felt like the Belk I worked at was really run down. It needed improvements which could’ve increased traffic."
good,Would have still been there if the manager hadn't cut my days down to only one day a week. Couldn't make it like that. I enjoyed the job. Got to meet a lot of really good people. Would go back if they get another store manager. She cut everyone hours to the point we had to look for work somewhere else. I loved the job and would go back.
good,"It was fun and hard work at the same time. When your  put on a project you work very hard to meet all of managements excpections , no laughs so you give it your best."
good,"Being my first job, Belk provided me an opportunity to learn about retail and grow my customer service skills. The management team can vary greatly. While many of the management team is helpful and kind, there are still many who are difficult to work with. The schedule changes so often that it is hard to rely on stable work days."
good,"There is seldom a typical day in retail!  Each day is different and the environment is evolving daily. During my tenure at Belk,  the company was in a constant state of change and it was difficult to build on past experience because procedures and systems changed annually.  The company was behind in technology compared to other department stores in their class.  This made business analysis more time consuming and cumbersome.  They are currently updating systems to expedite the dissemination of information and analysis of business data. "
good,Belk is not very busy so there is a lot of down time where there are not many customers. The beauty department is full of gossip and drama and you're lucky if you can get 10 hours a week.
good,"The job was okay, but if you have a problem or need help, no one was around. You had to figure it out yourself. Whenever you do run into someone, they just tell you to ask someone else because they most likely dont know either."
good,"If it wasn't for the people I actually work with, I probably would have left a lot sooner. The manager we have now isn't nearly as wonderful as our previous. They only care about their favorite employees."
good,"While I loved being a visual merchandiser, it was a very physical job. Very stressful visits from corporate office, all but one of the managers in the 11 years that I worked there were very good. Regional managers were all awesome. But work loads just got heavier as fewer employees are on the floor now."
good,"This job didnt pay a lot, it was not a living wage. The hours were minimal and no room for more even if you did well in your position. Management was okay but did not seem to always know what was going on."
good,"Belk offered flexibility, and great opportunity to work in different departments.  They offered pretty good employee discounts.  The store manager at the time was great to work for."
good,"My time at Belk has been fun, but it isn’t enough for me. I am a serious person and I like to have a more important role. I believe they management is fun and they try their best, but I rather have a more important role. I also would like to start on a career instead of a job."
good,"BELK was the best retail job I very had.  I have work at several major retail stores."
good,"Was my first job, Decent pay, decent amount of hours, Loved most co-workers, Great Management, Scheduler who paid no attention to your availability, hard to get time off, super slow paced"
good,Positive working environment well mannered co workers customers were always nice and greeting employees with a smile. Duties and tasks were always made to be done in a timely manner.
good,"Setting up displays inside building, receiving merchandise, helping customers when coming into store, cleaning up dock area, help me work with people with give you great experience in customer service"
good,"Okay company to work for.. To much stress is placed on the associate to get credit apps and item locators.  To much emphasis is placed on getting email addresses and phone numbers.  People don't like to give out that kind of information.  All of these things will be on a report with your name on it, saying you can do better in those areas when you try everyday.  Getting the sale signs to be correct is  sometimes frustrating."
good,"Enjoyable work and environment, but job lacks benefits and competitive pay primarily due to market limitations. Job allowed for career development, but lacked growth potential without relocation."
good,"Worked here for over a year. The work wasn't difficult, but I needed more hours to support my family, which were never available. Management is very understanding of the needs of parents. Teamwork and camaraderie were great."
good,"Its a great starter job for someone in school while trying to manage school and work life.  However, there's not much growth in management, so if you're looking to grow with the company there may be some hurdles."
good,"Work environment is well with benefits depending on position. Not much room to grow as an employee unless position is to be needed to fulfill. Working in this company for three years has taught me a lot about retail with good experiences and some bad. Overall, Belk allows many of its employees to have fair schedule but not room growth."
good,Help people find and sell shoes. Handle merchandise on the floor and in stock room. Cashier and check out customers. Process payment for customers. Make shoe labels when new merchandise come in. Open/Close register.
good,management could be a little more professional and if you ever have a confrontation with a coworker you will have to hound the manager to do something about it.
good,Belk is were I started to learn great customers service skills. Working for belk has showed me how  to talk and make sure every customer is happy when they walk out the door.
good,"I only worked here for a short period. Management was great, but health benefits were outrageous due to the company being privately owned."
good,"Being a Sales Team Manager at Belk in Spanish Fort, AL was a good experience. I worked with, and managed some amazing people. However, there was some issues that I didn't like or understanding while working there."
good,belk was just supposed to be a demo job but they decided to keep me full time so i ended up staying. it requires a lot of recovery and folding or youre not going home if you work in clothes
good,I did loss prevention with them for a short period of time had a young LP Mgr  schedule changes forced me to quite due to the fact I couldn't get fully certified unless he was there great place to gain LP experience and later move on to another company but be carful you can easily be terminated and blamed for bad stops and you must score 100% on all test there is no margins for error with the shoplifter monitoring and apprehension system they use if you are not a great test take or aren't good and constant monitoring people or get bored easily then look else where!
good,"When I first started with Belk it was a great place to work with a family environment, and they really cared about there employees. Then they were bought out and that feeling is gone. Everyone just became a number. They have laid off so many people lately it's ridiculous and they say there is more to come. I was caught up in this just the other day on my one year anniversary with Belk I was laid off. I did the maintenance for corporate headquarters and they decided it would be better to outsource the maintenance work (good luck)."
good,"Your experience at Belk as a sales associate really depends on what you want to make it. The responsibilities were pretty basic; customer service, cleanliness and motivation."
good,The work environment is good. Management is good. However when management change work environment change. It's a small company and focus is really about the bottom line. But a great place to start career in customer service.
good,"As HR/Office Manager at Belk I daily used innovative payroll and HR software.  I learned to make sure I treated all associates the same."
good,"the management is always driving sales goals,and cutting hours but expecting more results. The associate is just a number, there is no loyalty to the person."
good,"Belk likes to move up their associates as quickly as possible. If they show good leadership skills, are making their goals, and really enjoy their job, they can go into a leadership program and excel within the company. It is a position in which you must be driven and flexible."
good,"Job consist of doing stock and sale change, sales, no commission, penny raises, credit card pushing, management drama, employee drama, almost all-women staff, random thieves, prepping for holidays, rude costumers here and there, and coupon, coupons, coupons."
good,You clock in to work and identify/open your designated register in the store depending on time of day. Then proceed to check out customers and accomplish daily tasks to keep store operational.
good,My manager is the best. She makes sure that I have whatever I need to properly do my job and she is always available to lend an ear or hand to be of any assistance possible.
good,A typical day at Belk would start off with store meting to see what our goals where for the day. Making sure the stock was in and everything was clean. Loved the consultants I worked with and manager had lots of fun things with contest .The hardest part of the job was cold calling for gift.The most enjoyable part of my job was see my customers come back to see me to help them with what ever they needed.
good,"Sales, and customer service. Opening New accounts, and being very polite."
good,"it is a good job and I like it. I dislike the slow days, but other than that its a fine job to have."
good,Schedule varied daily. I liked working in teams to unload and distribute merchandise. Lack of training for independent work was most difficult. Customer service was the most enjoyable
good,I learned a little about retail during my time spent at Belks. I was still in highschool at the time so the job worked well with my hours. management was curtious and again accomadating to school. I enjoyed helping customers piece together outfits for everyday life or big events in their life.
good,"A typical day starts @ 5AM processing the receiving truck. The team and I process and merchandise the floor all before 10AM."
good,Great place to start out. Pay isnt great unless your in management like I was. Hours are typical retail. Great team for each departments and well organized. 
good,"A typical day at work was receiving goods scanning them in with the correct count on a assembly line, places the orders out to be shipped to various stores. I learned that you had to really pay attention not to put the wrong orders in the incorrect place. managers were really demanding and that made your day go by faster. Lifting boxes over 50lbs. The most enjoyable was getting the goods shipped out on time."
good,"A typical day at work if putting up stock, doing markdowns and assisting the customers. I like the management and the people that I work with."
good,"Belk was full of fun co-workers and great managers. It just was full of older associates who have secure position because they've been with the company for years so no matter how hard I worked or the fact I was consistently towards the top of sales, I couldn't keep my job due to the elder employees."
good,"Where do I start? I love how you're on, ""Pay for performance."" If you meet sales and credit goals, you'll surely get a raise! I even love how they put the carrot in front on you every month, on your stats reports. Managers will say, ""you're right on track to making more money."" You may get a $1, if that, and won't really go up from there! It's ridiculous how the managers uptalk the sales positions. ""It's such a great career, with benefits, and awesome oppritunities for advancemet!"" Yea, they expect you to advance the level of work, and pay you just a bit above minimum wage! Also, if you don't get enough people to sign up for the Belk Rewards Card, your hours will get cut! Can't afford to take less than the 25 hours per week they offer! And, the credit card is such a great card to have, at nearly 25% interest! Yes, that means you're paying $25 back, for every $100 you spend. And the rewards dollars, for every 400 points= $400 you spend/earn, you get a $10 reward!!! So, when you charge $400, with $100 dollars interest tied to it. In reality for every $500 spent, you get 1/50 th of that back! In my experience, they spot who the hard workers are, and they exploit them! Seriously, I found a much better job, and they still wanted me to stay. Heck, I was only making 5 cents more than I started! And, that was after working there for 2 years! They didn't want me to leave, cause they were getting excellent work, for cheap labor! This company is as cheap as the brands they sell! Red Camel, New Directions, Kim Rodgers, and Saddlebred; just to name a few! I swear you get better quality at"
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. we were very interactive and team oriented. I ejoyed helping the customers find what they needed at the price they wanted.
good,All i can say about this company is that it has alot of history and if your just starting off in entry level or management after training for buissness its a great company.
good,This experience was good because I started right before Christmas and I was able to interact with alot of different people from all over.
good,"We had meetings everyday, so that we would stay in the know. Coupons all the time, and stock not real heavy."
good,"fast pace never the same thing each day, hardest part of the job was the crazy work schedule worked a lot of nights on  weekends.  if wasn't for crazy schedule would still love my job!"
good,When i first started working there i had to learn the ropes and get the swing of things. You have to stay moving and always either be assisting a customer or tightening up the store. The pay is fair and the hours are ok
good,"I enjoyed my experience with them ,I worked in wem’s Department.i was purchasing clothing for occasions.the benefits employee discount was a great perk."
good,The environment and ppl I worked I with was good. The pay sucks and the workload was a bit much for one person at times. I would consider working here in the future if the pay was realistic.
good,You never know how to plan vacations because you have to let them know way in advance.  If you don't have a family and have unlimited time available then that's for you.  Great for a single person with no obligations at all.
good,cool little retail spot to work. they take there retail very serious as to macy's competition. shifts can be as little as 3 hours to as long as 10 hours.
good,"Belk is a decent place if you’re just looking for small part time work and in school or if you want some extra money. But the hours are pretty terrible. Many people get 7-10 hours A WEEK! It’s VERY rare to get 20 hrs in a week unless your full time maybe. They get slightly better during the holidays. Many people have second jobs. You can’t work there and support a household unless you’re a manager. The people are very patient and nice, the hours just suck. If you work in the back near home and kids, you’ll barely do anything. Unlike other retail jobs, closing isn’t long and tiring. We’ve closed at 9 and it’s Times I would be clocking out at 9:08."
good,"I enjoyed working with the the other employees.  I also enjoyed the health benefits.  Unfortunately, Belk is another store that cuts hours in the winter and that hurts financially when trying to pay bills."
good,"The team that i work with are really great. We help each other out and it really is good to be on a team. We clean out the dressing room, open charge accounts, do bra fittings, i can also do suit fitting for men, we have several departments in one. One of the most difficult thing to do is to be the only person working . Their never is enough people to cover we can not work over 30 hours when it is time to get off exhaustion is how i feel. The most enjoyable part about my job is the customers I really enjoy the customers."
good,Great job if you are interested in merchandising and marketing.  The culture is ever changing due to the turnover of employees and senior  management.
good,"The environment is good but there have been a lot of changes in the company because of a buy out.  Changes in merchandise, less people on the floor to help customers, etc have been a major complaint from customers."
good,"i’ve been at belk for almost 2 years now. it has its good qualities and bad qualities. sometimes this job style isn’t for everyone, it’s competive, fast paced retail"
good,workin for belk was great. although cleaning up after the customers that do not care about cleanliness was not. very disgusting. changing diapers in the changing rooms too. just rude
good,"Although it wasn't a very hard job, they held high expectations for their employees and the professionalism of the company in general was superior. The only thing I have negative to say were some employees were rude and didn't like new people coming in."
good,"Operations manager severely lacked people skills and was often condescending and almost always confrontational. Besides that everything was dandy, so I think it definitely depends on the department."
good,I usually work early mornings unless its a special event or the holidays. My duties are to put out the product that comes from the truck and place it on the floor according to the planner.
good,This job was very competitive and requires standing for long periods of time. Merchandise had to be tagged and placed on the floor. Merchandise had ton marked down for sales. This job was based on commission sales.
good,"This job was fun, but you stand on your feet for the entirety of the shift. The work culture was family oriented, and developing customer relationships with the clients was the best part of the job."
good,"Belk worked great around my schooling, and they gave you every day you requested off as long as it was far enough in advance. (Holidays are different, they have a calendar of days you're not allowed to request off.) Management was OK, communication through departments was rough. If you were good at your job, you got to do every other persons job as well. The work was fairly easy, but time consuming, which was good because it made the day go by fast. There was ALWAYS something that needed to be done, so the people that stood around doing nothing on slow days, were just being lazy. There was very little coverage when people called out, which was very common. Overall, great place to start work experience."
good,"I had to stock shelves and move clothing around on the sales floor. I worked in the mens dept, jewelry, home section, and accessories. It wasn't a bad job and the only reason I left was because I had my first son and became a stay at home mom."
good,"With the recent purchase of Belk by an investment company, employees aren't sure where the next cuts in benefits are going to come from. Ownership owe the employees some direction"
good,You must love working with customers and find a passion for your area in order to be successful.
good,"Everyone works together in this store and that is great. However, to move on it is based off your performance. If you perform poorly according to sales or credit application standards you may not advance. So it is very competitive to make sure you meet your sales goals."
good,"I worked at Belks for literally only 1 month. I worked with older women. (55+ years of age) The older women were more hateful than a highschool teenage female. I never got more than 4 hours a week also. It was just one of those jobs that if you didn't work there when it opened, you really weren't all that welcome."
good,"typical day at work-steady flow of customers, some rude ones, hour lunch break if you work 7 hours or more."
good,Fun fast paced work place although the site I worked at was under staffed and lead to over working could be great outside of that the people working could becoe very close
good,typical summer job for any teenager who is looking for something fun and paying well to earn good money to save for school. it paid well and the workplace is enjoyable and I have learned about time management and organization skills.
good,"People want to grow, develop, be challenged and opportunities to communicate with employees. Through project, an workplace helps employees to grow individually which may great for company also open communication practices will help to reduce silos as a company grows."
good,Belk taught me more than just how to be a retail sales associate. They also taught me about the competitive drive that it takes to push your sales and more.
good,"The culture at Belk over the past 1 and half has been one of change development, growth, and constant cultural diversity. Belk Continuously strives to set the bar high in terms of marketplace trends with other competitors such as: Macy's JC Penny's, and other privately owned retail giants."
good,"I learned a lot while working at Belk Department store. I worked in the shoe department, so of course that required grabbing shoes for customers all day and even going up stairs often. I enjoyed providing excellent customer service and the discounts that the store offered to employees."
good,Credit DRIVEN. The credit applications are the heart of the store and practically everything that they mainly ask for. Other than that the job is very easy and fun if your social.
good,"New owners are very driven to be a profitable company. Too many irons in the fire & struggling to provide enough support in all areas. Like many companies, talk a good game but not handling the transition very well. Pay is not competitive enough in the industry."
good,"Peers are very welcoming, no management backup when it comes to angry customers. Nice employee benefits, relaxed dress code. training adequate so you feel well prepared."
good,"It's an ok job during the months of September and December thanks to commission, but past those dates you hardly make any money or get any hours. It can be difficult to get time off. No conistant hours."
good,"It is an ok company to work for, that is if you like retail and liek to work retail hours. The best part is the discount, it's great."
good,"The company is going through changes currently, some good and some questionable.  However, these changes have not had too much of an impact pertaining to a typical day for a sales associate.  Sales associates are required to build customer relationships in order to increase sales for the company.  Also, maintain floor standards, solicit credit, gain product knowledge, and various other duties pertaining to the respective areas a person will work in.  It is important to work as a team to maintain the overall appearance of the store."
good,"I've worked for Belk for 12 months, first few months were good after getting the hang of things and knowing how to process the truck, working with friendly co workers. It's a good paying job. Hardest part of the jobs is finding something to do when there is no truck. Management became more strict after 8 months.  The most enjoyable part is working in multiple departments and learning different aspects of the Belk organization."
good,"My employment here at Belk was definitely a game changing experience. While I am a people person and love to be social, full-time fashion retail was not for me, at this time. I was much happier when I joined the OPS team and stocked merchandise and aided in the daily presentation of the store. "
good,On a average day i associated with customers. I also set sales and promote them to customers. I open up the store 3 days a week which required unloading a truck.
good,"This ideally is the perfect job, as it was. The employees are pleasant and management was amazing. One of the best places I've worked thus far. They have great employee discounts and they treat everyone equally. There were no favorites and you have a deserving lengthy breaks."
good,"My coworkers were the only good part about working for Belk. The hours are either too short to be worth it, or way too long. It's almost impossible to get a decent raise, because they base it on a point scale. Each point coincides with email capture, telephone capture, credit cards, customer service surveys, and in-store orders. If you don't sell 125% of your sales goals for the year, you don't get a point. you have to have around 85% for email and phone, must have multiple surveys, and a high dollar amount of orders. If you miss 2 points, you get 2 warnings then you're fired, no matter how hard you are trying. You are not recognized for any work you do on the floor, whether its recovery or moving fixtures and lifting heavy objects all day. The only way to make an even relatively decent living is to stay with the company for decades. And even then its not a glamorous lifestyle. "
good,"Like any job Belk has its pros and cons, but overall it is a great work environment. The associates are friendly and most managers are understanding."
good,Great place to work but very political when promoting. They do not always promote the most talented people. Heavily focused on recruited from Macy's instead of promoting those who have tenure with the company.
good,Managers do not always help you like they say they will. People don't do their jobs like they are supposed to. Sometimes in retail you have good days and helping customers is always a good thing.
good,"Mid level management overhaul needed.  Rates success by how much work gets done, not if its quality.  Need to look at different metrics of success."
good,"- sales associate "
good,"Management staff needs coaching, LOVE customers and staff, Human Resource managers was very helpful, my commute was that great"
good,"The typical day of work is come in clock in be ready to work hard and fast and emptying out 2,000 pieces or more  of various sizes off the trailer truck."
good,"I gained a lot of interaction with the customers, there wasn't any hard part about this job. I enjoyed this job very much."
good,It was good part time job. The good thing about this is the hours. I went to work at 4:30 am and got off around noon. I had the rest of the day to do whatever. The hours were probably the best thing about the job. Unloading the truck and loading them on the dock was pretty easy as well.
good,"My career with Belk was good. I was with Bobbi Brown. Store hours can be crazy, but other then that very regular and loyal shoppers with a great reputation in the south."
good,"Has its slow times and busy times around Christmas. As a part time "
good,it was a sesonal job wish i could of been put on full-time. everyone was easy to get along with
good,"A typical day at Belk would be, coming into work opening up the registers cleaning and organizing my area before store opens.  Once the store opens be sure to meet and great all customers, asking if they need help, get customers to sit in your chair to apply makeup or skincare. Make sure I'm meeting my daily quota. I learned a lot about maintaining a customer log and keeping up with permanent clients being able to get clients to come back to the store. Management was great very helpful at times. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to explain all the product to our clients and meeting new people everyday."
good,"I worked at belks for a short time , bring a graduate of retail school  I find their policys very oldfashioned!!!               they need to focus on rhe customers more and on other things less!!! they need to update their antiquated pos sooooo much!!!"
good,A typical day working here was easy going. I learned a lot from here this was my first actually customer interacting job.
good,"work 40+ hours on salary base."
good,"Running cash register and helping customers. I learn good customer service, stock and do invertory. Management was good always availble when u needed them. I really enjoyed helping the customers."
good,I hope to have made a positive impact with the excellent customer service I provided to Belk Customers.
good,The management was very insentative to the occurances in their employee's lives
good,"They are too tight about soliciting credit to people. They do not have enough coverage, but they are good about giving you days off if you need it and time off."
good,"As a sales associate at Belk, you are responsible for many different task, from register, on the floor interactions, maintaining of fitting and stock rooms, organization of sales floor (sizing and colorizing of clearance fixtures included), setting sales, and completing mark-downs, to things such as dusting the fixtures and sweeping up area."
good,I worked in the young contemporary and children section. I was always in both departments alone. Management was not the best and was hard to contact someone when needed in my department.
good,"Working at Belk has been enjoyable and easy to move up in the company until you get to a salaried position. High demand hours, limited work-life balance,"
good,Really liked working there . But wished I could get more hours . Seeing that I was full time . Really loved working with the people who worked there . And I think it's a well managed store .
good,I like the company I just wish we had better management and communication. I love the customers I just wish they would have better policy’s with returns
good,which they wouldn't of let me go for no reason! We really became like a family and I didnt wanna leave. I was the best seasonal in kids and they still let me go and now theres hardly anyone working in kids
good,"The job is fast paced with different jobs to do every day from sale sets to markdowns. To merchandising household items to men, women and children clothing. Management is really good about listening to issues."
good,"Belk is an exciting place, but very tenured and competitive. It relies on tacit knowledge coupled with innovation. However, the veteran owners of such knowledge are married to processes, hence causing obstacles when attempting to innovate or streamline processes."
good,I was there for many many years but was not compensated for my experience or time.The best part of the job was building relationships with my customers.
good,"Job is demanding with wanting emails, phone, numbers, credits, and meeting monthly quotas. "
good,"Belk has great discounts for its workers. Sometimes the desire to sell credits become overwhelming, but overall it was a decent retail job. If you don't mind standing and walking around a lot, it is a great position. Retail jobs are often hard because of hours and holiday craziness. Belk is moderately decent with all of those, and the pay was slightly above minimum wage.."
good,Management is great.  I only work part time so the pay and benefits could be better.  I really like my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is the parking.
good,I work in the shoe department so it gets very hectic at times. It's usually always busy. The management is okay I suppose. The discounts are nice though.
good,"Its great company and they care about you like you family. Management is good and they show they care.  I would tell anybody to apply, the benefits are okay, but you get insurance when they hire ypu. I love the 401K plan."
good,"""Hit the ground running"" type of atmosphere with colorful associate personalities.  Management communicates effectively and are dedicated to promotion and growth of associates.  Multi tasking is definitely a priority and time management makes the day run smoothly."
good,A typical day would consist of helping customers find items or return an item they no longer want. Management was very well organized and co-workers were friendly.
good,"Customer service, sales and working with merchandise, markdowns, signage, inventory and training.  The most difficult part of the job was standing on your feet for 8 hrs or more per day.  I enjoyed working with the customers and building a relationship with them."
good,"Love the people i work with.Can be stressful at times but that is with any company. Been with the company for 7yrs and have worked in all areas of the store. The best area was recieving,unloading trucks,setting ads and markdowns.I also enjoyed going to other stores helping to remerchandise the store to fall or spring looks. I also helped in opening the newnan belk and the macon belk."
good,I love retail but I needed a office atmosphere at the time and a straight 8-5 job time frame Monday through Friday.
good,I spent many years here. You do have the option to move around to a department that suits you. I learned a lot about customer service while working there. There is little balance between home and work though and it's a hard place to work if you have children.
good,Working for belk has its ups and downs you must be a strong manager capable of multitasking and handling customer issues along with coaching and managing associates
good,"Daily    production  work   day,   I learned a  new   task    . Management    was      satisfactory, coworkers   were    team  players,,  there  was  nothing  hard about the   job  at  all.  Going to   work  daily    working  with    my     coworkers."
good,The managing staff was very perceptive to employees needs and did a great job advocating for employees.  Coworkers worked together and helped one another out as it was needed.
good,Really enjoy the customers.  I'm in a tourist area and the conversations are enjoyable.  My immediate co-workers are wonderful and truly complete my day.  Most annoying part of the job is being required to open credit cards otherwise it's great.
good,"Though the management was throughly unorganized and indifferent, the staff, most of whom had worked there long-term, made working there enjoyable. :)"
good,"I mostly merchandise the store. i have learned proper procedurs when merchandising: how to hang clothes on the racks, how to color coordinate them, etc..."
good,selling anything is demanding you must enjoy people and think like the vcustomer in which the customer is always correct
good,The pay was good. I didn't enjoy the work enviroment. I was an associate for a year
good,I returned to retail after 10+ years in administration for seasonal work but enjoyed my coworkers and the atmosphere enough to remain employed for 2 years. I enjoyed my time there.
good,It was a good paying job. You can have fun and work at the same time. Easy to get along there. There were some problems but nothing major. The employers were helpful and friendly.
good,"you get 3 dollars for every customer you get to sign up for store credit "
good,"This was a very busy job, stayed busy. i learned the customers they come in regularly so i know them very well. The management was great and love the business"
good,Ok job low paid not enough people to work at one time to many clothes managers are good open early for thanksgiving and Christmas wish they were into the employee
good,This company is a really nice place to work at if you want a part-time job or need to pick up some extra hours if you already have a job. They’re very flexible with hours if you’re in school.
good,the job was easy to fulfill I learned how to do mark downs put items where they belong on shelves. management there could be better. the hardest part about my job is when they want a person to do one thing then turn around and call you to do something else when they already got a person doing a another. the enjoyable apart about my job was working with people helping customer's out when  they need help and when we did fundraiser events.
good,"Clock in mornings have a meeting open registers open door.  Put clothes away off racks, take care of your customer. If you came in after noon check dressing rooms take over so first associate go to lunch put clothes away we also had to sale credit."
good,was really intersesting when i got hired because the interview only took like 10 to 15 minutes and it was a quick process but then they dont let you tske any education leave.
good,"my duties consisted of accepting customers credit card payments  and assisting with correcting any incorrect billing problems, maintain/balance the daily cash drawer."
good,Management is sometimes not as understanding as they should be.  Fragrances and cosmetics is a great place to work. The girls up there are so friendly and it's like a family. The other areas in the store can be difficult to work in as there is an exceptional amount of drama. It's ridiculous. Shoes is an okay dept. to work in as long as you don't mind running up and down stairs all day.
good,It was a great experience to work on my communication skills as well as work with others. I loved being able to balance my work and social life. I also loved the discount!
good,"Belk's Policies are not to support the managerial team. It lacks alot of balance and authority to manage and maintain productive employees.A typical day was always off balance never knew what your day would be like with the inconsistency and high turnover rates.Management was unskilled, and lack the sense of responsibility, Most enjoyable part of the job was it was 3 miles from my home; it was convenient."
good,The meet was nice it was fun there. Working people wad nice too. The work was easy to do it was not hard. It wad fun to be working there
good,"I had great support from management, it was a fun place to work. Working as a beauty advisor gave me many new skills when worker closely with customers."
good,"A typical work day to me is when , you clock in speak to the people that's over you so that they know you have shown up, and get straight to your task. I've learned that working in retail has set ways of doing things. Inventory I would say is the hardest part of the job , because you have to concentrate to make sure everything is done correctly . The most enjoyable part of my job is unloading a truck, because you have time to talk get to know others you also get to work as a team."
good,"Belk was a fun experience. The customers were nice and the management worked well with its employees. The only drawback was trying to do the job of two people, stocking and running the register while tending to lines of customers. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience there."
good,We often had to work on our own which made me highly effective and managing my time and the task at hand for any given day. Management cared and would help you when needed. Co-workers were always friendly and willing to help.
good,"Love the company that I work for, I have learned a lot about Lancôme as a whole. Love the family feel of my co-workers. I am a part time employee who would love to be full time. The hardest part of my job is that I don't get enough hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new things everyday, and also interacting with my clients."
good,"A typical day at work consists of operating a cash register, greeting customers,clearing fitting rooms every 30 mins,returning items to the appropriate places in the store, offering credit, maintaining a sales per hour goal as well as doing returns and even exchanges."
good,"A typical day at work consists of completing transaction, assisting customers and constant interactions with consumers.I learned the importance of customer service and working at a team to get projects completed. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting and assisting customers, while the hardest part would be setting sales."
good,"As A makeup I show cased the product to the customers to enhanced sales. Customer Service, Cashier, company credit card sales, organizing and putting out new merchandise received in weekly shipments, and keeping things clean and presentable."
good,   Fast paced daily and always a new challenge that provided my expertise and  personal attention to detail.  The management experience and interpersonal relationships were exciting from a retail standpoint.  I enjoyed these challenges and always looked forward to what each day would present.  I loved my job and my store manager was the best employer I have ever had the pleasure of working with.
good,"Totally enjoyed working with the public and developing a personal relationship with each customer. Enjoyed helping customers coordinate clothing with accessories and contacting them when items arrived that I thought they would like. My pet peeve...is people that are late for work...and if I did not arrive an hour early..they thought I had been in an accident! The hardest part of the job was trying to achieve all of my goals because I wanted to be the BEST I COULD BE..in anything that I did... but the rewards were great. The most enjoyable part was making friends with customers, listening to their personal problems.and trying to help them in any way that I could."
good,I worked full and part time. Unrealistic goals for employees who work evenings. No customers? Can't make sales goal or credit goal. Raises are based on that criteria. Never got a raise.
good,We needed more employees to help us unload the trucks & staff needed help. Management was sometimes unorganized. The paid was okay but certain weeks everyone hours was keep getting cut.
good,"It's okay here, they work with you which is what I love. They are friendly and everybody tries to help if need be. It just needs to be more organized and better communication as any job out there."
good,"It was a pretty good part time job, they work around your schedule, and its not hard at all. The pay was not great but the employee discount was amazing. That's one of the main reasons I stayed for the year."
good,"Very busy environment. Fast paced, fun, work life balance is not a priority. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and interacting with customers."
good,"There are different departments of the store that you could possibly work in depending on where you're assigned that day. There are credits that your required to get each week but there is leeway if you fall short. Based on the town it was in, most of the days were extremely slow and you find yourself wandering looking for tasks to complete."
good,"This job was fun, I learned how to find mates for shoes and i learned more patience. I really enjoyed my coworkers because they were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was when my relief didn't show up on time."
good,Terrible work environment. Managers and human resources did not cooperate with associates complaints .Overall I would not refer anyone to work for this company due to the stress levels I encountered while employed.
good,"I was a sales associate for BELK in Conway Arkansas for about 3 months this fall.  My responsibilities were to focus on selling while providing the customer an exceptional shopping experience.  As well as keeping my department clean, well organized, and occasionally having to provide customer service over the phone.  I was put in the kid’s and intimate departments and I would provide help in other departments if needed.  This job experience helped me enhance my skills in problem solving, organizing, and handling a cash register.  It also gave me the experience in a fast-pace working environment as well as the in retail environment."
good,Great team work and supervisors. Climate control warehouse
good,overall I like I am not getting enough hours. I went from 30 a week to 9 0r 10 a week
good,"Upbeat work enviroment, competative, excellent customer service is a must."
good,A typical day at work would be going in around six in the morning and getting things set up for store opening also setting up the dock for our truck load of new merchandise.
good,Great place to work with flexible hours. Nice staff and managers. They make a way to help you learn what is needed to provide customer service for the customers
good,"A typical day at Belk consists of merchandising, selling, soliciting credit, cleaning, keeping fitting room clean, and setting sales. For the most part, it was enjoyable, but you sometimes have to deal with difficult people. The staff were pretty friendly."
good,Productive and a nice place to work it feel like family. ever day I have to count the two safes then do the deposit. management treat you well
good,"Atypical day here is full of hostile behavior and you have to apply steady sales skills. I had to be very persuasive and goal oriented. The managers were very imprudent about reaching sales goals and promoting seasonal items. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with many different people, some on different levels of affection. The worst part was the extent of things the company went through to get and keep the business thriving and achieving."
good,Working for belk distribution is over work for no money basically. If you are a temp expect nothing but a cut off day. the people you work with are good but the company itself is not.
good,Was a good place to work. I enjoyed my time there. I am glad they gave me good training and experience. Was a good team. I really enjoyed everything overall. The management deff. needs help though they were a mess.
good,It is not the best job! If it was I wouldn’t be on here trying to get another! I would recommend if you like old people. Not the best management or schedule
good,"I was hired as a salesperson at less then 9 dollars an hour. However,  after leaving i had experience in electrical wiring  I was performing wiring task and other electrical maintenance at the same job title and pay scale. Over all I think belk is a very good department store as long as they don't have people like Fred in in management."
good,"Belk is not a bad place to work, but it can get busy and hectic. When at work the break is not that long considering your consistency standing up on your feet."
good,"If you're a student and don't want to work from 4-8 am, then don't apply for this job. other than that it is a pretty easy job. I usually busted out the earbuds to listen to music while working because it was boring labor. Got along well with everyone there though"
good,The manager was ok but the actual managers of the Lancome counter could use improvement.  The cosmetic manager was great but the Lancôme crew and their managers need improvement.
good,Working for Belk was a great experience in customer service and if I cuold work there again would be a honor. Had great co-workers..
good,Great business. In fact one of the best I've worked. I only wished I could 've got more hours. I enjoyed working at this company.honored.
good,I had a good time at this job I was always counting inventory which made the time go by fast and it always had its ups and downs like any other job.
good,always find something to keep you busy.  Managers however have no understanding on how to provide employees constructive feedback and/or proper training.
good,"While working at Belk, there has been five people leave. They have all gone to a new job because working at Belk was a bad experience for them. The hours are horrible, as a full time employee I may get 32 hours a week instead of 35 or more that I need. The management is also very close minded and require so much from their sales associates. The only good thing I have gotten put of working at Belk is a few good friendships with some of the girls I work with."
good,At Belk pecan land Mall u don't get paid what they say 4 hour or 5 hours anit what they tell you one person have to work in big store buy they self it's alot of work for one person they don't want you take a break
good,I would have stayed with Belk.  Was promised hours of at least 15-25. Started ok but gradually dropped off to 9hrs.  Scheduler was hiring new employees instead of giving hours to current employees. When employees are promised hours not getting them is horrible.  I could not even see driving to work for 3 3hr days.  Wear and tear on vehicles along with gas prices were not cost effective.
good,"After working for Belk for 8 years, I was never offered a chance to  go into management . Their was always an excuse as to why I could not go into management. Always felt they showed  favoritism  with certain employees  and overlooked the ones who work hard and made sure their job was done  properly ."
good,"Not enough staff was scheduled to get the job done. Store was extremely dirty. Weeks went by between vacuuming. There was only 1 person to keep 2 stores clean."
good,Belk use to be an amazing place to work. New management at corporate and store level has changed from one of customer comes first to operations focus.
good,"definitely my favorite job I've worked in retail. I enjoy working independently (with as little co-worker interaction as possible) & Belk was perfect for that. management didn't train me, it was kind of up to us to learn as we went. the pay was decent for a part time job in retail, especially compared to their competitor stores. overall, I loved working there and learned a lot."
good,"I enjoyed working here, as the customers were a delight. They really looked forward to being helped and were patient if you were helping someone else. My co-workers were very helpful knowing I was new to the cash machine, especially wanting to give customers every discount they were entitled to. One of the hardest for me was learning all the different keys on the register."
good,"full time "
good,The workplace environment was mainly fast paced depending on the day. Most of the co-workers were easy to get along with but the management was unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was tolerating disrespect from some customers and the managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friends I made while working there.
good,This store is better than JC Penny or Sears. The new owners appear to be absent minded of employees happiness. I hate working on Thanksgiving Day. Favoritism and Politics runs management employee scheduling and moving from part-time to full-time.
good,Belk was an interesting place to work. It was fun helping customers locate items of clothing they needed. I also enjoyed working on wall displays and putting together outfits for display.
good,"I worked 12 hours a day, co-workers were very nice. I enjoyed the people but not the place. Security was like going through the airport and were very unfair, rude, and needed to be checked. Management was nice but very unorganized. I enjoy the people and job but the place is not the best place to work."
good,"Exciting place to work, people were great even most customers. i learned how to do alot especially folding clothes. I would to go back seasonal"
good,"typical day would be slow,  I learned to be a bridal consultant.  the managers were ok.  my co workers were focused.th hardest part was making sure orders were correct and shipped to the right place.  the most enjoyable part was the raises"
good,Learned something new about clothes and styles daily.  Had usual customers that came in a few times a week.  I really liked my manager I had he new when to relax and when to get the job done.  I did not really talk to my co-workers a lot simply because I felt that they talked to much at work.  The hardest thing about this job was having to learn the different style of dresses.  Every time I had to put dresses out I messed them up.  I tried my best to learn it and just could never get it.  Best part of this job was the customers.
good,"Customer service. Put out clothes, help customers, make it a neat and great shopping experience."
good,"If your loolking for a job belk is, a nice place to work, but not so friendly management. The hours are good, company doesnt work with you as far as time off and things when you first start with the temp company."
good,"belk is an interesting place to work , their are plenty of opprotunities to cross train , but the pay sucks. the hours you need are never the hours you get . their are always scheduling issues . the staff is great . management is ok , ive worked their 6 months and every supervisor still asks me my name even though ive been introduced to them multiple times"
good,"	Provide customer service and assistance, operate cash register, and greet all customers."
good,part time hours may exceed 30+ hours per week depending on the season
good,Easy job but was in a bad store. Store manager was completly useless about LP. I left a good store and was mislead about the manager position. Poor and outdated equipment.
good,"Good place to work but as a full time person with no benefits offered it had its perks certain time you made above your expected goal and the pay balanced out .It wasn't work cashiering , putting out merchandise assist customers it had opportunity for advance ."
good,"Overall the job is okay, however the schedule is not good. Most times you are scheduled in the middle of the day and that doesn't allow time for taking care of things outside of work."
good,"Everyday you clock in and then head to the floor to assist customers  with whatever they need. You learn you have to be patient and keep a smile on your face at all times of the day.Management will always have it ups and downs. There are a lot of great co-workers that are like family, and then there are some you wish would get fired. The hardest part would be working at your absolute max level and surpassing your goals and still feeling unappreciated. I love the fact of meeting new people from all around."
good,Demanding work environment. Not much room for growth. Good associate discounts. Old school culture - not all part of the organization believe in flexible work environment (ie. Work from home or Flexible work schedule).
good,"A typical day of Opening the store included a morning meeting, straightening your work space and assigned store area, and balancing the registers. The company had great values, morals and integrity based guidelines, unfortunately this particular store did adhere to that."
good,"Other than my manager being a total _____ and my other manager being the definition of harassment, it was wonderful working there. Until they dramatically cut my hours to 10 hours a week. I eventually put my 2 weeks notice in to relocate with my husband."
good,"Great place to work, but many changes through the years that do not necessarily benefit the employees. Cuts tend to come from employee benefits and wages rather than corporate."
good,"A typical day consisted of assisting customers, operating the cash register, and keeping sales floor and stock room neat and orginized. I learned from my manager how to be a good leader and how to get to know the people working under you. I also learned how not to be a good manager by the head store manager who didnt get to know any of the employees personally and had poor leadership skills. My co-workers were very friendly and fun to interact with. it was like one big family. The hardest part of the job was probably when it was a slow day and trying to find something to do to stay busy. I like to stay busy and work at a fast pace and sometimes i was unable to do that."
good,"A nice place to work, sometimes Management overwork you and don't care too much about how Associates feel."
good,the job is very hands on with customers. U have to help woman position there selves in the undergarments and make sure they love the fit. Bra fitting events are fun an exciting. There normally is music and light refreshments for customers.
good,Working in a different area people were really competitive we worked on sales and the more sales you got at the end of your shift the better. When your evaluation came up if you were below sales for the year it was possible you got a decrease in your pay.
good,The most enjoyable day thing at work for me is to make sure the customer is happy. I love to see that the customer is happy and satisfied with their purchase.
good,a usual work day has cleaning your area and picking through things customers left sitting around. this is the easiest but most tedious part of working in a department store.
good,"This was a great place to work, there were great people there at the time of my employment. I enjoyed the competition. Upper inhouse management is what hurt the company."
good,ok place to work. immediate management is great but wasn't a fan of corportate. they are too hatrd on their managers and do not give them the recognition the deserve
good,"Enjoyed working with Belk at the start, but culture shifted after company aquired by outside retail group and family ownership sold off. Every week it's setting up for a new ""sale"" and it just make work with hardly any change in actual sale prices."
good,"High turnover. Scheduling was inconsistent. Not enough training for new associates before the holiday season. Store sales per hour goals forced us to spend time away from our counter goals."
good,I want for belk for 3 years. At this time I was going through a hardship in my life. My store manager who took over in 2013 had an opportunity to give me the pay I needed to reach income standard but he refused to do it.
good,I really enjoyed meeting the people I worked with. I learned to work in a fast paced environment and make sales. I did get stressed often because I worked in the Misses department and most of the time it was by myself and it is the busiest department besides shoes.
good,"A typical day at work was never too stressful but in retail, we are understaffed a lot of times. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers shop for what they need. Its a pleasure to get the know them and their needs. The hardest part of my job is keeping everyone happy, sometimes you will have angry customers and I'm aware thats not my fault."
good,"The joy always came from assisting and meeting customers. "
good,"Relaxed management is a great plus, but getting real answers to questions was an ongoing effort. Co-workers were gracious and fun to be around. Altogether, a pleasant experience."
good,Great company but not what I wanted. Management is not good at all. They dont care about associates.
good,"I worked there for a short period of time, but I did enjoy it. The staff were nice and helpful at times. The only issues I would really have was that I would be given times that would conflict with school or hours that I could not work because during that time I was using public transportation, which was made clear several times."
good,I had to great store manager and it made life fun and you wanted to go to work. Belk was large and very fast. Then I got my 3rd store manager and my life went from happy happy to very unhappy and I ended up quiting
good,Have enjoyed the opportunity for growth in a fast paced environment. I have specifically enjoyed the opportunity to excel in a Flagship store
good,Belk has amazing co-workers. I could not have made it through my day with out the people I worked with.
good,Belk gave me a job and I showed them I was a tough and hard worker. They were willing to working around other's schedules but I was told they would not work with mine and they knew I had another job.
good,My co-workers were very nice and helpful people. They always helped me if I needed anything. Management could use a little help. One or two of the managers were very unprofessional and made comments in front of customers. Never really got a choice in schedule/hours. Getting to know about certain aspects of the retail business was a highlight.
good,"A typical day at work is some what hectic at times. I've learned how to be more business oriented and learned how to better manage my time. Management is okay overall but could use improvement in a few areas. My co-workers are great due to the fact I compromise and get along well with others. The hardest part of my job is having to pull other individuals weight when we're short on staff, which is often. What I consider to be the most enjoyable part of the job is when I can leave a day's work knowing I was productive and efficient. I also enjoy my work shifts."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in and asking the supervisor at the time what to do and get started. usualy they will pair you with a more experienced person to help giude you on what to do. from there its just repetition. Though a lot of days consisted with me having to start very early (sometimes 4-5am) it is not always expected of the employee to get there that early, as most of it is a certain department."
good,"I loved my co-workers but there are few hours to go around.  I was always early and did everything they asked, but had with less than 10 hours a week.   There also isn't consequences for employees who don't do there jobs correctly or come in late.  Hours are scarce and expectations are high."
good,"There was very little to enjoy about the day to day routine of working at Belk. Particularly if your job was commission based."
good,"I enjoyed working at Belk, I started when they had gift wrapping, loved helping the public, get ready for the Holidays. I later worked on the Roc Team, very fast paced, hard work, busy, unload truck, merchandise, sensor, put out freight, help customers,they are the back bone of the company, not enough pay for the work, liked the hours."
good,I’ve learned how to work quick with others and to understand them and have also learned a lot since I’ve started working there. Great time and always interesting
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, but they did not work with school schedule. They worked almost all holidays with little to no compensation. And there is no seniority ever."
good,"Great job & nice people to work with. Meet new people every day."
good,"For an entry-level job, this was okay. You get a feel of what retail life is like on a corporate level. However, at the time there was no room for advancement. Belk prided themselves in having 25-30% of their staff as contractors. No real benefits outside of getting a paycheck."
good,"Fast pace job,  I enjoyed working with customers.  A typical day would be very busy helping customers cleaning the department and working as a cashier though out the day."
good,"This is my first retail sales position and then I was upgraded to fulfillment associate."
good,"Great place to work if you care about the store. But hours are hard to come by the company doesn't value giving living wages or hours. So if you love retail but don't need the money, it's a great place to work."
good,"A typical day at work involves opening the till, checking the floor for areas that need to be straightened. Assess the number of guests coming through my area and ensuring that I greet them and let them know that I am available if they require assistance. I see if we need any supplies. I let other employees know that I have arrived in case they are scheduled for a break. The management team is friendly and encourages us to get credit applications and collect email information from our guests. The workplace culture is full of ongoing change, whether a department is being overhauled or there is a change in management, there is always something in the works. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to fulfill my guests needs and ensuring they are having a pleasant visit to the store. I love it when my regular guests come by and say hello. My commitment is to serve my guest to the very best of my ability."
good,"Terrific coworkers but insufficient pay. Frequently covering more than one department and not enough time to get all new merchandise out on floor, keep departments organized, and wait on customers. HR is wonderful and always works to assist employees. Great employee discount."
good,Good place to work. People are a good group of people.  Did not feel like I got any training.  Employees were very helpful in getting me trained.  They are cutting hrs starting the 3 week of January which is hard.
good,The pay was not enough for all you have to endure. There were some things going on with management that may have or have not changed since the management has changed.
good,"Cut throat company, Depending on your preferences I would recommend this job to college and high school students . Or anyone looking for something part time."
good,"Good benefits , retail has changed quite a bit in the past year, not quite the same customer or staff. There are growth opportunities as there are a lot of new changes."
good,"Great company to work with."
good,I loved working in retail but not for Belk. I loved the way the store manager ran the store. It just wasn't any growth there. Its just a starters job.
good,Belk is a very poised & productive work environment. The people are easy to talk to & likes to work. Very seldom do you find team members who admire work.
good,"I liked working for Belk's most of the times.Dealing with customers kept me busy and other duties,too.Management stressed  getting new accounts and I did my best to do so. I left because I was overlooked for a advancement and raise the time I was there.  I was a good,responsible, hard-working sales associate and I deserved better recognition for my work performance. I left for another job.   It is a good place to work if you apply yourself in all expectations                          of the job. You have to like working with people, communicate well,and be polite at all times. Management wants you to do your best to sell new account for company to keep  Belk's a competitive and respectful Company. An associate has to be efficient in prioritizing and completing a task in a timely manner, yet flexible to multitask when necessary.  Knowing some computer skills is a must because you will be helping online  as well as  using the register with every sale."
good,"Overall rating*"
good,"A typical day of work at Belk consisted of unloading/merchandising stock, assisting customers with purchasing decisions, advising customers about sales and deals, assisting team members in other departments with any needs that arise. The hardest part of the job was keeping merchandise straight during holiday seasons. The most enjoyable part was helping customers with their purchasing questions."

good,the job itself isnt bad. its certain people that you might have to work with. also its hard to make a living when you work a 35/40 hr week and then drop to less then 20
good,Nice working at a place where you can shop after work.  Great group of individuals that I worked with.  The managers were nice and friendly.  Never had any problems
good,"It is an okay part time job not many hours are given , however they do treat their employees like family , i have never had a problem with management ."
good,"The women i worked with were like my mothers,the main manager was rude, had no respect for ones the passed away.the hardest thing was trying to organize everything that you have piled up and dealing with customers especially. If by yourself."
good,"The job is good especially if your a student. Just do what they ask, and be prepared to know that the customer is always right."
good,"Management very positive and helpful"
good,The management is very helpful.the environment is fast-paced but most customers are nice. the hardest part of the job was rush hours . Keeping up with the pace of the work became challenging for me .
good,Customer service with specialty in clothing and design. Building and directing a team to perform and showcase great customer service
good,Thoroughly enjoyed the social aspect of this job.  Management unwilling to work with the hours I wanted to work.  My co-workers were wonderful.
good,"I enjoyed working for Belk's; I worked there for two years but since it was a temporary job I was laid off, and that really hurt."
good,"I am very happy with my job and look forward to growing within the company. I feel my talents and skills match the qualifications however, I'd like to have more opportunities."
good,There may be slow days but those days are limited. The perfume counter usually keeps you hoping... and if you have allergies it is not a job for you!!!  I loved it!!! Still find myself wanting to go back to work for a perfume department.
good,"I liked the new skills I gained during my 10 years with the company.  I loved the merchandising portion of my job, the business/sales analyzation of working in retail, but for the amount of work the pay isn't good."
good,"-Fulfill the Customers' needs as they come into the store"
good,"I work part time and I enjoy it.  Management has improve since the new store manager has been there.  Co-worker are great.  The hardest part of this job is the dressing rooms lol the women are nasty and the leave the clothes all over the floor, leave ungodly things in the dressing room on the floor.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers."
good,"A typical workday would consist of cash reconciliation, training new employees, conducting markdowns, recovery, assisting customers.  Working during the holidays was challenging due to the long hours.  The managment was very laid back but effective.  Co-workers were always easy to get along with and very helpful.  I learned how to conduct markdowns at store level and how to provide top customer service."
good,Wait on customers who want their gifts wrapped. Answer main phone line and transfer call to different departments. Balance cash from the previous day and get deposit ready.
good,"A typical day at work starts out with taking care of email, then I move onto the cash office were I prepare the daily deposit and audit, and research and cash over/ shorts.  I then handle any HR issues that need to be taken care of recruiting, hiring, training and maintaining employee files.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to plan and execute special events such as Charity Day, Friends and Family, United Way and Susen G. Komen events.  I'm very passionate about fund raising and helping out a needy organization. In my time as Manager on duty I work on the sales floor helping customers and merchandising the departments.  Management at time needs extra help and I never mind helping out with anything.  Some of my co-workers are my best friends and I enjoy visiting with them outside of work. I love learning new things,"
good,"Enjoyed helping others find the things they needed"
good,"a typical day all really depends on where you work. You can do anything from receiving truck to assisting customers with clothing choices. Management there consist of quite a few new people who are all still learning the ropes, However the co-workers are amazing. They treat everyone there like family. The hardest part of the job is customer service during the holidays. The most enjoyable part is being able to be involved in many things with not only customers but the community as well."
good,"- meet and greet customers"
good,Belk is a retail store in which I love it has a growth development it offer customer service i like that we do everything ourself in the sore the hardest part is when the customer's are rude and when the hours are being cut due to less sales
good,"Reviewed upcoming sales, new merchandise and made sure all signs were placed to standards."
good,"A typical work day consists of keeping the dressing rooms cleaned, straightening up any areas that need replenishing, and providing good customer service to all customers."
good,"It's a retail store job which can be exhausting. Belk has many sales events happening all the time and sometimes you just don't have the time to make your area look nice. But I did really like my coworkers. You will walk A LOT. Get used to 10,000-17,000 steps per shift, from slow to busy respectively."
good,"Pick orders and stand them down the line.when the product light comes on,Scan it with a rf scanner  and scan the location. Put product in container and send it down the line."
good,"I enjoyed working Belk, however, as a part-time employee, your hours vary.  If there would've been a full-time position with regular hours, that would have been ideal.  Great job for someone just starting out in the workforce."
good,"Once a month, the company gives its employees a double discount. All floor associates who help customers apply for a Belk credit card, the company gives the associate $3 for every credit they get."
good,This was my first retail job and I learned so much from it. I made excellent friends who taught me how to connect with my customers and build a rapport with them. I was trained in a variety of departments in the store and was able to help many people that started after me learn the ropes of the job.
good,5 years of employment have enjoyed it until new management August 2018 has finally taken the Accessories department away from me that I was responsible for since March 2015.
good,"Very diverse group of people looking to customers feel welcomed and engage with everyone, management is always looking for ways to improve and wants to interact with their employees."
good,I loved working at Belk. The management could be better but overall the managers are helpful and kind. The store was very hard to keep clean due to customers and how big the store is.
good,I have strong communication skills and love learning new things. My strengths include determination and intuition. I take initiative and can easily solve problems.
good,"Make sure,if hired, to always focus in on your work and not store gossip. Make sure to not upset management because your hours will be deducted. If there is ever a problem inform management right away,whether it's with merchandise or a coworker to prevent more problems."
good,I’ve worked for Belk corporation for 13 years in multiple states and locations. That’s a plus with the company there’s opportunities for relocation and growth.
good,"It is a nice place to work, with people helping you to learn new jobs. When I worked there I was taught three different jobs.I started picking,then I was taught put away. And after that I learned how to pack out the product."
good,Overall belk is a good company to work for. I believe there are things that need to be worked on as far as the company goes. Every place has their kinks but i do feel that managment and the bigger bosses of the company need to really come to the stores and ask the associates their intake since they work there on a daily basis and know the merchandise better than anyone.
good,"Great place to work BUT the management is terrible, more specifically the store manager. If you like the crazy holiday hours, the rush, meeting new people and a fast paced work environment then you'd love it here."
good,Fun place to work. Friendly co workers and people. I was the scheduler. So I was in the back most of the time. It was great until we got new Management.
good,I liked working there I liked the people.It was a great change of pace for myself.it afforded me the opportunity to see other jobs that are available in this spectrum.
good,The customers are the best part of the day. You meet so many and conversations just sprout of no where. It is possible to build of bond with your customers and they will always come back to shop with you.
good,I loved my job but need at least 40hrs a week.30 hrs a week is not enough to support a family.Overall I loved working with my coworkers & the management team.
good,"I did like working for them, the only problem is the schedules and too many managers. They offer didn’t agree on planning the floor. Overall good time"
good,I worked for the seasonal period and that was fun. The holidays working hours were long for me because I was working a full-time job. I met a lot of friends and colleagues. I'm really looking for full-time work that would offer more money and better benefits.
good,"I enjoyed working at Belk but being part of the cosmetics team made it difficult to move up within the company.  The management team didn't pay attention to the cosmetics department much, only when we were in Gift with Purchase, or other promotional events.  I enjoyed the team of people I worked with and had and overall pleasant experience."
good,Belk was a very good place to work at if you enjoy working with customers one on one and being clean. You make to make sure that your area of the store is clean and that all customers are satisfied by the end of the day.
good,Belk is a good company to work for if you are highly motivated and willing to put in the work. Working holiday and weekends are required. They have good benefits.
good,"Very relaxed environment, met my best friends there. Coworkers become family and customers also! Very flexible when working with your school or other job schedule."
good,Belk is a fun n good place work meet lot new people n learn how run a warehouse all together as a while fast pace n lots hands on so u get a good workout at same time
good,Belk is a great place to work and it's awesome they offer some benefits to part time employees.  I love that they offer a discount on purchases and occasionally it is double discount.
good,"Working at Belk has allowed me to be able to continue to go to school, I enjoy the people everyone is always friendly and always willing to help each other ."
good,"Overall, none yet. The hardest part is trying to elevate our systems and standards to that which we elevate our clients to. Some expect that we would be best-in-class on all things Human Capital, but that is tough and something we are working on."
good,"I wont say I loved every mgr in each department, but I certainly enjoyed working in Cosmetics, and the team we had. Everyone was a big hand during gift, and I think the others hated that, including mgmt. I only worked a few months, but it was definitely a great place to work, plus all the perks such as gratis were amazing. Our AR for the counter I worked at would always come in and invite me along to the MGR lunch mtgs which was always intense, but humbling being I was just a Beauty Advisor. Would def. work here again if time permitted!"
good,I come in walk the store and see if anything is out of place put up sale signs if needed set cosmetics if needed attend morning meeting check email for for updates and directives that come out for setups attend weekly planning meeting for the following week continue to work on projects by priority
good,Typical day involved high employee customer interaction.  The work was demanding during peak times and during holidays. The pay was not competitive and required A1 performance for low pay.
good,"Learned a lot at belk through training and the employees and managers. Slow pace environment with friendly customers and employees. Been working here for almost a year,10 months to b exact and I love it, just looking for new job with higher pay that I really enjoy."
good,"good, place to work, but it isn't family oriented. they have one goal and that goal stands for everyone but also distances others from each other. i recommend"
good,Learned a lot about loading and unloading trucks. Placed merchandise and  products on shelves and set up displays that were appealing to the eye for customers.
good,"I for one do not recommend working at Belk. The staff are terrible to work with, the management is always sub par, and they do not treat their employees well enough to deal with the job. Have fun!"
good,A great place to start career and grow your career.  Team members are amazing and the culture fosters creativity and team work.  Charlotte NC is a great place to live.
good,"Adequate place of employment. Friendly work environment, has its days but most places do. Would recommend to only patient people who don't mind doing similar weekly tasks."
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with, and the manager was helpful with the work when needed. I learned the proper way to fold all of the clothes that we sold."
good,Overall a toxic place to work once one moves a bit up the ladder. It reminded me of the crabs in a bucket. I wouldn't recommend a friend working there.
good,"Belk was a nice place to work and I actually enjoyed working there. However, the pay and benefits weren't great and I had to leave. It was only a temporary job for me as I had just graduated college. I needed more money and wanted to pursue other career dreams. I feel if you're a person that wants to move up in the retail business then this may be a place for you. It may take a while but could be a great opportunity."
good,If you went in and done job everything was good. Management was good. I met new people everyday.stocking the floor and greeting customers and checking them out was a typical day at belks.
good,"Belks was an easy going job , no rush and face pace working . Everything was smooth and flowed accordingly. It was very much quiet the majority of the work time not unless we had a big sale then yes it became very busy but on a normal bases it was smooth."
good,"This job is somewhat laid back, and it is easy work. It's a good job for someone with no specific trade or degree. To wok in the women's shoe department, like I do, you have to be able to lift boxes and climb ladders."
good,"Fast Pace place to work."
good,"It will get busy out of nowhere sometimes throughout the day. yes, you will sometimes get frustrated with what people say and do or what the manager say or do. but at least you get your hours worth most days."
good,"I worked for Belk for 10 years, and loved every minute of it! I am a people person, so I really enjoyed seeing and meting new people. I enjoyed getting to help people."
good,"Belk was a place where you had to work hard and keep busy in order to get your job done.  If you closed at night, you had to stay with everything to get the job done and they would turn the heat or air off about 30 minutes before the store closed every night.  That was not comfortable."
good,"Relaxed environment except on holidays, management was great as well as the co workers. The hardest part of the job would have to be working with the equipment we had at the time, specifically the registers."
good,I have been working online sales at Belk since November 2015. I also help place censor tags on clothes at times. It is a great place to work and I would highly recommend it.
good,"I enjoyed working for belks. Would still been there if I didn't take sick"
good,Belk is not a bad job. The only thing is management. They do not back their employees up. Also the scheduling is horrible. You do not get the schedule out in time to plan anything.
good,"Not bad, not awesome. it's a job and i made good friends there, but if you are looking for advancement and good hours, you may want to keep looking for a job."
good,"Typical day consisted of, recruiting potential associates, on-boarding new hires; training and development; process daily cash office duites; monitor daily attendance; process payroll"
good,I loved working at Belks. I enjoyed my co workers. The job was demanding but easy going. I got a chance to meet new people. I got to help customers. I loved that I was able to be a stylist to the customers.
good,"one of the managers was mean, but overall no issues, relaxed work environment except on days like black friday, easy prep work, and good leadership overall"
good,1st full time job. Manager was very considerate of work-life balance even though it was a retail sales environment. Decent pay to include hourly plus commission.
good,"A typical day is actually not the same thing happening every day. I do learn something new most days and that is helpful in my position. The hardest part of my job is when it is boring,"
good,"Belk is fair and reasonable workplace with a wealth of experience and expertise in it's workforce. Belk is staffed with many competent, considerate, and conscientious individuals whose ideology is one of great customer service."
good,"pretty good place to work.  Boss would give ideal jobs to their favorite employees.  super low pay rate but fairly easy job. "
good,"I loved working for belk but they sold the business to an investment company and things are changing greatly. Unfortunately, I do not think it is for the best so I am pursuing other endeavors."
good,"I enjoyed working there and meeting different people on a daily basis, my job consist of over seeing my department, audits scanning merchandise accounts receivable"
good,It was nice place to work. Managers are really nice and understanding. It was a fun place to work with a good team. Everything was great except the old machines that would mess up every other day.
good,"No room for advancement and pay scale to low. "
good,Learned to goal set.  To meet or exceed sales expectations.  Enjoyed establishing relationships with repeat customers and to fulfill their likes and learn their dislikes for their buying needs.
good,The high volume of customer complaints that had to be handled on a daily basis attests to this company's failure to properly plan for major events with a standard policy.
good,"The management at my certain Belk's was good and they helped me through some things. Although, the whole competition about ""who stole my customer"" even though they didn't help the customer in their section is dumb. No need to be all petty about employees trying to help YOU out with your customers that need assistance asap. It's about serving the customer to make them happy, not about you and trying to having bragging rights."
good,"I enjoyed working for Belk twelve years ago. A pleasant work environment the pay was competitive and benefits were good as well, plus you also got and employee discount which is always nice."
good,"This job was awesome. I earned lots of experience folding clothes and taking to strangers. If you ever need someone to fold your pants,  I'm your guy."
good,"Customer facing role including financial management, stocking and logistics and issue resolution. When it is a slow day I would  restock shoes to kill time."
good,"Belk is retail, and retail is never easy.  As a part time employee I felt valued in the way management was compassionate about my family's scheduling needs.  Belk is the kind of workplace that remembers you-  I walk into the store years later and still see people I know who welcome me with hugs and smiles."
good,"great place to work! opportunity to move up in the company. I love the fact that the coworkers are more like family, very close knit working environment."
good,Workplace provided ample time to get the store set up for opening as well as provided breaks at the correct time to make sure all employees were comfortable. Management held a meeting every morning which was instrumental in teaching us what our goals and obligations for the day entailed. All employees took their job seriously and all parts of the job were enjoyable.
good,"Like the summary states, it is simply a job. If someone needs very little money without too much stress, it is a good place to land. However, advancement opportunities are very few and far between. Employees are usually very unmotivated as compensation is low and there is nowhere to move up in the company."
good,This store was run well. I was a lady's apparel associate but also worked in other departments when needed. The store had friends associates and ok hours.
good,"Loved having the 20% off discount on everything and then there are double discount days when you get 40% off! Unlike coupons, there are no exclusions!"
good,"A typical days work included exemplifying excellent customer service, organizing merchandise and managing a section of the department store. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers have a great experience and leave happy."
good,It's a team culture with individual specific work assignments focused on departments. Engaged employees working towards success to meet productivity goals.
good,New owners are making great changes in merchandising and improved many benefit programs to attract and retain new talent.
good,"Developed stellar customer service skills by addressing the need of each and every customer that I interacted with on a daily basis"
good,I enjoyed working for Belk. I worked with great people. I enjoyed helping customers and arranging the merchandise in my department.
good,it is a high paced job but management and coworkers are supportive. long hours and not always family friendly. lots of room for advancement.
good,Worked there about a year and some change ..started in woman's shoes department transferred to men store. Made poor choice and was charged with larceny by employee. Definitely regret it cause that was my only way of income but made a mistake and learning from it.
good,The good times were really fun.  I loved the events hosted by Belk.  I had two sets of managers during my time there.  The first set was awful.  No management skills whatsoever.
good,good transitional place to work when deciding what direction to go in. ability to gain knowledge and experience in high paced environment.
good,"This was a good place to start as a first job. I had something to do at all times, and it kept me busy.  The management team were all focused more on the money side of things than the needs of the employees. All the coworkers i worked with were very kind."
good,"I enjoyed working at Belk. However, they did have a problem keeping mangers and proper management is needed. Great great Great"
good,The managment is nice at first and then if an issue occurs they begin to treat yuo differently. The managment does not adress issues right away when they are brought up and.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at Belk is that employees support each other , motivate each other, help each other, cheer each other up when someone has been treated unfair .   "
good,"I gained extensive retail and merchandising experience. I worked in several different departments over the course of 12 years, which gave me the opportunity to learn a lot. I really enjoyed meeting lots of wonderful people, co workers and customers."
good,"greeting visitor, handling manifest, filing paper work answering phone was all part of my typical daily duties learned a lot about merchandise by interacting with the buyer that would come to the distribution center it was a interesting job"
good,"Good working environment. As you expect from matured company, good processes in place for career development. Company invests a lot in employee learning and development, lot of opportunities if you are looking for a change. Competitive benefits."
good,"A typical day consists of clocking in, opening registers, attending morning meeting, setting up counter and readying area for customers. Once we opened, I would wait on customers, addressing their needs, both at my counter and beyond, if need be. I maintained and reset stock on shelves throughout the day. I rang up customers. I learned a lot about retailing and marketing. My coworkers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was when it was slow and we had to meet sales quotas and were't able to. I enjoyed working with the Clarins team and learning more about skincare from them."
good,"I would be responsible for the store during my shift. Did new hires and evaluations. Put out new product, did new resets and did price changes."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew."
good,Working at Belk was a joy. The people and atmosphere was great to be apart of. We were all a team there. I would recommend anybody to work for their company.
good,"Creative Workplace which takes a lot of energy. The day is always different for customers are never the same, but making the customer happy about the merchandise they have purchased. If the customer comes in with a problem, making it seem like it can be easily solved makes the customer continue their day happily and makes me feel good about what I have done."
good,"A typical day at work, was morning department meeting, and assisting customer with holiday purchases. hardest part of the job was dealing with numerous, rude and impatient customers. most enjoyable part was assisting customers in purchasing items they were in search of."
good,A typical day consists of working on the sales floor assisting customers with relentless customer service. I've  learned how to  satisfy customers by being attentive to their individual needs.Management is very supportive of all staff and contributes to the overall success of the entire department.My coworkers and I put forth a team effort to accomplish the company's goals and objectives.The hardest part is knowing that retail is a seasonal fluctuating job that has up swings along with down swings in sales which affect working hours.The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the customers that I come in contact with on a daily basis.
good,The job is fairly easy to execute.  I picked it up as a seasonal gig and they kept me on.  The discounts on the clothes were great!
good,I was on the support team for Belk. I set prices on sales and did visual clothing on mannequins. I learned so much from my manager there by week three I was doing everything on my own. My co-workers are still my friends they were so nice and it was almost like a family the way we worked together. The hardest thing was color coding on visual but i made it through. All in all i really liked it here and learned so much and met great friends.
good,I enjoyed working for Belk and would like to work for them again. Nice co workers Good hours. Job was outsourced. I enjoyed all the co-workers as they helped me when needed.
good,"Customer Service and sales with the expected highest level of customer satisfaction, time management and high multitasking abilities, friendly attitude and smile to match. My job has provided me with knowledge and understanding of patience in a high stress environment. The dept which I work in is one example, it has a hard time maintaining management staff. I have in such times stepped up to take on those responsibilities until a manger was hired in and helped to assist the new manger where needed. I have worked with some wonderful people in the past but some of fellow associates really do make the job worth going in to work everyday. I'd say the hardest part of my job is the hours. I am a single mother and retail work requires some extremely flexible hours which does not allow for spending very much quality time with my boys or to finish my education. What I love most about my job though is the customers and the relationship I have developed with them over the years"
good,Loved it. It is a great place to work with wonderful people. If you love to work hard and always have a new task this is the place for you.
good,Productive and fun place to work Reward hard work and blessed to be working there. enjoy meeting the customers and delighted by the good quality of merchandise and them working to come into modern computer times.

good,This position is great for a young girl right out of college who wants to get the corporate experience with a fairly large retail company.
good,"Good company to work for but love when it was McRaes and benefits were better. Things gotten better since changes of HR and some managers. The negative vibe and spirit, the intimidation from the former HR manager is no longer there so it's getting better. Wish hours and scheduling were better and the pay should increase for all workers especially when you have to work a whole area on your own cause of the scheduling."
good,I would open or close the register. I learned how to put clothes out in the correct way by color and by style. I loved my co-workers they were all so nice. the hardest part of the job would be sometimes dealing with people but other than that it was a good place to work. I love working with the people and some of my customers where the best.
good,A typical day on the job was assisting customers as well as talking with them. Some would come and tell all of their problems others were in and out. The hardest part was rude customers. The best part was the customers I met and talked to.
good,"Started in jewelry/accessories."
good,"A general day consists of checking out customers, recovering and checking stock, opening credits, and general upkeep of store and department."
good,I worked at Belk Inc when they were in the process of moving to another store and that experience was one to remember because I met so many people.
good,"Belk's is a great place to work. I enjoy working with everyone, Managers are extremely nice and are very understanding."
good,"I love the retail environment and all the different people and personalities. Many close friendships were made.  The hardest part of the job is working holidays hours, although my retail family made it not seem that difficult.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people, the fashion, and the pace.  I like to stay busy, I like to work hard...hustle and move.  My job in visual always had me doing just that...never a dull moment and my days flew by."
good,I begin working for Belk in December of 2011. I worker here mainly to make extra money for school during the Christmas break. While at Belk I learned to work as a team and how to provide excellent customer service. I also learned how create displays and make sure stock was on the floor at all times.
good,We would come in and open a register. We were required to put new stock out and help customers.  At the end of the day we closed out the register.
good,"Belk is a nice place to work. I cannot say anything particularly negative other than there need to be more employees in order to get all tasks completed. I enjoyed working there part-time while in school. The makeup counter was my favorite department to work in. The jewelry department was also a fun place to work. They push you to make sales and open credit card accounts. Also, you have to meet a sales quota but are still paid salary. Overall, a good place to work."
good,"receiving"
good,I enjoyed working for Belk and it was a great start for my professional career.
good,"I loved learning new things!"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Belk.  As anyone in loss prevention knows there are many times that you are waiting for something to happen, but when it does it makes the wait worth it.  I worked with a great group of guys in loss prevention."

good,I motivated and coached a set of employess to give them the set of skills to complete the job task effectively and timely.
good,"Belk was a flexible company to work for, but offered no static schedules.  This made planning activities outside of work difficult."
good,"having to build/burst china sets for customers.  The management is like any other management.  They all have their picks.  My co-workers are good people.  The hardest part about the job is really nothing.  The most enjoyable part of the job, doing what is expected of me, my friends, etc"
good,Belk was a great company to work for. I really enjoyed my time here.
good,Learned time efficiency and time management skills. How to handle customer complaints with ease.
good,This has been a great place to work.  Hours have been cut and am looking for more hours.
good,I input data for this company. The work environment was nice friendly people who are willing to train you. CO-workers who all worked together so that we completed all assignments
good,This company is good to work for when the economy is good.  I witnessed them cutting hours of employees so they would not have to provide health insurance.
good,A typical day a BDC is normal for me because I have been there as a temp for four long years.  I have learned several positions and also learned how to multi-task.  I have several managers at BDC.  All of them are fair.  My co-workers are very friendly and team players.  The hardest part of my job is knowing rather or not you are going to work a full week because of  peak season.  The most enjoyable  part of my job is meeting new people everyday.
good,"It was during the Christmas season so everyone was in a hurry, customers were slightly rude, and they were a little unorganized. Closer to Christmas we relocated in store to a smaller area because of customer complaints about previous location. New policy changes with the gift wrapping annoyed the customer. The disrespect these people showed was outrageous, but still I kept smiling."
good,"Belk is one of the few retailers that continue to grow, even in this uncertain economy. I have benefits, and job security there. It's a pleasure to work with the group that I do."
good,"Easy entry-level job"
good,The hardest part of the job was having to constantly pick up where other areas slacked off.
good,My co-workers and management team are friendly and personable. I enjoy going to work everyday.
good,A nice place to work. There job maybe more structure now than it was before. The management team is well trained. I enjoyed the customers and being involved with the public.
good,"great retail job, good experience in a department store. The best part was helping people find the items they are looking for."
good,Belk has implimented a system of quickly processing new merchandise to the sales floor. This system would work if there were enough man hours allocated to get the total job done.
good,"As with most any retail job, the pay is low and the work is hard.  The customers are sometimes nice, a lot of times mean.  As a receiver there is a lot of freight for a small amount of staff to process.  The management at the time was under a ridiculous amount of stress due to upper management that was later corrected after I and several others left including the store manager.  The hardest part of the job was organizing the freight during the seasonal shifts.  The most enjoyable part were the hours."
good,"i enjoyed working in the home store department and other departments when requested,i enjoyed learning the customer service industry such as inventory and helping customers. The hardest part of the job was making sure merchandise was priced correctly and in stock."
good,load trucks with merchandise to be shipped to Belk department stores. I also did some data entry with this position. I got along with all of my co-workers.
good,Restock of womens garments and helping customers with merchandise.
good,"sales associate"
good,Belk is a good company to work at and have the opportunity to grow with the company.
good,great working for Parisian but when company changed to belk  there were lots of changes and a cut in pay
good,Working at a department store required patience due to the never-ending organization of misplaced items.  The best part was assisting the customers.  It's a good feeling when you can merely put a smile on someone's face and/or help the customers find what they are searching for.
good,Some of the people are really nice. I guess it depends on the location of the store.
good,"I worked there for the holidays, so I did not get to learn very much."
good,"Friendly, supportive associates and management. "
good,You are always meeting new people and learning is endless! The hardest part of the job is when you first start learning how the store and different departments are set up. Once you figure everything out its a great job with great co workers.
good,"I would have stayed, but my father passed away and my Mother needed my help for several months."
good,Uses Old technology and most expired out of support technology. except DB2
good,Working at Belks was a wonderful opportunity for me to expand and learn. Just like working in a hotel you make sure every customer is satisified when they are in you department. Belks is a wonderful company to work for.
good,very organized and structured
good,A standard sales job with understanding management. Hard work but fun.
good,"I helped unload trucks, and worked the merchandise as well as cleaned the store"
good,Lots of positive employees along with a good management staff.
good,"starting with opening register and account for all cash, request change if necessary, putting new merchandise, clean up the customer service station, organize and fold all our products according to store layout to make them more appealing and accessible. help customer find what they are looking for, suggest new items for them that they might need depending on the occasion."
good,"Assisting customers with payments, purchases, and questions"
good,I learned how to merchandise the apparel and make the displays look more atractive. The hardest part of the job was having to sale credit cards to customers in a bad economy.
good,On a day to day basis I encounter many genuine and wonderful customers who are understanding and very patient with me when helping them takes a little more time. Even though I've only been with the company for three and a half months I feel as though I've learned a lot. My managers are great people who are always willing to help when you don't understand or need to talk about anything. My co-workers are also great. Sometimes its hard to get people to switch days with you if you really need it but overall they are good people. The hardest part would be the lack of help there is. Everyone who works in my departments are very hard workers but because we all have very different availability one of us would get stuck working a night by ourselves. My department was in charge of the biggest portion of the store so the amount of pressure on that one person to get things done and service people was outstanding. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to meet so many amazing and encouraging customers.
good,"I liked working with the public, helping customers, giviing positive advise always makes a person feel good."
good,"Learning to move merchandise around for seasonal items, new merchandise. The hardest part of my day is being at work for five in the morning to work frieght out on the floor for the holidays. The part I enjoy is when the truck is fully unloaded onto the floor and everything is put out."
good,Constant sales and interaction with customers. Work environment can also be fast paced at times and very slow at others.
good,This was the kind of place where you made friends easily of the co-workers as well as the customers. I learned here that one of the best tools you can have is friendly and prompt customer service.
good,"A typical work day would be opening the cash registers, providing customers with the best customer service, opening credit card accounts, folding and hanging up clothes etc."
good,"My day consists of assisting customers with returns, purchases, locating items, and sometimes finding that perfect outfit for an occasion. I also spend a pretty large amount of time cleaning out the dressing room and getting all the clothes put back onto the floor. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers find something that looks good on them. The hardest part about my job is trying to work the register and still manage to get all the clothes straightened and put back on the floor. My managers are very helpful and are always available and willing to help when I need it. I get along with a majority of the coworkers I interact with, the ones I don't particularly care for, I still interact with professionally."
good,"worked in customer service and also in the receiving sept. Took payments for credit cards, I also unloaded trucks and checked in merchandse"
good,"Monitored, trained, and developed practices for over 90 associates. The most enjoyable part of this job was being involved in two new store openings (training and monitoring the associates)."
good,Very fast paced environment. Instant credits are stressed every minute.
good,I was employed by Belk for 2 years. I was in Customer Service during
good,Work in loss prevention so i didn't interact with customers. Low supervision. High stressful situations occasionally. Decent business to work for in the loss prevention felid.
good,Clean friendly work environment. Low paying but great work environment.Potential to advance! Supportive staff and great company overall! Not enough hours giving out to staff tho.
good,Estaba padre el trabajo solo en ocasiones algo estresante. por la falta de personal.
good,A fun place to work and I enjoyed the co-workers and managers.  Food provided often.  Sales goals were reasonable and fair with out high pressure sales.
good,"Come to work do your job and leave, management is ok, 1 or 2  are rude, hr is helpful, it is what it is, do your job at your best, where you work and you wouldn't need to worry about anything or anyone."
good,"The Lexington Belk is an interesting place to work at. Overall, the work environment is fair. Management is good and I work with wonderful people, however, there are things that could be different. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship I have formed with my coworkers and the discounts that are available to employees."
good,"It’s a warehouse very stuffy and hot in the summer time, but cold in the winter no air conditioners just big fans. Just a fast pace related area. Very good people"
good,I enjoy working at Belk in the shipping and receiving department. However; I prefer to work on the sales floor and interact with the customers and co-workers.
good,"I work in the juniors or youth contemporary department, which only one other person works in and my second week on the job, she took a leave of absence and has been gone for over a month, so I am relatively the only one working the area so I come into a huge mess most of the time, if I open the closing crew leave clothes on my bar or pilled on the register and vice verse if I close, the opening people do so. It is unfair and exhausting for me to have to clean the whole area alone. I am full time and I enjoy the commission sometimes, but it is not worth the stress that comes with having an hourly sales goal of selling $500+ in order to get the 6% commission while having to clean up from the previous day and watch the fitting room too."
good,"Show favoritism based on seniority rather than production, credit apps, attitudes.  Very hard to respect this management when nothing is fair among the employees.   Very unprofessional!"
good,"I enjoyed working a Belk. They are good to their employees and have great products. If you want a job that lets you be social, then Bell is the place to work."
good,"It was a well rounded work area , i enjoyed the people i worked with . The hours were flexible , I got off in enough time to do extra curicular activities that were beneficial."
good,"I work as a sales associate, the job is fairly easy as far as the register. The training I got was mostly on the computer self-pasted. I feel that was due to me being hired as a permanent part-time employee. Most associates hired for seasonal are not trained as well, not sure why but I feel that's the reason for such high turnover. The hours are cut sometimes and that makes it hard when you work in an area like the home store. Because you have high returns and sales and also the bridal registry to attend and then there is gift wrapping for bridal gifts, with one person it's really tough!"
good,Belks was just a part-time job  liked the job just not the manager at the time  was working a full time job at deslee an part time at belks the manager told me I had to pick one
good,"I don't think Belk had any intention of providing employment, beyond 45days. There was no environmental training, such as fire, weather,safe place locations, lost child, medical emergency, so on so forth!"
good,If you enjoy helping others looking and feeling their best you should apply to work at Belk. The pay is excellent and the discounts are wonderful as well.
good,i was expected to move very fast all day to handle customers as well as take care of the department. The management was okay but there's no room for advancement.
good,The job isn’t really bad it’s just unorganized the store was always a mess there where barely any hours given and the managers where horrible help to employees that worked there
good,"Overall Belk was a good place to work. However, the hours are inconsistent and varies. If your trying to take care of family this is the not the job for you unless you are full time. Very flexible job, but holidays can be rough."
good,"Sales Team Managers are restricted on time off due to sales days. Always a conflict when time off is requested. Well compensated during Thanksgiviing/Christmas . Earn an xtra week of vacation "
good,Belks is an ok job to work for teenagers who really don't have too much responsibilities and nothing to worry about but for an adult who has to feed three kids pays rent and provide every day it just isn't enough due to lack of work and lack of hours
good,"It is a typical retail environment. Coach associates in the moment. Coach to all company matrix,"
good,I got a job here because of my mother who has worked for the company for over 10 years part-time. I met some really great people at both store locations I was at. I also enjoyed the customers. I would have liked more of a work life balance with rotating schedule for workers both full time and part time.
good,"Exceptional work environment. Management definitely treats you like family. Unfortunately, corporate restructuring restricts a lot of store-line choices and decisions."
good,Belk stays true to the southern hospitality comfort it began with. It's an environment that embraces kindness and customer satisfaction. Advancement is fair with longevity at the company.
good,it is not a positive environment to work in. the management picks favorites and can be very hard on you at all time they sometimes can talk very negative about you to other employees.
good,"Contract position- Full time positions are available, but hard to come by. Heath insurance is provided through the recruiter. Laid back dress code and environment."
good,"Belk is a fine place to work if you have no other obligations. I approved my school schedule by the store manager, then the shift managers refused to adhere to said schedule. Said managers would give me write ups for going to school instead of work when they scheduled me out of my availability."
good,"very laid back and fun, face paced more often than not, management is awesome and always willing to help.  The only downfall to this company is moving up into leadership roles and micro management."
good,"Great company with much room for advancement for hard workers. Long days preparing for visits. Holidays, nights and weekends working is difficult for families with children."
good,"At Belk I have learned many things, one being how to enhance my customer service skills. I provide customer service, and relations on a daily basis. Interacting with different scenarios and personalities. The hardest part of my job is finding out how to deal with each customer, and learning how to interact to meet their needs. But, in the end the goal is always to satisfy the customers needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is figuring out the customer, and seeing them happy and ready to get to know each other. Finding new clientele is always fun!"
good,"in a typical day, open the cash registers, then start on putting stock away, taking care of customers and checking them out. even on slow days the pace is still quick and there is always way to stay busy"
good,"Working at Belk taught me a lot of things such as patience for rude customers and how to handle situations. Management was okay, but could definitely be better. The hardest part of the job was definitely remaining ""cool"" with rude customers."
good,If you like working in a relaxed environment and your own pace while dealing with customers face to face this would be the right job for you.  the most enjoyable part of the job are the clothes and the latest designs.
good,this division was closed and all consolidated to charlotte.  when the division was operating it was a great environment with good collaboration.  great office.
good,I really enjoy the oragnization behind the company. They are very over informative to their employees and what's going on. They treated the store as home with respect and kindness.
good,I enjoyed working at Belk for the employee discounts!!  On a more serious note. I am elated to always assist customers with their shipping meeds. To see a happy customer makes me happy.
good,"A typical day at work is greeting and meeting customers. assisting them in locating their desired merchandise. Ringing merchandise and during merchandise recovery. I have learned that I love customer service, however, retail is not my niche.  The Store Manager is new at the location I work, she is trying very hard.  Wish her much success."
good,"Retail industry at the forefront.  Dealing with satisfying customer needs and accommodating many of the customer needs.  Belk offers great benefits through their healthcare plan.  Compensation varies greatly between associates depending upon seniority and meeting of sales goals.  Also, employee salaries were also cutback in some cases where associates had achieved their sales goals that lead to positive end of year reviews that saw compensation increase yearly.  Recently, new company policies saw cutbacks in full-time positions for operations teams, customer service, and housekeeping."
good,Belks was a good place to work when I first started but as time went on it went down hill for me.. The pay there was very good but I was only getting 2 days a week to work and only 6 hrs a day... I  put in a lot of work there to not be promoted or anything so I had to leave.
good,"Great employer,pay was good and flexible schedule  hardest part of working is the lunch breaks I enjoyed it because it makes a person grow and I learned how to lift faster"
good,"morning meetings.,Open cash register. if i have any shipments  ,put the stuff away door opens and we get busy in between times  call mclients.I enjoy."
good,Although it is the best place I have ever worked I did feel unappreciated. I got many compliments from customers but my managers never seemed interested in rewarding me.
good,"It is a good work place. At my store, I got along with all of my coworkers and management just fine. Management did not always communicate well though... For example, the assistant managers may ask us to move a floor layout one way, then later on if the Store Manager came by, she would let them know that they had us move the fixtures to the wrong place and we would have to move all the fixtures again to fix a layout on the floor."
good,"I worked at Belk for 10 years.  Today, the company is now owned by Private Equity and the company is completely different than when I first started.  It is still a great place, but the work/life balance has changed dramatically, and a majority of the management and the entire structure of the Merchandise Area is brand new.  "
good,"Visual Merchandising Dressing and organizing store to companies standards. Builiding fixtures and dressing forms hanging pictures, painting walls. Setting up events in store."
good,"A lot of work, not enough people. With that being said, management works 50+ hours a week & they are salary not hourly."
good,Managers above my crew were clueless. On how our job worked and what we need to get our job done efficiently. I felt that i was just moved around every where and it was chaos.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with customers and helping them pick out stuff. It was all about building those relationships with clients, so I knew they would want to come back and shop with us. I enjoyed working the register, especially during the busier times!"
good,"Productive place to work."
good,Terrible management. Completely unorganized and way too many troubleshooting issues. No structure or motivational tools whatsoever. Major confusion between two different temp agencies that are not in anyway on the same page. No advancement opportunities available. Basically just putting bodies in place. Work is only seasonal. Huge amount of layoffs.
good,the best enviornment of any retail business Ive ever worked with.company really seemed to care about its employees.worked really well with my student schedule
good,Short breaks. The supervisor was cool on her good days. If she was having a bad day watch out! It's a lot of walking involved and the insurance was not the best. Too expensive
good,"It was easy to work, a very basic job. Would start at 5 am and immediately start unloading the truck. Co-workers were easy to get along with, management was good until the new manager came then everything became stressful. Hardest part was unloading and stacking boxes on racks to go out to departments because we would run out of room or boxes would topple over."
good,"Busy, fast paced environment that included a team of operations personnel. I received and unloaded stock and disbursed throughout the store for sales associates to put away. I kept the warehouse clean and organized as well as the store in general. I also performed maintenance as needed throughout the store."
good,"Not too bad a place to work,  Has good work life balance.  Learned a lot of new systems and was able to increase skill set. Co-workers were friendly and helpful. Management was flexible and willing to work with you."
good,"Working for Belk was an amazing experience, here I was able to develop my customer services skills beyond measures. I miss from being there."
good,"Belk has a lot of great aspects to consider; great perks like associate discount and fun events, benefits, competitive pay, and is always looking to improve its company."
good,"running register, keeping area clean, helping customers, setting sales, maintaining sales goals, weekly conference calls . The most enjoyable part of the job were my co workers."
good,"A typical day at work, My first task daily would be to check the call-out line. After recording all of the call outs I would walk the floor and check-in with every departments supervisor to ensure they're fully staffed. Next I walk the floor an additional time to ensure that all of the associates have the proper ppe. I would then return to my office and print off the daily roll call which shows me exactly who's clocked in, who clocked in late, and who's absent. After that is done I return to the floor and assist the supervisors in any way I can help."
good,This company is somewhat disorganozed with scheduling but it has been a good learning experience. There are some really helpful people I work with.
good,"Fun place to work, get to meet different people and different personalities every day. Great work environment with great co-workers. Everyone was willing to help each other achieve their goal."
good,"Belk has been a great place to work. The team is flexible with work life balance. The healthcare benefits package is also really good. The team is young and is very energetic to launch innovative ideas and programs. With the sale of Belk, the changes in management have been rocky, but overall the experience at Belk is great!"
good,"Good family owned company to work for, plenty of overtime and lots of good management that you can learn from. The employees love the perks the company offer lots of free promotions for the employees."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was when they did the little things for employees when they achieved a goal or exceeded the goal that was set. I learned excellent customer service skills there and worked with great co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed working there and the customer service I can give it. Fun place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but it is a big company."
good,"I really liked the atmosphere, the people there i worked with were nice and down to earth. I really enjoyed working there but i mean what is 10 hours for one week? They would always call me on my days off to come in. which i didnt mind but why not give me some hours from the start?? Easy money your not doing much. You wont make much money here so this is good if you are a high school kid or if you are retired. Not enough stable income for me."
good,"Nothing but positives about the staff at Belk's.  Aside from a short period of time each year where hours are ridiculously long, great place to work,"
good,"At the beginning of each day we meet with management for Morning Rally.  This is helpful because it provides associates with information to produce better sales throughout the day.  We discuss goals for the day, week and month."
good,A typical day consists of pulling shoes for customers and putting them up if they are not bought. The management is supportive of employees.
good,"fast paced retail setting, learned a lot about how a large department store works. The pay is not bad but the company is not the same as it used to be."
good,Good overall place to work. Hours were long during the holidays. Salesfloor people are at a minimum and are expected to do a lot during their shift. Salary is competitive for the area.
good,"A large privately held company. Hours very week to week, hard to manage life and work at time. Customer often complain of discounts, coupons and sales events. Over all it seems to do what it thinks to build its business,"
good,Belk is really nice place to work i enjoy the new peoples that i work with and love the jobs
good,Provided excellent customer service to our customers day-to-day by making sure the right product was available for them and provided prompt check outs.
good,I enjoyed working in customer service the most.  I was able to learn new skills.  I also worked on the sales floor.  It was challanging.  I loved the people I worked with.  We were like a family.  I am still very close to them.  The main thing I had a problem with was having to get credit apps.  We had to get a certain amount per pay period.  I was uncomfortable pushing customers to get a credit app.  My co-workers and I worked well together.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my duties in customer service.
good,"Being that Belk is the largest family owned retail company in America, I take pride in my job and strive to be the best.  Overall, however, I feel that the potential to reach higher levels of achievement within this company is a lost cause, as the communication among management is lacking so severely that one could pull their hair out.  I enjoy what I do, but the lack of appreciation and sincerity with this company is quite disheartening."
good,I assist customers with their desired clothing style selection by guiding them in the right direction of fashion and assisting them with the purchase of their merchandise.
good,Everything runs great when you have fun co-wrokers. Management was great at the time when I worked there.
good,typical day at work consisted of customer service stocking
good,"Each day I pull the previous days sales and credit reports for the Region (12 stores). "
good,after clocking in for the day I would check the dressing rooms to see if there was any clothes to put away before the department opened. I then counted the amount of money that was given to me for the day. after opening the drawers. I would check the dresser rooms and take clothes back to there area. I learned how to be more open to people. I liked my management they would talk and listen to the employees that they had. My coworkers were great people. they were always hard working and doing there jobs wonderfully. My hardest part of the job.... I can't really say. It was very easy. the most enjoyable part of the job was when I saw the customers leave with happy faces.
good,"I trained to learn products and sales information, met sales goals with the team of analysts and artists, followed schematics, and reported to Sales Executives. It was a customer service-oriented position and required product knowledge to meet goals."
good,"Love the customers I work with as well as my fellow employees. Belk just doesn't have much room to grow. It's all about who you know and not how hard you work at least in certain regions and stores."
good,"I was part time and my schedule varied every 2 weeks.  Management was very supportative and I learned alot about the merchandise, ie:  china, crystal and silver.  The best part of the job was interacting with customers and making a positive difference in their shopping experience.  The hardest part was the Christmas hours (12 Hours a Day) on some days.  Also being on your feet for very long time periods."
good,"A typical day at work includes giving great customer service, organizing merchandise, and cleaning , my department. My ASM is awesome, she helps and listens. My co workers are all friendly and helpful. I love being able to meet new people."
good,"Laid Back in the evenings."
good,"the typical retail job although with out the support of corporate. The store solely is reliable for all things operational, custodial, security and financial."
good,"At the beginning of each shift, I would go into to the cash cage and balance the previous evenings register drops and complete all coordinating paperwork.  I would then take a walk through the store and make sure that all the sale displays were stocked, clean and priced correctly.  For the rest of my shift, I would help customers with questions and sales."
good,helped customers find what they was looking for and stocking shoes and placing shoes on the floor racks and finding the right size shoe for the customers aswell as doing markdowns and ringing the customers up when they was ready to purchase the product. I learned how to do markdowns the correct way. My co-workers were great to work with.The hardiest part of the job was stocking shoes. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people and helping the customers out when they would need it.
good,Team work atmosphere. The meetings are helpful and keep you motivated. There is ALWAYS work to be done and the customers keep you busy.
good,I really enjoyed working at belk a typical work day constisted of great customer service and working with fun and knowledgable co-workers and Manager. i loved meeting and talking to new people made my day
good,"I would mainly be in the jewlery department at Belks. I would show customers jewlery from the show case, change watch batteris and bands on watches, clean jewlery, etc. Managment can be kind of strict at times, but we always worked well together. the hardest part of the job was getting hours for the week to work. Most enjoyable part was the people that I worked with, the always kept work exciting and enjoyable."
good,"Opening and closing duties, setting displays daily within shoes, jewelery sales, hand bag, assisting customers with sales purchases, completing sales, and inventory crew work"
good,"The company as a whole is great, but there is no room to grow. If your hired as a sales associate, moving up the career ladder won""t happen."
good,"My team comes in at 5:00 AM to unload the truck and process the freight onto the sales floor. We will set sales when needed, do markdowns, find and ship out RTV'S (return to vendor), transfers, and customer shipments. After each truck I fill out a spreadsheet to see how many cartons per hour we did. Then I look up the truck manifest for the next shipment. I've recently learned how to accept the markdowns on the computer, and open the store so the registers can be opened. Management works with you once you can get someone over by you, otherwise they are busy with other associates and/or customers. The hardest part of the job is housekeeping since we don't have a housekeeper, it takes us away from our main job. The most enjoyable part of the job is gaining new work experience."
good,"morning meeting, open the branch, count down the drawer and balance cash, provide customer service."
good,"Overall i loved the job, but they fabricated the amount of hours I would get. I’m glad I got the opportunity to learn new skills, meet friendly people, and make money enjoying what I love to do. The hardest part of the job, for me, was not being able to ship items on sale, because other customers had already bought it in-store."
good,"I didn’t enjoy packing . If I did another job maybe I would’ve liked it more . Also , third shift isn’t for me; second would’vd been much better. The pay was great ! Overall it was a good experience."
good,"Overall, rewarding with lots customer contact which was the most enjoyable part of the job.  Workplace culture strict with attendance and schedule adherence. The hardest part of the job was the work schedule hours, especially during the holiday season. This was an invaluable work experience on all levels, good and bad."
good,"It is a good experience. Busy usually, supportive coworkers. Lots of little perks with discounts, birthdays, schedule flexibility and an upbeat atmosphere."
good,"If you like working with people of all culture backgrounds, this is a place you will enjoy and prosper at, as it is a fine department store. Must be open minded to get ahead in retail environments."
good,"Because there are so many locations it's hard to review this fairly, my location in Bossier City went through a TON of manager changes in my two years there and that resulted in a lot of difficulty. The most systemic problem though is corporation wide- they want a lot of work in a little time. Store managers are rewarded for unused hours (15 scheduled per person, only 12 used, etc.) So there's incentive to overwork employees. This is a great starter job and helped me get through graduate school (as a merchandiser my hours per week varied between 39 and 6)."
good,I have worked for Belk for many years and it is a great company. Lots of growth and changes to stay relevant. My job is different daily so you do not get bored. I wish that retail paid better for all the hard work that you put in.
good,"Good culture with opportunity for advancement. Ability to be entrepreneurial and take calculated risks which is great. Beautiful campus with lots of perks (gym, walking trails, cafe, every day casual work attire, etc...) and you're surrounded by a lot of talented and motivated people."
good,I assisted customers in person and over the phone. I mostly worked in the shoe department and did stock and audit as well as working the cash register. I also worked in beauty and clothing. I loved assisting others and making sure they found everything they were looking for or needed. I enjoyed every employee I worked with. My over all experience and satisfaction working at Belk was a blessing.  I enjoyed working for Belk.
good,"Benefits and advancement is on the con side. But pro for the pay, location and job responsibilities. Advancement depends on who likes you and not on job performance. Preferential treatment for some younger employees and for those who management personally likes. Not sure what criteria has to be meet to get promoted or pay raise. Witnessed a new employee go straight to management within a month of hire date while some seasoned employees are repeatedly passed over for promotions that have experience and great job management skills."
good,Always do your best job and put your best foot forward all we respect your manager and coworkers.   Always communicate with your coworkers and managers and especially your store manager
good,Management was excellent. Workplace environment was relaxed yet professional. The worst part of the job was that it was very slow at times and you didnt feel productive.
good,"Like a lot of jobs I’ve had, you don’t really go anywhere with it. You’re just an associate. That’s it. You’ll more than likely never get above that. Management is catty, and lots of drama fill this particularly store (Denham Springs). If you keep your head down, you’ll be fine"
good,at times it is stressful. there was always a mess and customers were rude but co-workers made it fun. you have to just deal with the mess. management was good.
good,""" As a specialist  my key focus is to sell the the "
good,I enjoyed my time at Belk. I liked working with my co-workers and the environment. There was always something new going on. Customers could be a headache but with the right people to help you we always muddled through.
good,"As a seasonal part-timer, the hours are fine especially if you're a college student, but if you're looking for a permanent part-time then prepare yourself for hour cuts after the holidays."
good,Good at working with students class schedule. Easy to make friends and good work environment. Managers are knowledgeable and most are easy to work with
good,"Great people to work with and get along with."
good,"I loved this job, but with me being full time I need better hours and pay to make a living. I need to be able to advance in this work place but I can’t. It’s hreat for part-timers or people who have retired."
good,"Not a very challenging job, very simple. The scheduling was a problem at one point I only had 12 hours for two weeks and it wasn’t good for my income."
good,I enjoy working here.  There is a  great amount of diversity. The culture and the people make every work day fun and exciting.  I look forward to growing with this company.
good,"It was a small time job, so they wouldn't be a big payout kind of company. It was one of my first jobs and they were very kind to me. I recommended for my little sister to work there because I would trust them to take care of their employees. However for someone looking to support a family. Then you would better look into management or another company."
good,"I really like working for Belk and Lancome, just wish there was a better advancement program. you have to start out as a key holder for several month, but with no extra pay,just added responsibility Then you can go into the management training program for nine months and you are sent to another store. The store could be a long distance away"
good,"You pick up a lot of skillls at belk from people skills to skills involving certain tasks.  It can be a stressful job for managment continously changes. However the job is about learning to balance and adapt to what is happening around you. It can be stressful and some co-workers may drive you insane, but Belk supports its employees who are going to school and works with them."
good,"Belk familiarized me with various sales tactics, such as initiating conversations with customers, and not being too pushy. My typical day at work consists of making sure the department I'm in is organized, tending to different customers consistently, and providing a friendly atmosphere for not only customers but fellow co workers. The most tedious aspect of my job is keeping track of productivity(via computer) because sales fluctuate as the day progresses. What i enjoy the most about my job is the different people I meet daily"
good,"Worked the register, took care of customers as well as kept the dressing rooms clean and tidy. Worked the fragrance counter in the Menswear department and had immense knowledge of male fragrances."
good,the management was decent especially since I was pregnant while I was working here. they were flexible and understanding. they also allowed me to work in the same store as my husband
good,"it was a great place to work. nothing to change, most management left so it isn't the same people, but i liked it there. It was flexible for school hours."
good,Good place to work with good benefits and if needed could change off day.  Worked with buyers to get in clothing customers are asking for.  Small store that served community well.
good,"They gave me the opportunity to grow and achieve the highest goal in my field. They gave me complete desegregation with the design for Visual Merchandising, budgets and presentation standards. It allowed me to engage my creativity in many different ways from fashion to marketing materials to sensory perception. I was fortunate to have spent my career in such a nurturing environment that allowed me to grow and excel with the satisfaction of making a real contribution to the company ."
good,"I have enjoyed working at belk"
good,"Great work environment, can be hectic at times but generally a fun place to work. Never had any problems with bad management. There is a true sense of family with the employees at Belk."
good,"Belk was a decent place to work.  The work was easy and not too physically demanding.  Just like working any other job, there are areas for improvement."
good,Belk's was a fun place to work with great opportunities to meet new people.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being somewhat of a personal shopper for online customers.
good,"A typical day at work i cleaned my department and assisted all customers with every need, I learned how to assist customers with a smile regardless of the situation. The management was okay at times and sometimes it wasn't. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part about the job was learning every department. The most enjoyable part was getting to know my co-workers."
good,"About three days out the week, maybe four days, we will receive a truck and us as the merchandising employees must put away all the new items throughout the store. We also have about 2-3 sale sets for the store also."
good,"Modern, Southern Style. Wonderful place to work, lots of really energetic and sociable people to interact with on a daily basis. Management isn't always on the same page."
good,"No micro management as a specialist you set a daily goal for yourself. Read emails and send emails first thing to clients."
good,The structure and corporate climate at Belk are well defined from the get-go. I think the only thing I had a real problem with was during training the woman who trained me clearly didn't want to train me. I just wished they had given me to someone different.
good,"Work holidays, aren't guaranteed 40 hours with being full-time . Insurance is not that great. Lack of leadership skills from certain managers, not professional."
good,"strong team culture.  good training for management team to enhance people skills and presentation skills. good cross functional training between merchandising, store management and planning"
good,Its a really good place to work. The money is really good. We get anywhere from 40 to 65 hours week. The only reason why I'm leaving is to find a better job and because we keep running out of work to do.
good,"Most enjoyable part about the job was when we would get together in the morning and always checked how many items we sold. Also, most enjoyable part was counting the money and closing down getting ready to leave."
good,Experience has been good and the sales associates are willing to engage every customer. Credit applications are a high priority as well as email and phone capture. Overall the company is well run and efficient. The only downside can be too much communication and not enough time or hours to complete directives from these communications. Can also be confusing when changing stores because different managers have different priorities when it comes to operations.
good,"I was a contract employee and enjoyed my time at Belk. I worked in the main office in Charlotte, NC and enjoyed my time there. They are very honest about contract work and fair between all employees no matter the status. Good place to work."
good,Very energetic work environment.  Fun place to work.  Team is like family.  Competitive and driven environment.  I think it would be better with higher pay.
good,This is a very friendly place to work. The environment is family oriented. The hardest part of the job was not knowing whether there was enough work to complete the week. I enjoyed working with the nice friendly people.
good,"Enjoyed working for the company, but constant changes with management at store level disrupted the working environment through out the store.Employee discount was beneficial because you were able to use it along with any sales that were offered to the general public."
good,"Plans change daily and sometimes hourly, must be able to adjust and    change focus quickly. Very hard to plan your day. Managers focus on driving key metrics and customer service. Enjoy meeting new people and helping them with their needs."
good,"Belk is a great company to be apart of.  There is ALWAYS something going on! Not only for the customers, but for the employees as well. Great company culture as well!"
good,"A typical day can be long and boring, customers can be challenging at times due to advertised coupons not related to more than half the merchandise being purchased due to exclusions but associates have excellent purchasing options with up to 40% off at different times of the year."
good,"You have strong selling and customer service skills then you can handle working at Belk. The key sales metrics involve you being able to solicit Credit, get emails and telephone numbers. Along with that, you must be able to suggestive sell and link sell. You have daily, monthy and yearly goals that you must meet in order to increase your pay. All of the metrics mentioned about are all apart of you performance review."
good,Great company and good environment. The people were great to work with and it was low stress. The pay was slightly lower than the average for retail but the work was relevant to pay.
good,"The hours were amazing for me , it allowed me to take breaks to take my children and myself to doctor appointments. I ran the entire children's department six cash drawers and four fitting rooms , I also had to train new people when needed and was required to keep my station clean ."
good,"My experience working at Belk was great. They have awesome staff/bosses. The work is easy, and there were always chances to volunteer for extra hours which I loved to do. They also had TV's in the break room, which was cool."
good,Belk offers many name brand products that shoppers want. They keep their stores updated and current with national trends. They have a good sence of the market and their
good,Good company-limited chances for advancement-like working with the customers-have been with the company for 17 years
good,I learned a lot about retail and customer satisfaction. I was taught how to use a cash register. Some duties include checking dressing rooms every 30 minutes and assisting customers on the sales floor.
good,"A southern retail department store. Employs 60-80 people. Customer service, operations, human resource, cashiers, cash office, visual merchandiser, management."
good,"had good hours nice people to work with . the manager was very nice and caring, lot of training and hand on training tooI enjoy it and would work for them again."
good,"We were expected to perform. The tasks we were expected to perform included (but were not limited to) the following: I would come to work, open the registers, set sales signs, help the crew responsible with receiving new merchandise, organize my area and make sure the store looks neat, welcome customers into the store and help them with anything they may need, check and clean up the dressing rooms, check customers out, and giftwrap their purchases if needed. Some days were great and others not so much. Customers vary greatly and at times, they can really bring you down. But as they say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I learned a lot about myself during my experience there. I also learned to be more patient as well as the true meaning of multitasking. I also enjoyed the benefits such as discount codes available to us at all times and free gifts based on our performances."
good,Belk has been an amazing experience.  I have learned more in my 2 years at Belk than I have learned throughout the duration of my career.
good,"They always keep you busy. More than likely you will never run out of work to do, which is always a good thing. The management is fine, although it could be much better."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of ringing up customers and answering any questions they had about different products offered. Things got stressful around the holidays. "
good,"Belk was a good place to work, very friendly associates that all got along. I loved working in cosmetics everyone was fair and you were rewarded for your good work."
good,"A typical work day began at the scheduled time, after  we clocked in I would find a manager a get the daily bliss (newsletter) which would tell me which department i was to work in that day. While i was employed there i learned how to size the items on the racks as well as zone them, and how to recover the merchandise an re-rack it. Management was usually helpful and pleasant. The team members (co- worker) were friendly an productive to the over all common good of our store.The hardest part of this job was using item locator, because it would to find a specif item for a customer. The most enjoyable part of my day was the face to face customer interaction."
good,"A typical day at work included greeting customers, assisting customers with their purchases using a point-of-sales machine. I helped customers with locating items, exchanging or returning items. I learned how to better assist customers by providing them with excellent service. Management did not micro-manage and hover within their departments. My co-workers were helpful, friendly, and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of the job was asking customers to fill out credit card applications. l enjoyed most was to make the customers happy."
good,This job was fun and easy. It paid well for a short period of time. The management was very poor. The moral was low in the store and employee issues were overlooked. The management has since changed.
good,It is a great company to work for. They offer good benefits and compensation. They offer many opportunities to grow with the company and advance.
good,The managers are friendly as well as the associates. The work environment is excellent and there are opportunities to excel.
good,"Meet good friends "
good,"Every day I had the pleasure of meeting new people, and assisting them with anything they needed. I also had the opportunity to develop my own clientele book for my everyday customers, which gave me a chance to know them more personable.  What I learned at this job was customer service skills, in person and on the phone. My co-workers were great to work with. We always stood together as a team, and helped each other as much as we could.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I could make someone happy even just by helping them with the smallest thing."
good,I enjoyed my job here I found something that was not a up to my understanding of liking. I used my knowledge of retail to help my bosses see I understood a planogram to a floor move.
good,A company that allows you to grow. Must be able to meet sales and credit quota to excel into a pacesetter. Great for part-time employment.
good,"Working at Belk is a pretty straight forward job as far as work goes. They have plenty of benefits, discounts and descent hours. The only real problem you will have is with the staff at the store from your managers or other associates and some customers . Overall it a ok job with some room for advancement and paid raises."
good,Belk is a great environment and fun place to work. Hours are a little difficult and not always enough. Co-workers are always great to work with and managers tried to work around my needs as much as possible. Pay was comparable to other retail in the area.
good,typical day was putting up stock and assisting customers.  learned quite a bit about merchandising.  management was receptive and down to earth.  coworkers were knowledgeable and fun to work with.  hardest part of the job was working very holiday.  most enjoyable part of the job was deep discounts.
good,"Belk, Clinique is a great place to work and I have made lasting friendships. I love my manager.  I do makeovers and skin workshops and help thousands of people during Gift with Visit.  I love to restock and do display work.   It really makes my day when I can turn someone's day around through conversation and positive customer service."
good,"My typical day at Belk would be to clock in and basically get  straight to work, whether it was recovering the sales floor, doing markdowns, or working at the register. If you work the morning shift, you start your day by attending a staff meeting where you find out how the store and sales are doing statistically and then are given your assignments for the day. The only problem I had with belk was that the significantly cut hours without any type of explanation or anything."
good,Room for advancement within the company. Enjoyed working with the customers and the employees.
good,"A typical day at work for me is to assist the customer with the merchandise, work cash register and receiving monies and other transitions.  I learn more how to handle situation that can be turn the wrong way with customers that are hard to deal with.  Management is very helpful in trying to help with the situation.  I enjoy working with my co-workers because we are team player.  The hardest part of the my job is when we have to turn people down when we do credit application and the customer is denied.  It is hard to tell them that they are denied.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people and communicating with the customers."
good,a typical day at belks is too learn something new such as new challenges.And also too meet those new challenges .greet customers and meet all there needs .make sure they leave feeling great.management allways give me that challenge if its credit card apps or if its making the department neat and clean .my co works are always looking at me as a leader and wanted the most knowledge  so they can become a leader as well.the hardest part of job is too balance out all responsibility and duty's that i am giving but at the end of the day i manage too succeed.the most enjoyable part of my job is too make the customer feel like they got the best customer service that they ever got witch makes me feel like im doing the right things too help the company.
good,"Sell shoes"
good,Skills were easy to obtain and materials where at your fingertips to be able to advance and maintain a healthy work environment. Co - Workers are easy going laid back individuals and took pride in their work.
good,A typical fun job for a college student. Great place to meet people within the community.
good,"Retail store. Sales Floor - very goal-oriented workplace. Busy with no time to loaf!"
good,"Belk's was a great Job. I was on my feet almost constantly but it was an active day each time. I was able to befriend my coworkers for easier interaction between us during the day. My manager specifically was very kind and motivating. She was a very serious hard worker with a pleasant personality and I wasn't afraid to speak to her about any problems I was having if any occurred. They enjoyed boosting moral often and keeping their employees very happy in order to keep their customers happy. We had personal basis with a lot of the customers and often times spoke with loyal repeat customers as formal friends. I would often go out of my way to assist a customer in order for them to have a quality visit to Belk's and shopping experience. This could, and often did, happen by telling the customer how they looked in clothing and offering suggestions as to which outfit would appear better to their body type. This had to be done with extreme care to not offend the customer in any ways. I did not much like putting the clothes away because we often reorganized the racks and it often felt like a maze in the short time I worked their. Many of my coworkers were not seasonal help like I was and would often steal customers away from me just to keep their sale numbers up and that often frustrated me but I just tried harder to make loyal customers who would only work with me if I was available."
good,"Belk thrives on Customer Service. Without quality CS it is impossible to have success.  I pride myself on CS.  Management has asked me to aid other employees enhance their CS. Most co-workers do NOT LIKE helping people to obtain their goal in Belk."
good,"Would merchandise and arrange product, be it comforters or china.  Give any customer a great customer service experience.  Was able to provide an awesome experience to the bride and family.  Would attend seminars about different products in the HOME Dept.."
good,"A typical day at work was to keep the shelves stock, take care of customers, help in others depts. if needed. Management was very nice and friendly, as well as my co-workers. The only thing I didn't like about the job is you are doing a lot of standing and your feet will hurt if you where the wrong pair of shoes. Best part of the job was you got discounts of all of the stuff in the store."
good,"I daily re-organized displays for the new merchandise received, changed signage, helped customers with their purchases, and opened and closed registers. I learned to keep current with work as the business came in rushes. The management were professional and helpful when needed.The co-workers were nice, but usually overloaded with their responsibilities The hardest part of the job was small amount of staff on busy days. I would hardly ever stop at the register on a busy day with very few people to assist with breaks. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people interaction as people shopped. ."
good,I like working at belk but that management needs a lot of work!
good,I had a great boss and team. The targets where a bit difficult to attain but i managed well.
good,Ok place to work. coworkers are great. Management is great.
good,I enjoyed meeting new people everyday. Overall good company to work for.
good,I worked in women's apparel. Loved helping customers and seeing the new fashions. 
good,I enjoy it the manager was good to work for and the co-workers
good,"Working here I learned how to set prices, keep floor organized."
good,hours didnt go well with my family..pay was not very good..nice people to work with
good,"A typical day at belk, would go in about 7 a.m. completed the scheduling for all the departments at belk, and make sure that days off were approved and if not notified the employee. I learned to understand the human resources side of business. After being there for a few months had to have surgery, which is when I became the bridal consultant in the home department. I loved working with brides and helping the pick out items for their wedding day."
good,"Belk is a great store to work for. we have great customer service, and we try and help any customer that we can."
good,"A typical day is a morning meeting, go over sales, quotas, and goals for the day. Putting away returns, and dressing room clothes. Opening and closing registers. Rotating clothes and setting up floor movements, end/beginning year inventory, and clearance. What i have learned at this job is that staying onto of your job duties is very important because its easy to get behind. Having a good standing with everyone on your team to help get all the jobs done is key."
good,Good days at work.learned how plant runs. Mangment and co workers work good together well.the hardest part islifting boxes.the most enjoyable job is pay days.
good,I enjoyed working with the public on a daily basis. Being able to accomplish the tasks set by management and satisfy customers made working in retail a fulfilling endeavor.
good,I had to move away or I would of stayed! It was a great opportunity to learn about the law.
good,Customer Service
good,"Belk has a very proffesional background and ethics, however it is very hard to advance because they have a ""pay for performance scale which allows the company to add and subtract your pay every quarter depending on the amount of sales and credit applications you have before the quarter ends."
good,"I enjoyed working there when I did but, I did have problems with some of my co-workers. I went to management for help in which the higher up management would make the situation worse by demeaning my managers decisions about the co-worker."
good,It's a place to make a living . They listen to any concerns you have and work with you on your schedule. Show up on time do what you got to do and they treat you very fairly.
good,Picking and packing majority of the day when orders come in. The worst part is standing around waiting on an order and the best part is having a huge order to keep yourself busy. Which is a typical day at belks. I’ve learned how to read and understand high quality of products being shipped to other stores
good,"Motivated Sales, and Credit are the most important to Belk. My experience of being micro managed in Jewelry.The part time position has high or low scheduled hrs. Be prepared for 1 8hr. Shift a wk., or more hrs in peak seasons(christmas). A very good place to work .with.management"
good,Belk is all about customer satisfaction. They have a great management team that provides a wonderful work environment. I honestly loved working there because it was easy and fun.
good,"A typical day required making sure all clothing in your section were in the right place, as well as making sure fitting rooms were always clean. Learned how to deal with fast pace retail. Management of the department i worked in was super nice and understanding. Workplace culture was okay. Hardest part was convincing people to apply for a Belk card. The most enjoyable were the discounts!"
good,I enjoyed working at Belks. The people and team members we’re friendly and prices are good. They will save you money. I would recommend the holiday work hours.
good,Belk has decent pay and good management but the hours fluctuate too much. Some weeks you get 30 hours and some weeks you get about 10. Other than that the job is okay.
good,The manager spoke to you daily check on you and reviewed you to help meet your goals. Awesome place to work it. Great benefits to this place. Long hours downside. But love the discounts and positive vibes. The hardest part was working Thanksgiving and Christmas. Not being with my family.
good,I like my job. Working with the public has it challenges but overall you deal with good people. The problem I had was the manager. The manager did not practice what was expected from the employees. Not following store policy.
good,"Worked there seasonally. Occasionally you’ll get rude people but it’s few and far between. You get 20% discounts and hour lunches, and $3 cash for every credit. Always kept busy and rarely called in. Fair and regular hours. Annoying to work holidays but that’s how life is."
good,"L really like working at Belk. Very fast pace work environment. Communication could be better, but all in all I enjoy my job and the people I work with."
good,Its a retail work environment with a very friendly staff. Hours were unpredictable and at times insufficient for my personal needs. The work was varied but at times unorganized.
good,Very good place to work. Not very flexible with the days you want to work. I had only asked for Sunday off and I got told that was not possible at all.
good,I enjoy working there. Great people to work with. Management could work on a lot of things. Scheduleing more people each day for one. Departments such as sales people and merchandising teams could work better together. Management could use more managers on floor also. Make lazy people do their job and follow through.
good,"It's a very easy-going place to work compared to other retail stores. Since the store is smaller, you tend to see the same customers thus allowing you to build and foster relationships."
good,They were flexible with my hours and would give me more hours if requested. Didn’t like that the manager would seek out the new person and talk down to them like they were a dog.
good,"This was a fun part time job when I was finishing college and just getting started.  Don't recall much about the pay, as this was 20 years ago!  I do remember enjoying the work."
good,"Great company, great people!"
good,The manager for the evening was running around everywhere. I had no way of finding them without stopping my work to go find them. It was difficult to find help when I needed it. I learned to do more things on my own working here.
good,"Great company to work for, friendly co-workers. Managers are supportive. I just wish there was better opportunity for advancement."
good,"At Belk you have quite the diversity, many different styles, colors and sizes at Belk. The management was very shifty. There were 2 different store managers in the nearly a year I worked there, the first manager had just started, she was very friendly, and made sure everyone was doing the best to their abilities. the second manager was more headstrong, making sure everyone was kept in order, which sometimes she could be very rude and disrespectful. During the day you cannot have food or drinks on the floor or any personal belongings, you can only have water. You always have to dress up, slacks with a nice shirt and nice shoes, basically your sunday best. My personal favorite part of the job was making sure all the customers had a smile on their face, getting to know them better, and seeing them walk out with the smile on their face, like they got exactly what they wanted plus more."
good,Belk could be a good place to work if management didn't push making a Belk credit card sale. Some of the seasoned staff would give advice on making the job work more productively.
good,"You enjoy the perspectives of different cultures and overall people, and interaction with co-workers and customers .when you work hard and promote credit even harder makes for a successful days work ."
good,"Belk requires all their associates to juggle customers with bringing in new merchandise, setting sales, and recovering areas in which customers have been shopping with a focus on the current customer first, at the same time. Staffing is minimal, even when hiring for holiday, it is often a guessing game as to when the peak business hours will occur. Attained a lot of experience working with customers and building a team that could work together to attain a common goal. In the years that I worked for Belk, I created a second family, both with coworkers and customers, which was the most enjoyable part of the job to me."
good,"I think belks was a nice place to work at i loved getting discounts helping customers and making new friends, I thought all of my managers were nice except one but other than that it was a fun experience."
good,"Worked there for 31 years!! Was good most of the time!! Was asked to take early retirement or be terminated!! I loved working with the current manager, although it was trying at times!!"
good,Job is not for anyone who doesn't like to work long hours. This job requires a lot of walking and packing orders. They are strict about calling out missing days
good,the structure of the management wasnt great. some days management showed up other days they didnt. we open and close the store with no managers presents. was never trained just learned the ways as the work day went alone.
good,Belk is a great job if you are good with people and have a decent memory. Customers will have many questions about current sales and it's good to know things about them and look confident and composed while explaining.
good,"Good manager with friendly environment. "
good,Great company if placed in the right place. My last store manager there was incompetent of running the store sufficiently. No one wanted to work for her and it was hard to motivate the associates to put forth the effort for her.
good,"As far as the store goes, the management was great. I wish the same could be said for the corporate offices of belk. They made it impossible to fire people who did not properly perform their job, and they expect you to push credit cards with little to no incentive. They put quotas on everything, which made for a very cut throat and hostile workplace. People would fight and complain about sales, and hours worked. It seemed great at first, but it got old."
good,A typical day at Belks fine jewelry counter consisted of helping customers to find that special piece of jewelry and making sure they were aware of policies. I further learned about each gemstone. The management is kinds and persistent. The workplace is full of wonderful employees who are friendly and quick to help. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my customers and their needs.
good,Processing clothing to go on the sales floor that include tagging pricing items unloading truck for kids furniture man woman Juniors working from 6-11 Monday - Friday
good,Nice place to work; fast paced; employees nice; career growth is  a plus; must work some holidays and a rigorous schedule but overall my experience was worth it. Great for college kid who need extra money
good,A typical work day is planned out by your manger. You are giving a task and the tasks should be completed before departure. Very calm environment with normally a variety of tasks to keep you busy.
good,"Pay was great to begin with for the seasonal holiday. I worked in the shoe department. I only recommend that people that work in the shoes department during the busy holidays, they have a good background of customer service (good and bad), patient and well-balanced."
good,"Belk is an overall enjoyable work place. It has slow and bad days like every other job. However, I love my job and my manager. Working with him made it very easy to come to work with a very positive attitude and it made the day go by quicker. Overall, Belk is a great place to work and everyone there for the most part get alone well great to make it a comfortable work enivornment."
good,"Belk is an up-and-coming company (via a re-sale of the company) even though its been in business for years.  Belk has things to learn, but they want to learn them."
good,"Working for Belk is a day centered around customer service, both internal and external.  Filling the needs of each customer that comes into the store is a necessity for the business to be successful.  Each day is different as each customer is different.  The most enjoyable part of the job is developing a team atmosphere with associates."
good,"I have been working at Belk for 10 years. Alot of associates and managers have worked  at Belk for over 35 years. Belk is like  a  family, ,if someone is in need we have a fund to help associates .We raise the money by wearing denim on Fridays and paying $2. The money goes into a fund until someone needs it."
good,Belk is a good place to work you must be a team player and be cross trained because you may be required to work in different departments. The 20% employee discount is awesome.
good,"Too many changes, not a very friendly environment, no job security.  A typical day was just going in knowing what you have to do and just do it. Best part of the job was the schedule"
good,"A typical day at work was sometimes unload the truck and after that was done, work on online orders and ship them out. I loved doing online orders and became very fast at them."
good,"A typical day at work is just opening up the store. Straightening the clothes, helping customers, etc. I would tell anyone that this is a good job experience to have. Management is pretty good at helping their employees. I've met some great people working here. I've made friends along the way. I learn new things every day."
good,Belk is a great place workplace for a college student and for someone who wants a part time job. Management is willing to work around employees that attend college.
good,"Was an amazing atmosphere, with hard-working individuals to keep you moving. Retail side of the store may have been different, but the people I worked with in the backroom were some of the friendliest, active people I've met in such a store."
good,"Greeting customers , putting out new stock , chaning displays , opening new charge accounts and ringig up sales and returns ,new products that came on the market . The culture was fast paced ,competive and a lot of fun if you like fashion and helping others."
good,This is a great place to start working especially while going to school full time. Fair management and a great enviroment with pleasant co-workers it was always fun
good,"Typical day, I arrive to work at 5a.m., being that I am now apart of the operations team. I, along with my team, unload boxes of the truck, unpack the boxes, put security tags on merchandise that requires them, and then merchandise the items on the sales floor according to a planogram. Learned a lot about fashion and the different names of certain articles of clothing and shoes. Managers have a hard time getting on the same page, causing the work environment to be a little chaotic at time. The hardest part of the job is just waking up and getting to the job, being that we have to report there so early in the morning. The most enjoyable part for me is merchandising the clothing and assisting the customers in finding what they are looking for, and suggesting other things."
good,"Operates the Computer/register system, as well as providing assistance to customers. This involves helping them with clothing and matching as well as providing additional requests for help with accessories. "
good,There were multiple employees I worked with who were not as productive and efficient while working. Had terrible attitudes and a lazy work ethic. The management was unstable and inconsistent when making rules and scheduling.
good,"Working at Belk has been a great experience for me. Gaining a better knowledge of working with the general public is always a useful skill to have. This job taught me organization, multitasking, and time management skills. The managers are all wonderful people, however, the store managers seem to be over tasked. The employees I work with on a day to day basis are very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is telling a customer no when they are wrong about pricing, ect., and then a manager comes out there and changes it. It makes the associate seem undermined in the workplace."
good,"Although the company offers a wonderful amount of jobs, the scheduling is bit off with the part time schedule I had to offer. With myself being in college, makes it difficult working only three hours a night."
good,"Overall this was a good job, my manager tried to work with me when there was a problem, I enjoyed helping the customers here and was allowed to do so as I best saw fit for the most part. Learned a lot about shoes and brands and also made commission."
good,"The job was hectic at times but overall satisfying, dealt with many people at days. My coworkers were great. sometimes the managers wouldn't allow you to talk to your coworkers but overall good place to work at."
good,"I like working with people and I love retail, so I did well here.  Management was fine, but they always seemed to be overworked and stretched too thin with the departments they needed to manage, which were often times multiple ones.  Other than that, they were very helpful."
good,"working at Belk as a salesperson was fun.  I had great products to promote, a diverse customer base, and interesting co-workers.  Schedules were posted early enough to make plans."
good,The management was very nice and worked well with my other schedule at my second job . I was able to work interdependently.The pay was what I considered as for people right out of high school.
good,"You can go in and set our availability day by day and even week to week.  For the most part, all employees are super friendly with each other (cashiers can get a little cut throat).  There are limited benefits for part time employees (dental & vision) which is a great help.  Not only do you get 20% off, usually 1x a month there is a double employee discount.  Big break room with vending machines, refrigerators and microwaves."
good,"learned a lot"
good,They let anybody be a lead. The leads are unprofessional half of em talk about doing drugs but belk want drug test em other than that its a good job
good,I enjoyed working foe this company. Started out at a big store and transferred to a smaller store. Some things offered to bigger stores should be offered at smaller stores such as soneone to clean. Employees at smaller stores are paid less but are required to do more. Other than that I loved working for Belk.
good,"I work in the operations team, a typical day at work consist of unpacking and doing a lot of merchandising throughout the store. The hardest part can be managing time but it is easy once you get used to it."
good,"My co-workers were great.  Management changed often, but my immediate supervisors were good."
good,"I enjoyed working for Belk very much! Most managers were helpful and kind. My only downside was needing a full time position for benefits and our store not having one open but being worked full time hours as a part time employee. If seeking a job in retail, I highly recommend Belk in Maryville, TN."
good,A typical day at work was i clock in and go to my department were i would open my cash register. tho out the day i would talk to customers make them fill at home and check them out.I would also be in charge of floor plans for my department. the management was okay at that time. The fun part of this job was getting to know the customers.
good,"The years were great...the people the place and location.  Then when numbers fell this year for the first time in all the time I was there, the new management fired me.  Did not offer to relocate me or give any kind of notice, just immediate dismissal. No offer for counseling, or a cut in pay. Greatly disappointed in the new management!"
good,"I enjoyed the job while I was in college, however, it is not a career. It is good to start or finish your life. Was able to learn some valuable life skill while dealing with people."
good,"Working at Belk for the last 3 years has given countless opportunities to work on my social skills. The people I work with are a fun group of people that make working there a lot more better. Also the management give you the chance to work out your own problems such as customer issues, visual issues and sale set up. The power is in your hands."
good,"Enjoyed working for Belk, enjoyed job, pay not good for the work I did, lots of red tape and politics among management. Management not supportive and there is no communication."
good,Enjoyed the management and people I worked with. Not a lot of opportunity for upward advancement. Always felt like I was making a difference.
good,Belk is a fun environment to work in and I work with a fun team. The downfall is low pay and advancement is not that easy. I became frustrated when I had my review and I received only a ten cent raise. This job is great for some in high school someone who just graduated. I am seeking a job with more challenge.
good,A very interesting work place where workers get to drive pack mules.  Pack mules are like small go carts used to pick clothes and were earned when a worker is able to pick 300 clothes or more during the period of 8 hours. Fortunately I was able to acquire one by working hard. Belk warehouse had a lot of hard working employees and I am happy to be one of them.
good,gave me chance to improve myself and my skills. learn to operate new machinery like a pack mule. was trained to be an assistant lead in packing position
good,"This was also a great job. I loved being in charge of the shoe department. It was a very busy job but interesting at the same time. "
good,"I complete mark downs, scan customer purchases and complete inventory. I train new employees. I have learned to adapt to my surroundings and learned how to work in every department. I enjoy meeting new people and having to train others. The hardest part is not being a full time employee. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to provide savings and knowing that the customer is getting what they want a the best price."
good,"great place to work if you enjoy always having something to do, management was great as long as you did the work and they didn't find you standing around all day the hours were good once again for those who did there work you didn't get the hours you wanted if the managers didn't see the work they wanted many complained about no hours while standing around doing nothing with the hours they were given, i enjoyed the many different people i came in contact with each day however cleaning the fitting rooms was the least enjoyable part of the job with no limit of items customers could take in even when it was possible to clean them every 30 minutes there could be an overwhelming amount of clothing in the rooms."
good,"Working for Belk was definitely a learning experience. I was the Loss Prevention Mgr., and I had to deal with every shoplifter that was caught in the store. The only down side is that there is no change in the work environment, and it becomes very easy to get burned out."
good,The coworkers did not seem to helpful. The managers were more helpful than the co workers. All in all loved interacting with the customers at a busy time of year.
good,"I've worked for belk for the past 8 years. My experiences started just as a part time associate while in college. I've advanced my way to management within the company to gain the skills and knowledge to step out of the retail realm and dive into another career. The company is the only family owned retail company and that's one thing Belk firmly hold on to. However, they do need to advance their technology within the store fully and not just testing stores. I started at 19 and now as 27 I would have thought they would have invested in the current technology that will soldify sales and drive business for its company. I have nothing but respect for the Belk and will always be grateful for the opportunity they have given me."
good,"Employee Discount"
good,"There is good and bad with retail.. You just have to learn when to take your job to heart, and when to let the customer or management be right, even if they are not. Retail is not for everyone, and after the first 2 weeks, you will find it out for yourself. "
good,"put out freight new merchandise on counter"
good,Great place to work and great people to work with. The department that you worked in was a team and other departments would come and help you if you needed assistance.
good,"Working for Estee Lauder Cosmetics  is a very rewarding experience.  An average day is spent sharing the amazing benefits of using a top tier skin care product.  I address each clients issues/concerns and help direct their purchases accordingly.  Education/learning is a ongoing process through corporate workshops and new product launches.  Management has been very accommodating to me as counter manager, giving me the autonomy to direct my associates as necessary.  The hardest part of any retail business are the hours and working every weekend.  The most enjoyable are the customers and my co-workers."
good,"I assisted customers with locating merchandise by size style and color.  I assisted with selecting jewelry and other apparel within the department.  It is of vital importance to always approach the customer with a smile and pleasant conversation and when the customer requested assistance,"
good,"A typical day working as a Sales Associate a Belk could entail suggestive merchandising, opening credit lines for customers, answering customer questions, completing customer orders, stock/inventory, and handling money. The management was overall above satisfactory."
good,I Sold Jewelry and clothes. I also did our inventory and loaded all the data in the computer for our upcoming clients.
good,"I had a team of very personable and understanding managers. In our store, there was no micro-managing and employees were expected to be self-reliant and competent, which was a welcome change from my previous retail positions."
good,"Includes late evenings, weekends at times. "
good,"What can I say? I work here now, have worked here or in a previous version of the store (under a different company's name) for over a decade. There is a lot to like about the job; flexible hours, I have earned multiple weeks paid vacation a year, I have gotten raises, I do enjoy getting off days on weekdays in order to accomplish errands and visit the doctor and dentist. I have had the pleasure of working with many  great managers and coworkers over the years, some of whom have become lifelong friends. I have even gotten to know some customers on a first name basis, something perhaps unusual in a ""big box"" type of retail establishment. The work is often interesting and can be full of surprises. "
good,Great customers... great environment... management were reasonable
good,great place to work and a place to learn more about fashion. where you can meet new people and establish a rapport with customers
good,"This was a fun place to work and the work was not overall too demanding. Some customers could be difficult to work with but it did not cloud the over all job atmosphere. the co workers were equally fun, helpful and knowledgeable. they were willing to help stock or straighten other areas of the store.  The most enjoyable part of the job to me was playing with the displays and different combination or clothing for the visual impact. The hardest part of the job was the occasional customer that i couldnt please or fix the issue and would have to call in management."
good,A typical day at work would be assisting many different customers with purchases and putting out product on display to be sold. I had a chance to interact with customers and help them choose different items that they may have been looking for. I learned how to deal with people of different kinds and also how to work in difficult situations. The hardest part of the job was probably working on holidays. Those were the most difficult times because holidays were the busiest days and you dealt with multiple customers at once. And around those times you tend to get more difficult customers. But I was able to learn how to work effectively under pressure and to satisfy both easy and difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being able to interact with many different people and help others find what they needed. I loved making customers happy and seeing them leave satisfied with their visit to our store. My co workers were easy to get along with and were definitely hard workers. Just tried not to involve myself in any of the gossip but loved working with them. Management was top notch and they made sure things were done with decency and with perfection. 
good,"On a typical day in Belk, three to five people would need help. Most came to see me for the help.  If I could not help them, I would send them to a co-worker who could help. My co-workers were great people to work with as well as the management. In fact, all of the management started as co-workers of one another.  That is a lesson of earning your way to the top and not having it handed to you. Very respectable. There was really no hard part of the job. The best thing was seeing a happy customer leaving the store. Nothing is more gratifying than knowing that the customer has had their needs met."
good,"A typical day at work can be hectic with handling customers, to doing stock, merchandising, setting sales, and performing markdowns. I have learned a lot about the retail business and the management is very driven."
good,"I worked 6.00 Am to 1.00 Pm, 5 days a week. Open store petty cash reg, for the days cash refunds and change needed on the floor,set out all media bags for each reg. Balance safe from night before. Had to count and balance all 44 reg bags for daily sales for cash and checks enter data.Look for money shortage ,lost cks, file all paper work,have deposit done ,and recount safe. Order money from bank to keep safe up to date to run daily / weekly."
good,"The typical day at Belk would be changing sales, ringing up sales, opening credit applications, located merchandise on the floor, unload and censoring freight on a daily basis, as well as cleaning fitting rooms and keeping a clean work environment. I learned a lot about what customer service was really about, I loved the customers and the face to face interaction. Management wasn't all that helpful but my co-workers were excellent."
good,"Come in, Clock in ,shipping and recieiving ,open register , straighten up, morning meeting, store opens,and Customer service for the rest of the day, straighten up, close register, straighten up and the go home,then do it all over"
good,I really enjoyed working here. Probably would still be there if it had not been for the turn of economic decline.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers find what they actually need. Building a sale, but not overwhelming anyone."
good,"As an Analyst, I learned to look at procedures and find ways to improve them. I also learned that leading training classes only looks easy when the person who is training you really knows their stuff. I worked with great people. The hardest part of this job was giving recommendations to managers and them not alway buying into making the changes. A Typical day involved travelling to stores and getting acclimated pretty fast."
good,"In all, Belk is a good place to work at but some things need to be changed. At my location, the personal scanners that Merchandisers use need to be updated. It can take up to 15 minutes max to find a good working scanner that won't shut down before starting a shift."
good,Belk makes sure all of their employees fell wanted. Such a fun place to work as there is always contest being held within the company and the store. A little stressful at times trying to reach all the goals they require you to. As any retail a little stressful during holidays.
good,"I enjoy working here. I love my coworkers and my managers are hilariously funny and great to work with. As a part-time worker, I do wish that I had more hours, but I don’t mind the amount I have now. It’s a great work environment and I’ve made quite a few friends working here. The pay is really good compared to some of the retail businesses here and the work environment is easy going. I recommend this job to anyone interested in it."
good,The most enjoyable part of Belk is working with great associates.The environment is a great place and with many wonderful managers. The Benefit are great.
good,"Con:"
good,"A typical day at work was, I would go in set up the warehouse and unload the truck for about 5 hours depending on the truck load. I learn how customer service experience works, how to be an sales man. The management was fair. They were all super nice. The work place culture was diverse. The hardest part of the job was staying until 1:00 in the morning to unload trucks. The best part of the job was getting to kno everyone there."
good,Belk helped train me into a management position. I am grateful for the opportunities I was given. I was lucky to have great mentors within the company.
good,I came aboard right after the acquisition so my opinion is impacted by so much change so many lay offs and a shift in culture. For all I know it could be a great place to work now.
good,during my time at Belk I gained a lot of retail and sales experience. I had opportunities to move up in the company and it strengthen my customer service skills. Fun place to work
good,"The only issues I ever had with my position came from corporate and how they handled their end of the job. Other than that, it was an absolutely wonderful experience!"
good,Great job $3 extra for credit apps. They work well with home life. Pay is acceptable. Tough to get full time but part time runs about 20-25 some times more on hours.
good,"Great place to work and grow. Great environment for a multi tasker. You"
good,I learned a lot working for them. From setting sales to merchandising. They can do better with the Manangers some have favorites and it's not fair. They should have a better understanding with people with kids and families. Its all about money with this company their suppose to be family oriented and there not
good,"Belk went through a lot of changes in my tenure there. If you are an adaptable person who is open to changes, it's a great place to work. There is consideration given to work/life balance and creating an environment where employees collaborate well. Benefits/pay can be on the lower end of the spectrum at times but the associate discount does sort of make up for it."
good,"A typical day at Belk was consistent, the other employees were good working together, and manager was very helpful and making sure that you understood work."
good,"Job is fast paced, constantly on your feet. You will hurt from all the walking, wear good shoes with insoles but once you get used to it  its not so bad. The people are decent and helpful."
good,They always recognizing your achievement. Opportunities for bonuses and advancements in the business. Store is family oriented. Always had events to celebrate your appreciation
good,"The New Bern store is a great place to work. I enjoy working with my co-workers. The schedule makes it hard to plan anything unless you ask for days off way in advance. "
good,good place to work anf meet  new people during the Christmas holiday. I enjoy the friendly staff and discounts that were provided.  The managers were awesome
good,It's a good work place you will love to be there. They treat you like family you always welcome. The main thing you have to work. Manager they take time out to ask you how your day are going making sure you are good throw out the day.
good,A Typical day of work was unloading and loading freight for most of the day. I learned how to use a fork lift learning how to be a cherri picker along with learning some special duties such as shipping orders and counting inventory. At belks our management team was very friendly team players very effective made sure task were done correctly and in a timely manner the hardest part of the job having to load shoe boxes back to back. The most enjoyable part of the job was loading big boxes and being able to get them done faster each time.
good,"Overall, I wish it wouldn't have been my first job because of the set schedule.Great environment, and benefits were available for full time employees."
good,"The work environment was pretty relaxed with reasonable goals. Management was great and always on top of things while being understanding and friendly. Holidays are the only time where the work can be pretty stressful, but it rarely becomes overwhelming."
good,The workplace was very laid back and everything was put neatly to make the store look nice. I had fun working there but they do not like paying associates more than 8.50.
good,Love the associates that work with me. Don't get a lot of time with family. Too many times your now able to take off. But given PTO time to take. Great environment! Love the customers!!
good,I loved my job at Belks I just felt as if I put in too much time and hard work to be fired for something I had no control over. They don't realize the obstacles you are faced with in everyday life.
good,"My review would be if you want to work those long days and long weeks perfect for you. A typical day insists on happy customers, getting different knowing of cultures and happy satisfaction of knowing customers leaving happy. I learned that there is always a better way out of things when you are strongly feeling it. The management is good, if you don't feel good in part they can place you somewhere where you will feel comfortable. The hardest part of my job is trying to keep the commission in shoes up it stresses me out sometimes. The most enjoyable part of my work days are the customers that I let leave with the biggest smiles and leaving with shoe they will love."
good,"When I worked at Belk, I enjoyed my job. I was very successful and happy. I traveled alot and was exposed to interesting people. I had the freedom to plan and execute business plans, develop people and excel."
good,"Overall, there is a high expectation of tasks that need to be completed which is determined by foot traffic in the store. Management is very understanding as long as you are performing well. I have learned time management and balance with my time by pacing myself and being organized. The hardest part of the job is recovering the store on a busy day, and the most enjoyable part is the coworkers you get to share the day with."
good,"Excellent place to work, great benefits, hours were good also. I met people from all over the world; people relocated from different areas. I received about five promotions, you can easily advance if you're willing to work and be challenged. It was like family. I still stay in contact some of my friends I met there. I highly recommend Believe to anyone."
good,This company is a great place to work. Employees bonds are quick and enriching.  Every day is different with sales and promotions. They provide a shopping experience for the customers. Management works hard to give employee incentives throughout working hours for achieving goals. The hardest part of this job could be standing on concrete for long periods time.
good,The morning were slow pace. I started out as a seasonal work but Belk retained me as a full time worker. During the holiday season during mid-day the work would become fast pace which I enjoyed.
good,"A Typical day at work would consist of helping customers find the perfect item/ items for them. "
good,I loved working for bell everybody was neat and clean. The guest were so nice. I learned how to have great customer service. The hours were great and the pay
good,Belk is a nice department store everyone that worked there was always helpful. My only complaint was that the store wasn't big enough for all the merchandise and it made difficult to put everything out on the floor.
good,It was an ok work environment.We could not leave the premises any time during the shift.That was a little odd.But overall is was a good job with decent pay.
good,It was  good starting job to get experience. It gets stressful sometimes specially during the holidays with people screaming at you about things out of your control.
good,I love working those 8 hours and really gotten the chance to cross train in other departments. I love the challenge I am good at multi-tasking and they let you work over if you want.
good,"It can get boring, but you have to find ways to keep busy. Overall, it's decent. It's really how you make it. One of the managers were a little annoying, but they were decent people."
good,"fun place to work, however to the demise of the beautiful work culture, the outsource to outsourcing firms who are turning the IT dept into a sweat shop enforcing overseas work standards on American workers."
good,Typical days at work days are simple but productive. I have learned a lot from working at Belk over the past three years. It has made me a stronger merchandiser.
good,"Fast pace work environment,  and sometimes can be stressful. However, the best thing is they will work around your school schedule.  They also give all employees a 20 percent discount."
good,"It's a great job to have if you really love fashion and went to school for fashion merchandising. It's very laid-back and relaxed for a corporate job. They have great benefits and you work 40hrs a week. I'm a temp in the e-commerce department and it's very repetitive. The job I'm doing is very easy and enjoy not having someone down my throat every minute, Everyone is nice and seem to love working here."
good,I enjoyed working with Belks. The management was very good in communicating with you about the promotions throughout the store and encouraged each team member to push sale goals. Did not leave much room for advancement though. The hours were limited. They were not able to hire part-time as 20 and full-time as 40; due to corporate decision and budjet cuts. Not their fault. Due to the economy.
good,"I was hired on to help during the holiday season. While some of my prior experiences with retail were less then stellar, Belk turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable. Laid back but always something to do, I'd say it was enjoyable to workt here."
good,This position is fun and creative but the environment and management is inconsistent. Always traveling and limited options to take time off. Pay is good.
good,"Working at Belk during the holiday season can be very busy, but it can also be very rewarding to assist customers in finding that special gift for their family member, friend, etc."
good,"You would go to your counter and there would be mountains of clothes stacked and you would have to be folding or hanging your entire shift, the customers always complained about the mess but the manager at the time didn't seem to have cared."
good,This was only a part time job for me but was fun and my manager was excellent to work for.  The company has some high expectations but nothing too major.  The staff were great to work with.
good,"Typically a work day would entail helping customers, putting away stock, rearranging department etc. Holidays obviously include extended hours, and some hours that are mandatory."
good,Working at belk I was part of the rock team. As a member of thhe rock team  my job was to unload trucks and take items out of box as well as place then where they are t go. My favorite part about the job were my coworkers we al got alone so well which made the day go by smooth and quickly. Mangementwas great they were very friendly.
good,"As an Operations worker, I would say that working on the truck is a good way to begin the day at 5 a.m. in the morning.  A little bit of exercise always cheered my morning, and prepared the rest of my day. "
good,"A typical day at work allows me to see day to day operations. Starting from the back of the house including shipment, to the front end with sales and promotion. Making sure the product is cycled out properly is a big part of the day to ensure accuracy for customer whether shopping for the latest trends or looking for the best deals. Multi tasking plays a big role at Belk in taking on the work load which  at times can be a bit challenging. The staff is very supportive and consist of multiple personalities who try to make the work place comfortable to be a part of."
good,"It was a pretty good job, that included benefits. The staff was really nice and understanding​, willing to work with you. I only wish the pay was higher."
good,"Belk cares for their employers. They send out birthday cards and they help support rehab for those who struggle with addiction. If I need a leave of absences for my mother I can trust to still have my job. Even when retiring from Belk they allow you to keep your discount. But some management does not care about the employees,  They pick and choose their favorite and honor those who does less, they disqualify those who they do not care for. The Benefits is very expensive for a single person I pay $100.00 every paycheck."
good,"Great people to work with and nice management staff. Always helpful when assisting a customer. Good schedules and shifts, nice flexible breaks. Greatly recommend."
good,"This place is a great place to work when you're starting out fresh in college and life in general. They hardly ever hire full time though, so don't get your hopes up for that idea, because it's probably never going to happen."
good,"Awesome Store Manager, Great Benefits, in all great place to work ."
good,"I loved working with the clients, but payroll is VERY limited. You must delegate out everything you need to do that week to get it accomplished and it really takes a TEAM to get the job done"
good,"using RF scanners to pick items ordered by customers, walking with cart. once finished load totes onto conveyor belt for packers to receive"
good,Trucks and work load influence the day's workload. Depending on time of the year or season. The merchandise is our priority to get to the stores to focus on sales.
good,I enjoyed working for Belk I miss working there.I loved my customers. I worked with great people. the management was very easy to talk to and get along with if you had a concern it could be addressed.
good,A typical day at work seems to be very productive for me. I wil always make sure that the customers are satisfied with the assistant from me. I always see myself in the next person that allow me to see that I would like to be treated fairly and with respect.
good,Everyday learning something new at work.  I learned how to schedule employee hours.  Management could have been better.  The hardest part of my job was scheduling all work hours within company budget and learning certain days and hours every employee could work.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to learn new task and being in a fun work environment and meeting new people.
good,"Great job good pay but hard to deal with the shifts"
good,Belk was a great company to work for. Management is always willing to work with you for further advancement. work/life balance is hard due to retail hours.
good,It great to assist customers with their purchases while working on the floor. Its also fun to be the first to see new merchandise as it comes in. I love the hours as well.
good,Working at Belk was enjoyable. The thing I enjoyed most was the customers..my customers were my reason for working. Nothing is better than good cus.ser.
good,"Belk is a good store that shares your value, and at times the day can be overwhelming but at the same time fun when interacting with customers making sure their needs are met and they leave feeling satisfied with the service and what they came to get or didn't expect to get"
good,Belk was a great place to work at.  I met great people working there.  The retail working life at Belk was very challenging.  I enjoyed working there and the discounts were amazing!
good,"Belk is not a bad place to work for. Like in most other retail workplaces, you are expected to do your job and keep on your toes. The experience can be rough sometimes as you constantly have to do something, but the key to doing this job just like most any other retail job is to persevere and conquer."
good,Enjoyed my time at Belk. Worked as an operations associate at the Friendly Center branch in Greensboro. Very flexible hours.
good,Have really enjoyed the opportunity to learn many different aspects of the retail business. This company strongly encourages promotion from within.
good,"When I first started at Belk it was my first REAL job, but everyone made me feel comfortable and like a part of their work family"
good,"A great company to grow with. A typical for me is checking emails, walking sales floor to check on associates productivity rates, greeting customers and informing of promotions going on that day."
good,"Belk offers health/dental/vision/and life insurance"
good,"Hard work, prodution job, all about the numbers, fun people to be around, but all together okay work place. also i think it would be better if they was more organized for their employee's."
good,I loved working for this store and the friendly people I worked for. It was a fun and exciting job for a seasonal one. I just wish I could of had a part time or full time position.
good,"work environment is very pleasant and currently enjoy the associates I work with. manager and associate relations are somewhat strained with current workload vs required break times. 6 hr shifts with strained approval for a break. not too many happy campers. a similar disagreement in the requirements for the annual ""pacesetter"" in the dept. it reveals a popularity contest between associate and mgt."
good,"My job included selling, remerchandising, ad setup,  price integrity gift wrapping, credit and floor setup. Customer service was top and foremost in this job. I had people come in looking for my assistance."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Belk, as it was my first retail job I learned a lot about how the industry works. A typical day included helping customers find what they needed, organizing the work floor, and ringing people up on the register. I learned how to work independently and how to help customers to the best of my ability. My co-workers were very helpful by showing me how to do things in the most efficient manner. My favorite part about working at Belk was being able to interact with new people."
good,Enjoyed working with coworkers and management. Easy work and great hours. The hardest part about the job is waking up in the morning if you are not a early morning person like me. 5am shifts was very exhausting.
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with Brides. We help them get prepared for their future ahead. I am in management and I work well with my co-workers. The hardest part is trying to do my own job because I am always asked to do someone else job.But, always get the job done with no hesitation.  The most enjoyable is working and communicating with people."
good,I enjoyed working at Belk. The hours I received were great and the pay was substantial for the work the work I did. I worked very well with my co-workers and enjoyed the different personalities that I came across.
good,I absolutely loved working at Belk in Bainbridge. I was employed there from my senior year in high school until I graduated college.  My store manager always made sure that I was on the schedule for the summer and all of my school breaks.  I appreciated the opportunity and trust afforded to me at Belk.
good,"Typical sales associate job. Sales, straightening merchandise, signing, etc. Be prepared to step up your sales game if you want to stand out!"
good,Working at belk i learned a lot of different skills i got to work in many different areas i picked and packed customers orders sort and put away inbound products also process customers returns
good,"A typical day at work was full of many task that needed to be completed by the end of the shift, so constantly doing something which is what I enjoy doing staying busy is a good thing. I learned organization. The management was great every manager was very involved and was on the sales floor most of the time, the store manager would bring prepared food for the associates for us to eat on during our breaks which was very nice and considerate. The co workers there were great if you needed help someone would always help. The hardest part in my opinion was constantly having to keep stuff picked up. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working with different people also."
good,"Belk is a good place to work.  It is a place that offers a good range of opportunity to its associates.  There is full and part-time positions.  A typical day of work would be 7-8 hours of work.  I learned good leadership skills and how to multi-task in different departments at this place.  I learned how to be a good team and departamental leader.  This is also where I learned how to be efficient and successful in driving sales goals and meeting them on a monthly basis.  I liked how I had the ability to grow and develop my skills and position from associate level to a specialist leadership position that was a department lead role including pay and benefits. I also learned how to create semi-annual events including different departments in store and helping in local areas.  The hardest part of the job was in meeting the monthly goals but with creativity and determination and a strive for excellence it was maintained.  I really enjoyed the team I worked with, and the upper and district management I would correlate with to help make and achieve the needs and goals of the store effectively."
good,Job was easy and straightforward. Only bad I have to say is the training process is pretty non-existent.
good,"Talented management team"
good,"A typical day at work generally consists of, recovery and inventory of stock on hand, balancing multiple cash machines, following up on customer service issues (questions, complaints, etc), assisting customers with purchases. I would have to say the most enjoyable aspect of the job is learning the ins and outs of the job, and handling the customers. The hardest part of the job is not having the right tools or manpower to do the job properly or in a timely manner. Management is always on hand and is willing to help out when needed and take on problems if need be."
good,"I would say the typical day we would get there early in the morning and work till around noon though sometimes we would work longer or shorter depending on the day. duties included moving stock, setting sales, doing markdowns, and cleaning. I worked the christmas season which was somewhat hectic at times as there was a ton of work and never enough people to get it done. typical work week was usually 15-25 hours a week, I think I got over 30 hours maybe two weeks the whole time I was there but then again i wasn't looking for 40 hours so it was ok. Most of the time you had a short week then a long week. For example one week I would work 13 hours then 26 the next week but I think it averaged out to around 20 hours a week. I didn't miss any days while I was there so they never spoke to me about that but they seemed to be pretty understanding with the people who did have emergencies. Also they gave me time off whenever I asked for it which was not often but still they obviously cared and understood life priorities. They were really patient with me and even when I messed up they were very understanding. I would say it is a great job if you are young and don't have a lot of experience or for moms who want to earn a little extra money. The co workers were all very easy to work with. I would say the hardest part of the job was that there were so many responsibilities so figuring it all out took some time. The most enjoyable part were the people I worked with, very helpful, considerate and just fun people to be around."
good,"I enjoy the atmosphere and type of work. Everyone is pleasant and personable. Work is not difficult, Sometimes very boring. But a good place to work."
good,"my typical work day consisted of help customers through the store, saleing products and using great customer service at all times."
good,The hardest part about working for Belk is the high volume of customers that comes through store during sales. It is a great work environment because everyone is treated like family.
good,"Belk is a great place to work. They offer great benefits, a nice employee discount, and they encourage their employees to advance their career within the company. Everyone that I worked with at Belk has been friendly and easy to get along with. I have made a lot of friends that I still socialize with now that I have left the company. If you enjoy interacting with people and helping people them you will enjoy working at Belk."
good,Stocking the floor and making sure everything is off the floor and dressing room. Check the register to make sure it total out. Interacting with the customers and helping them is they need  it.
good,"Belk is good at taking care of their Associate as far as rewards, pay, discounts, etc. Management team works together really well and has a family like presence while staying professional. I oversee all Safety and Security so no one knows what I do on a daily basis but the Store Manager and Regional Loss Prevention Manager. I research reports, video and watch live feed to detect any sign of theft or fraud on a daily basis. I oversee all Inventories in planning and execution. Hardest part of the job is the constant changing in my schedule to meet the store needs. I do really enjoy observing the wrong that employees and/or customers do and actually being able to take action on that. What's even better is when I hear when someone I apprehended took that as a life lesson and turned their lives around for the better...that is the greatest award personally."
good,This was a part-time position in I learned about the latest trends in men's fashions
good,"The environment was welcoming. Created strong bonds with co workers and managers.The company provided employees with friendly competition in meeting sales goals, making work both productive and fun."
good,"I am satisfied over all with my employment at Belk, INC. Management is one of the best I have worked for. Business feels like family and the sales associates show it."
good,"Overall was a fine place to work, enjoyed all the friendly people i met. This was a very sociable place to work."
good,Been here for two months and havent had any reasonable hours. My hours keep getting cut and I have gone 4 weeks without working altogether.
good,"At belk we greeted customers upon arrival and assisted them while shopping"
good,"clock in, put the stock away , mingle with customers and suggestive sell, keep fixtures straight and organized, order products for customers that are not found in our store and mainly have fun with the customers"
good,"I LOVED most of the people I worked with and people I worked for. I really enjoyed my ASM and all of those who worked with me in my sales area. It was very fun and close knit, maybe a tiny bit cut throat at times when it was getting close to time for reviews."
good,I get an opportunity to build new relationships assist clients with selecting make-up and skin-care
good,Work was plentiful.  Arrival time was monitored but when you finished your work you had to option to leave or stay longer.
good,"I loved working with the customers helping them find what they needed. I also did signing, put out stock, straightened inventory, trained for management and helped set store merchandise moves for better location in store and to increase sales."
good,"A typical day at Belk was providing customer care and making sure all merchandise stayed in order. I learned a lot about customer service, merchandising, and focusing on working to the best of my abilities. Working with different types of people could get rough but you just have to focus on you and maintain a good attitude. The hardest part was definitely keeping up with all of the departments I was required to keep up with, but the most enjoyable part was getting on a personal level with my customers, getting good feedback from them and my managers, and keeping my area looking the best possible."
good,"This job was good with understanding needing a sick day or family emergencies. Also, this job was good with lunch breaks or labor work breaks. Over all a great job with good pay."
good,"Coworkers pleasant as well as most of the customers. I learned a lot about china, crystal and flatware. I also learned a lot about towels and sheets. The hardest part of the job was the hours. The most enjoyable part was making the brides happy."
good,Great college job for students attending school in Greensboro. It is accessible to many of the colleges around the area. My typical work day would begin as soon as class was over with. A normal work day ends around 9:15. The associates that I worked with were considered my second family. Everyone was friendly and we all got along. Management was nice and operated in a professional manner.
good,its a great job for everyone. They have good management and can advance in the company.
good,"While this job was a lot of hard work, I very much enjoyed it. I spent my work days waiting on customers, helping them select items, finding the items in our inventory, and completing sales. The management was inconsistent while I was there. I had four different managers in the six months that I was there. I very much enjoyed working with my coworkers."
good,The only problems i had was some co worker was always coming back from luch late and the manger never told you had to work over until late
good,"Belk is a family owned business that is working to advance technology not only in their company, but also in the retail industry."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of puttin new items out and checking prices on items to see if prices and markdowns are correct and post new deals, assisted customers for fitting of formal suits. My coworkers were fun and made the day go by faster.The hardest part of the job was being nice to customers even though they were so rude to you, but that's typical in any place you work. I loved my coworkers and i had regular customers that came in and told me stories about their wife (worked in the mens department)."
good,If you're willing to work this is a great job for people who have families are other obligations outside of work. The available benefits are very helpful and the hours are manageable.
good,privately owned business. Some travel required. Very family concious superiorr
good,The job has taught me quite a bit about how to sale merchandise and customer service.

good,"Overall, it was a very accepting and productive workspace. I was able to work according to my schedule and they would work around your schedule and the team members were very understanding."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, The holiday schedule is a bit brutual but is to be expected in retail work. Compensation could be better for workers with tenure."
good,Working at Belk was a great experience. I learned a lot from the managers and coworkers and really enjoyed the people I was working with on a daily basis.
good,"Greet and assist customers in a friendly and timely manner. Give great customer service. The ability to open a new Belk account, take payments and well as processing sales and returns. Assist associates with opening and closing procedures and helping with sales, returns or anything else needed."
good,"Great working environment with top end managers. Great working facility,  and everyone acts in a professional manner. Has nice break room and one hour lunch breaks."
good,"There are many different departments in the store. But the main goal is to make sure the customers are satisfied. We were also trained to up sale and promote the store credit card. For each credit application, we received an incentive and recognition at the morning meetings."
good,"Great job, you have a clear understanding of your expectations. Hard to complete extra worked asked of you and complete your expected job. Dont bite off more than you can chew, but walk and chew gum at the same time."
good,"I loved and enjoyed working for Belk very much. The working environment was amazing, and my coworkers were very friendly and welcoming. I am very grateful I was able to work at a great store like Belk"
good,"Working at Belk was one of the best jobs I could work at .It was no drama , manger was good to get along with . It wasn't a hard job , we all tried helping each other out ."
good,"The customers were very messy, the dressing rooms were always a disaster and id have to stop working to clean them, sometimes having to leave registers unattended. busy area with not enough workers, however its very laid back and has amazing people to work with and for"
good,"retail is always a learning experience..enjoyed my 11 yrs. there, benefits are good and a lot of really nice associates and customers make for a    "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in and receiving my department showcase keys from the manager on duty. I was responsible for showcasing expensive jewelry throughout my shift. I loved my employees. During the holidays hours, the mangers made it fun to come to work."
good,"This was an amazing place to work. Inventory days sucked though. Management was great. Mostly great people to work with! Fulfillment was exciting, would of liked to cross train for other areas though."
good,My shift was mostly weekday evenings and weekends. I don't like how they may you work 12 hours on Thanksgiving evening and the day afterwards. Retail blacks out days off during any holiday.
good,"Assisting customers from opening to closing.  When not busy finding something to do to pass time. Management is ok depending on who is working your shift. But overall Belk is a good Company to work for.  Friendly staff, CHARMS, rewards"
good,"I like working at Belk, the coworkers were great and the customer were super nice and i really enjoyed the atmosphere, at first I had to learn how work in their system and after that everything became simple to me and again i really enjoyed it."
good,"I worked here while i was in high school and did seasonal work while in college. it was a great first job. there just was a lot of drama between merchandising crew and floor associates. overall, it was not bad, just not a forever employment."
good,"I've been with Parisian/Belk for 14 years.  I've enjoyed working there.  I get full-time hours and adequate health and supplemental insurance.  I began working back when the company was ""Parisian's.""  The Belk family acquired it.  Overall, I've enjoyed getting to know and assisting my coworkers and customers.  I enjoy working with people and feel that Belk has overall all a supportive professional culture."
good,when i first started the job i loved it but i was seasonal and o would work there again its a good job to start off at and the workers are very nice  its well worth working at
good,"Loved my job in fulfillment. Would do it again when they need help. Every day was a challenge when it came to picking orders. Certain areas of the store were less organized than others, making it more difficult to locate ordered items. Finding difficult items, items not normally carried at this location, is better than winning a contest. People were friendly and helpful. "
good,Meeting new people everyday was the best of the job !! Belk does promote from within but not all the time. Hours are the hardest part especially during the holidays.
good,I loved working at Belk. It was my very first job and everyone was so patient with me. I got along great with my co workers and management. I got to know regular customers by name. There were sometimes competitions between the departments and it was good lighthearted fun. We were able to transfer to another department if there was an opening available.
good,"I liked my position as visual. I had control over the way tye store looked and did not have to interface with customers very much. Also, the layout was always changing so there was always something to do."
good,"I enjoyed working here although it was temporary. I had great respectable managers. The only thing I will say is the staff has poor communication, and poor scheduling."
good,"A day at work includes customer service, leadership duties, clean dressing rooms and restock merchandise, keep area orderly.  Enjoy working with customers."
good,"The people I worked with directly was the biggest plus to working at Belk for me.  Being the salon division, we were given more autonomy to run the business which made it fun, yet challenging (in a good way)."
good,"A very easy and manageable job to do"
good,Belk is a great Place to work. They give great hours and work really good work your schedule. It can get overwhelmed but can be worth it. Definitely takes patience.
good,"I was a cashier ."
good,"Belk is a company that is flexable withe their hours and positions."
good,"When I worked at Belk, I felt that all my coworkers enjoyed working with me. I was the youngest on the team, so I had much more energy and drive to get tasks done. However, I feel that they scheduled me on days where much needed to be done, and I felt over worked at times. The hardest part of this job would be balancing your interaction with customers and getting the dressing rooms cleaned up and the day before ""put-backs"" that did not get done put away. Being a sales associate at Belk does have its benefits though. As a sales associte, you will recieve a 20% discout when shopping at Belk, and I used that discount quite often, since Belk is my favorite store. I feel that I left on a good note, so I may come back if I find myeslf desperate for a job."
good,company makes you feel valued and treats you like family.  They are open to listen to new ideas from their employees.  They are willing to work with you conflicts arise.
good,Belk. A great place to shop. Friendly associates. And a wonderful manager! Working there could be difficult. Depending on the day and the duties you were responsible for. Got very strict at the end. Store could use some remodeling. Overall I loved working there.
good,Management works with employees and is very fair.  The staff is very friendly and teamwork is promoted.  The culture is open and accommodating to everyone.  I enjoy working there but working every holiday is making the job more difficult.
good,"I enjoyed working for Belk. It was a fun, friendly atmosphere and I learned a lot. It was very fast paced at times, which is great if you like to stay busy."
good,"My time at Belks was pretty short due to family matters. But everyone there was nice and welcoming. Pay was nice, and they cared about there employers."
good,"Nice work environment, employees are really nice and helpful, days could be chill and relaxed, but could also be busy and crazy overall it was a good place to work."
good,A lively paced counter position with great client contact and relationships.  A very fun experience working with regional and national makeup artists and booking events for all!
good,"Belk was an internship, where i sharpened my customer service skills. It started off as an intership in college and i was offered a ""full time seasonal"" position."
good,Pretty easy job when just running the register and re organizing merchandise. Can get stressful when unloading the trucks early in the morning but keeps you in shape
good,Belk is a great place to work. The associate discounts are great. The environment is fun even when the workload is demanding. There is also a lot of opportunities to grow.
good,"Belk is a good company. Any position ranging from management to associate is usually driven by sales, so the ultimate goal is to make sure you have the resources in place to ensure you meet and exceed your daily sales goals. Leadership, staffing, product in tocks, friendly staff, competitive pricing, and overall store appearance impacts the customers experience and contribute to driving sales. My biggest role is providing an environment that associates enjoy working in, while ensuring our team is staffed and trained. The most challenging part of the job is having our schedule dictated by huge sales events, which usually includes working a lot of holidays/weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job is the competitive employee discount, the vacation time allowed for full time associates and management, and the hours of operation add a little more balance to a retail career than most companies."
good,I enjoy working at Belk. All of the employees were really nice and helpful for when I first started until now. If i need anything they are always there to help and reassure about everything including sales and different promotions we have going on.
good,"Arrive 5 min. early to clock in for your shift which changes daily.  Attend a morning meeting, open your register and make sure you have everything you need to start your day."
good,It was my first plant job so I was thinking like dis bout the be hard but it was the best job I ever had the hard part was walking around picking and when u get to the location the stuff ain’t there
good,"it is nice and hard work"
good,"A typical day is to come in and open department by opening safes and putting jewelry in cases. Open registers, do shipments, make sure cases are clean and tidy. Most important is taking care of customers and sometimes addressing their problems. Had to address many problems for customers and it is my responsibility to make them happy. Believe in telling a customer the truth about a piece of jewelry. I like making a customer feel like a family member. I have been top seller many times for this company."
good,What started out as a seasonal part-time position became full-time with a promotion.  The management really cares about the employees and you are rewarded for hard work.
good,"Productive, fun, room for advancement. Management is always willing to help. I went through extensive training. The most enjoyable part about working for the company is everyone was a team player."
good,Great company to work for. Good hours and pay. Good location. General warehouse work. Hot some days and cold when it’s cold no paid lunch. Some days got off early so didn’t always get 40 hours
good,"Belk was a wonderful place to work! I learned a lot about how to cater to customers. I helped customers locate items, and I, also, placed clothing back in their designated area from fitting rooms."
good,Nice employer to work for  and great benefits. Time off. Discounts Discountcustomerservice is plus meeting people.  Various departments for learning inventory.
good,"Management and staff were very friendly, everybody treated each other like they were family. Most customers were nice and respectful to associates, however there are times when customers would become upset with associates when coupons would not work due to exclusions. Sales associates were required to ask every customer if they were shopping with a Belk card. Raises seemed to be based on how much merchandise you sold as well as how many belk cards you opened. Overall, not a bad job but surely could have payed better."
good,"I enjoyed my time at belk. There was room for advancement and I learned more than I thought I would in the time I was there. Loved the people I worked with, and was proud to call myself a Belk employee."
good,"This job entails a great position, strong team , and an amazing manager. In this position you'll be pushed to work hard, but it is in my opinion completely worth it ."
good,"Overall very good company to work for. I was a good company to work for. I had good manager and associate we was a family ,supported and loyal to the company. I really developed strong people skill there."
good,Belk is a very busy work place for sale associates. This job was very helpful with helping me deal with customer service. Making sure your customer walk out the door with a smile on their face was my goal.
good,have nice work place to work in. I learned to housekeeping and receiving. the hardest things bout the job is the lack of help form some of the employees
good,"Great work environment,good management , good work hours,great discount.  Easy training .  Truly have nothing negative to say about this company, except that there are few full time positions"
good,"I dealt with the public to make sure customer satisfaction was important. I handled the cash register and merchandise. I made sure the sales were offered for customers to see discounts. I worked in the HOME STORE, SHOES, CUSTOMER SERVICE, and WOMEN APPARELS. I was very well rounded to work in different areas of retail. I managed to sell products based on commission and very organized in my working area."
good,if you like to stay busy and work part of a team this is the job for you. it is very quick paced and if you work with the right people can be fun too.
good,belk was a good place to work it had great pay people were cool boos was alight  I worked 3rd shift so in the summer it was great to work but in the winter it was very cold

good,"It was a good job for my first experience working as retail. I loed Helping the customers and etc. I learned to run a cash register, do returns and change sales signs every other day."
good,Fast paced work environment. Independent workplace and flexible schedules. Career advancement is not really an option. Periodic professional development classes.
good,"As with any big name retailer, there are expectations. "
good,The employees are great but the customers are so hard to deal with.  The manager is great and easy to talk too. The associates are great and friendly to work with.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Belk and would recommend it to someone who can remain on their feet for hours on end. The environment is competitive because there are sales goals which impact your salary at the end of the year. I wouldn't recommend this position for someone who is looking for a full time job, since the hours given to part time are basically the same as full time."
good,Belk is a nice and flexible place to work and the team leaders and managers are reasonable. There is never a day that is hard and unmanageable. I would like to stay if they had more full time opportunities.
good,Belk is a good company they have more variety than most department stores. They treat employees  fair. working with Belk is stressful esp when they insist on opening credit cards.

I enjoyed working with my coworkers and made a lot of friends."

good,"When I worked at Belk it was in a transition that I thought that I wanted to take a different career path. I worked for Belk, but also I worked for Elizabeth Arden counter inside of Belk. I truly did love that job and all the ladies that I worked with in that department. At that time I only had one child then became pregnant with my second while working there. After having my second it became hard with the retail hours because my husband also worked retail hours. So actually an old manager of mine that I previously worked with at United Bank located me and offered me a job at People Bank."

good,I enjoyed working at Belks in the ladies shoe department. I enjoyed assisting customers and helping   them to the best of my ability .  My employee discount was a bonus. The only thing I didn't like was being required to get two credit applications a week.

good,This job was a part time employment I had during the time I was in college. It was a great part time job and I enjoyed it.It was not ideal during the holiday season.
good,"As a sales associate, I was required to check the dressing rooms for clothes, hang them back up, and put them back in their respective places. I also used the register to ring up customers. I learned that not everyone is patient and friendly, but that everyone should be treated in a friendly, respectable manner."
good,"Creative Workplace which takes a lot of energy. The day is always different for customers are never the same, but making the customer happy about the merchandise they have purchased.

good,"Working at Belk is decent. The managers are very understanding and are available to help whenever you need it as an employee. The store is run well."
good,I would typically assist customers with their shoe selection.  I would go into the stock room and find what they wanted and make a few suggestions.  I would sell credit card applications.  I would assist with taking shipments out of boxes off the truck and place them into their proper places.
good,Working on a daily basis is awesome. Being able to make someone feel good about themselves makes my work day awesome. The hardest thing at Belks is when a customer doesn't get the customer service that they are suppose to get.
good,"I enjoyed working here for this short period of time wish it could have been longer. I learned a lot about sales, register, and also stocking items. The co-workers were very helpful and overall really nice. The hardest part of the job was keeping myself busy because sometimes there may not be any customers or anything to put back so I had to find stuff to do like straighten up or clean out cubbies underneath register.

Keep all this energy and motivation going on, all while juggling setting a floor sets, sale sets, or maintaining store readiness until close of business. It's hard sometimes very long work, but it is really fun, rewarding, and an enjoyable place to work. My favorite part of the job is working with all different types of people, from co-workers and associates to customers. And then learning and making a connection with those different people.

I learned a great deal about skin care and make up as well as how to handle people under pressure and deal with negative situations in a positive manner.  While working for Clinique, my counter met every goal that was expected of us and then some.  We recieved numberous awards including money and free products!  I had a counter manager who I adored and other co-workers in the cosmetic/fragrance area of the store.  My counter-manager and co-worker taught me a great deal about how to be professional the Clinique way including dressing appropriately, following Cliniques skincare and make-up policies, computer inquiries and stock inventory.  The hardest part of my job was taking returns because the person did not use the product correctly or in all honestly just decided they were to lazy to use it at all.  On a rare occassion was a return because it wasn't the right product or color for someone's skin.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the daily interractions with different clients and working for Clinique as a whole!  Clinique is a wonderful company that compensates their employees well with rewards and products!"

good,"Not enough hours"
good,"I was responsible for confirming, canceling and shipping online customer orders and ensuring that they would reach the correct customer.I learned everything there was to know about the online ordering process while working with a great team and excellent members of management.

good,"Good company to work for if you are into retail, people are friendly and the atmosphere is one of the best."
good,"I enjoyed  working at belk.  A typical day in customer service would consist of doing  the deposit, putting out petty cash, register, gift wrapping, receiving payments, and the switchboard.  On the sales floor I received daily merchandise to be put out, set sales, did markdowns, assisted customers, and rang up sales.  I also received charge payments.  The hardest part of my job was getting customers to open up charge accounts.  I was never comfortable trying to get a customer to sign up for a credit  card.  I was close to my fellow associates.  We were all like family.  I really enjoyed working in customer service the most.  I felt like I learned a lot  while there.  I did'n't always agree with management, but I did what I was told.  I did respect their position."
good,"It is a fast paced retail environment. The hours can be long, and the priorities ever changing. Change is the only constant thing in this business. I have learned to adapt and overcome many issues from HR related claims and issues, to a variety of customer service issues. My peer store managers are great and will help you if needed. The hardest part of the job is dealing with not accomplishing all of the tasks you have laid out for the day. I really enjoy the interaction with my associates and customers, and being able to problem solve many different situations."
good,I enjoyed working with a wide variety of coworkers as well as guests. The store stayed busy so days went by quickly. Management was always helpful and friendly and offered great employee incentives for things such as getting customers to apply for store credit cards. Hours were never consistent and I wish I had had a more reliable schedule with a set number of hours each week but I enjoyed the work I did and dealing with the store managers. They were very approacable and helpful.
good,"In the morning after the registers are open, there is a store meeting.  (If our shift is closing we get the information from the early shift.)  There is freight to put out, sometimes sales to set and shifting items to clearance which happens on a monthly basis. The basic goal of the job is customer service, which is making the customer happy with professionalism and value.  We have a contact list to call for sales, such as Charity Day or holiday shopping.  At the end of the day we have to close the register, organize the media and balancing the deposit for the register.  Before we leave we have to make sure everything is straighten and our wrap stands are clean.  I would say the hardest part of the job maybe taking care of the department when there is no help.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday."
good,A good and friend place to work you can grow with the company you can move up to the supervisor position.

Everyone got along with each other, we used team work to get goals accomplished throughout the day. The hardest part about that job was unloading the trucks and being short handed on help some days. I had two great managers, Debra Phinisey,and Vernon Humphries. Two of the greatest managers I ever worked with. The best part of my job was the people. I enjoyed working with all of them. It was sad when I got laid off started to miss them."

good,"knowing that you have taken care of a customer need"
good,A typical day includes working in a specific area and finding ways to make the store attractive for customers. Learn to interact with customers and persuade them to buying products. Management could be better because they do not always ensure the employees are satisfied with their job. Co-workers are friendly and respectful to each other. The hardest part of the job is having to work on weekends especially nights. The most enjoyable part of the job are the incentives we get when doing contests within the store.
good,The most enjoyable facet of this job included sharing information about merchandise to customers; each of their questions presented a better opportunity to increase product knowledge.

good,I got paid well and my managers were very kind. 20 percent discount and hour long lunch breaks. People can get rude. I was pressured to sell credit cards though.
good,"The typical day at work: When customers came in, I would immediately tend to their needs and make sure that I assisted them with good customer service.  Managers are always watching!  The hardest part of the job was when there were any problems with a belk card or ordering and I had to call customer services to make sure everything got sorted out, which was a little bit stressful, especially when the customers are impatient."

good,"All of management were very friendly and considerate. Employees got along very well. Great work environment.  Typical day for a sales representative is to greet customers and check them out. Help them with any advice regarding clothes or directions to different departments. Most difficult part of working at Belk is during the holidays just because the dressing rooms tend to get very messy. Dressing rooms don't get to be checked very often just because many people are shopping through out the holidays, and not my employees are working."
good,"I get up at 5:10 depending on what we are doing today but typically 5:10. I be there by 6 and I start to unload a truck with coworkers. Sweating or freezing I am there, but after we unload we send it out to the other team and they unpack them. When they're done me and a coworker go pick it up and clean up the floor before the store opens. Then all the cardboard we picked up is then palletized by the both of us. That's the end of the day depending on what we got going on."

good,"As a cosmetic consultant, I sold skin care products, makeup and assisted in choosing the right colors and shades of makeup for the client.  I advised customers how to take care of their skin.  I had to maintain the stock supply of the skin care products and makeup.  I maintained a high quota of sales on a monthly basis.  I attended training meetings for the different companies that supplied the makeup.  I did inventories and kept sales records.  I also did sales promotions on a monthly basis."
good,"Love my coworkers, my immediate manager and my job sometimes.  There are plenty of clothes in the fitting room each day since there is no limit as to how much guests can take in.  When your coworker lacks correct work ethic you end up getting stuck doing your job and theirs."

The management was flexible and sometimes helpful. Co-workers were fun and helpful. We always worked as a team to get the overall job done. The hardest part of the job is learning to deal with customers irate behaviors when we have no solution and having some co-workers who didnt want to do their part. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning different things to be successful in customer service and meeting/working with new ppl."
good,Great computer training and friendly helpful management.
good,"The whole job was customer service, and keeping the sales floor clean. My favorite part was dealing with the ladies that loved to buy. They loved the help and your honest opinion on their cloths. The hardest thing for me was keeping the fitting rooms cleaned out. I went in smiling and came out smiling, everyone there made me feel at home."
good,Coming up on my 1st year & love my job ;-) ... Management is great in helping work with my schedule with 3 children being a single Mom. NICE having a Store Manager with such a Positive Attitude & Praises her employees therefore making you want to come to work & Not dread coming to work !! This makes a Huge difference
good,I honestly can say I enjoy working at Belk. Making goals and credit is celebrated. Not only do they thank you but you get paid for the apps you open! Management at my store is great. I like that pay is based on experience. I have been doing sales for 5 years so I would be a little upset if someone just starting in sales was getting paid as high as me. Only thing you need to bring to work is a GREAT pair of shoes and a positive attitude and you're set! You can even use advertised coupons with employee discount!!
good,It was such a great experience working at Belk! I loved all of my customers and all of my coworkers! Such a sweet staff. Everyone there definitely knows how to pull together for the better of the company and our customers
good,"If you are an individual who is looking for a position after being out of the working environment for an extended period (homemaker, laid off, relocation/transition, etc.), this is the place for you.  Although the Belk's culture believes in having a work-life balance, the check would have to come down to the pay.  The associates are very nice people and they do try to treat you like family.  The Store Manager is a great person to work for.  Unfortunately, my part-time pay does not match up to my full-time bills."
good,"I've been here only a few days so far and love it. The people are great to work with and are helpful, especially for someone who's never worked in retail before. The managers are awesome and don't mind helping you as well. They are flexible on schedules, which helps when I have two jobs now."

good,"It really was an awesome place to work and then the owner died, his nephews took over and changed the company culture overnight. It was a place where people spent their entire careers, because it was just that great of a place to work, but then after the reorganization it was different. It became like so many other retailers and that is not a good thing."

good,Belk was very productive made you feel like family patient understanding I loved my job at Belk was just a bad time in my life at the end would highly recommend working at Belk it was my favorite job
good,"Working at Belk was temporary for myself, but I enjoyed the managers and their professionalism and encouraging attitudes for the employees. Some days were more stressful than others mostly depending on customers. The hardest part of the job was finding the time to put clothes back to where they belong from when they were left in the changing rooms. The job always allowed reasonable breaks, kind and friendly coworkers and managers who usually made you feel important. When it was time for a break somewhere in the middle of your shift, you just let whoever was working in your department know you would be back in 30 minutes to an hour, and that would be that. The managers hold you to reasonably high standards and expect top of the line customer service. Some coworkers were a little difficult occasionally, but that does not have too much to do with the job its self. The hours were not too much, and not too little, usually just right. There was only one week that I can recall that I noticed I was not scheduled enough. Overall, I still recommend Belk to anyone looking for a part time job."
good,"A day at work includes customer service, sales of merchandise, credit cards, clean dressing rooms and restock merchandise, keep area orderly. Associates are great to work with always willing to assist as well management. Enjoy working with customers.

good,Its very sweet at belk everybody is cool nice speaks to you. They ask you how you are doing. All the mangers at my belk are cool cant speak for other belk stores .

Also the process of signing a costumer up for a Belk card to become a member of the store. The management was great, it kept the store in order. The workplace has a modern southern style feel to it. The hardest part of the job is when i couldn't sell a product because we didn't have it at the store and i was not able to order it for the costumer for there being none in inventory.

good,It's a great place to work as a burner job but I am not a retail kind of person so I just don't see it being a long term choice for me. It's very easy a good job to make extra money while you are still in school or just need the extra money.

good,"After clocking in, I would gather the jewelry case keys and begin staging the workplace area. Once the area was made presentable and would begin checking our inventory. Once this was completed I would check the status of our repairs. This was often done via phone call and sometimes via email. All new merchandise would then be placed onto the shelves while I zoned as well. I really learned a lot about the jewelry industry at my time with Belk. All of my co-workers were really great people and we worked alongside management to achieve our goals. The hardest part of the job was convincing people to sign-up for credit cards. I worked part-time so I was unable to get as many credit applications as my full-time counterparts. This was understandable, but it still bothered me a bit. If anything, it motivated me to try harder, which is a good thing. The best part of the job was the people that I worked with and the customers we assisted."
good,"I typically started off my day at the register. First I would make sure that all the money was balanced and what it was supposed to be. Then I would straighten around the register on the tables and shelves. And then if there was any cleaning(dusting, etc) that needed to be done I did that. And I worked on stock. I went to the back to see if there was any that needed to be put out. And sometimes, if my manager asked me to I would start on markdowns/markups. I learned a lot about what it was like to work in retail. And I learned a lot about myself and what I was capable of. I loved all the managers. I did not have a problem or issue out of any one of them. My co-workers were very competitive, especially when it came to sales and soliciting credit. The hardest part was the difficult customers. The most enjoyable part was at night, when it was kind of slow I had a lot of downtime to just straighten, dust and help the customers that came in."
good,i enjoy hard work i workout alot so i loved loadin an unloadin trucks...i didnt hat nothin about tha job tha only thing i hated was that i had to moved to miami to start shcool...
good,Belk is a wonderful place to work. The management is superb and the team I work for is outstanding and a fun environment. The schedule is also great. There is opportunity to grow. Merchandising and working in the Home department is challenging and fun. Overall a fantastic company to work for. I can not say enough to recommend Belk as an employer.
good,Negative work environment with inexperienced management. Not a lot of flexibility in scheduling. You must be strong willed and able to adapt to anything.
good,this is a good place to work. We use to make commision which made it a great place to work. But I dont believe you get compensated for commissions anymore. Its just hourly now.
good,". helping people "
good,"Though I loved most of the people employed there, the management at the time was not so good. No backbone. Lots of upper management drama and everyone had a clicke."
good,I have learned a lot working there and the co-worker's were very helpful . It was just the hours weren't consistent and that was difficult because our pay varied and it's hard to live that way.
good,I loved working for belk because the fashion was second to non. I could always count on finding things that you would not normally find in other department stores.
good,Its was overnight stocking and remodeling the store!! I really dont have anything to say bad about Belk i loved the job it was seasonal. I enjoyed this job alot
good,Just  helping people in the store making sure they find everything they need and is just a friendly atmosphere it was a fun store to work at you find a lot grate stuff
good,i love working there just need more hours than what they can give me. Belk have taught me alot about operationd and dhow to send things back and selling alot
good,"Belk has provided me with a great career for the last 21 years. The management is helpful and sensitive to personal needs, and co-workers are cheerful. The best part of my job is building the personal relationships with my clientele. I worked in the petite department for over 20 years and through that, was able to build long-term relationships with numerous clients. I've actually had people seek me out in my just so they could buy their clothes through me. The service and attention I give my clients is always superb and Belk allows me to express my vibrant personality. Through the years at Belk, I have exceeded corporate sales goals and have been acknowledged for my efforts."
good,If you’re looking for a job to get by and maintain this is your ideal job. Not to much work the pay is decent and you have great customers who’ll make your day
good,I so enjoyed working with the public. My responsibility was very lite and i enjoyed the co workers there. They give me few hours to justify my time away from my family.
good,Belk is a deparment store. Co-workers were very nice and out going. the hardest part of the job was the sales and credit applications- left because I moved
good,"It is fine.  I work here part-time, so unfortunately I experienced limited hours, and long periods of cleaning"
good,"As a part time seasonal support associate at the end of the year, it wasn't as bad or stressful as I thought it would be since this was my very first job. The managers and most of the coworkers were all welcoming and plenty amicable. They were not critical when I made a mistake, and encouraged me to ask questions or for help when I needed it."
good,A great place to make a long term career in fashion with a friendly family environment with good benefits if your full time. Management really don't pay attention to all their employees they just listen to the ones that their friends with and the rest of they dont don't listen to you or do anything about problems but otherwise a good place.
good,Fantastic workplace with great customers. Management was not fair. They had their favourites in the store. Managers gave away fragrance for credit contest in the store. And every time I tried to meet with the boss man she gave me that Wednesday off.
good,I have worked at Belk for about 5 years now. It is a very laid back environment to work in except the holiday time. Belk is extremely busy during those times
good,"I came in opened up the cash registers, greeted the customers as they came through my department, helped them find anything they were looking for, rang them up on the cash register, answered the telephone, made sure the dressing rooms were clean and my department was clean."
good,Belk is my first employer. It is retail so I didn't have a consistent schedule until I was promoted to the office. I love my store manager and my HR manager.
good,"A typical day at Belk would start at 9:45 am. Starting with a morning meeting, counting registers and then opening. There was new clothing stock that came in almost every day that each department had to work onto the sales floor. This was my favorite part of the job because of the merchandising. On a daily basis you help customers find items, buy items, and return items."
good,Belk's is a good company as a retailer they have a good standard and Nice business model
good,"The managers really take care of you. They also make sure the store is in the most pristine condition. Holidays can be tough, but the hard work always pays off."
good,I’m a people person so I enjoy helping & assisting our customers as well as my co-workers.  There a lot more work involved than just checking out customers.  Recovery is a very important part of the job as well.
good,When I started working at Belk I knew there were great opportunities. I knew from my experience working at Burdines and Macy and the sales volume I had achieved that Belk offered a great opportunity for me. And it has been. I have achieved wonderful sales increase.
good,Overall great place to work.  The employees are really helpful and are great to work with.  The employer provides a great atmosphere to work.  They don’t micro management which is great.
good,It’s usually a lot of work but it get done quick. Lift a couple heavy items but it’s not bad at all. It was a clean work place and you could learn a lot of different things.
good,Belk was a good pace hands on job. At Belk i worked in receiving and shipping and it was a great job for flexible hours. Great staff worked with me. I would handle a truck load alone and was fairly easy.
good,While I was at Belk I learned what it takes to grow in the business world at what it takes to run a successful business and also helped me acquire the tools needed to be successful at the next level
good,"I've been with Belk in Conway for a little over a year, and I will be so sad when I have to leave for different career paths with my degree. From the regular customers I've built relationships with, to my management and co workers, everybody is a big family there. There's always work drama of course, but people some people come and go. I have learned so many things in my year of working there and advanced in different retail skills. If the schedules and flexibility was better. I would try to advance my career there, however that's one thing belk isn't the best about."
good,The management was not good and unorganized when I worked there so it made it hard to enjoy working for the company. The job overall wasn't bad and the other employees were friendly.
good,working at belk is just like working in any retail establishment. you have to work long hours while standing and you have to work all weekends. you do work that wasn't originally assign when you were hired.
good,"Relaxed people and good place to work would recommend to a friend just friendly people and good discount on items you buy , supervisors are helpful Great place ."
good,My positions at Belk were part-time. Usually 4-6 hours a day for about 3-4 days. Great store discounts! Free meals if you make your goals. I enjoyed the people I met at work.
good,"Set Sale"
good,This was the best job I had because I was able to be home with my wife at night. I was able to attend ally my religious meetings and able to engage in my volunteer work.

good,"i enjoyed the experience, a company you can grow to love. My managers where lovely, almost like 2nd parents. coworkers welcomed me with open arms. great experience, would of loved to stay"
good,"The management team would keep you posted on the sales that was happening that day or week. They provided you with the proper coupons that customers would have. The management team was very friendly. The hardest part of my job was dealing with those out of date computers they had & not enough floor coverage during a big sale. The most enjoyable part of my job was my department managers, and the events we had within the store. I loved The way we would come together to raise money for different charities. The way management would always encourage you to reach your goal as well as the stores goal. I will definitely miss my ""work family""."
good,"great place to work, very relaxed the staff is very respectful,  fantastic. but the only problem is the a/c it was always very cold on the work floor but besides that it was great."
good,Working for Belk is a great place to work. The management has been very supportive as I trained for my current position. My Co- Workers are great to work with.
good,working here was a great experience with great people in a great environment where everyone was treated fairly ad they assisted you in achieving your goals and accommodating schedules
good,"Very busy and multi jobs you have to do in a day .You will work non stop ,till lunch and only break is bathroom.They closed down and moved to S.C., i couldn't move to that location."
good,We were busy especially holidays and with the summer vacation tourists. The winters were a little slow but I would create events to do facials and makeovers .
good,"I would consider a typical day at work, a normal day. I say a normal day because it's the normal things that happen every day. I want to learn different things while I'm at work, that's the fun part. Hardest part about the job is communication, without communication you have nothing."
good,Typical day at work is ever changing and busy.  What I have learned is that every customer is different and has their own ideas of what is fashionable and what they like.  Management is very helpful and wonderful I absolutely love the Belk family.  Workplace culture is great everyone is like family.  The hardest part of the job is trying to please each and every customer.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers with that special outfit for a special event.
good,"The southern people are wonderful. They are warm and make you feel welcome. Totally different type of people, more laid back. Just all great. Would recommend for everyone to work there."
good,The hardest part of the job is waiting but I enjoy that part aswell! Management is awesome. Everything you need toget the job done is provided! Also they help you when in times of need!

good,"during the season there was something to do. if it was  not restock it was cleaning, to customer service. they are good people just the rules from higher up is unfair."
good,Helped people with their needs and wants.  Took money on a daily basis and closed drawer at end of shift.  Management was very helpful and understanding.  Co-workers were great to work with and easy to get along with.
good,"A typical work day at belk was busy sometimes slow, depending on what shift you worked. I learned a lot about how to open credit cards and earn some points. My coworkers were asweome. Some had their moments. The hardest part about the job was when the customers got irritated but the most enjoyable part of the job was the team work and the positivity i received for other employees even if it wasn't from the managers, but the employees!!"
good,"I love the working environment. Move freight, stock, or other materials to and from storage or production areas"
good,typically id come in around 9:45 AM and we'd have our morning meeting before opening. after the meeting id make sure my department was free of clutter and the registers had been counted. throughout the day id make sure the dressing rooms were being cleaned out regularly. at the end of the day we would recover the areas and get ready for the next day
good,"Working here was an awesome experience. The children were wonderful, they brightened my day everyday! I was always excited about working here."
good,It is a good place to work. I enjoy my time here. I love to meet new people everyday & also love to see some familiar faces. It is over all a great place to work.
good,"Along with processing expense invoices, I was the ""go-to"" person for all the stores in our division in regards to expenses.  Management travelled often, visiting locations in our division, so they entrusted the admins to handle the office in their absence.  I have learned that I can be an independent worker and capable of handling most situations that might arise."
good,A typical day at work consists helping do put backs and helping the customers find what they want. I take boxes of jewlery from the back and display them ion the correct display the store has for them. If I am working in the clothes department I not only help customers check out but I help with the put back of clothes and such.

good,Great products and wonderful to work for. I enjoyed free product bi-yearly and had great communication with all higher-ups
good,We would unload the truck and put boxes onto floats. Reading the box numbers to tell which float they belong to. Once we finish we would take the float to there proper zones or locations. When we finished that we would put the product in its place and once we finished that was the end of the day depending on what time you got off.
good,This company has a lot of changes going on with management. I was fun working with my co-workers but most did not stay long
good,Great place to work for students and part time work.  Its not meant to be a full time job. Great discounts as well.  You will have a great experience if this is just a part time job.
good,"Belk is a good place to work. It helped me to develop skills such as working together as a team, learning merchandise, building rapport with customers to help make sales & also help customer feel comfortable with merchandise he/she purchased."
good,"It was an honor to have worked for this company. We had so much fun as a team, but also as our own family. What I loved most about Belk, is that you got a 20% discount on top of getting to use the coupon that was out for that day, or week. Decent pay."
good,very busy. i learned how to do inventory. management was very nice. some of the co workers were a little slack. cleaning the dressing rooms was gross. for the most part everyone is professional.
good,"Food lion was a fast paced environment that I have learned how to count money, control the cashier, and make inventory. while working at food lion I have learned a great experience of customer service."
good,"The company culture is great and provides employee's with a supportive environment. The only concern is they are growing and a lot of managers are trying to transition it into a corporate environment, so hopefully that doesn't continue. Over all it's a great company!"
good,"I am a member of the management team at Belk Salisbury. We strive to work together as a team. Our goals are to meet and exceed store level sales plans along with national sales event goals. A typical day we spend a little time in the office checking sales, credit goals and emails. While the rest of our day we spend working on the floor with our associates. Rather its working on floor moves, markdowns, merchandising or even assisting customer.  Belk has taught me not only hands on merchandising, but a great deal of customer service. I have learned the 5 behaviors of Service Excellence.  Be ready, Greet and Engage, Add Value, Close, and Recover. With this knowledge I know that I can give the very best customer service."

good,"Great benefits"
good,"I would clock in and receive my work sheet in order to know how much work I had. I learned proper ways to stack items so they would not fall. My managers where nice and easy going, if I had any problems I would go to them and they would fix it. Some coworkers were ok and some really worked hard the ones that really cared about there jobs. There really was no hard part to the job except when we had real big orders that took extra time. The thing I enjoyed the most was I got to work at my own pace, everybody got along and helped each other out we needed. "
good,It was always fun to meet new people that came into Belk. You never knew what would happen because it's very unpredictable.

Understanding Customer Service and delivering it."
good,"I was given the opportunity to manage this counter when I was very young, and I learned a lot, both good and bad. I learned extensive customer service, how to interact with employees, and tried to learn to manage personalities that didn't match mine.

good,The job was rewarding because repeat customers would come in to shop and always give good feedback about me.  I enjoyed working with all the employees there and really liked my job.
good,"My managers were good people. The main problem with the job was the pay was just too low. Retail is tough with internet being so competitive. The big guys in Charlotte need to get new equipment. The stuff in the stores, such as registers and inventory guns are terrible tools to work with."
good,A typical day at work for an operations team member is quick paced but kind of fun. We are a close and small team of 5 people. The most enjoyable part of my job and that the time flies by when working on the freight. The hardest part of my job is trying to put up the freight when there is no where to put it.
good,"I have been employed with Belk for over two years and even though there are a few moments and customers that make me not like my job, generally I love coming to work. My co-workers are amazing and the only gripe I have is that my management could use a bit of work ( some favoritism in the management). It would be hard to advance in my area unless you are apart of the inner crowd.Also as with retail the schedules are constantly changing so if having a set schedule is more your style I would suggest not applying."
good,Great customers service love my co-workers great double discount days great location down side no hours or health care for part timers overall OK company

good,"It was a good learning experience. I learn alot of new things dealing with the fashion industry. How to do markup and markdown rates, hang and tag the clothing, and etc.... The hardest part of my job was getting customers to understand me but only beacuse I had accent. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my fellow employees ."
good,"Early morning receiving dock, unload trucks, open boxes, load on flatbeds and rolling racks, take merchandise to floor to be implemented into stock."
good,"I loved the people at Belk. I worked in the Men's Store, which was in an annex with the Home Store. This suited me just fine. I preferred the more intimate environment.  My co-worker were great for the most part, but there are always some that you just can't see eye to eye with, so you just smile and only talk when necessary. The hardest part of the job for me was reaching up to hang heavy clothes. I hurt my shoulder doing this and had to have surgery, which pretty much put me out of commision for a year. So, I went ahead and quit so they could find someone else. I worked there twice. I left the first time to be a temp for Medicare, which they completely understood. Then, I came back until my surgery. I loved the management, some of the nicest people I have ever worked for."
good,"great place to start off with retail. "
good,"Right now it is really slow,but i have been with the company for 7 years and i enjoy what i do very much. I have worked in different areas in the store but i mostly sell cosmetics. My co-workers are great and we have a great bond. The hardest part is when customers arent happy."
good,"Learned how to pick orders and keep area clean"
good,"I was a temporary seasonal employee, therefore the benefits did not "
good,"Collect credit card payments, collect lay-a-way payments, each night at closing collect each money bag from each cash register."
good,"I would clock in, put away any clothes in the dressing rooms back on the appropriate rack, I learned about many different designers. I got along with all of my coworkers and managers, there wasn't really any part of the job that was difficult. I really enjoyed helping all the customers find what they were looking for."
good,"I love to meet new people on a daily base and my co-worker were great we worked together on all things our manager was great and very understanding about every thing the hardest part of the job is trying to help a customer and put way stock, the most enjoyable part was dressing nice and smiling and being friendly to each customer"
good,Belk is a good company to get experience. You learn many key factors about the work force but little about how to grow within a company
good,Great place to work people were out going. Loved getting to work at different departments in the store It made the job fresh and not so boring. my boss she was great she always made it up beat in there. Co-workers were great a bit competitive and snobbish but you will have that any were u go.

good,I am nice and a people's person I am really seeking for a job where I can have a long term at....and a job where I can move up in the company....I am hard worker and always willing to go the extra mile when it comes to my job and willing to learn something that I don't no

Of course the pay isn't that great, so you'll probably need to work two jobs, but working here is so worth it. They even offer some benefits to part time workers. Where else can you find that?!"
good,A typical day at work consisted of me unloading the stores stock and placing it in the correct order it goes. Management was great at Belk. I enjoyed interacting with my coworkers and the customers as well.
good,"Daily retail tasks, shadow different departments to get a glimpse each department and how it effects the store as a whole. There were weekly assignments that needed to be turned in. Because some tasks were new for myself, with some of the explanations it took me longer to understand. I enjoyed the relationships I was able to create with some of the employees. There were skills that I was able to learn and take way to apply for the future."
good,"Seasonal work! Need full-time work? People friendly, enjoyed working there.Would like to work seasonal more offten as needed. I will definitely work there again."
good,A day at Belk is filled with helping customers setting up displays and stocking shelves. I learned how to work with brides and their families to set up a weeding register.
good,"A typical day was filled with waiting on customers, stocking shelves, and keeping merchandise in a presentable condition. Some duties varied on the day of the week, the month or even the time of year."
good,Great team to work with.  Was allowed to be creative. Management is engaged with the team and sometimes works right in the trenches with everyone else. The job is somewhat physical because you move  inventory daily.
good,"I loved my time working here. We had a great team and great managers. I loved coming to work and I loved most of the customers. You had lots of regulars and even though some of the customers would be rude, your managers were always around to help. I moved up from part-time to full-time very quickly.They trained me very well and managers would answer any questions I had. My managers noticed my work ethic and promoted me once I expressed interest. You did have certain goals you had to reach in order to get a yearly raise but your team would always help you along the way. The store I worked at was small so our team was like family. Not sure how it is at the bigger stores. They do push you constantly to open credit cards but this seems to be normal in all department store jobs. I would recommend this job to anyone!"
good,Fair work enviroment. Flexible in the workplace as well as hours. Everyday came with opportunity to learn and perform different task. Management cared for their employees.
good,Overall working at Belk has been a good experience. They try to find fun and exciting ways to get their employees involved and enjoy the job. It does get aggravating at times
good,This is a good company to work for and advance with. At this time I have nothing further to say at this time nor in the future.
good,It was a comfortable job with friendly co-workers. I enjoyed the organization and opprotunity to practice my customer service. I stayed on my feet most of the days and recieved a 1 hour lunch break for every 8 I worked.
good,independent work with limited micromanagement. Co-workers are easy to get along with. Job description was pretty clear cut
good,"I learned more from Belk than I can list. During my time at this company, I believe my ability to assist customers on a more personal level became very sharp. I learned about their lives and needs and used this information to help them select products that would enhance their lives."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Belk because the managers recognize employees efforts and they put people first. Also through the job, I learn patience with your customers."
good,"Very busy and productive "
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was work with different customers. Knowing my job inside and out and being able to assist customers with what they needed. I love customer service. It isn't always easy and you don't always get the best customers but that's what keep the days interesting.
good,"I had great co-workers and Assistant Managers.  On a typical day I would set sales, organize my area and make sure it is clean. Assistant customers finding what they are looking for and checking them out at the register.  I learned great customer service and I enjoyed conversing with the customers."
good,"Management sometimes show favoritism, overall good job enviornment"
good,"Making sure my job tasks, and the ability to provide customer service always were done. Enjoyed helping customers find exactly what they needed, by even advertising something a little more expensive that fit there needs."
good,"Create excitement at the counter to encourage new customer interaction and product knowledge. Plan events to show customers how to use product and increase sales as well as customer base. Schedule employee schedules for upcoming weeks, holidays, and events. And configure paper work for product line, damages, and employee compensation."
good,I enjoyed working there. It was fun and time went by fast because I was busy at all times.
good,"A typical day would include receiving 30 to 40 orders from our customers and processing same. Following orders through the process and seeing them shipped as promised. I learned to expect the best from your employees when you give your best. The hardest part of my job was to have a customer need a product that we did not have in stock. Then the product would have to be manufactured and shipped as-soon-as possible. "
good,"My typical work day was a great one. It starts off busy with a lil down time. I learned alot about how to use SKU numbers. Management was very helpful. My co-workers and I were like family, we worked as a team to get our jobs done. The hardest part of the job was when it was time to go home because I never wanted to leave. I loved my job just that much. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers come back and say ""I missed you while you were off""."
good,i go to work to make money not to have fun all work is hard what do you want me to say it is a great place to work
good,"It’s a nice place to work, the people there are nice, and it’s easy to catch on, but gaining hours is very difficult during some of the times of the year."
good,"Be knowledgeable about merchandise and products, know your sales, customer service is a must, know the layout of your department and store, keep fitting rooms cleaned out and merchandise put back in proper place, maintain a cliental book, help with merchandising and sale sets"
good,I've been here almost three years I've met a lot of people and enjoy working here it is a good place to work employees are friendly we have fun sometime work is hard sometimes and sometimes it can be easy just according to what day it is

good,Working at Belk was fun and enjoyable and they gave great employee discounts.I really enjoyed my time working there and hope to find another job with a similar working atmosphere.
good,Only thing is there are no limits on how many items customers can take to the dressing rooms.  You spend majority of the time putting things away.....
good,Did not like the idea of managers being continuously switched and extra work being placed on employees all of the time that was not under the job description.
good,"Because of my flexibility in working with customers in a variety of settings, my workday was never typical.  My primary role was in accessories sales, but I also worked in other departments as needed on an emergent basis.  Additionally, I was called upon to complete inventory, staff grand openings, and other tasks not offered to many associates.  The culture was good, overall, although management conflict began to cause problems with morale.  Ultimately, that portion of the Belk organization collapsed and another family member accepted the duties."
good,"Belk is a positive workplace. Everyday I walk into work everyone is smiling, Greets you with a hello and is very friendly. Employees are hardworking and Belk always provides you with some type of work and is very flexible."
good,It was a easy task working at belk. Peak season is always a busy fine for belk. You always had a challenge working there. They also gave out prices to random names picked out of a drawing.
good,"in a typical day, open the cash registers, then start on putting stock away, taking care of customers and checking them out. even on slow days the pace is still quick and there is always way to stay busy"
good,Belk is very flexible and helpful when it comes to college. I enjoy the open minded decisions  my manager  personally make; she made sure we were all able to come together and laugh over “cup cake day” or “customer appreciation day”..
good,belk was a fun job . i liked that we got discounts . everybody worked together as one . the managers did they jobs well and didn't take long to come when you needed them .
good,Good group of people I worked with.  Training was very thorough and someone was always around if I needed help with something. It is a very social job which I enjoy very much.
good,I really loved my time working at Belk. Every one there was so welcoming and friendly. It was like family. I was hired as a temp employee but had a knee injury outside of work. I've stopped in often and they want me back. If it wasn't for the awesome team here it would have been just another job.
good,"Great place to work, the sales team managers were great. The operations team manager was, in my opinion, garbage and should be  replaced. but other than that it was a great place to work."
good,"I disliked working here because of the unsteady hours, no paid vacations, and little time to complete a lot of work.  I did on the other hand, like the food provided, work around your schedule, and the people."
good,A typical day at Belk consisted of discussing merchandise with customers and helping please people with their personal appearance. All of my managers are absolutely amazing at what they do. The hardest part is making sure all of the merchandise is kept in good care. The most enjoyable part is how everyone acts like a family.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and my employee discount. I felt that that store and management did value their employees. The benefits were fair and the company promoted a nice work atmosphere.
good,"Productive, laid back and a fun workplace with great people . You get to talk to great people all day and also get rewards for your achievements. The manager was great as well."
good,The people were great to work with. I received adequate training. There were plenty of things to keep you busy. Management was      very good about working around my schedule.
good,"Belk is a great place to explore and build skill levels in merchandising, customer service and responsibility.  I enjoyed each position held with the company and counted in an honor to work with the team."
good,"I worked less than a year, after the store was built and opened."
good,"A typical day was arriving at work at 5:30 and unpacking all inventory , Sensor all clothing , and put it out on the floor. If we had time we would go help another department before store opening."
good,I am disappointed that I cannot be rehired. I should have appealed my termination and I regret it. I truly loved working for Belk and I would have gone the distance. I could have seen myself having long term employment up until the time I would have retired.
good,"it was a great experience , and the pace of the job kept me busy which was good. the most enjoyable part of the job was that the co workers were very helpful and polite when needed we are a team and help each other to catch up and stay on task, there are really no hard parts of the day unless there no work and we are waiting around searching for work."
good,"Working in the mens dept was both challenging and fun,I learned how to taylor pants and stock merchandise,pricing and sales signs fit mannequins ect. management was easy to geta hold of if you had a problem.We all worked as one big happy family.Frequented customers knew us by name  and vice versa.The hardest part of my job was switching from days to nights because i had three boys at the time who were all in school.The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I was helping my customers.If they needed a fitting, I was there.If they needed a different color or size,I made sure they had it.my customer always left happy!"
good,Meetings every morning went over sales goals. Made sure everything was in order before store opened. I loved all the customers got to know a lot of people.
good,"I learned a lot of different things working at this department store. I learned how to measure women, men, and kids feet by working in the shoe department. I learned how to stay consistent with keeping up with several customers at once, while also keeping them happy and enjoying there shopping.  The culture of this store was based off of ""modern southern style"" very southern and laid back. The hardest part of this job was trying to stay on the same page with all other associates in the store because our managers would tell some associates one thing and others another thing, so communication was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is that everybody as far as associates got along great and had great relationships with one another."
good,"A typical day at work is working with the general public all day no age limit set. I have learned more people skills, problem solving, and multi-tasking. I have no management skills but willing to learn. My workplace culture does not affect me. The hardest part of my job is not being able to solve a problem. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and making them happy to where they are satisfied with my service."
good,"Awesome place to work for!, The people and the management are amazing people! We were all like a family there, I am very sad to have to go."
good,"I love working at Belk. It is a great company to be a part of and work for. It is very busy with multiple task to be completed, and I am a very good at multi-tasking."
good,"A place that target high school graduates, college students and older adults. Excellent career oppurtunities and allow areas for growth. Learn product knowledge while having fun, doing something you love and building a relationship with customers based on their deslire and needs."
good,It was a plesure working there. I enjoyed the public as well as my management team.
good,"Belk Stores is probably one of the last privately owned retail companies left in today's market. It is family owned and one of the cleanist and most profitable companies I've ever seen, and is comparable to department stores such as Macy's and Dillards.  It is comprised of close to 400 stores stretching from the Carolinas to Louisiana, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Florida and Alabama."
good,I enjoyed working at Belk and dealing with the public.  I was able to use my skills from my previous jobs. I had a great communication with my co-workers. What I enjoyed the most was assisting the customers with their needs.  I felt an accomplishment by the end of the day after the store closed and I balanced the cash register.
good,"Learned a lot about the retail world and different cultures also, found patience I never thought I would have."
good,they terminated me for no reason hated that but could go back just havent applied
good,Typical retail. Good work environment. Learn the importance of time and working a schedule.
good,Great coworkers along with great management. Easy to get along with everyone and work together to maintain stores upkeep and inventory. Great place to work.
good,In a typical day I help customers with makeup questions. Schedule appointments to drive counter business. Work together with my coworkers to develop a sales plan and insure that I reach my personal goal and also provide tools to enable my co workers to do the same. The hardest part of the job is being away from my family as much as I am. The most enjoyable part of the job is giving that great customer service to every client every day.
good,"I was very pleased with the oppertunity to show of my skills and to develope a talented team of detective's and lead the region in stats and productivity. Building a great relationship with management only to gain sucess in loss-prevention as a manager, and to become a pacesetter."
good,"I worked in the accessories section of Belk as a sales representative. There I staged jewelry and other accessories, and organized purses, wallets, belts, and scarves. Along side the jewelry department, I would sometimes help out with the shoes area, if the store was short of hands. My co-workers were really nice, and very helpful, as well as the management, who helped make sure that I was the best sales rep. for their store. The hardest part of the job was doing nothing for hours on end if the area was as organized as I could possibly make it, and all I had to do was wait for customers. However, the most enjoyable part was when someone needed help, whether it was matching accessories to an outfit or just pointing them towards the bathroom."
good,I had so much fun dealing with the customers and attending to their needs.
good,"Working at the Belk Department Stores in Charlottesville, Virginia was a pleasure. The management staff strived to provide the best in support for their employees, very considerant, and supported their employees during challanging times. The operations of suppling materials to the floors with lack of staff was very challanging, and the team always managed to produce results."
good,"Customers appreshiated good help. Hours were ok, training wasn't the best, very long and boring."
good,"I am enjoying working at Belk more than any other job I have ever had. I actually look forward to going in to work. The managers are very motivating and regularly give incentives for meeting set goals. Everyone helps one another. It is definitely a ""team"" oriented environment. I am currently part time, but hoping for full time."
good,I can't say nothing bad or nothing good about it. It was fun working with all my employees. But I knew I had something better to do in life. It's a great job for somebody that doesn't have kids and just want to make a little money on the side.
good,Worked with my school schedule and gave great hours. I worked two jobs at the time and they worked with both my school and work schedule. Great pay just really depends on the manager.
good,"I worked in the shoes department, home department, women's department, mens department and cosmetic department. My favorite department was cosmetic's. My lease favorite experience was the holiday hours. But overall I enjoyed Belk's as a place of employment."
good,"I really enjoyed working there it was a great environment for a first job , everyone was nice and calm. I learned to work at a fast pace and having help from other sales associates when it got busy was amazing !"
good,"Belk is the New Bern store for gift giving.  They carry modern items and continually have discount opportunities for customers.  Belk enjoys the interaction between the employee and the customer and encourages the employee to get to know the customer & what they are looking for.  The Belk employees are a fun group with honest, hard working ethnics."
good,"Great compensations. "
good,"Working with Belk is a repetitive job which is ok, but it can get stressful when there are sales going on there more people using the dressing room which  become more dirty with clothes.  During the work day, you make sure the department you are working is stays clean which mean putting clothes where they belong, picking clothes off the floor and etc. Sometime it can be boring where you don't have any customers then there's time where your area can use some cleaning but your department is busy."
good,"They were very nice they treated me like I was part of their family even though I was temporarily hired for the holidays it was a very hi pace ."
good,"They will work with you on your schedule plus you get double discount days. In cosmetics you get what they call gratis so many time a year so you get free cosmetics & makeup. And anytime new product is released to get it in the mail, FULL SIZE, FREE!!!!"
good,Belk was a great place to work when I was there. It was a very balanced place. Everyone got along and everything flowed smoothly. All of the managers at Belk seemed to truly care about their employees and worked with them when needed.
good,I would recommend for people who actually like to clean and you are good at it.  They need people who actually care about the job they do. I will say the mangers really will work with you most of the time and does care. I really felt like i was at home working here i enjoyed meeting great people.
good,"The opportunities to make good money are there, even if you get hired part time you have the potential to get full time hours. Management where I worked was great and supportive so were the other employees. Overall I think it's great for someone that enjoys retail. I personally do not but that has nothing to do with the company"
good,The Belk Corporate buying office was an amazing experience. When you were hired you were part of a family. The company worked hard at providing opportunities for advancement. They rewarded loyalty and prided themselves in retaining talent.
good,amazing place to work. love the discount. i love working with all the customers. i would completely recommend this company to any person looking for a job.
good,I work on the Rocc team. We unload the trucks and place merchandise on racks or flat bed carts which we roll out at the end of the shift. Clean up after we are finished and that's a days work. Simple and easy.
good,Good place to work. The management was easy to work with. My direct boss worked hard to allow me to have a schedule that was good for work and home life.
good,"Nenhum dia era como um outro, especialmente quando os engenheiros decidiam distribuir programas novos, para os computadores dos usuários sem comunicar nosso grupo, em sem testar adequadamente os programas. Isso causava com que o time inteiro deixasse de fazer suas outras obrigações, e fazer o possível para reduzir o tempo que os usuários permanecem fora for ar. "

good,"I love the thought of dressing up every-day going to work.  "
good,A company focused on delivering resutls through it's associates.  Meet or exceed metic goal expectations. Recognize and celebrate success daily of customer service and sales behaviors.
good,"My typical day consisted of recovering my work area until a customer came, I learned how to work with a team. Belk benefited me way more than it hindered me."
good,"I had the most fun working here, it was my first 'adult job' and I learned to grow with two companies, Belk and Estee Lauder. Lots of opportunity to learn with new product knowledge also the stresses of sales and numbers kept me on my feet! Goals everyday.

We had a great management staff, great young team and overall a family."

good,I loved working here even thought he pay was $9 the atmosphere at the spanish fort store was energizing. If I was making more and were getting a full 80 hours I would still be at the job.
good,"A typical day here would start off by going to whatever department you were signed to. Once you get to your department you start organizing and cleaning your department and helping customers find what they need whether is a sweater in a certain color or sunglasses that best fit their style. Every day you could learn something new whether is was learning to size women for a bra size, or how to stock the shoe stock room, or how to measure a man for a suit. The management at this particular Belk were amazing. They are easy to contact, very friendly, and always willing to help and go over and beyond to make you feel appreciated. The hardest part about this job was training seasonal workers who just jump in not really having time to learn everything before the holiday is over. The most enjoyable part about this job is that their are great incentives while working there such as raises, gift cards, and advancement within the work place."
good,good company to work for. Daily activities involve routine retail management and customer service. Processing merchandise and  store event prep. and set ups
good,I was successful with achieving my sales goals for the floor sales and long-term events.

good,"Working at belk we have swing shifts, so sometimes you may come in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon. In the mornings we always get together before store open and we talk about the previous day on how well we did, far a sales, credits, our score on how well we treated our customers, just to let everybody know where we at. Then we go to our area open registers and get started with our day. Everyday there is something to do, we either have to set a sale, straighten our merchandise so customers can shop and mess it all back up but hey it gives us something to do!! I love working with the customers and some of us have a personal relationship with the customers, like some people have certain associates they like to go to, to shop or just talk about anything.

good,Loved working here and with the managers. I learned alot about make up and skin care. Working with the other cosmetic people was great! The hardest part of the job was trying to sell expensive cosmetics to customers that live in not to expensive areas. I enjoyed getting excited about new products and showing them to customers as they came into the store.
good,Keeps you busy. I like people. Co workers are great. Management works with you. It's not. Customers are usually entertaining.

good,"Management always acknowledges you when in site. Be prepared to work weekends, I had to resign due to another weekend job, where I had to work Sunday, so they asked if I would consider a different department that did not require weekends. If you work hard, they will acknowledge and encourage. You accept the responsibility to encourage selling Belk credit cards, but the store works as a team. Support from other employee’s is exceptional."
good,"It is fun for me helping peoole find the perfect gift, or just the right style! Setting sales helped know what was where and showing people where to find what they came for then adding to the purchase is satisfying for the customer and the associate."
good,It is retail so it can be stressful at times.  I have a great schedule just not compensated for the work load given.  Also they do not base raises on your work performance just the store performance..
good,"As a seasonal worker for Belk, I really loved my job.  The other associates were great to work with and down to earth. All the managers there are very nice but also very hard working and work with the associates to get the goal of the day done. I would go back and work with these lovely women that pull together to run Belk as one."

I've learned that the more comfort  in a shoe the more satisfied your customer will be. Each body is asymmetrical causing some customers feet to either be wide, narrow, high arched or low arched. The most difficult part of the job is helping the customer decide on which shoe because the cutest shoe isn't always comfortable. If the customer leaves comfortable they wont come back in pain.

I enjoyed my customers the most, I made friends with some of the most amazing people that shopped in the store.

Some of the management have unrealistic expectations of what can be done in a 6 hr. period.  One dept. manager in particular is wonderful at praising employees in a condicending manner that is so annoying.  And management tells employees about other employees and pits them against one another.  Like I said, its mainly one person."

good,"A typical day at work would either consist of a sign change or putting out merchandise. Pretty much a fun job great for college students, and flexible for older individuals."
good,I have been working at Belk part time for almost a year.  I love my team mates and the management.  And the 401k is amazing!  Belk matches up to 6 percent and you are vested immediately and I am a part timer!!  I love the 401k.  I have another full time job so I don't need the health insurance.  And the discount is great.  Double discount on even clearance items.  Love my Belk job.
good,I enjoyed working at belks.  Management is nice and helpful and co workers were friendly and helpful.  Hours and days were scheduled fairly. Employees were treated fairly.
good,"I work in three different departments during my three years with the company. Had its ups and downs, but if you get to know your co workers and have fun its an enjoyable job, but if you keep to yourself you will hate it."
good,"Very nice managers,  work very nice because the manager give chance for rising in my job, believe me in my decisions. Nice incentives for growing in department"
good,"I was a child model here, all employees very respectful. Made a great healthy and fun environment for everyone. Always looked forward to and enjoyed my time at Belk."
good,I liked all of the friendly staff. The pay schedule was bi-weekly and pay raises were annually. I did enjoy the bonuses I received every three months if my department performed their duties.
good,A typical work day was nice and smooth. Management was good learned many new things from them. Working there was great got to meet people working there and help some great customers.
good,Love the people that i work with and it is a great place to work. Great benefits that they offer to their associates. Able to advance at Belk if you are willing to transfer.
good,"I was working here as sales/Cashier.first i was part time worker then full time,it wasn't easy on working in holiday times,long hours,employees did get discount at work."
good,"The people that I worked with are unbeatable.  While we did have goals, they were not hard to meet, just do your job.  At Belk as long as you are doing what you are supposed to, the management is on your side and easy to work for."
good,"A typical day at work for me was busy and productive. When answering a switchboard promptly, accurately and quickly was important and in a timely manner. Every call received from customers, the main headquarters {in Charlotte} or vendors, or our  in store management and fellow employees, were ""all "" treated as special, important and necessary."
good,"-Shifts are usually 3-8 hrs for part-time employees"
good,Nice place to work. Very interesting and orderly. Only am seasonal associate. Only been there for a few weeks but everything is great so far.
good,"This was the first job I've had working in retail, and I enjoyed it. My typical day at work was usually very busy since I worked as a seasonal associate during the Christmas season. I did understand that it was not always going to be that busy, but I did enjoy how busy it was because I always had something to do. Because it was the first customer service job I had, I learned a great many things. I learned how to better develop my people skills, and I learned how to better handle those customers that were unhappy about something. I'm pretty sure I had the best managers that any associate could ask for. I loved my managers! My co-workers were so amazing and helpful. I had so much fun working with them. They were always willing to help me when I encountered a situation that I did not know how to handle. The hardest part of my job was having to fill in for some of my co-workers who were always late or never called out when they were not able to show up. I never minded working extra, but it was hard on some days when I had somewhere else to be. It is helpful when your co-workers call out when they canno show up. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the new people and seeing all different kinds of personalities. There were some customers that were easier to deal with than others, but I have to give an over-all positive review about my time at Belk."
good,This job taught me so much about the management of a department store and the requirements of such a job. It taught me that great teamwork and an attentive manager are key in this field.
good,Working for the company Belk has been an amazing experience. Being apart of the Belk family has been an adventure with the customers and the clothing. Multitasking is a must when you work in retail. There is never a dull moment in retail and especially never slow during the Christmas season. Belk will always be one of my favorite places to work.
good,"Working at Belk is a great experience. I developed better communication skills and keeping my area clean. Belk's associates are like family, but I believe they never keep enough people on the floor at all times. Todays Woman is always a mess with Z-bars, because they normally work one person at a time in that department. Customers would often complain and I would reassure them that im always here to help and im sorry about the inconvenience. Other then that Belk is a nice place to work."
good,"I started at Belk in Customer Service as a seasonal employee wrapping gifts in 2014. I came back in June of 2015 when my daughter got engaged for extra money because I enjoyed the position, my co-worked the the customers so much. Customer Service is being eliminated in May so I am being displaced but I'm hoping to find a position elsewhere in the company that I like as much as Customer Service."

I received 2 or 3 pay raises within the year that I worked there and the job was not stressful,  although there were times when it was challenging,  but that was the fun of it. If you enjoy retail, I highly recommend it."
good,I enjoyed everyone I worked with and made friendships that have been maintained for 20 years. Working with such great people made the job fun to go to.
good,"Belk is a very fun place to work at, with awesome coworkers and a great management group. As a sales associate in the women's department my job is to greet every customer who walks in the store and help them with anything might need assistance with. I have to keep my department clean and straight and empty the fitting room in my area. As a sales associate at Belk we have sales goals, Belk credit card goals, and item locator goals that we have to meet every month."

good,I knew what I needed to do and was turned loose to take care of the things I needed to do. If I ever missed any time even an hour due to a dr appointment etc. I was able to make that time up on other days. Management was always awesome. I enjoyed working with them and learning from them. My co workers were all good as it did rotate some but all were great. The hardest part of the job was limiting myself on things that needed to be done. My goals were set higher for myself than they set for me.
good,"A typical day is truck day everything is like clock work, non-stop, busy, busy, busy. I learned organizations skills, and a lot about retail. Management was decent. They were all cool. Co-workers were great, loving, caring, like one big happy family. I don't think I had anything to worry about that was hard. I loved this job. They always had caterers. I loved working events."

good,"Meeting and helping costumers"
good,"I open cash registers, put out new stock, scan department for new sales, rearrange floor with new merchandise if needed. Assist customers with needs with clothing. I work with a great team. The hard part is maintaining your daily sales quote during slow peak. I enjoy working with customers and my co-workers.

good,"Good paying job,fun place to work. It got crazy on the big sale days like black friday and big shoe sales, but other than that it was one of the best jobs i had."
good,"I learned about fashion events, the behind the scenes and how much production goes into the event before the actual event; how people are involved and how quickly the show goes. I enjoyed most was putting the event together and then seeing the end result. It was beautiful and amazing. I enjoyed everything. My co-workers were nice and easy to work with."
good,"I love the job, enjoy my co-workers and management. Nice atmosphere."
good,"I started working at Belk in high school which led to me getting this job as temporary Christmas help. A typical day for me at Belk was answering phones, stocking and setting up displays, inventory, assuring customer service, marking merchandise.

I have learned many things about footwear and can pass it on to customers, which ultimately helps them choose the best shoe for their needs. The culture at Belk is very friendly and I have made many friends in my department and others. The department managers are easy to work with and listen to your feedback about the department and are interested in hearing your ideas about how you think it might be improved.

good,A typical day at Belk consists of helping out the costumers and keeping you department in order. What I learned from Belk is that responsibilities are a major concern. Management is always on the floor helping out workers and as well as costumers. Co-workers from Belk are always on their best behavior. The hardest part about the job is to keep your area in good shape because we want it like new for our next costumer. The most enjoyable part of the job was to have a close relationship with customers and the hustle of keeping Belk an improving store over time.

good,The good about working there or anywhere is everything. Just do what your told to do and your job will be easy. And there are no bad comments about this job or any job.
good,"As an associate I worked in different departments of the store. Each department was different than the others and required me to have proper knowledge on of the items in all departments. A typical day for me at work began with clocking in, reporting to my department, assisting the customers, and making sure the department was stock and organized. Management allowed this to be more efficient due to several managers over the various departments. The workplace culture is very diverse which allows me to bond and learn things on a personal level. If I had to state something that was hard about this job is that making sure each customer is satisfied so that they will return to shop with us again. The most enjoyable part about this job is meeting new people and creating bonds with co-workers and customers."

Some days however, you could start doing one thing, then you're asked to do other tasks and you're whole shift may consist of doing many different things. You will always have something to do, so it makes shifts seem to go by quickly. The other employees are good people to work with and the managers are very understanding and understand that people have other things going on outside of work. You will be held accountable for things not completed however, and it helps you build a sense of accountability for yourself."

I quickly learned to balance both aspects of my job and i enjoyed my bosses and co workers. They trusted me to keep the department straight and clean and also trusted me enough to handle the floor moves in the department and also the visual displays. I also handled the registration of Brides and i handled and modeled in Bridal fashion shows for the store. The only thing i didnt like back then was just the traveling i had to do for the out of town Bridal events.
good,"Loved this company, if I didnt have to move because of husbands relocation to new station i will definitely be there today. Great environment great people great opportunities!!1"
good,"open or close registers"
good,"A typical day would include answering phones, organizing clothing, putting clothing on the racks where they belong, opening or closing a register, helping customers, marking down clearance and preparing for sales. I learned how to satisfy a customers needs and anything I needed to know about working in retail. My co-workers were pleasant and were really good at teamwork. The managers were fair to their employees, always polite and gave constructive criticism. The hardest part of the job was making sure all the sale signs were correct and everything on the clothing rack was included, and if it wasn't we had to find a different spot where it would fit. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with pleasant people and assisting customers and their needs"
good,"I currently work for Belk as a full time Operations Lead. I am in charge of half of the store including, misses (6+ vendors), Juniors (2+ vendors), Intimates (9+ vendors), Better (5+ vendors), Contemporary (3+ vendors). Email me for review of current employment."
good,Good place to work and shop.Nice people work there to.Hardest part was cleaning and closing at night.
good,"A typical day working at Belk requires being on your feet and moving around the floor. A sincere smile is required and usually comes naturally from the satisfaction of our customers. Our mission is to make sure our customers are getting fashion they desire and the value they deserve from our quality brands and knowledgeable sales associates. The most enjoyable part of the job is that at the end of the day, it's not just about making a sale to a customer. My job is to make sure our customers count on Belk first; for themselves, for their family, for life. It is also my duty to assist customers in being rewarded for their service to us. Belk Rewards cards offer a great deal to Belk customers who shop continuously with us and rewards them in points by the amount of money they spend using their Belk card. The hardest part of the job is security. Meaning, if the conditions are right, people will steal. Cameras and LP's are good but it is everyone's job to prevent loss. It's hard to manage in doing so at times when we are rushed and busy with other customers. The most important thing I try to remember is to always keep my head up and my eyes open, to always be aware of my surroundings and to check dressing rooms as much as possible."
good,"My typical day at work started with opening the registers in the handbag and accessory department. After that we had a 10 minute morning meeting where the sales plan for the day was discussed, the different sales and coupons were also discussed, if we had markdowns to do. Sales to set. Hardest part of the day was trying to set the sales sometimes. Most enjoyable was seeing the new merchandise come in and where to put it."

good,"I loved every customer that came in, they were really caring, nice, and always had a great attitude. I've learned a lot on how to measure people's bra size, such as the band and cup size. The manager team was really helpful and nice, they provided lunch for all the co-workers on the job when we had a busy day around the holiday season. The thing i miss the most at Belk is the co-workers, they were so nice and helpful, one night i had to close down 4 registers and a co- worker decided to help me close them down. It was really hard to say goodbye but i know I'll see them again. Nothing on the job wasn't hard, everything was pretty much simple and easy. I really enjoyed meeting new people and helping customers find what they were looking for."
good,Excellent place to work. Great Managers and Supervisors along with all the associates. Friendly local people come in to shop instead of going to the Mall. They find the Larger stores do not give very good personalized service. I go the extra mile to make every customer feel welcomed.
good,I like working at belks because they have good quality of clothing and I love serving the cusomers. but what I dislike about belk they have very low rate of salary.

good,"My typical day at work for belk was full of cleaning and rearrangement of the department. I learned that not everyone is a hard worker. I had the best manager there, she was always very willing to help me with all the chores I had to get done for the day in the department. I loved all of my co-wokers and I still go and visit them on my free time because they were very helpful to me when I first became an associate of the store and I am forever thankful of that. The hardest thing about my job was when it was down to myself and one other associate in just my department I was the only one doing any work, the other associate stayed planted at the register because our pay was determined by our sales and I could never make any sales because I was always out on the floor doing whatever was asked of me. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know all of my co-workers that enjoyed working with me as much as I enjoyed working with them."
good,"They had awesome benefits, and management was exceptional. The hours were tough because I'm a single Mom and I had to work every Saturday. I left because I needed to be home more with my teenage children."
good,Good Place to work with a very friendly staff. Store does a little over 15 million in net sales a year. Southern company with relentless customer service based values.
good,I usually opened the store with the M.O.D. and did my fitting room checks and my stockroom checks. Then i reviewed the overnight video and got ready to open the doors. I had a great working relationship with the store manager as well as all the asst. managers. I learned how to identify a potential shoplifter as well as how to look for internal theft. The hardest part of the job was having down time when the store was slow so i would do some of the maintenance work that needed to be done. All in all i really enjoyed my time at Belk.
