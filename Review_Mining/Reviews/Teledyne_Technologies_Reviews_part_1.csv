rating,review
bad,"treated most of  people with no respect,the select few were treated totally different,I was so happy to leave this company,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND YHIS PLACE TO AN ENEMY EVER MIND A FRIEND."
bad,Profits were only concern and employees are treated like robots and nearly slaves! Uneducated and untrained leadership where Spanish is language required to work there! Job offered no training for position and duties could not be performed due to communication(language) issues!
bad,"Leads are really aggressive, this people dont have any training, yelling at people all day. They don’t help when workers need help, this company do not invest any money hiring a professional supervisor especially leads there is 2 really aggressive women , during this year I saw around 20 workers leave this company."
bad,Worst place i have ever work at ..I honestly have nothing good to say about Them.. They treated me like the Sheep of the Family ......................
bad,"Too much drama with the women that work there!  Overly sensitive for a chemical plant environment, which directly effected the atmosphere for everyone in the company, site ! your experience and knowledge. And the turnover rate is atrocious"
bad,"they will lie about your work,20yr olds will fall asleep at there work station and not get fired,others will just not show up,but if your a temp they dont want you there and they dont ,they will make up something (the one showing how to do the job)then get to work on machinery thats from the stone age breaks down if you look at it wrong,oh you will be blamed for that too.maybe some day someone or people will have had it with this place go to work for another company that does what they do and put this company out of business.oh wait, i just did,just say en."
bad,Wouldn't work there ever again low pay expected to work over alot guess if your handicapped or right out of highschool may be a temporary job but nothing long term no way can live on what they pay they make a million a month but employees make nothing corporate gets monthly bonus if reach goal
bad,"Was fired for refusing to do more OT than I currently did ( I worked 45-50 hours a week) Tried to explain the situation to both my supervisor and manger in meetings with thier response being that I will be fired if I don’t do the OT. Management doesn’t care about the employees on the floor with a “us vs them” mentality. Management doesn’t care about quality just MONEY. Pay is terrible for the work load and stress management shovels on you constantly. I saw how shoddy/ cutting corners the company is becoming and this is putting peoples lives at risk. If you firmly plant your lips on your manager’s backside, you can do what you want without reprimands. This company is a joke all in its self. Oh, by the way, we’re all paying for it too seeing 70% of their business is govt. contracts!"
bad,"Don't waste your time, this is the worst job in the world ! Bad people. Bad work environment. Don't apply. You will regret it. There are better places every ware. Not this place."
bad,"There are very few opportunities for career growth, raises, or change. Management will often overlook experience and expertise in the field. You will be asked to do many tasks that do not fall under your job title for no compensation or job title change. I routed calls all over the plant, but I was not hired to be a receptionist.  This company is male dominated that moves very slowly on all decisions, and has not been a good environment for younger professional women.  "
bad,The manager was the worst I ever had in 40 years. Everyone is overworked. They won't hire more people as business increased. Top management does not know how to direct the direction of the company.
bad,"There have been people working here for ten years and they still do NOT get the benefits which include: insurance, paid vacations, and paid sick days. Do not apply to work here because you will be forced to work super hard for long hours but will not get any benefits."
bad,It was my first job running cnc grinding equipment. It's it a fast paced safe work place. The white floor could have been eaten off of it was so clean. To bad it closed down now.
bad,solder component on pc broads using small hand tools. learned how to solder really fast work on assembly line. management nice. co-worker also nice. nothing hard about the job. enjoy getting the job done.
bad,i have accomplished my job and ran out of work. The only thing i noise is that a new company bought of the company and made changes and nothing good came out of it.
bad,a typical day is being very nice to senior management in hopes that WHEN the next layoff happens (pretty much every business quarter on the last day so they can lie to shareholders) it wont be you.
bad,"Since the 2nd generation took over family owned Optech, Decline in R&D, decline in sales and the market share pushed the owners to sell the company to Teledyne. Since then the technology drain and the work place squeeze to save a dime spending the a dollar is continuing."
bad,"management gains their innocence by taking yours, no ethics policy enforced, everything revolves around the comfort of upper managment"
bad,"The management is without trustworthy character. When I was let go, It was for not meeting goals that were never communicated and was outside of my influence."
bad,"Very poor management, no advancement and no coaching."
bad,Too cheap to provide air conditioning or filter the air Management operates on wishful thinking and unrealistic expectations. People who work there require pschotrophic medication to cope with the stress.
bad,You want a low salary? The you found the right company to work for! Like the feeling of being on a constant sinking ship run by idiots? You found the right place
bad,Be on the good side of management or they will try to find ways to harass or get rid of you lots of overtime no appreciation for your work whatsoever. Rotten place to work
bad,"I proved to dentists that it wasn't me that messed up the part and he still fired me I knew he was going to fire me before I got fired I told the temp agency weeks in advance that he didn't like me "
bad,Work 10 hours a day and almost every Saturday with low pay. At the most .25 cent raise every year but Health Insurance goes up every year and takes it. Health insurance is over $700/month for a family. There is no opportunity for advancement either. Rather an employee is qualified or not the salary jobs are hired from outside.
bad,"As a temporary Contractor, provided pre-award contract support for Teledyne, who was awarded a $25 million contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)."
bad,"Communication between department staff, supervisors and management needs extreme improvement. Lacking stability and order in work assessments. Reminder of job descriptions needs to be upheld. Increase discipline and more strict work ethics in department leads and supervisors."
bad,"They are constantly having a ""reduction in work force"" and then turn around and fill the same positions within a year.  Employees are expendable and viewed as working bees, not as people.  HR does nothing when an employee complains about management or discrimination at the work place because of personal relationships they have with management.  Current employees complain constantly and do not stay long unless they have no where else to go.  One employee even attempted suicide in the restroom.  Not a healthy working atmosphere at all!!!"
bad,"Just a place to work.  They do not provide any incentives to their employees nor do they show any appreciation.  Just a great place to go in, work and leave."
bad,"While under the previous ownership,THE place to work and be appreciated for a well done job with possibility to grow. Bought out and almost gone now. Work has gotten shipped to places with cheep labour, outside Canada."
bad,"This company provides management though non-leadership expecting and demanding results without any job training, job guidelines or infrastructure setup to provide methods to achieve results. Bickering between management, employees and interfacing companies provides for an environment where answers to questions are given vaguely providing an atmosphere that is confusing and dark. If you enjoy working in a vague environment, non-cooperation between all parties, no guidance or direction with high mgmt. expectations, being left out on a limb, being negatively criticized for everything you do, and always working on eggshells, then this is the company for you. Note: One star rating is too generous!"
bad,"When I first started at this company it was a ok place to work, but as the months went by it started to get over whelming. They do not treat there employees very well, They do not give you raises as promised. I was told when I started soldering I would get more money. But I'm still making the same amount, I have asked for a raise 2 times, and they just keep coming up with more excuses to not give. Don't get me wrong I did learn a lot of new things with this company, most of the co-workers are great people. The hardest part about this job, is trying to enjoy it and be happy. Management is not that great. "
bad,"Good luck, put in years here, it could have been wonderful, it was not, nepotism poor management, drug abuse, terrible leadership, and a class division environment made it out to be a bad work experience.  co workers are wonderful but the management ruined everything."
bad,"For a newcomer is a good work because going to have some history, but as job advancement is not a good opportunity, as pay is not really the best, work environment is not really good."
bad,"Management shows favoritism and its very clear.  If they like you they show it even if you are a productive employee.  You could be the worst employee but if they like you productivity is overlooked.  After they hired a new supervisor if was not the same, as a person and as a supervisor, didn't take the time to get to know the product, when you asked questions he always directed you to someone else.  I didn't enjoy working there it was very uncomfortable."
bad,"Pays some of the bills good for those like repetitive work, this just happens to be the best situation for me at this time."
bad,"Benefits and compensation are below market share and is equal through all low level employees whether your a test technician or janitor. The employees are knowledgeable but management is incompetent and they go by the philosophy "" if you don't like it leave"" instead of working to solve problems. HR is never in the office and when she is has no time to talk  and is a no show for scheduled appointments. No advancement  and basically a retirement home."
bad,Worked in Finance in Chelmsford for 7 weeks. Its the worst place I have ever worked. Would def not recommend it to anyone. Very poor management and rude and didn't even speak during the day. No structure to job role. No training available. A very serious working environment. Very low morale in team. Some very horrible people working there. Couldn't wait to get out
bad,This company should be closed down. I've witnessed bullying of the worst kind by management towards operators. Nobody to support you when in desperate need. Work was enjoyable  and a few nice people but that's it. HR totally incompetent. There is no organisation amongst managers and lots of people are really stressed. Very unhappy environment. Steer clear.
bad,"If you enjoy watching someone use mediocre NLP skills on unsuspecting innocents purely in order to induce self-destruction and mutual backstabbing, you have definitely come to the right place. Best place for schadenfreude ever. Since you will receive no guidance whatsoever, you will definitely learn if you are really a self starter within two weeks on the job. If you manage to quit before you are fired you have won at life and will probably feel empowered to accomplish anything. Moreover, talented people running away as soon as they can find a new job."
bad,"Bad Manager with people, pretending to be completely trained in 4 weeks, no support only mobbing. There's people working there since 20 years and more that tease and judge new hires.."
bad,"If you enjoy watching someone use mediocre NLP skills on unsuspecting innocents purely in order to induce self-destruction and mutual backstabbing, you have definitely come to the right place. Best place for schadenfreude ever. Since you will receive no guidance whatsoever, you will definitely learn if you are really a self starter within two weeks on the job. If you manage to quit before you are fired you have won at life and will probably feel empowered to accomplish anything. Moreover, talanted people running away as soon as they can find a new jobs."
bad,"Management is horrible. They will make promises that they won't keep. They will tell you anything to get you to do what they want. They do not care about you as a person, or your family life. Very low wages."
bad,"I've been working there for a long time but they don't give me any benefits and they do not pay my vacations, sick days, or holidays. They make me work for long hours and the pay is not good. The workers there are also rude."
bad,If you like working for a narcissistic dictator this is a job for you. You'll be under scrutiny the day you start. You will do as the dictator tells you or he will get rid of you. The more experience you have the more of a threat you are to the dictator. Site leaders do not last long at this place thanks to the dictator. Save yourself some trouble and keep looking for a job.
bad,"I enjoyed the work while with the company.  The problem was with the clique within the department. The supervisor was very political, & if you didn't agree with him,  he & the other employees turn on you. Human resources was no help."
bad,Things were slow. You could figure out the job quickly and do your work by yourself most of the days. Not much room for advancement and trying to get out of your lane is frowned upon.
bad,"place is a super fast pace but nothing to crazy its basically the same thing every day "
bad,No management management just milking government . Technologies are 40 years old and nobody is willing to see it or invest money. People with toxic characters just waiting for retirement.
bad,Poorly organized and managed company.  After a very short time I discovered they did not have work which fit my skillset and had very little work in general.
bad,"This contractor is worst. They cared about no one. It was tough to get noticed if you weren't one of the good ole boys. The pay was decent, but they offered no benefits since it was a temp position."
bad,"Only there for a short period of time but the people were great to work with. Fun place to work but unfortunately, it had to close shortly after I joined them."
bad,"Would never recommend this place for work. The company demands overtime and although you have the right to refuse over time work, if you do refuse it you will never be considered for anything."
bad,"I was moved into a position after declining the offer. I let them know I didn't have the skill set for the advanced financial reporting they told me I had to do. They moved me into the position anyway, then 4 months later, said I wasn't cutting it. This was not a good fit and they knew it."
bad,he Leadership and Management needs a serious upgrade to include HR reform. The culture at this company throws good people away like trash. Retaining the popular employees regardless of their work or lack of work.
bad,Once Teledyne took this company over it slowly went down hill . Management does nothing for the employees. It's sad to see what was once a great family owned company be overtaken by corporate greed.
bad,Teledyne is an average company to work for. Some individuals benefit more from the company than others.
bad,This company does not treat every employee as an asset. Does NOT compensate accordingly. The career opportunities are just awful. This company keeps poor performing employees and does not reward those who are contributing.
bad,Management talks about everybody behind their backs. Coworkers talk about everyone behind their backs. Nobody seems to care about anything other than the money the company makes
bad,"Actual duties will not match the job description.  They claim collaboration with other departments in the req, but discourage it in real practice.  "
bad,"The pay did not match up to the responsibilities and quality assurance assumed. Management was very poor in that it felt very hostile and stressful. Leaders were quick to discipline first, then ask questions and look for a remediation later. There was very little support and “looking out for the employees” by management."
bad,Been here 20 years hoping for management to receive loyalty thru fair treatment and good pay. What a joke. The laity is put in a WinePress and squeezed until your juiced. Then your carcass is thrown away.
bad,Did not offer stability didn't allow family leave only care d about quantity and quality not employees to much harassment in company nothing done about it
bad,Worked 7 days a week for 2 months to ship a project on time. Was laid off shortly after. Did not receive any compensation increase after graduation. Engineering manager was not approachable and had a talent at making you feel like an idiot when you had questions.
bad,"Most enjoyable part of work was interacting with the delivery drivers, loading and unloading the trucks. "
bad,"No job security or prospects for advancement, senior management team are unprofessional, unethical and incompetent."
bad,Regret taking this position as the pay/benefits were well below average. Management was inexperienced. Union workers ran the show.
bad,Fun place to work at. learned something new every day. offered some useful classes and courses all paid by the employer. Vacation were granted easily.
bad,"As above. "
bad,working here was sometimes good but mostly bad. bosses always lurking even when slow periods of work flow. end of year is always a heavy push to get products out to the worldwide customers.
bad,"While I enjoyed my job, the atmosphere of the company was very lacking.  It was a total good ole boy network.  While I was treated fairly, I saw many examples of others being treated unfairly."
bad,"Constantly moving priorities."
bad,It was no room for advancement with the company. Learned a lot about how the generator works.
bad,"The managers do not help employees succeed in their role. No positive feedback or quality assessments done . "
bad,Les gens sont bien gentils mais l emploi tres stressant
bad,"No real promise of growth only false advertisement. "
bad,"There is a significant lack of vision. The last of the knowledgeable veterans from whom to learn will retire in 1-2 years. There is no vision from management on how to sustain this business. Most assemblers who can build this technology will retire in a few years. Several of the skilled technicians will retire, further significantly affecting productivity. This company is headed for a rude awakening in a few years."
bad,No one in management ever took the time to mentor other department employees or to even get to know them or talk to them. No employee engagement at all. I would not work here again.
bad,I was a contract worker. I wasn't privy to the benefits of the Teledyne employees. it seemed nice. a little outdated when I was there. Location was good for me.
bad,It was dirty and management was horrible and they treated you like slaves and if you speak your mind they would give you days off. It was like working for a dictatorship it was crazy.
bad,Raises minuscule despite performance reviews. Low intellect employees abound. Backstabbing culture at times. Near constant change regarding job parameters.
bad,"Almost choked when I read the other reviews..."
bad,"Work culture and work ethic are very poor. Unable to transition from a small company into Teledyne. Total lack of supervision, opportunities available to select few."
bad,"Teledyne dg obrien "
bad,"I oversaw a few product lines and helped alleviate issues for production when they had part or build problems.  "
bad,"8 hour schedule"
bad,"Duties and essential functions of my position are assemble and electronically test TWTs. Duties will include preliminary testing,pulse focusing, assembling tubes for test,environmental testing.Ability to follow written and verbal instructions is essential.Some lifting 50 pounds, use various hand tools using computers,be mechanically inclined,work with high voltage, read mechanical drawings and complete documentation.Using various dc equipment,also must have Top Secret Clearance.Hardest part of job was keeping up with customer demands."
bad,"I perform electrical, plumbing, carpentry, systems furniture assembly, furniture moving, safety team member, assistant to EH/S director, security, contractor management/scheduling, administrative, and the list goes on. Yet I am kept at a career level far lower than what I achieve everyday. There is little to no senior management support, career guidance, or performance appreciation. The environment is casual and laid back, which is nice, but a lack of compensation to match effort and successes is severe and undermining what could be a very positive and enriching workplace. I enjoy my job, the laid back atmosphere, and the physical location Teledyne has provided, but the compensation levels need to be brought up in order to compete with today's market. There is little to no work/life balance, and no changes in sight for the near future."
bad,"Teledyne Controls El Segundo, is a Legacy Manufacturing environment, a ""Good Old Boys""Club. The Quality Management is made up of talent that should not be in ""Quality""and most likely should be in the Functional Organization of Production.  The mindset is old and Legacy at best.  Change is rejected and a dictator rules the department and business."
bad,Set in old ways. Improvement ideas not readily accepted. Very little acknowledgement of creating a safe work environment.
bad,There are a lot of great people working here. I enjoyed interacting with them helping out with any concerns that they had. I made quite a few friends while I worked there.
bad,"Company has steadily declined over the years.  Their end is in sight unless major changes made."
bad,"Teledyne Webb Research and Teledyne Benthos provide a stable place of employment for people seeking to work close to home on Cape Cod.  Recent growth of both business units and their acquisition by Teledyne have brought significant change to the culture of the day to day work place.  A shift in values from research and learning to the bottom line and productivity have greatly affected job fullfillment for many employees. Benefits and pay remain on par, and even slightly better than other comparable businesses on Cape Cod.  There remains an underlying tone of informality and easy goingness that many job seekers are looking for, but as the company grows and seeks greater profits, that culture too is changing."
bad,I had three bosses working here and all of them would run back to each other trying to figure out what was what and confused everyone even more. I probably won’t work here again or recommend it.
bad,Seems like management has become uptight. I have invested 15 months of my life there to make a living while doing a good job. It seems like a waste of time.
bad,"Teledyne started as a pretty good place to work but after the first crude oil price drop, the constant layoffs and restructuring has seriously decreased morale of the entire plant. I would not advise seeking a permanent long-term position here, however the college internships are quite insightful and beneficial."
bad,Market share continues to drop year over year. Restructers by reducing staff and production. Changes sales paths from distrubution to direct and tries to do both.
bad,"Problem is that people are too relax, and thus the everything is too slow. This might be a problem for company future growth."
bad,* Manufacture instruments
bad,This company tends to favor certain employees and not appreciate the lower employees that do all the work.  Very uneven appreciation.  Long work hours.
bad,"This company loves to hire people when it gets busy and then lay them off when it slows down. Then, once business picks up again, they call the folks they laid off and ask if they want to come back to work. So many people reluctantly come back to work with a poor attitude and don't really care about doing a good job. Just going through the motions really."
bad,They are very clicky and only care about numbers not the employee. Not a career destination and I would recommend a different company. They do not follow or even know their own policies.
bad,I learned a lot of new skills and technology in assembling work .I would love to work back with this great company. love it there
bad,"Good salary , Management staff to large and are not honest with employees . Company had lay -offs in June 2013 . Bosses said that would be all until Jan 2014 , That was a lie took our salary increases , took profit  sharing then had another layoff in Nov  2013 ."
bad,Lifting heavy framing brackets & putting together molds. Ilearned blue print reading & statistical control.The management were more concerned with production than employee safety. Co-workers were helpful. Lifting heavy mold frames all day. When ther was extra people.
bad,"Experienced workforce with varied and useful skillbase. We have the whole package in one location from design to production,stores and  worlwide delivery."
bad,It was a difficult transition from a family owned business (KW) to a corporate buyout.
bad,Not a recommendable environment - four people out for medical leave in my department alone...along with several from PM Office and Operations.
bad,Worked for 26 Years doing everything necessary to keep department running and was downsized.  I have doubts that anybody's job is safe in this company
good,"standard factory job with a union. continual clashes among union to union, union to management issues. annual layoffs created hardships for younger employees"
good,"Landed here with a cold call from a placement agency. Company moved to Portsmouth NH. Travel and quality of life severely affected, not worth the trip."
good,Never work here run far run fast period. This isnt the place for anyone period run dont work here run dont drive by this place dont even say its name.
good,"Disorganized management with poor communication of vision, repetitive secretive corporate reorganizations, multiple layoffs with no warning to employees, and a culture which rewards incompetence and fails to recognize or reward teams and individuals who are carrying the business and assuring its solvency. Hard work and long hours are not recognized and growth opportunity is limited because promotions are given without advertisement or competition to favorites, whether or not they are best performing or best qualified."
good,"Company is great if you are an engineer. For manufacturing technicians, the work can be mundane and boring sometimes."
good,"Typical day consist on producing batteries and production. I was work different positions daily pertaining on what my supervisor needs that specific day. Some days i assemble, work in stockroom, shipping or helping with quality inspecting."
good,A typical work days is you come to work and get straight to work no meetings required if your technician or on production floor. I wouldn't know about the higher management but I would say they conduct quite a few meetings through out the day. The co-workers are noisy and they are always out to point fingers at what you did wrong. Its almost as if they want to get you fired. Management seems to be too busy to take care of anyone. If you have a question or concern as to why things are not a certain way... they will quickly try to shut you down instead of giving you a straight answer. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home.
good,Management is scattered and misdirected. Resources are inadequate and not timely applied. Workforce is walking on egg shells.
good,Fast paced environment with many learning opportunities. . Employees are hard working and friendly.
good,"This company is going through growing pains. It used to be amazing, so I heard, until they got bought out by Teledyne."
good,"Horrible management.  No communication."
good,It was a temporary job through a temp agency.  I was there for only 9 months and was laid off.  There's no future with this company!!!
good,"I loved working with the people I had around me.  It was exciting and challenging work.  We had a moto of ""everyone wears more than one hat"" meaning you help out were its needed even if it's not really part of your job description.  This is something I feel strongly about as I am more than willing to help out if needed. when needed and where needed.  I learned that if you work hard it can be recognized and rewarded.  The former CEO that was there for 9 years of my tenure was so hands on and he made it a very welcoming and warm work place.  He expected hard work but he didn't discount that the best way to get the best out of his employees was positive motivation."
good,"When I first joined the Group, they were hiring several people per week.  1 month later, they started continuous and regular layoffs.  People following the CEOs strategy is inconsistent."
good,"Great History and people. But with high Burden Rate Teledyne Micro price themselves out of business. Unfortunately, may of years of experience lost..."
good,"HR is good. The job is easy but they make it hard. Managers are not skilled, not willing to change or improve, not responsible, blame on others for not meeting goals. Managers are not doing their work and they make it hard for employees to do theirs. Technologies is very behind."
good,To much nepotism and favoritism. Expect you to work long hours but don't want you to charge more than 8 hours. Charging OT is STRONGLY discouraged while you are somewhat encouraged to work more than 8 hrs/day if needed.
good,"Overall,  good manufacturing company,  good products. Leadership takes their power to a whole new level. Company President is blinded by his direct reports and does not see what is actually happening in the company. Human Resource department are not pleasurable to work with at all - In fact, conniving at that."
good,Overall good work environment. Top management are down to the earth and very respectful. People are cooperative. Middle management requires some human resources training.
good,"Fast paced environment."
good,"A typical day involves reviewing sales peoples forecasts, challenges in the sales process, responding to inquiries, giving presentation both in person and video conference, respond to proposals, respond to quotes, work with Teledyne Marine to cross functional sale other instruments within the business sector, and much more."
good,"Hired to come in and contact damage control and business recovery for their radioactive waste management business.  While support staff was excellent, the interest and support of upper management and the ability of the top company managers to work together and integrate a forward looking business strategy resulted in an extraordinary level of stress for middle managers and staff."
good,"The projects design performance was very challenging."
good,"Teledyne has a diverse group of individuls working for for them, including some incredibly talented engineers, from a technology point of view the company is outstanding to work for."
good,"Each morning I have a short team brief and react to any urgent issues raised. check e-mails for any new enquiries prepare and submit our estimate. Liaise with internal departments and customers. Update the computer system, entering new parts, BOM, writing new and updating existing  shop floor process layouts.  I have learned how to prioritise and delegate when required but also have time to assist my work colleagues. My manager trusts and relies on me greatly, he appreciates my efforts and is very supportive. My co-workers are generally cooperative, professional and friendly, I also socialise with many of then. The hardest part of the job is trying to complete all the various tasks each day and to keep all my customers happy but somehow I generally manage to do this. The most rewarding part of the job is when I receive positive feed back and appreciation from the customer and colleagues."
good,"My direct supervisor was often too busy to assist me or give me things to do. I would finish by wok so early and I ended up knocking out because I was so bored. Don't get me wrong. It's not like I wanted to slack off, it was more like no one would give me work to do. I would ask every day if there was more work to be done and everyone would shrug their shoulders and I would end up on Google News the whole entire day."
good,Commited to meet delivery schedule to customer. Team had to stretch the work week to satisfy the projected delivery. Often hard stop dates and document delivery to keep.
good,it is a company that doesn't want to change in the way they work even though they constantly emphasise this need to do so. no social culture either. managers seem to care about individuals well being but not their personal development in their careers.
good,"Teledyne relays purchased a small electronics firm called Gentron."
good,Great job but limited growth potential due to lack of support beyond my direct manager. My manager made the job worth it but never got the support from upper management
good,"Teledyne is a really good company but the manager I had was the worst person I have ever met.  Ask people that have met him."
good,recurring issues with applying economy of scale and a protective culture of cliques hindering effective teamwork. weak investment in the training and empowerment of the manufacturing floor via continuous improvement and process controls.
good,"management not interested in training you on new jobs, co-worker not interested in training you correctly."
good,"the employees were nice to work with"
good,"Good environment to work and people is friendly, but company should invest more in equipment so that it will produce more quality product"
good,Good job to get into coding though doesn't leave you with much transferable knowledge and so although you get the key skills it's very difficult to say to another employer I have all this experience but none of the working knowledge relates to you. The people are very nice in general but management can be lacking and there's usually no real sense of urgency about anything.
good,Worked Teledyne Energy Systems 2001 to 2008.  Trying to perform engineering work in a noisy cubicle was a special treat.  Somewhat politicized environment.  Senior engineers were allowed to silence others work without fair review.  HR manager was not trustworthy.
good,"Daily stress and pressure can sometimes be overwhelming, but all in all it is not a bad place to work. I don't feel for my knowledge and abilities that I am compensated fairly. They have a good cafeteria and generally good potential for collaboration with coworkers."
good,"Nice, caring people and laid back work environment.  Management does not micro manage, which is a plus. Management is understanding and flexible when you need to take time off or leave early.  The pay could be better. The people here are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Empresa agradável de trabalhar mas a gerência é pre matura em algumas tomadas de decisões.
good,Work load has dramatically increased in the last three years.  Company has made little effort to increase workforce and has increased current employees workload.
good,You don't get paid enough work 2 weeks and still don't bring home 500 dollars for 2 weeks of work. If you don't have help u cannot support a family working there. I liked working there just did not pay enough. There are a few folk there that understood but those that are getting $60-80 they don't feel the pain of what the people on the floor is going through u either eat or buy your meds people with a family forget it u wont survive without help...
good,Great place to learn. Union sucks and layoffs are to often. Turnover in management is the worst. if your single great place to work. Also benefits suck as well.
good,It's a fun work place with low on compensation but less stressful working hours. Flexible timing with option to work from home in emergency. Extra hours you put you can use as vacation.
good,"You are in control of your feeling, you create your environment the  location is great close to the beach and lots of fun places to eat. perfect working hours, and the people are nice."

good,Small privately owned company with few chanches for advancement.
good,"Was there for 5 years and met some great people. We worked hard as a team. Very little if any compensation, but the people made it worth it. Had high turnover with management. Work really dropped off and the layoffs were about 2-3 a year. I had a great direct manager. Too bad she was let go too."
good,Small group and opportunities to collaborate with other departments.
good,"Great place to start in manufacturing. Easy work, easy money, plenty of overtime, great benefits, but lack of management, internal growth, and praise."
good,"Well managed from a financial standpoint"
good,The management had no idea about how to deal with revision control on engineering documents. They created a cumbersome configuration control into place. No one understood it.
good,This is a place that loves to shcmear their profits in your face while at the same time having employees who have to have supplemental ebs cards to feed their family. The overtime is ridiculous and if you do not submit you are frowned upon.
good,"Liked the office atmosphere and colleagues.  Was able to attend conferences and educational events as part of my job.  "
good,"It was a temporary job, so there were no plans to be a long term perm worker there. "
good,Teledyne HR can be responsible for providing this information about the company to potential employees. Teledyne. Potential employees should inquire about this.

good,"Teledyne is an excellent company that demonstrates professionalism and concern for their employees. As an employee, growth potential is provided on an educational basis."

good,Many thanks for the many new skills and knowledge I acquired in this organization. But not room or the opportunity to grow within the organization so the time is here to keep on striving forward. Setting new goals and vison.

good,"a lot of full-time and part-time employees"
good,Much more work involved in early days due to much less competition in the worldwide market. Work environment was less stressful. Management had more hands on and more knowledge of product.
good,"The branch of Teledyne Technologies I worked for closed years ago. I can't say too much that would be applicable about the other branches, since I haven't worked there."
good,A very business orientated please to work.  Schedule was 5 days a week 40 hours. Had a cafeteria and the food was good. The ar4ea was a very large building .

good,"Teledyne has very dynamic work environment, constantly pushing the limits. You will gain good work experience in all environmental health and safety fields."
good,"Like the job security, the multiple jobs that keep me focused and busy day to day, the people that I work with every day. I like the challenge of my work and the satisfaction of completing these challenges and learning something new along the way. Like the interaction with the many customers and helping them solve their challenging Engineering problems."
good,This is a stable manufacturing company with niche market industrial products that is hard to get in for other companies.  work life balance is good.
good,"Teledyne used to be a great place to work, where you felt secure in your job. However, in the last year it has changed dramatically. Management used to care about the employees and listen to what people had to say. But not anymore. The place to going downhill fast. Most people have either been laid off or left to find another job. They have also cut hours and taken away benefits. Definitely not a good place to work anymore."
good,There was a lot to do and it was interesting work. Unfortunately there was a general lack of opportunity to advance. Otherwise it was a good company to be in.
good,As a production planner I would schedule all components made in our high pace machine shop. I would also work quickly and accurately within multiple computer systems and with my co-workers. One of my biggest responsibilities was to balance a diverse work load across 24 CNC and manual machines.
good,"management was no good"
good,Une bonne journée c'est d'être occuper et effectuer tout les taches qui doivent se faire pour une journée de travail

good,"Fast paced company, great management, I worked with good hard workers. their was nothing really hard about this job. I learned to run Molding machines."
good,Secretarial work all day
good,I could work as many hours as I wanted
good,"This company makes an interesting acoustic technology product and is the market leader in their field. But the field itself is rather small, making for an ""incestuous"" professional community in which everyone knows everyone, opportunities are few, and newcomers face obstacles in establishing themselves or promoting original ideas in the presence of ""lifers"" who have been with the company for years and years. Also, the technology takes a long time to learn thoroughly, and sales experience here is not very applicable to other technology fields outside of this limited industry space."
good,Our days were busy from start to finish which made time go quickly.
good,"Teledyne was a very laid back and slow paced job. I learned team work as far as a manufacturing plant. They built circuit boards for the military in which I was educated opon. Management is not the best at teledyne. They have lost a few contracts which led to lesser work and lay offs. Other than the rate of pay and the management, the job was great. The hardest part of the job was finding some kind of task when your immediate asssignment was completed. This is the part that management lacked. They weren't very good with balancing out work and finding meaningful work. The environment was great, although. The people were kind. The work not stressful. I was not a dirty job. Great benefits."
good,The atmosphere at Teledyne Webb Research is more of a factory mentality than an engineering mentality.
good,"After many years of service to the local business unit of a Global company, corporate level decision was made to merge local company with a sister location in Colorado. No incentives were given to move from Pgh. to Englewood, Co, and there were few takers. "
good,"The people you work with will be great, and it's not a bad place. Expect a lot of hours but flip a coin with management and some are great and others not so much. It's really not what you know but who you do that plays a role in your success here."
good,TBE was a good opportunity when I accepted an analyst position there. From the time I was hired until the loss of contract was 1 year and layoffs occurred.
good,The employe moral is always low they get people who think they know more then the employe who's been doing it for years. Some of the engineers who they bring in are not qualified for the job
good,Biggest drawback was that this company was located in Huntsville Alabama. Was never comfortable living there. Met some life long friends in a collegian workplace environment.
good,"Good benefit during the Oil Price was up, business slow down dramatically due to the price of Oil basically"
good,"Good people, good place to work. Nice and climate controlled building. not very easy to find unless your from Lewisburg but worth it if you get an interview"
good,"Yearly management changes, yearly layoffs & not what you know it's who you know as you have to be in the good ole boy country club."
good,"Work life balance is tough, good place to work as there is no shortage of work, old ideals and antiquated practices.  Decent job stability."
good,Great opportunity to be directly involved in both business unit operations and also corporate reporting activities.
good,"I was a intern. Not alot of new technology and basic duties included testing, building prototypes, etc. Easy going job."
good,"Typical day involved inputting field data into computer programs in order to determine the best areas for oil & natural gas drilling. First encounter with computers, and learned the basics of date manipulation. At the time, the industry was very transcient, and co-workers came and went frequently. For those who were stable, it was a good exoerience to work with them. The management was less 'hands on' than most, and this fostered a relaxed atmosphere that somewhat mitigated the high volume of output that was expected. This job did help me with independent problem solving, but i could have used more supervision along thw way."
good,"It was ok at first, but eventually lay offs started happening. People weren't getting their bonuses. There were no raises. It was determined by Teledyne Corporate. They didn't care about the staff."
good,"I've always found the management at Teledyne to be very loyal to its employees. The biggest complaint is the very small annual raises during my time here. They also do not pay people with non engineering degrees as much as engineers, even though they may be performing the say job."
good,"The company is a productive and safe enviroment and people "
good,"Developing sensors and controls for underwater applications is very challenging and satisfying.  Great relationships are built between us and our customers as we work hard to satisfy almost impossible requirements.  Our team always had great problems to solve, and getting to the solutions was a great experience.  Management was driven hard to maintain growth and profitability.  We made our goals most of the time, but if we missed, jobs were on the line."
good,"good place to work, good management, great coworkers very caring, open lines of communication, good benefits, compensation very good."
good,"While I was there, it was a pretty solid place to work. It was well balanced and permitted you to have a nice personal life. The compensation was average and the benefits fair but not spectacular. I enjoyed the job and the people I worked with. Advancement was achievable and the culture was good. All that though is offset by uncertainty. No matter how good a job is, uncertainty keeps it from being great. It can't be great when market instability keeps a cloud of doubt over the entire workforce. It's hard to relax when you never know if or when you are going to lose it all. Stability counts for a lot in employment and there isn't much here. Lives are affected each and every time reductions are made and these types of fluctuations in the market keep businesses like this from being truely great."
good,"Utilizing MRP, review and purchase materials for the production of Gliders."
good,Excellent small company. Very much enjoyed my time here. Management was always very personable and allowed for a flexible schedule.
good,"A good company to work for, it is a small close-knit group. Normally, I would do a walk around in the morning to verify that there isn't any burnt out lightbulbs and that the a/c was running correctly. Perform safety checks to ensure personnel were following all appropriate protocols. Review, scan and file completed documentation for units that have shipped. Review Federal register for any updates to regulations that affected our facility."
good,"excellent job role really varied, people were OK not great. didn't really get to know the ones downstairs, upstairs were good, best manager I've ever had"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Teledyne Monitor Labs. My co-workers were very nice and easy to get along with. However, with the recent economy struggles we had two layoffs of about 15% of our small workforce over a 3 year period. Management is relaxed and easy to work for. Compensation could have been better. Benefits were standard like most other workplaces."
good,"A typical day will have me troubleshooting non-conforming circuit boards, writing or updating a test procedure, testing a boat or testing a sonar system."
good,"Employees professional, Engineers at Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. are very knowledgable and extremely intelligent.   System Software development is top notch and teams work well to advance technology.   Administrative areas are educated and up to date on all FAR and DFAR changes and execution."
good,Good company. Overall enjoyed my time at the company. Small business unit. If your looking for advancement this is not the company.
good,"Great benefits, great boss, interesting new people. Rewarding challenges,"
good,"Fast Paced environment, not enough support.  Great learning experience with a diverse group of employees that has a family feel.  Good place to work and learn in the robotics community."
good,the hardest part of the job was learning how the data packets were arranged.
good,"–Operate CNC mills to produce high tolerance parts."
good,"I'll start things off. On the most basic level, I enjoy talking with people. My job provides me an opportunity to put that basic urge to use for a purpose. I'm a very social person since before the word ""social' meant anything other than in-person. I Was able to be creative with great results. Developed some strong work relationship that carried on after being laid off. Great people to associate with."
good,detailed oriented working in the business but not enough on the business. good people. not enough training and development to grow within the company even while it is financially successful
good,I enjoyed working in Teledyne. I learned a lot of process. The maanagement is okay. I love to work with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to communicate with assembly department that they don't want write ups when you see some deffects or rejects on their work. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone smiles at you.
good,"Management is very micro managed which is needed for the fast paced assembly."
good,I was considered of the better machinist yet I was dismissed over pot...not cool with that I will be able to make it to the meeting tonight but I will be there at the same time before I get there so I can you know if you need anything else from me please let me know what you think and
good,"Normal work day 10 to 14 hours"
good,The people in the midle mangement sucked top mangment loved and so was the WORKERs
good,"It was a nice place to work, I enjoyed my time there up until they started laying people off. I really liked working there but I would not go back due to fear of no job security."
good,"The RISI part of Teledyne I work for could use a new GM, I just feel like he needs to brush up on his people skills, my manager is Awesome, she really helps when you feel like giving up because of the GM."
good,"Horaires variées, possibilités d'avancement. Grand respect entre employé et supérieurs."
good,"As Shipping Lead I played key role in the day to day operations at Teledyne, some of my duties consist of running a daily sales order report and assigning sales orders to the shipping clerks.  I attended the morning production meetings to identify any shortages for the day.  At the end of everyday I would provide a shipping summary of any missed shipments or problems still pending."
good,"Teledyne has a dedicated team of workers and they try hard to satisfy customer demands."
good,"Always busy, production people willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done.  Time there was productive, wished could have stayed longer and completed more actions."
good,Not the best place for promoting good work as it was promoting favorites of the General manager (GM). The old GM is now gone and my hopes are the Company can now meet their goals under the guidance of the new GM.
good,"Great people to work with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Poor pay however the work environment makes up for it, I believe they could improve their compensation matching the responsibilities aligned."
good,Worked for 27 years. Was a pleasant environment. Did mostly military and aerospace applications. Have not been involved with the company for over 4 years so I am unsure of the current status of the work environment.
good,Was a great place to work.  People were nice and very pleasant.  The design work was very rewarding once product came to life.  This is a good company for college grads looking to get their feet wet in all various engineering departments.
good,"An outstanding one year of applied procurement Sr., Buyer skills. "
good,"Being a tech for this place was challenging you have to maintain your project and work with others to help with their own projects. The work/life balance was sort of messed up. They wanted me to work overtime ALL the time but then told me that I was not working hard enough for them to satisfied with my product line. I was 3 to 4 months ahead of their time of completion for my project. The tech behind their products are very old and outdated. What I mean by this is, it's all analog. They could go digital but do not have the resources to do so. I was laid off, I really would not mind going back to work for them. Even though they lack the technology to make their product lines go much faster it is an everyday challenge. The one down side is the leads and upper management get overwhelmed with stuff and push it all down on the leads and the leads push it down on the techs."
good,"TML is a technology based company with many divisions.  The work culture is solid.  Training and management direction is lacking. Pay is slightly below industry standards. While like everyone in my division have come in contact with, unsure about job stability."
good,"Half-day Fridays"

good,"Fast-paced high tech environment."
good,"A lot of work when there is work, They use Unigraphics ( NX8.5) and have a large selection of cutting tools. A fair selection of CNC Machines and a good sheet metal shop as well as welding."
good,Part of large company - dynamic and fast paced environment. Consistent growth year over year - market leader with multiple locations throughout US and beyond. Good organization to be a part of - very technically driven.
good,The people are more like family than co-workers. I was able to learn new skills for a new division of the company and I got to travel to learn it.
good,Challenging role handling multiple executives from President to Vice President to Comptroller in day to day administrative role.
good,I absoultly loved my job and wish I could go back!! Due to family issues I had to leave.If were giving another opportunity I would love to work there again!!!!

good,"I had a productive and self-satisfying position in an aerospace environment, which I love.  I enjoyed traveling to all aerospace segments of the company located in different states.  I felt I could make a difference by saving money for the company, keeping them in compliance for all the years that I was emloyed and trained people who could do the job without me."
good,"Es una empresa con una alta dependecia a su planta matriz, lo que hace que la retroalimentacion y tiempo de reaccion ante el cliente final podria aun ser mejorado, pero esto esta regido por las politicas corporativas. "
good,"Great defense contractor, stable work environment. Well-known in Huntsville area."
good,"My time at Teledyne ML was an enjoyable and learning experience.  I mostly enjoyed the learning part of my job.  Given opportuinities to work with calibrated instrumentation and the science behind the methodologies.

good,Good co-workers; job assignments in flux because of business departments changes; lots of oppotunity for take charge person.
good,Worked in Contracts Department.
good,"Pretty goood place to work in. They hire too many people on temporary contracts, but they provide benefits with those."
good,"So sometimes it will get slow some weeks and wayyy to busy other weeks. The place is a LITTLE sloppily managed so you will get big workloads some weeks and small ones other weeks. However, it is a manufacturing company and the work that I do is actually pretty interesting and makes we want to have a deeper understanding of electronics. The pay is kind of low, but you can always do overtime which kind of makes up for it."
good,"Compensation is good; However, scheduling is always a challenge.  Some resist change due to the program that is most of the time dynamic. Management change roles quite often"
good,"The job was good fast paced some time, coworkers was nice to work with"
good,"Teledyne is a good company to learn at.  Because of its corporate structure there may not be a direct path for career progression, but a new Engineer can move around and learn the basics."
good,Worked in a production environment that was sales based and bonus based.  Production could not keep their promised due dates which negated the bonus option and left our clients missing deadlines.
good,Fast paced environment.  Some positions require travel.  Multicultural company.  Great company to work for.  Great team-work throughout the company.  Good benefits.
good,I was hired as a contract writer for highly technical avionics software documentation. The documentation was not complete for several months after I started. The company used a proprietary software system that was impossible for even an experienced technical writer to use.
good,Always busy at work. Learn to troubleshoot and fix robotic sensors and actuators. 
good,"Daily work (which ideally was simple yet extensive) had to be pushed aside constantly to support corporate sales goals. Poor planning during a new production acquisition overloaded the procurement team among other departments and management."

good,"had a chance to programmed setup and tested Robotic configurations for EIT troubleshooting, generated shop drawings (2D and 3D ) utilizing AutoCad, and provided configuration management and revision tracking oversight and reporting."
good,"Nice environment to work in, good people.  No real opportunity for advancement because the ""good ole boy"" system is well in place.  So if you are not skilled at making management your friend then you probably won't last long."
good,"Pursuing self employment -- currently employed by Verify as independent contractor "
good,"As an electrical test engineer my duties involved:"
good,"Het is cleanroom werk fijn montage maar ik wil ook  andere werkervaringen dan alleen montage , in een winkel werken bv heb ik nog nooit gedaan ben echt nieuwschierig en liikt  wel heel leuk met afwisselend werk en met klanten omgaan ."
good,The company had robust sales for several years but did not react quickly enough when the oil industry crashed. Company should have been looking for ways to diversify.

good,I had a great manager who brought me up to my true potential. I enjoy the negotiations w/suppliers. I take pride in my work and enjoy my co-workers.
good,"This company is like several families, each department is it's own.  The people are very nice. I have enjoyed working here.  The interactions with co-workers make the longer shifts seem shorter.  Lately, with the lower gas prices, there have been scheduled and random company lay-offs.  This can make the work day a bit stressful."

I learned about fiber handling, winding, splicing and so on..My manager and co-worker were very helpful. The hardest part was when we have to work 7 days a week, 11 hours a day. Obviously, the most enjoyable part of it was, when you received pay check with lots of overtime."
good,"Started working in the plant at various areas, then applied for inventory control clerk."
good,Teldyne is a very busy place. Takes pride in shipments being ship to various parts of the world. Very organized establishment.

good,"In the individual business units there was strong team working, helped each other. A problem was shared to resolve, not a blame game"

good,"My years working in the Mechanical Engineering field at Teledyne were excellent! My relationship with my Engineering Manager was both Professional and personal, as he was always there for me when I needed him. We worked on many projects together and I can easily say we were a good team. My work schedule was flexible and I put in overtime when necessary. Had it not been for the relocation of my department, I would have still been an employee at Teledyne Reynolds. I wish them nothing but the best!"
good,This was a temporary assignment. The people were friendly and helpful. I was given leeway to work independently as well as with others. I enjoyed working there.

good,I worked at Teledyne for almost 2 years and loved it for the most part.  Left there to continue with some college.
good,good job security
good,"There's a lot of old timers in this company that's been here over 30 years.  A lot are retiring if not retired yet.  This is a good company to retire to, but some managers are not good at promoting their people.  The new generations now are not into staying in one place and retiring there, so this company hires and will continue to loose new people since the pay is not that good as well."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the projects I get to work on. Most people are easy to work with, I feel the company is thinking more about the money than the employees in recent months."
good,"For a beginning engineer, this is a wondering place to start your career. You get to wear a lot of different hats, from design to manufacturing and customer support."
good,"Though I learned to perform at my job at a high level, I felt as though there was very limited opportunities for advancement. I was dissatisfied with my opportunities."
good,"Teledyne Controls experienced very fast growth in the last ten years and perhaps its caught up to them.  It's currently in transition with lots of management changes.  "
good,Fair work environment. Work hard and you’ll do well. Compensation for my position was lacking. I was trained by great caring people. Having a three day weekend every week was really nice.

good,"Best job I had in the last 19 years.  Upper management (Program Manager & Director) needs to be replaced. Only thing you hated about the place. They give you ""Bonus Checks"" !"
good,On the job training is not efficient but they are trying to improve. Work days are typically busy. I was able to advance quickly and learn various positions within the company.

good,"the days are long at 10-12 hours;"
good,"My typical day at Teledyne was coming in to work and gathering information on the days shipments. The addresses, the quantity and packaging had to be correct. If we needed crates or boxes, I ordered them per the dimensions and specs required. Teledyne sent my supervisor and myself to Anniston Army Depot to be certified for Hazmat shipping. I returned certified, my supervisor did not. So I had to put my name on the manifest on Hazardous Material shipments. And might I add, that none was returned due to the paperwork or packaging. There, I also became a certified fork lift driver. Our work slowed down for a time because all the contracts ran out. They had a large layoff which I was included in.

good,"When I started there it was a great place to work. I advanced to Engineering Manager and was able to participate in stock-purchase, tuition reimbursement and 401K match. The bad part came after a corporate consolidation with a larger Teledyne business. The new leaders from the New larger parent didn't understand our business and frankly didn't care, they wanted growth. After that the culture, atmosphere change dramatically. I would have still been there to date if that consolidation wouldn't have occurred, or at least not with that business unit."
good,High tech facility with government contracts where attention to a details as well as state and local environmental laws are most important part of daily activities.Building new areas to accommodate up coming project to customers strict requirements.
good,Company is good for work/life balance. Pay could be better but the company culture is great. Management is good to work for as well. The company looks out for their employees.
good,Stable place to work.  There are travel opportunities if you want.  Current leadership is great but the current CEO of Controls is retiring.  Do not recommend working in one of the satellite offices if you want the best work opportunities.
good,Truly a good company. The average employee there had been employed for 15 years. Very low turnover. Quality work and good management. Good family atmosphere
good,The company is very stable and  a nice place to work. Employees are friendly and management are fair in the treatment of their employees. I implemented the AS9102 for this company.

good,"I have found Teledyne a nice place to work, I have made many friends and although the day can be quite hectic, the staff still make it a joyful place to be in. The small office makes it more like a family environment and personal issues are always catered for."

good,"The majority of my work tenure comes from Teledyne who was later bought out by Litton and then Northrop Grumman.  My work experience comes from being a component and reliability engineer with Teledyne Controls and Teledyne Systems.  Then later on with Teledyne Micro Electronics and Teledyne Safety Products where a transition was made from Reliability to Quality Assurance.  Over the course of my engineering career, I had some great experiences working on several military programs that fell under the guidelines of the AS9100 quality management system.  For example, at Teledyne Systems I was the Reliability Engineer on the Mission Computer for the Northrup Grumman TASSAM Missile program.  While at Litton Guidance and Control all reliability engineering for the Tomahawk Baseline Improvement Program (TBIP) and the guidance system for MSLS  was under my work responsibility.  While at Teledyne Micro Electronics my reliability/quality engineering responsibilities were directed towards the F22 and Kodak Government Satellite programs. At Teledyne Safety products, I was the QA Manager for the F22 ejection seat program."
good,"At first no one really communicated what my exact role was, but after a few weeks of cross training and helping people wherever I could, we worked together to find my place helping between departments to streamline the workload and act as back-up when the department heads I cross trained with were out on vacation or sick."
good,For me Ideal location is a platform where every one is satisfied. Which has ample opportunities for growth. A healthy environment with good team to solve a challenge is a ideal location I feel.
good,"I performed management, contracting, and engineering.  I infrequently had to personally deliver highly technical components in my car to make delivery schedules when manufacturing operations were late.  The people were interesting to work with."
good,"Open shop in am reset alarms open doors turn on equipment warm up machines, line jobs up for production review reports of daily production."
good,"The people in the Lincoln location were amazing. However, the farther up the chain you go the more they forget about the people actually doing the work. These people I worked with were working 10 hours a day and 5 hours on Saturdays and it was the norm in most of the time to work that much over time to make the number the higher up wanted to do for sales. The main people I worked with were able to turn work orders over in a few days, but due to poor wages and under-staffing they were getting very warn out."
good,"Worked with Navy project office on design objectives, and developed concept models, actual designs, and goal achieving scenarios"

good,Management and the employees very friendly to work with.Good benefits. Training was very good and detailed. The work hours where very flexible because of location in Dallas.

good,worked there 27 years.  Mostly enjoyed the people I worked with.  the benefits are not bad.  Probably as good as it gets these days.  Not the best paying place to work in Lincoln but the people helped make the experience part of the appeal to stay there.
good,"I worked for Teledyne for several yeas and the people and management was easy to work with."
good,Great job environment. Very conservative company Lots of company events for the employees and has good benefits . Needs more work/life balance and better coffee
good,"I worked there for 4 years and really enjoyed what I did. Benefits were good and pay was ok, But there was no room for advancement and that why I left."
good,A lot of workers here have been there for many of years and they are super nice to work with. The General Manager is very approachable and easy to talk to...Super nice
good,This was my first job out of college.  It was a good place to work overall.  I worked in the lab and made friends with a couple of the guys I worked with.  There was a team of young engineers who had a lot of work needing to be done in the lab and they were often fun to work with.

good,"Teledyne Marine gave me the unique opportunity to both be a part of a large US organisation and learn how such US organisation is controlled, but also, and the is very unique, relocate 3 US production entities to Europe, and thereby acquiring in debt knowledge about technology, organisation and operations in an US company and being able to compare to European culture."
good,"Established company with many locations. Great place to work with excellent work/life balance. "
good,"It was friendly atmosphere  to work, clean, friendly staff and coworkers, easy job except you would  have to stand all day on feet, other then that good job."
good,Teledyne good company. Co-workers the best. Good challenging work environment just the way I like it. Would do it again if had the opportunity. But on a part time basis. Management supportive in getting the job done.
good,the hardest part of the job is learning all the technical aspects of the job and getting different answers to the same questions.  People are helpful but not very social
good,"Enjoyed work environment, flexible and independent thinking encouraged. Very good benefits package, Health, Live Insurance, 401K, etc. One of the best ERP systems utilized."
good,The Teledyne team was friendly and very sharp technically.  A good place to contribute and see the effect of your daily efforts.  Their technology is highly advanced and sophisticated.
good,The Engineers are very good.  The management is loves micro-management.  Engineering is a complicated process.  Engineers need to talk to each other to reach a common solution.  Management likes to keep the engineers separate and make all the decisions.  This is frustrating to the workers.
good,Good Management with openness towards new ideas and encouragement. the supervisor doesn't bother you as long as you are completing your work in a timely manner.
good,"Typical day at work was planning for production runs to ensure material and components were assembled to meet production.  I learned how to plan for a fast paced production and how to correspond with overseas production teams.  Management was good, and the work culture was diverse.  The hardest part of the job was working in the spread sheets that changed daily to keep up with the demands and the most enjoyable of the job was that I was able to converse with the production floor and learn more about each product Teledyne produced."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction. I learned a lot here such as documentation for international orders, data entry, newsletter editing, and switchboard."

good,"made cold calls, to invited to trade show booth, managemeant was able to answer question you made have. Hardest part was calling and geting may no on the call. Enjoy making calls and talk about the trade show that was atending."
good,Excellent company but the pay scale should be more inline with their competitors. In order to recruit the best talent they should pay accordingly. They have an excellent wellness program.
good,This was an Oil Exploration company with many field crews. This company also provided computer processing for Oil companies. Pay was good and advancement was good
good,Great working environment and centrally located facilities. Every employee is welcoming and ready to help in any way they can in order to get the job done. Management is always open and available.
good,Working at TBE was rewarding and a learning experience.  This job involved developing and manufacturing space-flight hardware for NASA space shuttle science experiments. A very fun and intelligent group of people to work with.
good,"management is amazing and very helpful, willing to step in and help when needed. Working there makes you feel like you are part of a family. You are always busy and the day goes by quick."
good,Fellow employees and management were friendly and very knowledgeable. They taught me how to improve my skills in Solidworks Design as well as assembly design overall.
good,"Good place lots of work, very busy. Genuine great place, great team spirit. Many opportunities for advancement. Stupendous technology with software to run equipment."
good,Worked in an environment I been use to all my life as a group leader. People where willing to work together. This went both ways. I worked hard for them as they did for me. Most jobs where government with some commercial mixed in. We worked with older equipment but made it happen every day. That was part of the challenge. Only sad part was when they announced the sale of the company to a Canadien company. They offered decent packages and help in finding jobs for others.  Going to miss a lot of these people and wish them well.
good,"In my three years working for this company, I acquired a great work ethic from Teledyne. I am very grateful for the skills that I have gained during my years working there."
good,"I had 5 lines in my area, Molding, Machining, Assembly with two lines in assembly and two in Molding and all the Machining parts. Worked with supervisors though out the day and solved many processes problems, standardized some or most of the process sheets, It was running very smooth, Instigated processes in molding with the help of the manager in that area,"
good,"I was able to advance quickly and loved the environment.  The journeymen were world class pattern makers and always willing to teach us how to build pattern.  The engineers were friendly and easy to work with.  "
good,"Easy going company that doesn't over work, so work to life balance is pretty good. Not many Salary employees can say they work 40 hours week. All in all it's a pretty good company with fun free events like Disneyland tickets, or baseball games. Compensation is pretty low and below industry average."
good,"Teledyne Microwave Solutions is a big company, which is a nice place to work. There are so many different departments. You will enjoy to work there."
good,"most people think that security doesn't do anything, but at this location was all about staying alert and paying attention to employees and vendors coming in"
good,"We are able to work a flexible time schedule as long as we get 40 hrs per week in my area, I have learned Solid Edge, Solid Works and a little bit of CREO.. Management is great as well as co workers. I absolutely LOVE my job here. Just things are really getting slow and it does not take a Rocket Scientist to see the writing on the wall...that is why I am putting my resume out here. If we were to get another contract, I would probably stay here."
good,Teledyne Dalsa is a welcoming place with interesting projects to get involved with. It was liberating to be given the freedom to incorporate your own ideas and contributions to a project. The device testing positions have a good mix of hands-on work as well as computer programming and coding.
good,"As a  Ph.D., I was not excited to apply for a position in industry.  Teledyne Energy Systems turned out to be a great compromise between industry and academia.  Working in the Advanced Energy Products group, I get to work on projects with NASA.  They also encourage publishing and attending conferences.  The benefits are great and the managers are great, too.  Another thing I love about this company is the way they give engineers space to gravitate towards their own interests (within the scope of current or future projects, of course).  The only negative thing I will say bout Teledyne ES is that they are a little old fashion in terms of the office environment: this isn't a place where you wear jeans and define your own work schedule.  Managers are sensitive to family needs etc, but overall the expectation is that everyone works the same schedule."
good,Teledyne is a great place to work.I found the Test Department to be a very rewarding and professional department to work in.
good,"Enjoy having goals and excellent results "
good,"Enjoyed many years of employment. Management was good to the people on the production line. Marketing,  R & D needed to do more, I think, Or the company would still be going strong. We were like a family."
good,"I have had a great experience working at Teledyne EMS. My supervisors were all very nice and helpful. They understood if any family emergencies came up. I was rewarded for my efforts. I was challenged on a daily basis, which kept me sharp between the ears. I always kept busy with the constant flow of product."
good,"I've enjoyed working with this company.  I can't speak for every group, but the group I work in is very close-knit.  The program I've worked on has had very strong funding, but there are groups that have not, which is typical for this industry.  Our customers have been very pleased with the products we've produced.  I floated around projects early in my employment, and this company made every effort to place me another project, so they really seem to protect their own."
good,"Reviewing and helping Control Account Managers with their financial budgets, EAC, and Earned Value.  Management is very focused on their goals and achieving the bottom line.  Co-workers are very nice and typically easy to get along with."
good,"Great Company to work for, great people to work for and to work with. Every day is always a joy to accomplish goals."
good,"Typical day on the job was hands on, mostly running the overhead, always had an eye out for working safety. Got along with my co workers &  management team well. The hardest part of the job was climbing up & down the ladder 4-5 times a day."
good,A nice place to work. People are very nice and understanding. Always felt like part of a team.
good,Hardest part of the job is working with tremendous number of engineering changes either in Production and Test areas.
good,"Coordinate Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) Command Launch Equipment (CLE) operations at Vandenberg AFB, CA and Ft. Greely, AK for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Ground Test - Distributed (GTD) activities. Responsibilities included personnel deployment schedules, maintaining current test procedures, checklists, daily status reports, and daily coordination meeting support."
good,Product production and processing are a huge part of a typical day. The coworkers are nothing short of a great group of people.
good,A serious work environment. I found the project rewarding as I was allowed to work independently with minimal management intervention.
good,"I worked on safety instructions, writing job descriptions, and helping maintain a safe working environment."
good,The work was interesting and the people cared about each other worked as a team
good,Work with Mapics and Browser using spreadsheets and queries.
good,"At Teledyne,my duties were to perform various operations and set-ups on machine tools to process,maintain tolerances to ISO 9000 standards on parts.Because of a confidentiality agreement,I cannot elaborate on what kind of parts they were."
good,Great place to work when raising a young family.  Able to work independently.  Company is wiling to invest in its employees creating long term employees.
good,"Overall this was a good company to work for. The days were manageable, the morale of others was generally high. I will say i did have a negative experience with the shift supervisor, but I wont hold that against him seeing as how he had just been promoted and didn't quite know how to handle his new position."
good,Loved the people I worked with and the work I was doing.  I learned so much about accounting and enjoyed this part of my job the most.  I also enjoyed the HR aspect of my job.
good,"Typical day at work for me was making changes to CAD models and manufacturing drawings of company products, which was usually quite dull. I feel it prepared me well for other corporate environments down the road. I enjoyed the hands-on parts of the job working with manufacturing."
good,"I worked there during the previous management for 4 years. It was a tough job but i really enjoyed it and learned a lot. I went to places and met people all over the world. Some previous co-workers are still my friends."
good,The DGO division is a unique environment of team players in striving to improve performance in niche markets.  The enjoyable part of my job was having a satisfied customer after negotiation design requirements and specifications and shipping of final product.
good,"it has a fast paced and physically demanding shipping-receiving and inventory area. Co-workers are all friendly, and mostly well mannered. overtime was usually always available. Management was very lackluster, more worried about the front lawn and board room couch then equipment and tools, the others did not understand the areas they controlled or were unbelievably lazy or uncommitted. that said though they were willing to work with you when it came down to personal life and needs, usually willing to negotiate hours and wage. The floor supervisors were mostly good, the one I worked under was well respected, often advising in other areas. It was an enjoyable place to work."
good,Enjoyed working there. I have worked for this company in the past.Company offered professional working environment with good leadership.
good,"Great company, I got to work and travel to places around the world that I would have never gotten a chance to do anywhere else. I went from building Missiles, tracked vehicles, and Radars for the DoD to the experience of handling and operating Cryogenics along with High Pressure facilities and the building and calibrating of Liquid Oxygen clean components at the Marshall Space Flight Center."
good,Great place to work and would recommend to someone else. Has great benefits.
good,Initial training was superb. Management cares about the employees. Quality products and great service team to back them up.
good,Everything about this company was great. I would still be working there had I not had to relocate for an ill family member
good,"Fast pace, daily challenges, great team support and work environment. Technology leader in the development and use of imaging sensors. No two days are the same."
good,"Great place to work, they try to keep everything as simple as possible, making it easy to learn and keep up with production. The management was great and very helpful whenever I had a question about something."
good,"It's a great place to work. They  treat their workers fair, honestly didn't wanna leave but it was contract. I'd recommend this place for anyone. Plus great compensation"
good,"Very well respectful and friendly environment. All the co-workers are very open. Like, answering and solving to your problems. If not, the management will make sure of it."
good,There is a great deal of opportunity for advancement and the growth has been tremendous since I received my opportunity to work here.
good,"I loved doing cost accounting, but the company was restructing. The new managment felt that only one cost accountant was needed."
good,One of my jobs at teledyne was checking and maintaining the o2 and LEL detectors monthly. I would pump nitrogen or propane in the sensor until it was below 19 and the alarm would go off. I also helped the journeymen electricans when I was either out of work orders or they needed help.

good,Teledyne is a great place to find good wages/benefits and security. The greatest challenge is the amount of time to do some of the work due to the requirements of government contracts. The environment / culture is productively relaxed to focus concentration on quality over quantity.
good,Good place to work. You will get out of it what you put in. Plenty of opportunity to advance. Co workers are easy to work with. Management is easy going.
good,This was a temporary job. I enjoyed and learned so much since this is a global company. The management team were always professional and courteous. I really would have liked to stayed there but I knew it was temporary when I started.
good,"Not real stable work environment."
good,I really like working on new fiber-optic audio/visual technology. The hardest part of the job was the 100% travel from state to state. My manager Install manager was a great mentor.

good,I took calls all day and the people I helped were pleasant.  The hard part about my job was I was there for the people and sometimes that took longer than my manager understood.  I was appreciated by those I helped but ultimately that did not matter the positions where moved out of state and I was left without a job.  I worked hard to improve myself I was there on time.  I even tried to get a degree and was doing quite well.  The business just went a different direction.
good,"Very professional and challenging.  Workplace culture is focused on working very hard, being on top of your game, managing multiple projects at one time, highly regulated, making sure integrity stays intact and being ethical.  You were held accountable for the accuracy of your work and always were required to substantiate what you did because it was subject to government audits.  Highly, highly, highly, highly collaborative, it was a must because the work product was very complex.  The business units ran rather autonomously, which complicated reporting and data gathering due to not being centralized in one location.  As well, they ran on streamline budgets at Corporate and your workload was unbelievably busy because they did not have enough staffing for everything that needed to get done."
good,I worked a single job for them to make some advertisement videos.  The entire group was very impressed with them. The videos were used to promote the product to specific groups.
good,I really liked everything about my position as a mechanical inspector.
good,"I started in the machine shop ordering tools and tooling for the machinists and ran the automated Toolboss machine. I worked in there for six years. Everyone was like family in there. I then went to the Quality department and was responsible for new hire training on safety and quality, internal auditing, and many more duties.

good,Very friendly environment that coordinates multiple departments to create quality products for customers. You are constantly working with people of different disciplines and that experience helps create well rounded employees.
good,"My company is good place to work for and my current manager is absolutely helpful with us. Everyday is a different experience with my job.  There is always challenges and sometimes issues before completing a job which makes it very challenging.   This always helps me to gain more knowledge of resolving problems and knowing people more. It is more of a technical than a clerical work which I believe having a degree makes it more valuable."
good,this is a good full time job and the pay is fair. they need a lot of overtime so one would easily be able to put in at least 20 hours of OT. pay is weekly
good,"If this industry is where you want your career at, definetly go for it! They want to push any of their businesses to the forefront if its field. A great place i wish i didnt have to leave."
good,"Great place to work and grow.  Excellent environment and benefits for employees.  I can honestly say i enjoyed my time at Teledyne Marine, Daytona Beach Fl"
