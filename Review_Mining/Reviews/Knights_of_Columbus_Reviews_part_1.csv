rating,review
bad,"They are not a good place to go , no room for advancement , they are stuck in the 1970s "
bad,The management was not organized and not fun to work for. They hire underage kids so they can pay them low wages. I do not recommend this job for any person looking from extra work.
bad,"Love the Knights. Selling insurance with the compensation was dreadful. Way too much pressure to sell more, while trying to service the existing customer base. Training was minimal."
bad,Working in the field force is a terrible opportunity.  They only serve the Catholic market which is shrinking. They make you service clients that you cannot sell to because they are too old and you can not even count it as a appointment.
bad,The pay is low. There are a lot of late nights and travel.  There is good training.  There is little opportunity for advancement.
bad,"There is no base salary, but they still ask you for an “Office” fee. Basically you’re paying them to work there. I worked for a particularly dishonest General Agent and instead of dealing with him the Chief Insurance Officer and others in the home office swept his misdeeds under the rug.  They masquerade as a fraternal organization while in reality they are nothing more then a pyramid scheme."
bad,IT WAS A PYRAMID SCHEME. no training. no pay. limited clientele. hostle clients. commission percentages were lower than any other insurance company. miserable.
bad,"There is a very high employee turnover rate for a reason. They pay server minimum wage and in McGregor the regulars do not tip enough to even bring your total income up to standard minimum wage. Bartenders are often told that they need to work breakfast shifts and during these shifts, they are paid server minimum wage, but when breakfast customers leave tips for them, the bartenders are made to donate ALL of their breakfast tips back to the hall. The drive out to McGregor is not worthwhile."
bad,"It's a great place to work if you are a man. Unsure how any woman walks through those doors and puts up with that male dominating disgustingness. "
bad,"Very Stressful place to work.Work-Load kept increasing. Compensation did not add-up to work-load. Un-ethical, no communication between employees and management."
bad,Absolutely revolting management skills. As someone who was a manager and highly experienced bar tender it was extreemly frustrating and disheartening to see the lack of staff training and the ill equipped bar. Staff was rude and poorly trained
bad,Totally taken advantage of. Don't care about their employees AT ALL!!! Horrible management. oncall 24/7/365. The barest minimum of software tools provided. Nepotism and backstabbing is encouraged.
bad,"Highly political environment.  Poor management.  Extreme micro-management.   Managers are authoritative and act as bullies.  The company is ruled by males.  Females defer to the men and behave inappropriately to flatter the men and obtain preferential treatment."
bad,"The company is years behind in their technology.  "
bad,This use to be a great company to work for but the higher ups are running the company into the ground. They now treat their employees like trash. Looking at the next Eron.
bad,"Managed a not for profit organizations. Bartended, did book keeping, ordering, inventory and managed the club. Managing duties were promoting the hall rentals."
bad,"●	Business Analyst professional with over 9 years of experience in Banking (both Commercial      and Investment), Finance and Property and casualty, Life Insurance, Retirement plans."
bad,"Family atmosphere amoung employees and management."
bad,"A great place to work, Unfortunately upper management  of the Knights of Columbus have absolutely no clue what is done at the printing plant on a daily basis. They have closed the printing plant and farmed out all the work."
bad,"Set your own work schedule but expected to be available for appointments seven days a week 8am to 9pm. "
bad,"Unorganized scheduling"
bad,KofC  Has an extremely poor training program.   It is basically learn as you go along.   Leadership is also very poor and weak.   No reembursement for expenses and fewer benefits.
bad,This place is very stressful and un organized. I bussed tables here and it was horrible. The pay is terrible. Staff and sometimes customers are very rude and disrespect you.
bad,"Hard to get going all together and then when you do finally they change your territory. Strive on being very ethical , but some are not at all. No benefits at all for health insurance unless you want to pay $1400 a month and most cant afford it."
bad,"close to home"
bad,"Given a book of business of about 800 families, all kofc members.   This list has been worked by all of your predecessors.   Many of these people won't even take your call, and state they have been out of the kofc for years. So you have to try to recruit new members to sell to.   Low commission rates on popular products.  Very poor training"
bad,A very stressful environment. No job security. The company is currently going thru a very intense restructuring and all jobs are on the line at all times.
bad,"The benefits are really good, unfortunately, the bad management overtakes the good benefits. Upper management is afraid to terminate bad managers and supervisors (in particular black or Latino ones) even when there are valid complaints. Bully, harass and belittle employess they feel inferior or threatened by on a daily basis is what they do. Makes for a very uncomfortable and long work day."
bad,"Expérience négative. Directeur d'agence sans expérience qui ne connaît que la vente même s'il est à son 3e vendeurs pour le même secteur en un an. "
bad,"Good work and benefits, but the politics are very challenging."
bad,The benefits are amazing but the opportunities within management are limited. There is little to no opportunity for training but high expectations for job understanding. No place to go for assistance when wanting to succeed.
bad,"It was a good job, but it just wasn’t for me. I never got a raise, the other employees were not very helpful either. It was long nights and every night all week. You can still have a social life and work, but it will be hard to balance with having to get enough sleep."
bad,"A dedicated and well intended group of men trying to make a difference in a very difficult and competitive"
bad,"Great organizational goals, however management goals are unrealistic when compared to the limited market of prospects and the negative attitude from the fraternal side of the organization towards the insurance side."
bad,Good management  good ambiance  good food good prople I learned a lot about the ins  and outs  of running a restaurant and handling everything from opening and closing and everything in between
good,"I worked here for a total of almost 8 years. It was a good place to work initially. When it came to moving up in the company, there wasn't a lot of room for advancement. As a result people tend to burn out, in this environment. When opportunities for advancement did become available, only the people who hadn't been run into the ground (regardless of skills and job knowledge) were considered, which only made for terrible working conditions for those already overlooked and passed over."
good,Knights of Columbus does not offer much balance with work life balance. The typical week has the agent put in 70 hours or more of work.  The pay is rather low.
good,"For a typical day volunteering for the Knights I would plan to show up on time and stay until everything was done. I would usually help set up for the events. I would usually learn the task as I was working on it. I would try the best that I could at all times to complete the job as well as anyone else,"
good,"This is a difficult job. You must have the ability to hear the word ""No"" a lot. Many men join the Knights and do not want to buy or hear about insurance."
good,Good company to work for when given the proper training.  The people and benefits are what makes the Knights of Columbus a good place to work with longevity.
good,"A company working for the benefit of its members, with company growth second. Though the company seems to be heading in a different direction. I did not like the new work atmosphere."
good,The convenience of working at KofC is it's location.  It's near the train stations which makes commuting an ease.  There are several restaurants and shopping areas in the area for conveniences.
good,The job was very high pressure with little support from management.
good,"Very dishonest managment. I witnessed people being used, lied to in regards to job performance and promotions, jealousy of management and set ups to discredit people that did not deserve this treatment. No chances to defend themselves or   be heard."
good,"The IT management is incompetent. No cost/benefit analysis is done for most projects. Overall IT talent is poor."
good,"I have always enjoyed waitressing, fast-paced, can be stressful at times, yet I found it to be fun.  I also enjoy working with the public, weather I was bartending or waiting on customers in the dining room."
good,"Dont even bother trying  to move up the ranks for your hard work because unless you are friends with a director, it's not going to happen. The wrong people with no management experience are placed into positions that they cannot handle because they are friends with someone.  The company offers great benefits and pay but it's not worth the stress."
good,"There was very polite people that I have encountered with , free meals were given for volunteering , donuts were also something that were given to the vulunteers ."
good,You never got paid the right amount and your job wasn’t secure. Even though the staff was amazing it was just so slow paced yet very unorganized. Oh well.
good,it was my first job and they only paid me $3 and hr plus tips so it wasent much. and the management always switched so we never had just one manager so it didnt work out well.
good,Great company with room for growth however in work training is minimal. It was a company where I learned a lot of experience that I will carry with me and learned how to deal with all different types of people.
good,"* Typical Day - Busy"
good,Mostly acted as own boss but required devotion and focus to ensure all aspects of the job were accomplished. Dealt with a diverse client base and went out of the way to make sure the customers needs were always met or exceeded.
good,"I am a Volunteer, so the only place you will get paid is in the kitchen. Otherwise you do time if you have kids at the paraclete high school the tuition will go down."
good,ocean views  was a good working environment bartending and doing functions.  It is not as active people wise as it used to be  but people who work there like it
good,"You have to know someone to get in, it is a very clique ish place to work, they do pay well, it's hard to get time off even if injured, a lot of favoritism is shown"
good,Great place to build a career if you don't have a young family. Many nights and meeting to attend. Ran like a family business if you until other team members don't met quota.
good,"Great managment, fun co workers, small busniess, loved cooking there. I had a great manager who will stand behind you and his word.  Always had new challanges"
good,"There is nothing to talk about.  Its just a temp job 8 hours a week or on call.  Although I have learned new computer skills."
good,The location did not have enough support from other locations or the ability bring in new members and eventually it led to the location being closed down.
good,Very stressful with the pressure of selling products all the time. Meeting new people was a great feeling. Every day you meet some one new. Its a great feeling when you deliver check to a widow.
good,A typical day at Knights of Columbus is that the night would start out slow then the business would increase. Knights was a warm welcoming employer. The management was very organized and took care of their employees. The hardest part of the jobs was having to clear a table at a rush especially if the dining was packed but it was a fun rush. It was high paced and it made the time go by fast. The most enjoyable would be interacting with the costumers. Majority of the customers were elderly and they were very polite.
good,"The work force is very competent and there is work life balance. Salaries are great and benefits are good as well. It is a  pleasant place to work, very relaxed atmosphere."
good,"A good place to work and I get to make my own hours, I do many things there such as setup for events clean the hall after events and clean the club room in the front of the building."
good,was great being able to raise money for charity for cooking and serving food for those families that barley have anything .  I love making an impact in peoples lives
good,it was a good place to work. i set up and cleaned up for parties on my own time. the building is closing.i worked with great guys and got the job done.
good,A typical day was me and a group of my peers coming up with different ways to help the community and raise money. I learned how to work with a team to come up with different projects.
good,"Decent place to work but the pay is very bad, and not consistent enough hours. Manager is a bit of a hot head, imo. Hardest part of the job was when it was hectic, co-workers were cool, sometimes there were arguments."
good,"A typical day at work would be setting up tables and other accessories for events, banquets, weddings, fish fries. Also, preparing and serving trays with the correct food on them ordered by customers or guests."
good,It was basically a volunteer job but I had fun. A lot of the people that worked there were older and of the Christian type. It held banquets in the hall or weddings and such. It wasn't a fast paced environment.
good,"-serving, cleaning, and decorating"
good,I enjoyed volunteering for this company. It was a great learning experience.
good,"This is a regular or normal teaching job.The management is a bit strict with the rules."
good,"Most people worked hard and did their jobs, but some people would find ways to get out of work and disrupt other coworkers. Management was impossible to get a hold of. Easy work with short hours."
good,kenmore new york location. fun place to work . good atmosphere friendly people.
good,"Stated above, with a fairly straight expectations. Drink serving was the mainstay of the job. This job's most difficult part was in dealing with intoxicated and demanding patrons."
good,"Staff was not very friendly or helpful.  Some of the employees were down right rude when asked a question.  I came down with gout and was offered the chance to work from home, and I did take that, but still, one employee gave me such a bad time, and reported to management that I was not doing my job, which was so untrue.  "
good,Calling a warm market of members in the morning to secure appointments for insurance presentations.  Afternoons spent seeing clients and seeking out potential new members for the Benefit Society.  Follow up calls in the evening as well as Fraternal meetings
good,"Quiet steady and productive."
good,i worked here seance i was 16 teen in tell they shut down it was a grate place to work and the people and the customers were fun to be around
good,Great job culture.  Really promoted helping families.  Unfortunately it took 1 to 2 months to get paid on sales and the job was 100% commission.  Would chargeback with little recourse for the agent.
good,Depending on where you live and how many clients are catholic.  It was a nice job but in my area I did not have a big customer base.  I did do very well for the year I was there.  The hours are long and cold calling is a challenge.
good,"A great place to work if you work well autonomously. If you like to work from home, be your own boss and run your own business and be compensated for your own efforts - KofC is great! If you need help, training, coaching, people to work next to and talk to then stay away."
good,It’s was awesome I had a chance you help the community while getting voulenteer hours for church it was also fun because many memories were made there with the amazing family’s.
good,"Enjoy working at KofC.  Working in a face-paced, diversified department which makes the day fly by.  Great co-workers and supervision.  Hours are good, in early and home early to start a second job."
good,"There are some paid jobs at Knights of Columbus, but I was only a volunteer. Its the best management sandbox I have ever been in, and it accepts pretty much anyone into a management position because it is a fraternity and there is nothing to lose. If management is extremely poor the council will shut down, but as long as there are active officers with interest in helping the church, this is not an issue."
good,Easy weekend job for $25 a night. Great practice for handling cash and learning to give change back.Throughout the night different ticket prices are given for bingo players and it involves quick thinking on handling money
good,"A typical day of work begging when: You have to wakeup at 5:00 a.m. every morning to start verifying your e-mails because you have to send an inform of how many visits you do have being doing during the last past week, sales and visits to council and members of the organization. "
good,"very few clients to sell to, they must be members of knights of Columbus, which left my area to just 600 clients.  You can only go to the well so many times."
good,"I am learning a heck of a lot, and I am providing a very valuable benefit to many different families, and it is very rewarding. The work can be very difficult and time intensive."
good,"Enjoyed working with other Catholic men and fellow Field Agents in a  collaborative work environment.  Unfortunately, the current General Agent lacks the ability to transfer his knowledge in a positive and supportive manner that would allow his agents to succeed. The company itself is a good company to work for, adequate pay, good benefits and very good insurance products for it's member families."
good,Working there was fun. I was able to meet new people and gain new customers along with brining old customers back. I typically worked about 20 hours inside the bar but 30 hours doing the paperwork and ordering. The management did not like changes to be made even if it was to increase revenue and customers. Management would say one thing positive and then behind your back say numerous things that are negative. They would not give time for the deliveries to come after the order was placed. Too much free alcohol was being passed out.
good,A full seven days a week plus records and reports to State of Minnesota monthly plus audits when ordered. Also once per year inventory and yearly seminar with the State Gambling Commission. Inside auditor reviewed the monthly reports before computer submission.
good,"Long hours as required to get the job done.  Travel as required thorough out Alberta/NWT.  Was the top official for Alberta/NWT."
good,"I enjoy working for the Knights of Columbus. Great vibes, great coworkers, great food! Gaming is busy which keeps us busy. Great clientele that make our jobs worthwhile"
good,-Cold calling skills
good,"I enjoyed that every day had a different challenge, that I was given the ability to work independently and with a team. Subsidized cafeteria pricing was also a bonus."
good,The Knights of Columbus are a wonderful Catholic Fraternal organization.  Their insurance program is exceptional but lacks national recognition and local support varies greatly.
good,A typical day included a meeting going over the agenda for event plans and operations in order to serve the community. Volunteers would step up and take positions in events.
good,"general agents not helpful at all, I had 1 deny me an earned trip to home office, one fired for misappropriation of funds, and one hyper focused on technical issues rather than sales."
good,i left because they were unorganized and had unfair hours. how this job worked was i had to sell candy and stuff to the children and work the cash register. the other part was frying french fries and stuff like that
good,"I really enjoyed my positon at knights of columbus, and my experience there .  The staff at the supply department were freindly and professional it was a honor to have worked with them."
good,I coached my brothers hockey team and it taught me how to handle opinions and criticism towards myself which help better myself.
good,"Management has great training program and are easy to talk to.  Little interference by management, work indepently.  Good potential for income"
good,I love volunteering here because you get free food if you work a banquet or event!
good,"A typical day at work for me involves shipping approximately 250 packages, mostly going domestically or to Canada, with some packages going to the Philippines, Caribbean countries Europe and Guam. I have learned a great deal about the shipping industry, including what changes costs of shipping and time of delivery. My supervisor is a very hands on individual, almost to the point of being a hindrance. He is knowledgeable about the items and information being shipped but not very knowledgeable about carriers and the daily operations of the department. The majority of my co-workers are unmotivated and disorganized. They take a very careless view to their daily work and production suffers on occasion as a result. There are a few co-workers who take their job seriously and perform well on a daily basis. The most difficult aspect of my job is deciding between FedEx ground and USPS in domestic shipping. I've learned that price jumps for the USPS when you get south of Washington D.C. and west of Ohio. The most enjoyable aspect of my job is knowing that I am helping families financially while they are going through a very tough personal time and that I am helping people to celebrate what they believe in and share it with other people."
good,Very knowledgeable people in the IT department. Each day brings new challanges. A very interesting work experience.
good,"We we're a group of 24. As a Data Entry Clerk I was responsible for my own accuracy and quality as well as speed. Our error entries were set at less than 1% for accuracy. In the amount of time I worked there, I did not go above 1% with errors."
good,"typical day would be starting off with the bookkeeping and then overseeing what events would be coming up and getting prepared. We did wedding, stags, showers, fundraisers ETC...The hardest part of my job was making sure that every event was perfect. The best part about the job was meeting and working with new people everyday."
good,I was a busser. I would refill water cups. Deliver food to the customers. Clean tables and wash dishes. Take food orders. Seat the customers. Also greet the customers.
good,This is an organization which prides itself on the Catholic Faith and its members. Working with assigned councils and meeting the members and their families was rewarding. Learning the value of the products that we sell as well as how they work was very educational for myself.
good,"Attended many fraternal meetings to meet clients and schedule appointments.  Made sales presentations on life insurance, IRA, Long Term Care and disability insurance.  I learned that many families do not have adequate life insurance to protect their families.  Training and support from management was not adequate. The support and help for families that this agency provides is the environment that attracts you to this noble endeavor.  The hardest part of the job was to stay motivated when sales were very slow.  The fun part of the job was meeting new clients and their families and assisting them in protecting their families."
good,"It's your typical waiter/host duties. Fun people to work with. At the time, the chef was really cool and flexible with your schedule. He was very strict but at the same time he was someone you could easily come to about a problem."
good,First place to work it was a good first job experience I honestly will miss how nice all the employees were here. I did like the condition of the place especially after the re-modeling being done.
good,It can be overwhelming sometimes. As long as you work hard and get everything done then it shouldn't be any problem. The pay isn't to great but it's worth it.
good,"This is a good place to work. It is a union job with above average benefits and a pension. However, pay is lower than market rates."
good,"The job was super easy to do because you're just setting up the table in chairs where they want them to be for events that go on at the Knights of Columbus. Also, I wouldn't recommend working here because this is only a 4 to 6 time a month thing and they don't pay you that much an hour to do it. If your only looking to do part-time here I would recommend it because its easy work."
good,I have good co workers that I've worked with for nearly 15 years. We work well as a team. It's nice when the client gives us free range to be creative.
good,"This is a great place for the Catholic man to build his faith and fraternal ties. With a potential to earn a far above average income. Like any sales career one must be prepared to put in some front end effort in order to see success. The systems are in place and there is a lot of support,"
good,"This is a life insurance company exclusive for the members of Knights of Columbus in the Philippines situated in Intramuros, Manila.  My work here requires interfacing with members on their inquiries and complaints on their lapsed or reinstated policies, written or personal.  Report monthly to the Service Manager on the accounting of lapsed policies."
good,"My position was Senior System Programmer Analyst and last 5 years of which Senior System Data Analyst. I was responsible for the data analysis of the all environments - test and production, working with the various technical groups - developers and business analysts and project managers."
good,"Set own work schedule"
good,I believe the KC is now permanently closed.  It was usually a fun place to work . The other bartenders were great for the most part.  When there were special events it was always a good time.They were great about helping out the scouts and other organizations.
good,I truly enjoyed this job; it was well managed and staffed and there was never an absence of management. This job provided a friendly work environment with a scheduled lunch and break. I worked with many kids but the hardest part was managing my co-councilor. Co-councilors were hard to manage because they were usually under 18 and very much kids them selves but overall well behaved. I truly loved working with the kids they were fun and full of energy
good,"It is a fast-pace environment. It is all about production, production, production.We strive--every year, to expand out products, around the world. I work along-side our Underwriters.I request and receive, insurer's medical information. I input it, into our system."
good,Call clients to schedule appointments for a financial review. People respond to email and text more often than by phone. People are amazed at the needs that are uncovered during a needs analysis. Getting people to commit to a date for a meeting.
good,I really enjoyed working at the Knights of Columbus.  I got to meet a lot of people an learned a lot about Life Insurance policy's.  I would recommend this job to people
good,Working at the Knights is very supportive environment if you work for the right. I branched off from tax auditing to IT Audit and the i received from management was perfect. Great place to work.
good,"As lead bartender, I was in charge of opening and closing the club on my scheduled days. I set up and broke down the register and took inventory of alcohol and supplies. I also was in charge of checking membership cards upon arrival, taking and serving food and drink orders, cleaning and maintaining the dining area, bar and restrooms...."
good,"A typical day started off with cleaning the pool deck, taking out trash, taking inventory, checking chemicals, and cleaning the bathrooms. Usually there were 3 to 5 lifeguards working at a time. Our jobs were to make sure swimmers were safe and enforce the rules of the pool to maintain safety."
good,"Had an enjoyable time working with the agents, answering phones, filing papers and reviewing insurance information and learning a lot about the insurance business."
good,"Making telephone calls to fraternal organization membership or prospective members to arrange appointments to discuss fraternal benefits including insurance. "
good,This is a non-profit organization which works in conjunction with the Catholic Church to provide assistance in charitable works for the church for the benefit of the local community. Many of the projects undertaken by the Knights of Columbus provide immeasurable benefits to the community served by the church.
good,I've learned a lot being here and continue to learn something new every day. I know this will take me far in my business career. If you're looking to be a part of a rapidly growing company with great company culture.. I suggest you check us out!
good,"The Knights of Columbus is a community of men that places charity as its most important value. Typically the Knights of Columbus volunteer to perform tasks that benefit communities in need such as domestic violence victims, families who have lost loved ones, troubled families, and even simply those in the community who simply need a few extra funds. The Knights of Columbus is not simply limited to a local church or the nation, but internationally. The hardest part of being a part of the Knights is sometimes finding the time in your schedule to help volunteer for projects. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction received from volunteering and the sense of brotherhood from fellow peers."
good,"Insurance Position, great products. Good culture very Christian. Can only sell to members. Need more support from organization to drive sales. It is fraternal."
good,Insurance company typical eight to four third desk job some departments have different times. Casual dressing taught people their software. Different departments have different things duties.
good,Volunteer organization. Great time volunteering at fundraisers and helping out in the community. Welcomes people both young and old to help out at many different events.
good,The Knights encouraged a very honest and civilized work experience.
good,"Knights of Columbus has a great work environment. Most spots are quiet, peaceful areas and it helps you easily do your work. There are also cafes and cafeterias that you can go to for lunch in case you desire to grab something delicious."
good,"Incredible experience, work/family balance is the main focus and  is an amazing company to be a part of. Never felt more at home than I do here, LOVE !"
good,Even though it's a charitable organization they still operate two different public entities.  It was a pleasure and rewarding experience to work with them.
good,This is a volunteer organization where there is plenty of opportunity to serve your local community. Lots of social events too.
good,Wonderful values placed on morality and doing the right thing for clients and customers
good,The Knights of Columbus is a great Organization that helps out local churches with funding and has come up with great ideas to help keep the community involved and tells people about the church.
good,"A typical job would be about 4 hours, depending on the situation at hand. I worked wedding parties, birthday parties, and casual Hall dinners. I learned how to buss and arrange the dinnerware. Everyone is nice, but the busier it gets, the more frustrated the workers get. The hardest part is keeping up with all the people and the most enjoyable part is making friends with your co-workers."
good,The Knights of Columbus offered many unique jobs and made me realize the value of working hard! I earned all I can from this job and am ready for a new chapter in my life
good,My work day started off very pleasant and no doubt a high demand in production for the company when dealing with Cash and Life Insurance Accounts.  Knights of Columbus is a very religious organization that is prestigest to work for.
good,A nice place to work. The people are pleasant and the environment is comfortable.
good,"The culture of bingo players is serious and exuberant as people gather weekly to play bingo. Good heatedly players will 'threaten' to rough me up if I don't call them a win. The crew of approximately twenty volunteers a week are also good hearted and committed to raising money for scholarships, youth programs, elderly housing and to provide assistance to societies less fortunate. The nights end with the volunteers guessing how much was made and some home made food being consumed."
good,"I loved working for the Knights of Columbus. I was always on time willing to take extra shifts even though I was a high school student in activities such as Soccer, Drill Team, & Softball. Loved my job and was always happy in the environment where I worked with many different people.  Never had problems with the customers I dealt with but had a couple problems with a couple coworkers. It was the hardest problem for me because I noticed they were stealing tips we all had to share so I professionally brought it to the managers attention but since they were related to other coworkers I was punished with fewer shifts which then led me to put in my 2 weeks and focus on my education. I however did learn how to check ids for alcohol and give wristbands, set up tables and chairs, put napkins in the glasses, set up the silver ware properly on the table and cater food to parties."
good,"I would highly recommend employment with the Knights of Columbus. There is a lot of support and job security because the company itself has a long history (130 years) of helping society and it's employees. With this fragile economy, there is great job security with the KofC and plenty of room for advancement."
good,"Everyone there was friendly and wanted to help out. Was an intern at this company, and they were always willing to teach me if I had questions. I learned a lot during my summer at the Knights of Columbus."
good,"A typical day would be scanning life policies into a scanner 250+,  Create a PDF file which would generate a contract for the life insurer. "
good,"Knights of Columbus is purely voluntary work. it taught me great social skills and the importance of team work.They are a church program, on friday night, holidays, and the first sunday of the month host meals. i was required to set up, prepare food, serve, clean, and wash dishes. It was a high pace environment because there would roughly be 100 or more people on a regular friday night dinner which meant wed set up and be ready by 4:30 guests come in at 5 and find their seats and then we make plates of food and serve."
good,"it was a good place to volunteer, it gave me several important skills for other jobs. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who is uncomfortable catering to people over the age of 50."
good,I enjoy being Financial Secretary of my Knights of Columbus Council.  I enjoy serving the Knights and the Church.  It is a lot of work for a little bit of money but I do it for the Lord.
good,I get to work with wonderful people on projects that benefit others!
good,Overall my working experience at the Knights of Columbus was very good and rewarding. I’ve been going there years before I got a job there and never had a problem.
good,"In this job I get to be extremely social and interact with clients. This job requires a lot of movement, positive attitude, and must one be very respectful. One has to be flexible to work in this business."

good,It's been awhile since I've worked at knights to Columbus which was from 2009 to 2014 so now it probably changed but at the time I did enjoy working here it was sad that I had to go but management had changed at the time so it went downhill

good,"There is room for advancement when you prove you are capable of handling it. Show up on time, do as told, always offer help and management will recognize your efforts. Schedule is very flexible, management is very understanding and empathetic. At times, it is slow-paced and at times it's very quick-paced - depending on the status of the guests' consumption. Overall, a great place to work for  some side cash."
good,Great place to work and great environment to be in. Overall very clean as well. Love working here and love my bosses.

My co-workers are very nice and have no issues."
good,"A typical day volunteering was fun, I was always looking forward to seeing who I would be working with. I learned how to set tables properly and I managed to carry multiple plates at once. My co-workers were very friendly and I got to meet a lot of different volunteers. The hardest part of the job was trying not to break anything when clearing the tables. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the managers because they were always playing jokes, laughing and making me feel comfortable. I also enjoyed being able to interact with the public, you get to meet a lot of different people."

Knights promotes from within and is in the process of developing a comprehensive in-house training program. They also provide self study training through LOMA and pay you for each course that you pass as well as each designation you receive.

Service revolves around charity, therefore management naturally follows noble individuals who motivate everyone and encourage brotherhood.

good,"My time with the company, although short, gave me a lot of time to meet many individuals and see the true culture of the Knights. While there I saw how strongly the company expresses Catholic ideals in their everyday work and applied them to clients outside of the office. The agents were very involved with the families they work for and helped them in times of need. They never focused on just selling insurance, but focused on making sure a family was financially prepared to take on any unexpected loss of a family member. It truly was an enlightening experience to work for one of the most ethical insurance companies in the US."
