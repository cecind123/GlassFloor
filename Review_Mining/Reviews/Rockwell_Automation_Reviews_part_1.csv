bad,"This is a very toxic company. The leadership is absolutely arrogant. They are a good old boys club with no clue about the products we actually develop. The Supply Chain leadership does not have a clue about what they are doing. The managers are always gone or are always taking their friends to lunch on the company’s dime. This company has become so dishonest over the last 20 years that I had to leave. After 20 years, you just don’t want to be apart of the nonsense and dishonesty anymore."
bad,Management was absent most of the time. The people that were in charge of my department were unprofessional and abrasive. Production was valued above anything else and the culture was not one I enjoyed working in.
bad,"Dysfunctional and toxic. HR ignores complaints that employees submit. Culture supports work place bullying and retaliation from managers. And, ignores high turnover."
bad,"IF YOU HAVE NO LIFE AND DONT MIND NOT GETTING ONE THIS IS THE PERFECT JOB FOR YOU ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A KISS BUTT KIND IF WORKER! Shut your mouth do your work make us money forget you have a family need to eat drink and hurry up and use the bathroom go home and hurry up get back to work get us 50,000 units packaged up if your sick and leave on a stretcher you will get points for leaving early .If you have vacation time use it to keep your sanity kind of job that’s what your getting working here and no they don’t see anything that someone is doing wrong to you especially if they are a certain color or are in leadership positions!"
bad,"This job was exactly what it says. A job. No real skills to learn, just back-breaking, repetitive, mundane physical labor. The environment is very fast paced and chaotic and the management were more like wardens."
bad,Just a job that I thought was going to be something that turned into nothing sad it was a great place with alot of great people but for some reason it just didn't work.
bad,"They care more about the company than they do your own health. They tell you you have to cancel your doctors appointments and plans to come in for OT which is mandatory. They threaten you if you don't. There is no room for advancement. I constantly got harassed by my supervisors and HR won't do anything other than ""well look into it"" which is a lie."
bad,"I'd be so tired from waking up so early in the morning that I would have to play on my phone to stay awake because the supervisor was so boring, but we knew that we had to sit and listen to him. I learned that some companies really don't care about their employees because that is an extremely stressful job. Management was so so because in the past four years or so there had been five different supervisors going for that spot. They never gave any incentive for good attendance or good behavior. The hardiest part of the job was working with ignorant co-workers who would form groups like they were still in high school. The most enjoyable part about that job was when I could work on the line by my self because I could get my work done and not have to worry about someone else messing something up that could possibly get me in trouble with them."
bad,The manager sexually harassed me. I was the victim and I was let go. That company is no good! There is nobody to complain to about it. You are on your own.The manager was taking advantage on me and I could not go to anybody and complain.
bad,Very respectful working environment. opportunity to learn new skills.Enjoyed stay at Rockwell automation. learned software development environment and testing.
bad,They are known for hiring temps then firing.   The pay sucks and the demand from management is unrealistic with limited equipment and workers. I would not recommend anyone to this company.
bad,as a field engineering traveled national and international comm power transmitinon equipment. worked with engineering support on setting up equipment to customer spec
bad,"Salary is okay until you factor in working 70+ hour weeks most weeks.  A lot of room for career advancement, but the environment can be very political.  High turnover in HR as the department was far too lean for the company size.   The culture there is just not positive and you work too many hours and do not get much out of it.  I left on my accord (without another job in hand) and did not regret it for second.   I had a bad leader there so that may be a big reason for my bad experience, but a lot of coworkers I had with different leaders left as well  there is definitely something undesireable about it."
bad,"Rockwell Automation/Allen Bradley corporation used to be the best place to work in the area. Many people were known as ""Lifers"", which meant once you got a job there you stayed for life. That mentality went out the window when Rockwell bought Allen Bradley Co. Now the only things they are interested in are numbers. They don't care about the people that work there, which in turn makes the people who work there not care about the company. It has been sad to see how things have gone downhill over the years. Management in general is only interested in keeping their jobs, and making their numbers look good. They are usually only there for a short time to add experience to their resumes, and then they move on. There used to be a sort of pride in what was made there, and quality was job #1. Now it is all about how cheap parts be bought, and keeping as little inventory as possible in the building. Much if not almost all of the production that was at this facility has been move to Mexico. Again it is all about profit margin. Why pay Americans $16 an hour, when you can pay Mexicans $9 a day! There is no pride in this company anymore, and I wish that was the worst of it. The worst part of all is the blatant lying. I think it is a job requirement to get any kind of office job for this corporation. They lie right to your face, and smile about it. So if you don't mind working for a company that doesn't care about you, pays decently well, lies to your face, puts constant stress on you no matter what, and you think head games are fun. Then this is the place for you. If not look elsewhere."
bad,This job is very stressful.  Management is unfair to it's workers.
bad,continuous improvement is a good program at my work. I like to improve things.They appreciate those people who take part in continuous improvement.
bad,"Not a good company to work for. The environment, product and the management sucks big time."
bad,"This place is a JOKE!!, management does not what they are doing, supervisors are not trained right and not people person, pay is low,Planners are stupid"
bad,"This is the last place you want to work. I didnt believe all the negative reviews, i worked here anyways. Bad mistake. Upper management is reckless and irresponsible. They work short hours while everyone else works 6 days a week. I feel that if the real company leaders knew what was going on in Twinsburg, then all of management would be replaced. There needs to be a union here. The treatment of and disregard for employees is so sickeningly unethical it makes my head spin. I will do my best to make sure no one i know accepts a job here."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"If all of these reviews are ""Great Reviews"", then why are all the people that worked for Rockwell no longer employed there. I can tell you why from my employment with Rockwell. It is Rockwell policy, only hires people to work for them as contractor's. When your time is up, your out the door. When I worked there at Rockwell, I actually saw people with expired contract's, when, they're time was up and asked to leave, tried and begged to get full time job's there. As Rockwell booted them out the door. For all you people reading this doubting what I am writting, then why are all these reviews been written by former Employee's. That's wright they do not care (Rockwell) after they say see you latter. (Reviewer's) They all think by writting these nice reviews, that they just might be called back to jobs by Rockwell, they will never see again as an Employee of Rockwell's."
bad,"The worst part about Rockwell is the complete inconsistency of leadership across its endless number of internal groups.  Ironically We Are One must only extend to executive staff because below that it’s Only Us.  That can be good in groups like Talent Acquisition or software business units where unity and inclusion are constantly practiced and lived.  In other groups like Test Engineering or  Facilities management is so atrocious you’d think it was 1954 in a sweat shop fear, bullying, poor pay and only the fittest will be rewarded are the norm and a near total lack of empathy or actual strategic intelligence are rampant.  In operations we were to rely on support groups within our services area, most of their managers favorite words were “no” and “can’t help” operations was hellish because people getting paid handsomely came up with new and creative ways to NOT do their job in helping us make money for the company be very careful which group you ever want to work in!"
bad,"Pésima organización por parte de supervisores y administrativos, está super marcado los presidencialismos."
bad,"During a group meeting with management one of the managers yelled at our elected floor group representative and told him that ""you're lucky to have this job! Anybody can do these jobs and soon you will all be replaced by machines anyway"". So workplace culture was...low. Also overtime was Mandatory. I think some people can get content with a job like this but it obviously wasn't for me. I will say that at least on the production floor they are brutally honest with their employees for better or worse."
bad,Lack of communication on managements part.  Always changed the rules of the company on an everyday basis.  Did not hire enough people and make everyone work O.T. on a daily basis. You have butt kissers that work there then they tell on other people because they don't like them or don't agree with what they say. Lack of quality training. Lack of leadership on the floor.
bad,"management is bad.  very lazy managers.  company is very manager top heavy and demands unrealistic expectations from workers who are afraid to speak up due to managerial performance reviews. the reviews retaliate against hard working employees and HR allow BAD management behavior.  I am shock to see the ratings this high.  When the company would take surveys about how they rated,  RA would eliminate the low scores and say they were just noise that should not be looked at."
bad,"Everything about this company sucks. The management sucks, the paying sucks, and lazy workers! First shift are the worse workers, but yet everything gets blamed on second and third shift if they don't finish an order or messed up on a drive. They hire lazy workers and let go of the people who actually wants to work. A lot of cry babies and snitchers in this company. A lot of testers and other employees left this place to work at GE because people who works at Rockwell are getting under paid and thats FACTS. 20 cents yearly raise? What kind of bull is that? Some people barely get a 20 cent raise. One material handler on second shift picking parts for 3 departments?! When asked the supervisor and product manager to hire another material handler to help out on second shift, they're answer was, ""we can't, we're trying to save money."" How are you a multi-billionaire company who is under paying your workers and ""supposedly"" can't afford to hire another material handler? Saving money my a**, this company is money greedy. Busting your butt off 10 hours every day and all they do is buy pizzas or donuts for the employees to eat after the busy season is over with. WE DON'T WANT YOUR FOOD, GIVE US A BONUS CHECK! One frame 1-7 cost about $5000-$10,000 easily! We push out thousands of drives out every week. The whole Rockwell system is just messed up period."
bad,I did not have a great experience here. My boss was not interested in suggestions. If I scheduled meetings with other workers at the facility he would tell me not to waste my time.
bad,"Poor management."
bad,"Cons:"
bad,"I worked in Assembly on 2nd Shift. Managements will yell and curse at the workers. They are very disrespectful to their employees. Lots of favoritism. If you have an issue, the HR department wont care. Very toxic work environment.  Dont work here."
bad,"Too many hours, to the point of physical degradation. Co-workers can be full of bullies and crooks. Management is very cliquish. Back stabbing is a daily ordeal. Very stressful. Pay isn't bad though, if you don't mind the irreversible physical damage."
bad,"This job was only bad because it was mandatory night shift and monotonous.  The management was good.  They were very accountable and worked well with all of us.  The pay is low for the exhaustion, but doable in a pinch."
bad,Muy buena empresa la recomiendo tienen buen sueldo y aambiente laboral y planta climatizada
bad,Unfortunately Rockwell does not support internal promotions as expected. Lots of experience acquired was not valuable to the company. They offer competitive benefits
bad,Not  high opinion management and leadership was lacking.  Dont have a strong opinion otherwise and would not recommend to my friends.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend it, although I work with nice people the department I work in is badly run, the computer systems are not suitable for this business."
bad,"Rockwell treats its employees and clients like nothing more than $$$, often making rash decisions to cut employees simply to save money with no regard to how it will affect customer service - especially customer service guaranteed by contracts."
bad,Le falta mucho a esta empresa no ay aumento se tardan para alhunnposteo la vdd tienes que durar hasta 3 o 7 años para tener un buen sueldo
bad,"Rockwell had some very nice and friendly employees that I worked with, and the work that you do is so easy that you fall asleep sometimes and you get bored. It's repetitive but it is a factory job so that's expected. My main problem was management and the overtime they forced on you. They never paid me my 8 hours of overtime and most of the employees on my shift never got paid some of  their overtime pay as well. My supervisor was super unprofessional and was very strict on everything. If you missed work, he would give you 6 points instead of 3 no matter what excuse you had. One of my co workers' house flooded, so they missed work because of it. Our supervisor gave him 7 points. If you have 12-15 points, you will get fired. He cares very deeply about keeping the machines running that if you need to use the bathroom, you're going to have to hold it in until break time which can be forever. He stalks you whenever you do leave to the bathroom. He would expect you to come to work if you were terminally ill or gave birth to a baby. Horrible management. All they care about is the company, and they dont care about their employees. They'll work you to death, force overtime on you, and won't pay you for it."
bad,"Contract position, no training, computer system not set up - had to figure it out with very little guidance not a welcoming environment poorly managed"
bad,There's not much room for advancement for specific departments. Supervisors in customer care tends to not stick around long. The customer care group is treated differently than any other department such as having to pay for coffee and bring the only group doing so.
bad,Had nice breaks that’s bout it. Over work u make u stay over time or come in early if u don’t finish don’t care bout u long as u get your job done they let me go after I stay over time to help someone eles after I did my job because they other guy act like he was sick he told me. So they use me to stay and I use work hard so I can leave on time they made me stay because they couldn’t finish they job than two hours later when I get home they call my temp spot and let me go after I did all that to help them job don’t care bout u. Don’t apply
bad,Had a job with no direction and was told it was ambiguous. Co-Workers had project they did not do that I had to start. Management thinks they are above you and can talk to you however they would like. Very little contact with other employees. Did not get to know others even when I asked to meet other people in my area ( did not know the people 3 feet from me). Sexist area that I worked in favoring young women over men. Little to no actual job training. was hired for one thing and ended up doing another thing. More interested in analyzing the problems than solving them. was graded on things I can not control.
bad,"Jobs at Rockwell are ""OK"" but most of management kills that right off the bat. They are constantly changing rules and just looking for ways to get you in trouble. I don't know why they are always trying to fight against you. But they sure as hell won't work with you. Management will put on the ""act"" that they love it there, meanwhile they are looking for a different job. "
bad,"I worked as a circuit board tester.  A very fast paced job that required heavy lifting and rapid change over of testing units. Most of the equipment is out of date and breaks down regularly. The routers and stations only accommodate particular circuit boards / testers, requiring the restocking of boards back into magazines to be routed at another location. Wasting time & energy. Work orders are changed midstream because of last minute ""emergency "" rush orders that should've been delivered by the beginning of the shift. This was a constant managerial error that was always overlooked. All of the measures the attain efficiency are directed at finding fault with employees while omitting redundant, illogical, counterproductive procedures established & enforced by management or faulty equipment. I was told several times that our 4 member department was understaffed by 3 peronell, yet we were expected to maintain or exceed the work of 7 without any additional compensation."
bad,Management shows very little compassion for employees . HR DEPT is by far the worst around this area . They offer no help for you but are more than happy to write you up with regards to the person . People like to stab other in the back so be very careful
bad,Rockwell I feel is a poor place to work.  The management team is very disrespectful.  They yell at the employees for talking.  You have to ask to use the bathroom.  They are not family oriented.
bad,I was working as a temporary contracted worker and I was bullied by full time employees. The management at the time turned a blind eye to what was going on.
bad,"Machine don't run very well so production is slow, techs spend more time fixing the machine than they are run."
bad,"I simply acted like I liked working there. I wanted to get out to bigger cities, but thanks to my personal life distracting my work life, I had hard time managing both."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend Rockwell due many long hours and the poor management , no clear path to advance your career , the pay is barley enough to cover expenses"
bad,"PROJEKT:"
bad,Women get paid less then men.  Management is clueless.   Concerns fall on deaf ears.  Racial harassment is plentiful.  Sad for a company that is global known.
bad,"Rockwell Automation falsely advertises that they are an inclusive culture & have a positive working environment. Nothing is further from the truth. They do not share information with their staff and keep their employees in the dark, often lying to their faces. Rockwell only cares about incoming sales and the rest of the staff are treated like second class citizens. Rockwell's 'leadership' is terrible and the people they have in charge of Canada are incompetent and frankly, mean spirited. I would never advise anyone to work for this Company. Rockwell does very little to provide training or support for their staff, often leaving them alone to figure it out on their own. Rockwell does not reward or value innovation or forward thinking leadership and new ideas. From my experience, Rockwell leadership only wants you to speak when spoken to and to just keep it to yourself if you have a new idea. I do not recommend this Company to anyone who would like to work in a positive working environment."
bad,"No hay tabulador de categorias, las prestaciones son solo las de ley no hay diferencia entre un tecnico y un operador se gana casi lo mismo y tienes que trabajar tiempo extra ya que pagan muy poco a los tecnicos"
bad,"My manager was not  honest person and always deceived."
bad,"The company is setup in silo's, very hard to achieve and complete projects due to the layered hierarchy of management. Difficult to obtain approval from management"
bad,pues tiene un ambiente muy familiar lo unico que no me gusto es de que no respetan lo que prometen siempre te dicen una cosa y otra pero no lo cumplen.
bad,Great company with great products that makes a difference for people life.
bad,"The company culture is now ""do everything fast, with dwindling resources"".  They used to promote managers from within.  Upper management is now composed of cast-offs from other companies."
bad,If you like working at an old school firm this is the place for you.  They try to do modern things but they are not committed if it will cost too much financially.
bad,People have been in same position for 15+ years. I see a few retired after working in SAME position for 38 years. Impossible to change and benefit from new technology.
bad,"Good exposure, good growth but poor direction and decision making from management. Highly unstable and lack of job security. Lots of restructing. A person is hired for one role and then given somthing else. No one values long term thinking, only fast thinking is valued here."
bad,"Rockwell was very stressful and did not need to be. I was a forklift operator. I was a package handler for awhile too. The manager was new and inexperienced, not really his fault but had left us all in a bad place to work."
bad,Rockwell was a good place to start and learn. Pay is on the low side. Learning was encouraged and there were opportunities for growth. Working with lower cost overseas developers was challenging and unpleasant.
bad,If company wouldn't have moved to Mexico and was secure I would still work there. Co workers were great and people all got along. It was pretty good while it lasted.
bad,"at the dc i worked at if you had a family and valued family time you didn't get much of it. The work life balance was very bad. But if you were single its a good place to get money and skills."
bad,When I started working there 10 years ago I loved my job and management.  Since then it is not a good work environment and not a good place to work for.
bad,"It started as a really fun job, then they raised the rate per hour , dropped how many errors you could get and then all the mandated over time started to happen. You could not make any plans outside of the work place, because they would change the over time on you and you would get into trouble for calling off on that."
bad,"There was lots of autonomy in my job and I had internal champions and mentors, however it was steeped in 'old boy's club' politics and wasn't able to give me advancement. They had great pay and benefits, however the glass ceiling was thick. There is a really a lovely social culture internally if you know how to get along in a large environment."
bad,"Very inefficient, leadership team have very few stars that would shine in other companies. The Global Sales and Management organization has lost 5 out of 7 directors. Good food in the cafeteria though :)"
bad,"Worked there almost 3 years. Co-workers were great. The overtime was way too much. Company is ruthless about quota to the point of making some cry just for taking a breather or talking while working. Had no life outside of work because of all the overtime and sheer exhaustion. Pay was decent and loved my crew, but the Germany 1940s regime they run is too much."
bad,"Been with RA for over 10 years.  Average work week is in excess of 60hrs.  Rarely have time to go to lunch or take the vacation time that I have coming.  Even so - there is more work than can get completed in the time frame.  Many of the people or good, hard working and helpful - so that is a plus.  Job security is very much in doubt.  Model is changing favoring outsourcing over in-house staff."
bad,"Daily I would run a machine change work orders, fixed the machine if it would alarm and check the polarity on electronic circuit boards. I did learn that some of the equipment was used for atm machines. The management change while I worked there. My co-workers were very helpful if I needed help. The hardest part of the job was learning  how to load the machines. I enjoyed just learning something new."
bad,"Great working environment, decent wages; however very poorly run and there is little to no room for growth."
bad,"Es una constante que no haya suficiente personal y la exigencia en resultados es muy alta. En general la capacidad de manejar situaciones de incumplimientos, fallas etc es mas importante que la capacidad de trabajo."
bad,Management is not fair and keep a lot of imformtion confidential. The hardest part of the job is trying to let you light shine when there is to much conflict of intrest.
bad,"The benefits, compensation, perks, flex hours, discounts, are great with this company. These were the great things about working there. "
bad,Very difficult to accomplish tasks when there is little interest from superiors and bad documentation process. Work can be interesting at times but is short lived.
good,"It can be an amazing place to work, or it can suck."
good,"I worked 4/10 hr days with mandatory fri and sat. I had benifits and 401K and little raise if any.  The co-workers were always changing because moral was going down.  I was on my feet for the whole 10 hr shift, minus the break and lunch. The job wasn't hard it just wasn't going to get me in the direction I wanted to go."
good,it was a nice place to work the people were nice did not care to work with CGA services management not professional and lack of experience did not know how to deal with the emloyee
good,"Just no growth for opportunity, worked on a line putting circuits on a motherboard."
good,"Does not hire or promote from within.  Working schedule is very tight and managers tend to ignore engineers' suggestions for improvement.  Recognition and bonuses used to be good, but now they have flatlined."
good,Do not typically promote from within. High stress working environment.
good,"A decent working environment, pay was a little low, and management could have been better but you wouldn't go home hating your life working there."
good,"Too many meetings, too many people are engaged in one work, low efficiency."
good,good company; worked with operations team members who were great. I learned SAP and more Microsoft products such as Teams and Forms as well as some social media as Yammer.
good,"Very uptight, very formal environment. Overall people stayed within their own groups. They do have catering for lunch during the week which is a nice change. Clean production floor"
good,Praca super warunki pracy też  z wynagrodzeniem mogło być dużo lepiej ale ogólnie dobrze się pracowało.
good,"I worked in a remote facility so advancement was limited."
good,"I do like my job, been there 17 years. When they change the hours,"
good,esta bien trabajar ahi solo que la paga es muy poca para las actividades
good,"Great work and life balance, yet, the culture within the department I worked for is depressing. Most of the management team can be very unprofessional."
good,"Good work life balance, no career advancement, on an average good company to work with. Helpful employees in the company. Flexible in terms of work from home when required from company end."
good,"Difficult to excel in your supervisor's eyes, especially as there is high turnover at almost every level of my department. My department is also the most underpaid, historically. My peers in other departments seem very happy - they are recognized for their hard work, and receive rewarding perks and/or personal advancements/promotions for it."
good,It's a corporate environment and it's highly competitive.  You need to network and specifically develop your skills for a position.  There are many silos and it's difficult to understand who to contact when you are new employee.  Again networking helps you overcome those silos which can take a year or more to learn all the business units.  It's an automation company and they are promoting Connected Enterprise and I think the company operations can improve on using this themselves.
good,"Hired through a temp agency, no benefits, no paid vacation, no paid sick time. but it was a Monday to Friday Job that gets you through till you can find something better."
good,"Rockwell is a clean manufacturing facility that produces industrial electronic devices.  I have learned different troubleshooting techniques from my co-workers. The 12 hour days are difficult, but having 3 or 4 days off per week gives me time to enjoy my family and able to do my hobbies."
good,"Rockwell Automation at one time (not in the last two years) only hired through a Temp Agency. It took many people two or more years to make it a fulltime permanent position. Once fulltime has been achieved, the previous temp time is not included in seniority. with so many other people having been there for a number of years (when people were hired within three months), there is a big gap in seniority when it comes to layoffs. I am a good example of this senairio. I've spent the last 10+ years At Rockwell and we are soon to be hit with a third round of layoffs and I'm next unfortunatley"
good,"Old company that needs new blood and new ideas, they are overly confident in its own decision and needs new ideas and blood."
good,"A typical day at Rockwell Automation was simple; you come in you get assigned a line to work on, sit there and as the product comes down the line you insert your parts."
good,The management was not kind to their employees.  Working assembly I would get my fingers cut up from units and the constant lifting and bad height of benches made my body hurt bad everyday.  Short lunch and breaks.  Had to walk long distance to just get outside.
good,"It is a decent enough place to work. It use to be a great place... But it seems like with the new management, there is more of a punishment mentality rather then a reward mentality.  So lately it is nose to the grind stone or you loose your nose... figuratively speaking of course."
good,The IT leadership doesn’t seem to know what they are doing.  Taking the cheap out instead of providing quality system for business processes.  System is outdated and lack automation.  The business is creating their own IT support.
good,"At the end of my time there was no work life balance.  They wanted us to be on call 24 hours a day and if the called you they expected you to answer no matter if you were on vacation, in bed or traveling."
good,"The job was good and co-workers were great, but the management we had was terrible. No job security, and we were not told the whole truth by management many times."
good,"I did not enjoy working for Rockwell Automation. Just not a good fit. I was over qualified for the position. Plus they don't have opening in the Raleigh / Durham area for advancement. "
good,The shining light of this place is the hard working coworkers who know what needs to get done and can work within the confines that the business has set up to get it done.
good,"Working in RA is good for fresh graduates, you are always busy and learn a lot. The culture is very lay back and it takes a long process to make any decisions. There are also drawbacks working here:"
good,"Reviewing large outstanding balances"
good,I earned the experience and skills to learn a new machine (smt) and advance along in the company. the hardest part about this job was  being there at 430am.
good,"90 day probation I did not know about,the trainer went on vacation and did not have any one to replace him,he was good at his job but did not speak English very well. Felt he held back a lot of the training when he was there."
good,They need to revanp their hiring process.
good,"Empresa com pensamento dinâmico porem com métodos e processos s travados, Gerencia não apoia as decisões tomadas pelos funcionários, Mesmo com assim o ambiente era agradável para se trabalhar"
good,"Job security is the biggest issue, rest all is ok. Working days are ok, lot of training's, management is driven out of US, no control on country level"
good,"In a typical day I fulfill management tasks, as well as overseeing a staff of 90 individuals. Throughout the day I complete various administrative duties as well, including spend reports, overtime, kaizen and gemba walks. I also provide strong internal and external customer service."
good,I worked in the Chicago area in a temp position at a time that I was unemployed in electrical engineering. This is a good place to start out as a technician. Can learn a lot. Not much room for advancement.
good,"Rockwell is an overall good company, but many of the mid-level and  upper-level managers are ineffective and lack people skills. Work-life balance is heavily dependent upon the department and the manager."
good,"Rockwell Automation were a typical US company which bought a very successful UK business and stripped all the great products and moved them abroad. "
good,Buena empresa de talla mundial  con una cultura de mucha etica
good,"There is little to no initiative at this company anymore, very conservative and resistant to change.  Managers are in CYA mode constantly since they get vague information from Directors."
good,"My First Company, Learning Environment,Friendly working atmosphere,Got opportunity to work on different product and process"
good,"Our day would start off with exercises and a mini meeting. Letting us know where we stood in the weeks goals."
good,"The work environment is really fast paced, so if you thrive in this type of environment, Rockwell would be a good fit."
good,Longer hours
good,Work is good along with benefits. However the job security is terrible. they hire when production slows down and fire you shortly after. The youngest employee by seniority has been there for 10 years. Everyone less than was fired.
good,A good place to start your career and learn about corporate life in a multinational and multicultural environment.
good,I enjoy most of what is required of my current position.  I like that I was given an opportunity and retained as an employee.  I appreciate my job as it is.
good,"In my role, the management seems more concerned with my projections and tracking than in the actual work output. I personally find it restrictive and an inefficient use of my labors."
good,IT management turns over rapidly with new directives causing a chaotic work environment.  This causes projects to be cancelled or scope to be dramatically changed.
good,"Hard work required.  Lots of data entry required.  Great cafeteria lot of selection.  Flexible hours, not a lot f overtime available.  Management can be a pain at times."
good,"Good place to work, flexible work hours. The industry is very competitive and every has to pitch in to improve the bottom line. Hardest part of job is meeting tight schedules, and the most enjoyable part is team events that foster team building"
good,The company is pretty good. I am a contractor that is very difficult to work with. I would rather be hired by Rockwell Automation directly. I think I would enjoy my job more that way.
good,"Great company to work for. Company had some recent org changes, which caused some confusion between the managers. Overall great company awesome Engineers in training program."
good,"Estabilidad laboral"
good,Rockwell received more than 100 phone calls a day.  They provided fast and quality technical support to outside companies. The staff in the Customer Service department were very friendly and easy to learn from. The Customer Service department had a high turnover for the manager's position unfortunately.
good,"Rockwell Automation has the potential to be a great company. You can have interesting projects, meet interesting people, and pursue your interests. However, you need to stay connected with a wide network of folks to progress professionally."
good,"The work was intriguing at first, but quickly became repetitive. I worked on several different stations assembling electrical cables, air/oil pressure devices and buttons for machinery. As I mentioned in a previous review, the torn labrum in my shoulder made the repetitive work difficult to do. I rarely saw management, but my supervisor was good to work for. My co-workers were easy to work with."
good,Go over with previous shift daily work. Was a sit down set same thing every day. Learned how to get real fast at the job.Only time see or talk to co-worker is break but everybody was easy to get along. Learned to read blueprints.
good,"Six sigma focused striving for continuous improvement"
good,"One of most enjoyable part of this job is being able to work with close family and friends day in and day out. As with most corporate jobs, there is not much room for advancement."
good,"Fast paced. High use of temporary workers."
good,"Don't get expected to be promoted in this company. They find everyone from somewhere else. The HR Department is full of females on a power trip. Coworkers have that ""certain"" personality that will grate on you nerves after the first day. Good Luck at this company!"
good,"Reaalmente no es un lugar donde sea los empleadpa primero, ponen primero al cliente ,es recomendable solo por aer instalaciones comodas ,buen transporte y comedor"
good,"Rockwell Automation is a truly global organization, with touchpoints all around the world.  There is a lot of opportunity to pursue across the Organization as well as through different Departments"
good,Rockwell is currently going through some management changes in IT. They are repeating the failures of past management. While the company has many perks the expectations are unrealistic and flawed.
good,"Es buena opción para trabajar y no tener mucho estrés, le falta dinamismo en la ejecución de los procesos y en la mejora  tiene muy buenas prestaciones excelente la de la salida temprano los viernes"
good,Repetive work. Be in shape some of the drives are heavy and the cart they are on have bad casters. They go where they want. They have trouble keeping testers. I recommend getting your bachelor's. Associate degrees don't go far here.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo y comedor y transportes "
good,I worked at Rockwell 12 years ago when I was suddenly outsourced. I'm sure the culture has changed since my time there. I still work with many people that continue to work at Rockwell so I believe they still are a good company to work for.
good,It's a start up.  Good company to learn a lot. It provides many different services.  I would recommend it to others. Great culture for family life balance.
good,"Noble y amigable, enfoque en las personas. Escuchan al personal opertivo."
good,A good place to start but as an engineering company Rockwell is very uninformed.  They are really an equipment vendor so they are a bit clueless when it comes to engineering
good,I can't remember a lot about Rockwell this was a temporary position that was under a contract once the contract the position ended can't remember a lot about the position as it was some time ago.
good,Managarment is a little disorganized so it makes up by being micromanaging. Lots of millineals that are fresh out of college with no work experience so a lot of patience is required.
good,"Good mentor."
good,"Old school traditional company, lots of experienced employees. Job . security is hit and miss. layoffs are not uncommon. Not much on the social aspects of a job"
good,"Ambiente limpo e organizado, boa comunicação entre colegas de trabalho. Empresa de boa ética e bons benefícios. Oportunidades para aprendizes camp e crescimento na empresa."
good,"I worked in the company at Calgary AB during 2012-2013. I am electrical engineer in charge of project design and commissioning."
good,People and Management not nice to work with.  lots of Bullies. Management does nothing about it.  It would be a good job if the hours were not Mandatory and people were nice to work with
good,I think that Rockwell Automation in Mayfield Heights is a good place to work. The management has good support and there are many good processes in place.
good,Very stressful work environment always have to stay cautious about what going on around you. Lots of favoritism going on in work place. If not liked will be looking for reason to terminate employment.
good,It is an environment based on who you know and not on what you know. There is a lot of politics in the office which causes the problems that they have.
good,"They offer several incentives like paying education and free courses  online. The people are very friendly to talk too, and the integrated system for engineers is awesome."
good,"Overall the globally company is great, work life balance is lacking a bit old school management styles across the board.   "
good,Rockwell is a nice place to work. Just do your job and go home mind you own business. Do you best to get the product out. Follow instructions get the work in a timely manner. Chase the highlights
good,"Good for Electronics Engineer."
good,"Rockwell was well stuck in the past with processes, tools, work life balance.  Over the last five years they have been working to improve all of these aspects but it is slow."
good,Era muy largo el dia y habia cosas muy pesadas que hacer.El tiempo de comida era poco.Es una linea de produccion entonces no habia tiempo de descanso.
good,Organization that strives to create some kind of work/life balance and developing leadership in various capabilities
good,management constantly changed but I was happy to have a permanent job. Not a real happy place to work. No air conditioning bad snacks in snack machine
good,Company maybe moving out of the US and might be moving to Mexico. The people I work with  are great and I wish things wouldn't change. I have been with this company 17 years.
good,"- As a technician a typical day at work was very hectic. "
good,"Nice place to work, although, my experience probably was not the most ideal, my contract was cut in half, from 12 weeks to only 6 weeks, due to budget cuts."
good,"•	Managed and retired LAN and WAN connections."
good,"I t was good place to work in. I t was the first job offered to me when I came to Canada."
good,"been there too short to make a fair judgement. not fussy about spending endless hours in office, as long as job is done free to go home."
good,"It was managable. Once you know more things, they will make you do more than your job title requires. They only allowed two 15 minutes breaks while working 8 hr shift. Everyone leaves the same time, meaning everyone leaves like 5 minutes early and comes 5 minutes late however, this was used against me during my time at Rockwell Automation in Mequon, WI for my performance."
good,This Company is determinedly focused on the bottom line.  They do not hesitate to terminate employees if their margin wavers.
good,work at a number of places it was ok but always wanted more it was a temp sevice
good,"Although my title says Technical Analyst, for the past few years I have taken on a much different role.    "
good,ok with me and overtime was great and need more constructive ethical lead people
good,"My typical day at Rockwell consisted of repairing electronic control panels. I learned how to use their diagnostic testing machines which pointed out the defective parts in each unit. I replaced lcd panels, or any other sub assembly that was broken. Then retested each unit to insure that they were fixed. The units were then shipped back to be used in plants across the country. My co workers were very nice people and we all got along nicely. They were the most enjoyable part of the job. I had an opportunity to move to Charlotte NC and this was the reason for my short stay at Rockwell."
good,"Good, smart colleagues. Lack of work to do. I could have done all the work that I did in a year in less than 2 months. Without any challenging projects or lack of, I didn't learned much. I felt I have wasted my time here learning nothing. I worked extremely hard in my last job and felt I was under paid and appreciated. In this job, I am well over paid and appreciated. This job has really hurted my motiviation and desire to improve."
good,en un dia de trabajo normal es un ambiente bueno la experiencia que adquiri fue la interpretacion de diagramas electricos y a cablear diferentes componentes electricos la parte mas difici para mi era cablear una interconeccion de ingenieria y lo que mas me a gustado del trabajo fue el apoyo que te brindan los compañeros de trabajo
good,"Advancement is by who you know, not what you know...    Don't expect to be promoted if you do a great job and develop and implement new processes that save the company millions, because it's all about a Director's perception of you whether you will be promoted... If you have differing views than a Director, you're an immediate outcast...  Beware."
good,"Rockwell is a great place to start. The company invests a lot of money in training and compensation. There is a big gulf between employees and contractors, and the company definitely use that to its advantage. Pay is ok (depending on assignment), but there is little to no stability in working as a contractor. Don't expect to be hired in either"
good,"Great company if you have the right political connections to move up.  If you don't have that, you won't have a long career."
good,"Learned how to read schematics and wire and identify electrical components. "
good,"Releasing Orders, New Accounts review, Chasing Debt, Queries, Spreadsheet preparation and maintaining, assisting AP."
good,"Be prepared for advanced politics and gaming. Simply doing outstanding work will not necessarily get you up the ladder. However, if head games are your thing, you'll love it here. Loads of lies and hypocrisy in abundance."
good,"Rockwell Automation claims to be Agile but is the most process heavy company that I have worked for by a large margin.  They change tools and processes faster than you can adapt and there seems to be no limit on the complexity of the processes.  As soon as you get comfortable with any part of your job, they will put you on a different team, change your manager, or change the workflow.  It never ends.  This is a very social company.  If you have great ideas that could revolutionize some area and save the company millions of dollars, but you can't get buy-in from the various factions which exist, then your ideas are meaningless."
good,Cultura Lean y Buena empresa para trabajar .......
good,He aprendido a relacionarme con el personal y a resolver situaciones estresantes que me ayudaran en mi experiencia laboral.
good,"was a good company, getting worse now. cutting many positions in North America to reduce the cost. not stable any more. multi-culture, flexible working hours."
good,"If you enjoy large company culture, such as what is parodied in movies, then Rockwell is for you.  Hey look, we hired a black guy!Meetings to plan for meetings.  Meetings to review meetings, meetings just to have meetings.  Quarterly Regional management dog and pony show, and death by PowerPoint.    Expect 50 or more emails per day including newsletters for each of the multiple business units as well and HR, etc.  All of these treasures and more can be found at Rockwell Automation."
good,A typical day is spent mostly farming out workers to other departments depending on the needs of production. management was knowledgeable . the work place was relaxed but also could be stressful at times.
good,I held many positions at Rockwell Automation and was promoted 5 times in 10 years.  They allowed your creativity which allowed me to save them millions of dollars on their I/O products.
good,Everyday i learned a new skill with good helpful co-workers. It was hard seeing the senior employees leave but rewarding for the corner stone left.
good,I would go in and clock in and then report to my spot on the line which was mostly assembly where we had a screen to walk us through the assembly step by step and if need be i would be told to package the drives.
good,Buena escuela de aprendizaje pero crecimiento laboral limitado
good,"Enjoyed the daily Challenges set out to me, wrt projects. Learned something every day. Was a valuable Experience Managing the Crew, Projects, admin etc."
good,"I got lucky, because I started working at Rockwell Automation before all of the outsourcing really started.  I've been exposed to and learned about so many different manufacturing operations.  You can't duplicate that anywhere today.  The timing was great, I took full advantage of being able to learn."
good,Technical Support Engineer provide support to field  engineer
good,Working environment is quite nice. Company has a culture of quality. Values the employees and provides safety. Applied ethics are quite impressive. However the company pays really low salaries to new graduates comparing to competitors.
good,"A lot of training and opportunities to move to other positions within the company."
good,Rockwell Automation is a very important company but the grown is too slow.
good,On paper this company looks awesome but working there was purely excruciating to say the least and would never suggest this company to anyone looking.
good,"Rockwell Automation offers a challenging work environment, non-meddling management and a fast pace.  The experience was well worth it.  The staff were very helpful."
good,"Overall my memories of Rockwell are positive. Most of the people I worked with across all functional areas were great, i.e., the engineers, the purchasing agents, supplier managers, commodity product managers, strategic sourcing managers, etc. In addition, many of the people who had been with the company for a long time were more than willing to mentor the ""newbies!"" I always found my coworkers to be helpful and friendly and the suppliers were almost always awesome...given the stresses they were under. Some of the hardest parts of the job were dealing with product quality issues when a line got shut down and our team would have to resolve that issue and get replacements parts...fast! I was able to learn a lot about purchasing in a large manufacturing environment and to top it off, I was able to earn my Green Belt in Lean manufacturing with the help of two great Black-Belts."
good,"Rockwell doesn't pay as much as the other production companies, but the one thing that i liked best is it's basically clean and they have air conditioning."
good,"Typical days involved design reviews."
good,punch inn and go to station where you wire units or assemble what I learned was how to read a wiring blueprints management is a little on the to much boss side and not enough team work co-workers about the same very few focused outgoing workers the hardest part was getting wires in small parts of units with not much room to work with the most enjoyable part of my job was I got to work alone so I could go at a faster pase with no distractions
good,"Overall, a very pleasant company to work for. Some limitations if you do not have an engineering background. "
good,"Strong, experienced leadership from CEO. Solid performance through economic cycles, they do not layoff large numbers of people like other manufacturing/technology companies during adverse times. RA proactively adjusts to the changing cycles and makes good decisions to avoid large layoffs."
good,Good place to work. Fosters growth. Just dont raise too many concerns to get noticed. Great work life balance. Not a great environment for knowledge sharing between peers
good,"As far as compensation, the company provides well for its employees and the offices were very nice; we had up-to-date technical equipment and software/hardware. I also felt I had a decent work/life balance. I had several managers over the years, some better than others. The company tends to reorganize every 18 months whether it needs to or not which leads to a insecurity among employees and lack of understanding why they're reorganizing. I met a lot of wonderful people working here; they draw a highly talented and competent workforce. But there is an air of royalty and serfs and division between top level management and non management, which is usually indicative of large corporations. "
good,Rockwell Automation is a great company to work for. The benefits they offer are above average and management does everything they can to work with their employees to make the time spent there as enjoyable as possible.
good,"el trabajo es muy limpio,  sin calor de ningun tipo planta 100% climatizada transporte muy buena empresa"
good,"SCADA like Intouch Wonderware & WINcc, LABVIEW, and FT view, RS view etc. & Data acquisition"
good,"Good place to work, but it depended on the manager you had how much work got done in a timely manner."
good,"hardest part was being a temp, and fitting in with the older crowd"
good,A typical day at work for Rockwell Automation included building large electrical drive cabinets. I am very happy about learning to read blue prints and build the drive cabinets accordingly. I worked with a great hard working team and at the end of the day I really feel like I accomplished something. Unfortunately I was only there for a six month contract and I feel that management didn't fully appreciate the efforts of all the contract workers.
good,"Typical day at work could be very diverse; you will never see the same problem twice. Management can be flexible, but it is rare that you interface with them. The job mostly runs like you are self-employed without the profit. It can get very lonely and it's easy to feel like there is little support if you need it. If variety is what you like and you're self motivated, this is a perfect fit."
good,I like to work for Rockwell Automation because it good work place you can learn and have more experience to the different departments and you can improve your work.
good,"Tactical and reactive.    Excellent people.  Limited talent retention tools.  Job Security high, low rotation. Head quarters in Milwaukee.   Working to develop an inclusion culture"
good,"I learned how to use BMC Patrol at Rockwell Automation. I enjoyed meeting and working with people from Europe, Latin America, China, and India. My typical day would start @ (6:30 AM - 6:30 PM) with shift turnover lasting about 10 -15 minutes; regarding details that occurred from the previous shift. I would proceed to log on to my email account and control M."
good,"Great benefits, hours are manageable. Management are professional. Co-workers are great people to work with. Starting pay is ok. I would say the employees were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"very slow pace and boring. long hours, standing on your feet all day"
good,empresa genial de poder entrar a trabajar ahi no lo pensaria extraño mi trabajo pero por malas desiciones asi fue renuncie pero n aun no tenia a mi hijo y aora hay que ser muy responsable
good,"While at Rockwell I have expanded my  knowledge with Sap and also learned how to operate a Order Picker. However, Ideas from a African American Woman was not tolerated by Supervisor nor Management. Employees were continuous drinking while operating life. The HR are aware of many of the issues that arise in the company. The supervisor is bias due to the fact that he is an African descendent and believe woman should only obey not to think. Team work is not prohibited unless given strict instruction from the male supervisor, however the women supervisor had very little control over effectiveness and efficiency of inventory. The most enjoyable part of my job is the research of parts and resolving issues on a high demand. The hardest part of my job that the male supervisor over the shipping and receiving therefor discrepancies mainly caused by the shipping and receiving to meet shipping deadline."
good,"Rockwell is a very good company that treats it's employees well.   Company stresses career development and does a good job in measuring the pulse of the employee's satisfaction.  Company pushes for career development and advancing, but there are limited openings so there are numerous people that leave since the advancement opportunities are very limited.  Rockwell is driven to be the most ethical company in the world."
good,"Good people to work with many culture, working in warehouse, heating and AC could use some attention , not very reasonable for the type of warehouse, management and support not up to par"
good,"Work was good when we had it. But when we got slow they would get ride of me, and when things put back up they call me to come back. Pay was good but not being hired in and wondering if i would be working tomorrow was stressful"
good,Processed purchase orders through internal automated email service.
good,"Uma boa empresa, bom local, porém pouca oportunidade."
good,"They had difficulty keeping good talent because of poor management at the top.  One day, I would report to a director, the next to a VP, and the next to the CEO.  It was difficult to keep focused because of the amount of change."
good,Don’t plan on advancing where you were hired.  You must be willing to relocate.  There is a lot of talk about management listening to workers but not much action on that front.
good,Rockwell Automation is a very fast-paced environment and everyone is expected to come to work and do their job. Safety is number one. Attendance is very important.
good,Empresa multinacional americana com foco em resultado.
good,"Facility provides a strong ""family"" mindset with all in house departments typically working together to get custom orders shipped to the customer on time. "
good,"La empresa para mi es muy buena solo por los que la dirigen que se olvida del sentido de humanidad,es difícil alguna promoción."
good,Rockwell is a good place to work depending on the position that you have
good,Needed to work 10 hours a day and 8 on the weekend. Still not enough. Accountability without authority. Co-workers were good.
good,"Desde que entró la nueva gerencia cambió mucho rockwell por eso mismo decidí salir de ese trabajo espero y ya sea otro para estos tiempos"
good,"While Rockwell itself is a fantastic company, the same cannot be said about TA Leadership.  There are several issues with favoritism, where only two VP referrals have advancement opportunities, there is age discrimination and a lot of tension and hostility that comes from the top down.  Rockwell isn't aware of this, unfortunately, although the Global Voices survey has pointed some things out.  Instead, TA leadership is eliminating members who identify discrepancies and unethical behavior.  The age discrimination is what bother the most, however.  "
good,"Es una buena empresa con buenas prestaciones, aunque un poco complicado crecer dentro de ella."
good,Standard work day with bit of an outdated atmosphere.  Use of ProE software to model in 3D and evaluate product.  Cross boarder work available if willing to relocate.
good,"I was a contractor there. Great company, but the job security issue is really WEIRD. Great teams. You will learn a LOT. Good tools, Just did not pay well."
good,"Displays a practical approach to solving problems"
good,"Rockwell Automation has many talented engineers but struggles with old fashioned management and old fashioned senior engineering managers in particular. Fortunately, all are well meaning and there is little intrigue. Nice folks."
good,"Good technical growth."
good,era muito boa para trabalha aprendi bastante coisa como profissional e pessoalmente as pessoas a maioria bem companheira sempre ajudando a gerencia não era boa porque não valorizava o funcionário porque tinha gente com cinco anos de firma com o mesmo salario que entro na hora de embala os painéis na montagem de painel
good,No personal life. Poor work/life balance. Not a good job if you have a family. You're expected to work long days and even week-ends.
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work. Somewhat of an 'old boys' club, so career growth can be limiting unless you play the game well."
good,"Empresa buena, carece de gestion administrativa..."
good,It was a good place to work to get experience in Agile and Project Management.  People were great to work with.  Pay was just too low as a contractor to stay on without any opportunity to advance.
good,I would work for this company again if I had a chance. They offered great compensation and beieved in employee work life balance. I learned a lot of new technology and skills while I was there. Worked there 11 years.
good,Good company to work in PLC domain. Work life balance is good. Good management. Life is easy. Better planned                                                   .
good,Great value proposition to their end customers. Outstanding employee resource groups. Great on-site medical center. An outstanding culture of inclusion journey.
good,This is an advancing company and has many pros and cons.  They are a multi-national company that is striving to put itself first and sometimes does not think of its employees the same way.
good,"Best job i ever had, they loved there employees and family environment, but a typical day was start meeting for production, and set goals. You had your people to have each other backs. And goals were met everyday. I hardest part of the job was manutary count day. You had to count every part in the whole plant. The most enjoyable part of the job was . They were always showing apprecaition to there employees. Cook outs , bouns. Cost of living raises."
good,My role at Rockwell Automation was so varied that no two days were ever the same. I gained a lot of knowledge from the team I worked with over the eight years in the role.
good,"todo es genial ahi,  en realidad no hay nada mehjor que eltrabajar en esa empresanoobstante las remuneraciones no son muy buenas"
good,You are not rewarded compensation how you should be. Rockwell is cheap when it comes to retaining and paying for talent unless it is for there LDP programs. Then college students with no experience can ask for over 55k and get it. Even the interns make over 45k. But they won't invest in the employees.
good,"On call 24 hours.  If not out in field resolving an issue or new setup, would work in office writing code.  If you're out in the field, you're required to stay until problem is resolved."
good,"Good organization for Automation. "
good,"I enjoy working with Rockwell Automation.  The job can be very challenging but I enjoy this aspect of my role as it makes my day far more interesting.  Management are fair and supportive.  They don't always get things right but are easy to approach if any issues do arise."
good,"Aprendi toda a parte de planejamento de materiais e de produção da empresa mantendo sempre em contato com todos os setores da empresa, com dia a dia bastante dinâmico."
good,Great opportunity to grow within the company.  Can have many different experiences in one organization.  Leaders work hard on doing the right thing to development young talent.
good,I was the sole buyer in the Houston office for Rockwell. While I enjoyed the Data Entry part.eh MRP system at the time was always changing and at time's with being a World Wide Company made difficult at times to receive timely answer's to issue's that may arise.
good,This is a perfect place to grow as a team and learn new solutions in SAP area. People are very supportive and encourage you to come up with your own ideas for a smooth business.
good,"Bonnes opportunitees de developement ."
good,"Good company focused on employee and ethical business habits.  Management focused on employees well-being.  Company focused on safe working habits, life/work balance."
good,I really enjoyed working for Rockwell they had a lot of different employee involved events.  I left because the hours were to long for my health.  It was ok with 10 hours a day but when we went to 12 hours I was unable to get enough sleep. Rockwell is a great place to work.
good,"good and knowledgeable managers, great learning experience. Only drawback is that the systems and software are old with little new innovation being implemented."
good,Good company to work for. Company continues to grow and is highly profitable. Company is global and treat all equally and fairly.
good,"What i learned in Rockwell Automation is the main duties of working in the accounts receivable department  such as establishing comunication with co workers and clients, using businnes vocabulary, verifiying details in the processed invoices,  the ability to work under pressure and to be asigned multiple projects."
good,"Best and very cooperating staff,"
good,"Shift would start at 4:30 a.m. We'd first review the work order, set the line up and get right to work. I learned about parts, and about how they are placed. If placed wrong, the board would not work. The supervisor was very nice and respectful. Whatever issue we had, he would address it right away. Co-workers were easy and fun to work with. They were very nice and helpful. The hardest part about the job was having to wake up at 2 a.m to get ready for work. The most enjoyable part about the job was the co-workers."
good,I create and maintain parts in the SAP/IFS system.  I have learned that I need to keep learning and striving for my goals.  I work with a very divers community of co workers that bring their knowledge to assist in the bottom line of making the customer happy.
good,It was a pleasure working and learning with everyone at Rockwell
good,"En Rockwell aprendí la importancia del Trabajo en euipo y a mostrar disposición y sentido de urgencia ante las necidades de las personas que dependen del trabajo de uno mismo. El ambiante Laboral es muy bueno, existe un gran compañerísmo con los colegas."
good,The best thing about Rockwell is that they treated contract employees like salaried.  Always got a free turkey at Christmas.  Too bad the IT staff is now completed outsourced.
good,"Empresa,de médio porte,ramo alimentício,organização do setor,leitura de ordem de produção,distribuição de tarefas."
good,"Good learn opportunity, nice people around, potential company"
good,"Learned a lot here, good working experience. management is good and supportive as long as the job gets done on time. Friendly workplace."
good,learned many purchasing skills yet was still tied to my prior days in production doing various jobs on the manufacturing floor.
good,when i walk in the door i feel a since of pride to be a part of an establishment that not only cares about their customers satisfaction but also takes pride in the environmental and community as a whole. most of my co-worker are pleasentful and a joy to work with.the hardest part is when i'm doing three mens work and are expected to do a fourth mans job.the most pleasurable part is when conformation is given that a product has reached it's destanation without any damages or unforeseeable complications.
good,Constantly working with internal and external people to acheive results. Must have patience and good listening and communications skills to deal with all different types of people.
good,"Held increasingly responsible positions including business analyst, Help Desk Manager, Project Manager, Desktop Services Manager and Director of Infrastructure Services."
good,"Short of a lack of culture change, there are great people in staff positions at Rockwell. Good team members help make the work easier and training is highly encouraged."
good,"In general people help if your stuck, many online courses but they don't cover electronics. They are normally Health and Safety related."
good,Es excelente ambiente laboral la gente muy amable dispuesta a colaborar solo hay distintos tipos de rivalidad entre ingenieros y el comedor da muy mal servicio
good,"If you are interested in making a difference this is a great place to work. "
good,Aprender a diferenciar diagramas electronicos y conocer nuevos componentes electronicos para la industria.
good,"Most of the Supervisors are great there but some were a nightmare to work for. Gossip and drama were their favorite things. "
good,Long hours and your expected to keep up efficiency the whole 12 hour shift which is sometimes difficult as you get older ... working a 12 hour shift makes for a 15 hour day
good,"I worked with a great team."
good,"Most departments have a healthy culture but, like any large corporation, one bad VP can create a toxic culture in their organization."
good,typical day fast paced. i learned how to manage time. Management dosen't seem to care how much ot you work enjoyable part working with people you like. the hardest part is working with co workers who dont want to do rhere job
good,"Review of PT and ES technical translations. Compilation of technical bilingual glossaries. Managed translation projects working with colleagues and translation agencies around the world. Workplace culture was open and inclusive, encouraged collaboration with colleagues and management. Most difficult aspect of job was gaining consensus with regard to terminology and translation style. Very enjoyable collaboration and relationships with colleagues around the world. Learned many new tasks and how to communicate effectively with people from diverse cultures. Management promoted self-efficiency and out-of-the-box thinking."
good,Solid Company to work for. 12 hour shifts are brutal though. If working an off shift a shift differential is provided which helps. i would recommend this job as long as you dont mind being on your feet for 12 hours
good,"Um dia de trabalho com muitas atividades, quando no escritório organizando documentações e projetos para inspeção da ISO 9000, fazendo levantamento de atividades do cronograma de projeto, cobrando prazos de setores e fornecedores.Se no campo, em reunião com o cliente e contratados para levantar necessidade e possíveis atrasos e interferências. Ou em reunião com a gerência para reportar condição do projeto. Aprendi muito com gestão de projetos, uso de ferramentas de controle e programação, lidar com situações complexas e desafiadoras. A gerência muito profissional dando liberdade para aplicar conhecimento mas sem deixar de cobrar resultados e prazos. Os colegas eram parceiros, comprometido com as atividades e dispostos a cooperar. A parte mais difícil era manter o andamento de todas as atividades em dia e organizadas de acordo com a ISO 9000, pois muita coisa tinha que ser feito em regime de mutirão pois muitas atividades na correira não eram documentadas pelos membros da equipe. A parte mais agradável era que sempre havia desafios novos a cada dia o que não tornava o dia rotineiro."
good,People are great to work with. Management is so large and the turnover rate is so high at the management level that it is very difficult to get many project goals accomplished.

good,"Good work enviroment, but no job security! Managers are less involved, but over all it's a good place to work!"
good,"Great company to work for as long as you are willing to re-locate every few years.  if you have a family with strong roots in your current living area, you will not be able to advance quickly, or at all."
good,We are a big plant with more than 1000 employees
good,Rockwell is very focused on the aggressive pursuit of achieving sales objectives. Strong focus on pipeline management and penetration of target markets and driving sales initiatives.
good,"Was a great place to work.  Some managers were leaders, some were dictators and some were wishy-washy.  If hired on just knowledge and not a lot of skill set for said job the managers often fail the employee and they move on or are let go.  Personality issues seem to get in the way with some of the younger managers and older employees."
good,"Rockwell is a stable company, it has a good life and work balance."
good,"Flexible work options - loved it there"

good,"It is a fast-paced but low-pressure working environment, the compensation is a little low but the benefits are good, we have 15 vacation days plus PTOs, I only wish it could be easier to make a career inside the company."
good,Company has a sound history in its field and is full of knowledgeable people. They are focused on quality and service. Management appeared to be very good locally but was unable to determine the overall quality of management.
good,loved the work and the environment and the people but was poorly run the last year or so.  loved the benefits and perks with the company. was exciting to work for a worldwide company
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. They had a very bad habit of hiring people for a project and then letting them go once the project was completed. They had a very bad reputation for retention of employees.
good,"The company culture is inclusive,while they do have a high standard for the new hires, if you are not a quick learner and cannot contribute fast, it could be stressful."
good,The work culture is business professional yet laid back.  Everyone seems to enjoy the work and the culture is very inviting.  Great individuals to work with.
good,Served as quality engineer for process quality side of the plant.  Was assigned responsibility for compliance to the inspectors on the floor.  My job focused on process improvements.
good,Rockwell was a good solid company but was more involved in automation solutions as opposed to customer facing problem solving which is where my strengths are.
good,"Voici quelques-unes de mes réalisations :"
good,"Empresa que oferece oportunidade de carreira para seus funcionários, porém a oferta salarial está um pouco abaixo do mercado atual."
good,Ağır işleyen ancak güvenli bir firma. Ancak Türkiyedeki organizasyon benim için gerekli iş imkanlarını çıkaramadı

good,"Rockwell has product development down pretty good, and the people are generally very capable. If you seek pride and personal recognition (as an engineer) in your work, look for a smaller company. If you seek a good paying job with nice folks to work with, Rockwell is the place to be!"
good,Booking flights; running & exporting Excel reports; using lotus notes email; looking after building maintenance workers; fulfilling sales representatives requests
good,"Overall Rockwell Automation is great company to work for as an engineer. I was able to develop and progress due to the challenging, fast-paced work and helpful, experienced teammates.  I felt that my contributions were valued and that I was an important part of my team.  I think Rockwell does a good job of putting ethics and integrity first while stressing the importance of customer relationships.  While I enjoyed my job there were three mains things that I disliked.  First, we consistently experienced issues with outdated processes and tools.  Second, upward mobility, development, and raises were heavily dependent on my immediate manager.  Third, because I worked in a project driven environment with a heavy emphasis on utilization I was not given time to work on improving processes or developing time saving tools."
good,Culture is very conservative.  Sometimes difficult to fit in for new employees.  Not a whole lot of support from management to help you develop your career.
good,"Working at Rockwell is fast paced, but pleasant. Good colleagues, nice environment. Usual ups and downs. Overall, it is a good place to work. People are respected, culture is inclusive. Good management, competitive products and healthy business."

good,"This is a great company to work with where you have the flexibility of time and independence to work in your own style, to bring up innovative ideas. Coworkers are always ready to help you."
good,Rockwell is a great place to grow your career.  This is especially true if you are early career and don't mind working 60 hours per week.  It becomes difficult once you have a family and other responsibilities.
good,"A typical day at Rockwell Automations, our supervisor would read the safety letter of the day. Depending on the department you are in you go to the different work stations, play your radio, and work until the first 20 minute break. Then when everyone is back from break we stretch as a group, as if  other station need help so people can volunteer to help and work through lunch. Everybody will go back to work until lunch, depending on the line if your line is on track everyone in you line goes to lunch. If your line is behind the packer off the line takes a late lunch to help catch up the line. At the end of the day if your schedule is not completed, depend on the performance of the people on the line, the entire line will have to come in an hour early. Still get paid overtime for coming in the hour early, but if your line failed due to the machine and tester not running correctly. No one is required or held accountable for not completing the schedule."
good,"I was a contractor at Rockwell Automation and was eventually laid off.  I can't fault them for that, they wanted to take care of their employees before contractors."
good,Very large company with minimal support for field personnel. A lot of extensive travel. Very demanding work but can be very rewarding. Very little interaction with management.
good,Company is good. Balanced work life. Career growth is lesser. Free meal coupons and cab facility. Good night shift allowance. Medical facilities. Good bonus on Diwali.
good,Falta de crecimiento poco automatizada ideal para aprender a cablear.
good,"Al llegar ingresar cada empleado los datos como serian usuario y contraseña para laborar en el día."
good,"This is a good company that tries to do things the right way.  The culture promotes ethical practices.  It can be difficult to navigate within the organization as with many large companies, and you may find yourself a bit lost in the beginning.  Most roles in the company are centered around engineering so diversity of role and upward mobility has it's limitations, especially if you are not willing to relocate."
good,I enjoyed learning how to troubleshoot and repair complex circuitry of CPU and drive boards that were initially designed 20-30 years ago. These boards were no longer fabricated and needed to be repaired to component level.

good,My time at Rockwell was excellent. Now that was over 10 years ago so I can't speak to them now but my time there was some of the best of my career. There was a real sense of teamwork.

good,The job culture is supportive and inclusive.  Rockwell also supports the work/life balance.  Compensation and benefits are good.
good,Depending on who you worked for and where you worked determined the environment.  I was fortunate to have great managers who cared about my success and did what they could to help me succeed.  Great coworkers and some nice perks but the expectation is that you make results.
good,"Had many opportunities to travel other facilities, exposure to top management chances are high, ideas are always welcome."
good,"- Fortunate to have worked with a good group of people throughout my years. "
good,"Working with Rockwell has been a great learning with excellent work environment and flexibility. Good benefits. However management is not up to the mark, as they don't take interest in listening to your ideas. No appreciation in terms of good work with productive outcome. However in case if there is even a minor error, an individual is just given a feedback with a negative approach. and that  is a real discourage."
good,"Rockwell Automation  is great atmosphere, everyone is very friendly helpful; there is always an extra hand when needed.A great company."

Depending on the type of Sales Engineer that you are with Rockwell, your day is filled with customer relationship management meetings and distribution management meetings. Rockwell takes a personal interest in every one of their employees, assuring that career advancement and growth is in their future. The hardest part of the job is the work life management. In sales, your performance is truly based upon how much effort you put into your career which could lead to long working hours."

The management was very understanding when you didn't get enuff sleep for what ever reason. I liked to learn different jobs, I started out on the assembly line dropping in parts on boards, setting up assembly line, then went to operating machines, dip machine, radial machine, and a robot which was a pain.

good,The company values it's employees and will accommodate for personal life. The company in Australia is relatively flat with some limited advancement without travelling a lot or relocating. Innovation is slow and generally driven down from headquarters.
good,Rockwell Automations is a place where you can learn new things about the unknown field of automation and the relationship with big customer companies.
good,Rockwell was a great place to work in terms of environment and people. Everyone was friendly and the job was pretty layed back for the rate of pay as I have always done labour intensive work. There was often poor planning resulting in shortages of work. When management changed things took a turn for the worst things seemed to be getting worse in terms of planning but maybe that's because they were making so many changes. People have been on contract here for several years as they are unwilling to hire new employees claiming they cannot forsee the long-term.

good,"Being a project administrator, It was important to get a good load of projects but at a certain point, there were limited projects to analyze which caused the company to lay off some of its workforce. Over all it was a good experience at Rockwell, we traveled to Milwaukee from Houston with our co-workers to attend certain meetings and got training from there. The job was easy.

And working with the production floor teams to make sure the production is in full gear with great quality.
good,had to either build or test parts to be pack out to customers.
good,Rockwell was an excellent place to work. The people are great and the compensation was excellent. The workplace is family friendly but people still like to have fun. The only reason I wasn't a fan was because I was more of a big city gal and the small towns of Cleveland and Milwaukee was just not appealing to me.

good,"Rockwell is a very ethical company and it treats people well. I never worked beyond 40 hours each week, and it seemed none of my coworkers went much beyond that amount. A lot of the educational opportunities within the company have to do with learning about its products, which, for an intern with an eye on other organizations, isn't particularly appealing. I was also disappointed at the end of my summer internship when an executive's feedback on intern project presentations had mostly to do with their business impact."

good,"In any typical day I would consult with subject matter experts to update existing documentation or undertake the conversion of legacy projects to FrameMaker. My co-worker was knowledgeable, organized, and impressed me with his willingness to going above and beyond to get the facts. Management was sensible and understood the scope of what we were doing and the time it would take to get it right.

Everyday I would take inventory of my tools, and after that I would use air guns to place all components in the correct location according to what the customer wants. Next I would wire the unit according to wiring diagram, very customer specific. Once you were complete with that you would need to check the unit over for wire strands, pinched wires, and several other print to check over to make sure you built it perfect. If not done right it could really hurt some one, and often the unit would take 2-3 hours some even a couple days. I also spent time painting around building,and six months in stock getting parts ready for assembler."
