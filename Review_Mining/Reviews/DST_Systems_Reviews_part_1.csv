rating,review
bad,The company is full of young professionals that are all naive and just happy to have a job. Management is aware of this and works employees accordingly. Th only way to move up is to work work 70 hour weeks consistently for years.
bad,The culture of this company has gone down hill. Horrible management. They do not support nor value there associates. You are just a number. No room for growth.
bad,"Stress of the job was off the charts! And even worse was the corporate culture. Imagine a place where there is tremendous social pressure to act happy, because no one is!"
bad,"Don't work here even if your life depended on it. Senior management down to team leader and assistants are out for one self."
bad,"If you loved attending high school come work for this company and relive your moments. Managers are promiscuous, self medicated, and unqualified to lead. Clients are pushed on to staff without notice or proper training. When you ask for help you’re greeted with figure it out yourself. I believe this is a response from management to mask their shortcomings in the knowledge department. Many people in position of power, gossip and promote the mean girl environment. After a few months, I feel less knowledgeable than I did walking into the company. Please save your time, energy and soul and avoid this place at all costs."
bad,"The lack of professionalism from upper management through to junior staff is astonishing. Employees are not treated with respect, and taken for granted. Some managers/directors or taking two hour lunches,(sometimes longer) while their direct reports are overworked and unable to take a lunch break. The morale is low and it doesn’t appear it will get any better. Senior management is aware of the issues but choosing to do nothing to resolve the matter. Unless you’re part of the inner circle you won’t be treated or compensated fairly. If you want a job that pays you half your market value, work over 60 hours a week, no training, systems that are faulty, no guidance or leadership, take pride being paid in bagels then this job is for you."
bad,Avoid working for DST Health Solutions in the Information Technology Department! C-Level is decent but direct reports such as Senior Director doesn't have enough experience. Experience Architect's opinions are ignored! The technology department is operated very poorly!  Enterprise Architects are forced to alter a solution to fit with Senior Director's vision thus Architects can't build the correct solution.
bad,"This company does not care about the well being of their staff. You're only a number there, no one cares if life hits you there. If the work isn't done, then you are. The working hours are exhausting and last minute. You are not notified of extended hours until less than 30 minutes, don't work here if you have children or a life."
bad,All levels of personnel were committing Fraud under the HIPAA law. Falsely claiming that the claims were being processed and no reporting was completed for proper follow up.
bad,"Worked for Bfds before they were bought out by Dst,and then ss&c ,  Workers are stressed out, over worked,due to layoffs due to reorg of company."
bad,"slave driven enviroment....not accomodating to new hires who come down with illness...let go before even given the opportunity to provide sufficient documentation for illness...under my probationary period so while I understand their needs, do not believe they believed me nor gave me the time to provide."
bad,"As a private contractor , I deliver groceries to waiting customers in a timely manner. Made sure all deliveries were accurate and properly distributed. Reported any discrepancies to Instacart human resources department"
bad,I was let go after 8 years of service because the company that bought DST was no longer interested in the knowledge there and was just scraping it for parts.
bad,Horrible place to work with zero appreciation!  Every day you go into work you’re waiting for the tap on the shoulder and the walk down to HR. It’s no way to treat hard working people. This company is truly about the bottom line.
bad,"There's nowhere to go in this company, if you come in through the call center or entry level. Be prepared for a bunch of people to tell you 25 different ways to do something, but provide you outdated resources or no resources for reference. The proprietary software is garbage. Management is hit-or-miss. There's a lot of fear of change in management, and presenting new ideas is unwelcome."
bad,I loved my job for the first 15 years that I worked there.  Then things changed and management became horrendous.  They looked for things to use to persecute you.
bad,This is where you go to end your career. Everyone here is old and grumpy and they hate change. Do you like to be told to do the same thing as last month without having an understanding of what you're actually doing? Come to SS&C
bad,That entire company is full of politics. Manager's have favorites and if you aren't one then watch out. The managers know nothing about what we do therefore they can't answer your questions. Most of the co-workers are nice. The manager's falsify your numbers to make you look bad.  There are layoffs going on so why would you apply?
bad,"DST is proud that they under pay their associates. They required management to micro-manage their associates and if they didn't, they were reprimanded. Benefits were decent if you were single because the company paid for them but if you had a family, the costs were extremely high. Work-life balance was non-existent. Your job at DST is your life and if you don't like it, they tell you to quit or they fire you."
bad,"For a Healthcare technologies company they are not very fluent in healthcare, keep in mind this is a Technologies firm that has a motto """
bad,"DST's purchase of Boston Financial Data Services, Inc is responsible for my being severed from the company as of 1/31/18 as DST is not retaining any support staff. From what I have seen of the culture so far, DST does not impress me as a place where I would want to continue employment even if offered."
bad,It was just ok. Nothing special would not decide to work there again. They constantly violate your space and expect you to bend over backwards for not much
bad,Worst place to worst especially if you have a family. HR is the worst they only look out for themselves . Investor services has the laziest managers. They treat there employees like nothing  Low pay and you loads of work. The hours are not flexible and you have to bid for vacation time . Software is outdated and training is a waste. The only thing good about working there is the employees. You have to kissed everyone behind  in order to get what you want and half the time that does not work. Don't work here..
bad,Been working here 5 years average is 55 hours / week with a minimum salary increase and way too much democracy.  Upper Management is clueless and attritition is tough to keep track as employees hate the work and empty promises.
bad,I worked for dst from 2003-2006. It was barely decent at first even though they did not pay much. I did so well with the dept I was in I was transferred to the processing dept and from there everything went down hill. They told me how to do the work one way and it always came back to me from qa saying something totally different. Then they had the nerve to blame me for it! I got into an argument with the sups and managers there in that dept. Shortly after that I was let go. Do not work for dst people!
bad,Got me into MVS and good project management skills.  Everything else was negative.
bad,It is not a place to advance at and the management is very controlling.
bad,"When you've been there for 5 years and raises are so low that incoming new hires make MORE than you, you know you work for SS&C. "
bad,It started out as a good company to work for when it was Dst but when SS&C brought it it went down hill the management is terrible you have to teach yourself how to do things this is not a company you can grow with
bad,DST began cutting benefits and laying off associates.  In 2018 DST was bought out by SS&C. A significant number of associates are unhappy and are pursuing other careers this last year after SS&C completed the buyout process.
bad,"Senior management abuses its authority, The Ops department promotes people based on favoritism instead of the quality of work. As a manager, you do not evaluate your direct report. you are told the grade to give him/her."
bad,"Nothing to say....we were acquired...going through major transition.  DST is effectively no longer a company.  While it was once a great company to work for, times have changed--including the mutual fund industry itself.  As a result, we were bought out, many layoffs happened, and those left are still wondering what is really going to happen.  The new company seems to be smart and perhaps we will do very well.  It's too early to conclude that."
bad,I started at DST 14 years ago with the intention of retiring from there - it was a great place to work. Now it's been bought out by SS&C and the morale is in the toilet. There is no respect for American workers and they are actively moving jobs to their offshore sites in India and Thailand. No job security whatsoever.
bad,company is sinking faster every year. even the higher ups are jumping ship after yet another merger. most employees are looking for new jobs or unsure whether they will be laid off in the near future. no real job security. management asks for more and more work to be done as associates leave and spots aren't filled. lowest compensation increase since i've started even with the tax reform giving the company a ridiculous amount of money.
bad,"Management has no transparency,treats associates like resources, not real people. When management talks about productivity they are never talking about theirs. HR is only there to serve the corporation, beware of all HR dealings. Workplace culture is cut throat behind closed doors. Associates who get their way have leverage over management, beware. Good place to get some experience and training and then get out or you will burn out .. eventually. Sound IT best practices and principles, learn then leave."
bad,"Boston Financial Data Services is a dying company. It was swallowed by DST, which was swallowed by SS&C. BFDS used to be a great place to work, but unfortunately, the M&A activity changed that."
bad,"Whatever you do, don't work at this terrible place.  It's mind-numbing and I'm embarrassed to have even worked there.  The worst management I've seen in all of my years."
bad,"Out of all my years of working in a call center, DST was the worst. Management is bad, they are unable or just do not like to communicate. The Management Team is never on the same page. The hours are ok and so is the pay if you are in dying need of a job. I would not make DST a career."
bad,the managers do not train you. HR protects the wrong Associates. they throw you under the bus and don't want you to have your own mind.
bad,"The trainers did a great job in training......they were not the problem.  One of many problems with DST was the management.  The managers didn't communicate with the trainers in what the new employees needed to know.  When a lot of the new people got to their assigned spot and were to do their assignments, they were clueless."
bad,Run from this place!!!!! They are a horrible company that does not care about their employees. They treat you like you are in high school. They expect you to bend over backwards for little pay. Management is the worst.
bad,"Typically worked 9-10 hr. days, with no break. Enjoyed the co-workers. With the amount of work, it was hard to take any time off."
bad,They treat their employees horrible and their morals and ethics do not line up with mine. They were not honest with the items they were putting on their paperwork.
bad,I worked here for 8 years and seen employees come and go.  SS&C Technologiea does not compensate well and do not keep their employees happy.  Management has no vision for the company.
bad,"Senior Management was living and managing in the 1980's. Standards items like work life balance did not matter to them. They wanted to count the chickens every day rather than allow professionals to ""get it done"". Combative environment."
bad,There is a shortage of technical associates. So you have non-tech people updating and deleting information from actual accounts with no background in this type of work.
bad,"You are used by management from day one.  If it makes your supervisor look good they keep you around; otherwise will dump you at the drop of a hat.  Impossibly overloaded; they wring as much out of you while they can."
bad,"Day consisted of 2-4 meetings per day."
bad,"The company always wants to take but don't want to give anything back, not only in monetary terms but also in basic everyday respect to its employees."
bad,"The company was recently purchased by a competitor with a focus on off-shoring and cost reduction. Wide scale layoffs have occurred and are expected to continue for at least the next year-and-a-half. Unless you're prepared to 'do more with less and love it', best look elsewhere."
bad,This part of the company was dismantled years ago. It was a very negative work environment. I was able to move into a different group. the new group was a healthier environment.
bad,"SS&C is not the ideal place to work if you're a seasoned professional, or someone who likes to work in a collaborative environment where ideas can be exchanged and fostered. It is the company you work for when there are no other options laid out on the table. Quite simply,  don't work there unless you're at the end of the road in your career."
bad,"Once upon a time DST was a great place top work, but now they have reductions in work force quarterly. DST was recently purchased as well leading to more speculation about additional layoffs."
bad,DST loves to micromanage but can’t seem to get things together for the benefit of their employees! I was a CSR and also did other various things for the company! They treat their call center reps like children! Management refuses to look at themselves but will point the finger and blame the CSRs.  Change should start at the top! Lead by example!
bad,"Too Fast pasted"
bad,"I read other peoples comments and I would agree with the negative ones."
bad,"At first I thought it was a good place to learn and advance but once you reach a certain level you have no where to go.   "
bad,"Horrible work-life balance. Very bad compensation. The only good thing there are benefits, health, dental and vacation."
bad,The department I worked in was so unorganized and training was poor. I was balancing client's commissions from the day they gave  me my clients. This was not suppose happen until after 6 months of training. Too much expected from little training. Supervisor had no patience with new employees.
bad,very stressful without good training management is not helpful making trades daily for mutual funds
bad,There is little to no training or guidance yet high expectations of no errors. Management is reclusive. The work load results in one to work very long hours yet management say do not want their staff to work late. One works harder and faster they are given more work. Promise made for advancement yet no room for advancement. Supervisors very condescendingly & offer poor training and guidance.
bad,The greed of this company is unbelievable. Hundreds of people were laid off in the Quincy office while a few people at the top made millions. Now they are replacing them with temps making $14 an hour before they ship the rest of the jobs to Kansas City.
bad,"Communication was awful. No autonomy at all. Factory-like working conditions. No opportunity for advancement.I was laid off with hundreds of other people after a merger, while the top management made millions."
bad,"Spent all day in meetings.  On call 24 hours a day 14 days straight,  They still used a pager and flip phone for their on call system.  The whole department needed to be revamped,"
bad,"Very high turnover, management is clueless, many employees are disgruntled due to being stuck, absurd hours, horrible culture.  This review applies to the Cranford office only."
bad,Constantly moving the requirements making it impossible to obtain advancement.High turnover. Very Stressful. Management doesn't know how to motivate. Would not recommend.
bad,"- Leadership focus is on the bottom line to the detriment of delivery"
bad,This has to be by far the worst job I have ever had. If the clients they had only knew how they treat there materials. Management sucks and everyday was a new vision that went nowhere. The leads never do anything and management is fine with that. I could go on and on with what wrong with this place. If you like to get mistreated then work here. But I recommend STAY AWAY.
bad,This job is not one to have if you have a family.  They are attempting to turn a corner as far as the culture of the place is concerned but the vast majority of the employees feel as if the company is only driven by money with no care for the employees that dedicate there time to make the company successful.
bad,"Ongoing crisis management - high incidence of ""band aid"" fixes.  Average work weeks 60-80 hours.  Very little flexibility.  Poor product quality/reliability.  Company ran by managers not leaders (need new leadership to create the high performance culture Argus is striving for).  Not employee friendly - in all the companies that I have worked for/consulted with never experienced a company so void of any type of performance recognition, success acknowledgement, or employee appreciation.  Very high turn-over rates.  Extreme lack of training, support, and resources.  Many talented, knowledgeable and committed individuals unfortunately, they are often not in decision making roles and company culture is one of top-down orientation.  Argus burns out their top talent - reflected in a recent Engagement survey.  Many silos and little teamwork.  Work is complex, takes time to acquire the needed expertise, and is lost when an associate leaves so turn-over is very detrimental to Argus success.  My comments are limited to Argus Health Systems have heard from Associates that other areas in the company are different."
bad,My time at DST was the worst experience I had in a long time. The employees I worked around were very negative and managment enabled them. Management had no clue about the work we did. Hours were inflexible you never knew when you would go home. Employees ostracized those they didn't like. I was depressed working here and it started to affect my emotional state. The overturn rate was high because of all of this. Very unnecessary and stressful and stressful incidents happened.  I would never recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"Assigned to single client and never expected to move beyond the same balance sheet, just the same data and process month in and month out. Management is too busy or indifferent to actually manage the people below them, never is an attempt to improve or consolidate ideas. Office was not originally with SS&C but since being acquired it's pretty obvious that the company just acquires successful midsize US offices and then sends most of the work to India when people stateside start jumping ship. People were friendly to work with but overall no real professional setting, or culture, to keep people coming back."
bad,"Developing a career is nigh on impossible here. Even in the event that you are promoted, there are multiple corporate loopholes that say you cannot get a salary increase. However, this differs from some select people so it is a very nepotistic place."
bad,"Annual layoffs or more since 2010, emphasis on college grads or offshore resources so you get a target on your back pretty quickly.  Cut budget, run lean, pay execs extremely well and have no vision to grow the company.  They used to have a good culture and really good people but thousands were cut since 2010 and many left seeing no opportunity and layoffs coming.  I wouldn't waste my time working there unless you're desperate. (disclosure: laid off after 20 years of good ratings)"
bad,Tax group review. It is very bad management and culture. Very high turn over. This caused by bad management. There is lack of communication between management level. Managers are using do it my way management style. Avoid this company if you can.
bad,"Due to so many acquisitions, many groups compete with each other and there is no team attitude. The company offers no management training and senior managers are encouraged to ""get things done"" regardless of means. This leads to very negative and at times hostel working conditions. If you are unemployed, by all means take a role with SS&C to get paid, but keep looking as SS&C does not encourage advancement nor competitive pay. If you have a job, as the saying goes ""nothing to see here, move along"" and keep looking elsewhere."
bad,The company lacks focus and structure.  They reward complacency with promotions and upper management isn't hands on.  I am amazed that the company is still operating with the lack of focus and structure that exists there.
bad,Management is poor and there is a double standard. The work environment is horrible and nothing is done to make it better. Management is selective in who is corrected and who is not.
bad,"Management is non-existent or worse.  No clear direction as to what needs to be done, and what the priorities are.  They don't care if you stay or go."
bad,"I hated my time there. Very micromanagement, the culture was awful since it seem people like ""narc"" on others to move up. Very bad atmosphere to work under."
bad,"I have not once heard an employee say they enjoy working for DST. The company is stuck in the '90's and the management is even further behind. Although it is quite outdated, they do offer decent training programs."
bad,"Once upon a time, DST was one of the best employers in the KC area.  Over the past 8 years or so, the company has fixated on the earnings per share for the next quarterly report.  Decisions are based on that factor with no regard for long term consequences. They are badly understaffed and looking at further reductions in force."
bad,"In retrospect, i made a bad decision going to SS&C. "
bad,"It used to be a good culture and good place to work."
bad,I was super excited when I got the call that I was hired. But as time went on I came to realize that the call center is the PITS!!! You have managers and team leads that walk past you and won't even speak. The calls are extremely stressful and you never get recognized for all the hard work you do. Its a terrible and very messy place to work and I wouldn't recommend a soul to work there.
bad,You can stay inside and work out of the cold. That is really the best thing about working at this company. They also offer paid vacation time.
bad,"In the beginning they woo employees with growth and success stories.  There are very few people who move up in the company. "
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. Management is poor with absolutely no leadership skills. There is a severe lack of respect for all employees. There is also a blame culture.
bad,"The company has been sold employment there in the future is uncertain"
bad,"Even though I had the most experience and knowledge of anyone there (including my Assistant Director), there was not nearly enough staff to support new Portfolio Accounts. I had a very rough time keeping up with training them while doing my own work, interviewing new staff, writing reviews, reviewing subordinates' work, and many other things. I spent 12 hour-days at my desk and was finally drained after six months so I asked to be relieved of my duties."
bad,Most stressful job I ever had. The manager I had would scream and yell at people for long periods of time over trivial things. He was known for this hateful behavior yet nothing was done about it. Lots of unethical behavior. Lack of respect for those employees that are not in a management position.
bad,"Typical day consisted of developing and supporting Pharmacy and ECT systems. "
bad,A typical day at work here is horrible. If you have other options do not work here. There is no room for advancement. Management is terrible. Managers do not even have a degree and knows nothing about managing people. They talk to you like childen and think you are suppose to be scared of them. Could go on and on. just a warning if you want a piece of mind. STAY AWAY.
bad,"good, friendly, and helpful co-workers"
bad,"Management is distant, training is minimal, technology is terrible, turnover is high. Would not recommend. Did not learn much besides how to use some proprietary softwares"
bad,Most workers that were getting a good salary were laid off this year and replaced with overseas resources.  I expect that will continue with additional blow that severance pay is being removed from company policy.
bad,"a favorable combination of circumstances, time, and place this art school could be a wonderful opportunity for you to finally develop your talent for painting Synonyms of opportunity break, chance, occasion, opening, room, shot Words Related to opportunity play, way. juncture, pass."
bad,My review of the company is not favorable nor would I refer anyone to this company that spends more time looking at younger folks and does not try to maintain experienced personal
bad,"●	Accurately evaluate, verify, and process responses from fund sponsors and administrators to update brokerage records for clients."
bad,"Company was fined several million dollars in August of 2014 for alleged participation in questionable practices.  I was an employee from 2007-9 and in my last year there was pressured to take part in Medicare fraud.  I reported this to MO attorney general and other watchdog agencies, none of whom seemed to care.  I was fired after becoming a whistleblower and I believe I was blackballed from call center jobs in Kansas City."
bad,"She was great VP, I ever worked with."
bad,"DST FORMERLY BFDS"
bad,"Horrible Management. Dumps everything on you and doesn't pay nearly enough to put up with the amount of work dumped on you. I've had to work numerous of nights from home, or stay late in the office. The benefits are highly over priced. Depending on the team your on, it may be alright. If you get on GlobeOp...Run!"
bad,The company itself is going through so many changes it's hard to not be micromanaged. Unfortunately in my role we were severely criticized.It wasn't a happy environment unfortunately. I enjoyed what I did but didn't enjoy the company I worked for.
bad,not applicable do not want to provide information at this time now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country now is the time for all
bad,"Bad Work culture, No work life balance, unprofessional managers, performance measured by long hours worked and not efficiency."
bad,"I enjoyed learning the mutual fund industry. "
bad,There is no work life balance.  Multiple layoffs a year for the last number of years.  All under the radar.  If you have been there a number of years you better be looking over your back.  You are probably on the short list.
bad,"I worked with processing financial transactions for high dollar amounts. Being in the operations field this came very natural to me, and was something that was interesting. I enjoyed it very much."
bad,"Small company that is not organised and not focused on the employees'  professional growth."
bad,This company has since sold out to another company. The morale here was extremely low and thus made the efficiency lack. There is no room for growth and the management is very much lacking in professional skills  and organization.
bad,"Poorly managed enough to bring the company to be sold and to have its guts ripped out leaving thousands out of work and the out going executives landing softly with golden parachutes, enough it makes you want to join Occupy Wall Street.  Greed is good for the crony executives that ravaged this fine, once revered pillar of Kansas City Tech businesses.  I had 5 managers in 3.5 years of employment.  All of which did all they could do to NOT lose their jobs, and that's really all they did....really"
bad,"Don't work here."
bad,What can I say. The management is so self centered. They do not try and do what is right for the company. It is all about which vendor brings them to the most games. The IT director spent $600k of unneeded money to EMC for a subpar solution to replace a perfectly working one. HR does not care about the people. They stopped doing exit interviews for this reason. Stay away
bad,"After spending 12 years of my life at this company I came to the realization that I wasnt going anywhere. I was part of a 4 man team, being the last one left in my team and doing all the work. DST wanted to hire someone to fill the spot several levels higher then me and have me train them, instead of promoting me. I was already doing all the Sr level work. "
bad,"Need the management to not only concentrate on how to build products, but also have to look at rectifying the quality of the business/products, Appreciate and improve the existing Talent of people inside."
bad,Get things in writing to every detail.  You will be lied to.  Good PTO but you will have a very hard time getting approval to take PTO time.  Middle Managent are inept and power/control hungry.  Kids with little education or skills are put in management positions.  People bailed this company left and right over the years.
bad,The new owners are focused on hitting earnings numbers vs. focusing on employees.  They don't understand focusing on employees will in turn result in increasing revenue and client satisfaction.
bad,"This company has lost its way. It has been bought out by SS&C, and has taken a significant turn for the worse. The associates are overworked, and underpaid. A typical day includes too many meetings, angry clients, and a lot of explanations around why they won't spend money to make money."
bad,"I have been working for BFDS/DST for 2+ years now and it's definitely had a steady decline since the merger of DST/BFDS and now DST/SS&C. "
bad,Is a middle size company that is poorly run.   Very little proper communication and management is done at DST.  Its hard to get ahead based on knowledge and work.  Typically you get ahead because of who you know.
bad,"No Work/Life Balance"
bad,"DST has changed significantly in the last few years.   Management has been driven by short term goals much more than long term success.   There are constantly budget cuts and a lot of turnover.   This is largely do to many work hours and poor work life balance.   The many hours that are put in by employees are not appreciated and expected.   Poor management direction leads to many wasted work hours, which leads to low employee engagement.   there seems to be little direction and the organization frequently reorganizes as well as strategy changes.   People who have been at DST for a long time are not appreciated as their knowledge is believe to be irrelevant to the modern work environment.   Focus in recent years has been on getting more millenial's into the work environment, which is a good thing.   However, there are many legacy processes that have to be supported to meet client requirements, and no one seems to believe this knowledge is needed.  The company is significantly outsourcing work at this point and spending a lot of money to do so.  "
bad,"Horrible management unless you don't mind threats, intimidation, bullying, and putdowns.  "
bad,Management is very poor in all aspects. Client re-tention is poor.
bad,"Every minute of you day is scheduled"
bad,My review summary should give you a indication.... The overall mentality of the company is to work and shut up and be happy you have a job.
bad,"I am a former employee who left on my own for another job. The stress and poor management is extreme. A lot of unfair promotions with ""friends"" of those in power. Poor morals and too many higher ups getting paid big fat salaries for doing nothing but roaming the Internet and getting others to do their work. Stay away if you know whats good for you."
bad,"Great place to look for personal growth, but the hours were long and unforgiving even when you are salaried. The benefits were okay when it comes to health insurance. Hard to fit in when you initially start working there."
bad,"Answer phones all day for clients."
bad,"Management has completely gone downhill over the years.  There is little to no career advancement unless you are ""in"" with management.  The culture is toxic from a management level."
bad,"Normally I work quite well with female colleagues and managers.  In fact some of the better managers I've had over the course of my career have been female."
bad,Sales run the development and product. Products promised before developed.  Employees don't do any work and rarely get along. Management doesn't care about employees only their bosses.
bad,great experience. bad management. possible to get good exposure but more likely to be lost on a small failing account. paid well below worth. depressing culture.
bad,"Great exposure to the hedge fund industry"
bad,"long work days, management asks for more"
bad,"Entry level only. Culture is not great. Pay is well below market rate.People are not motivated. Clients view the admin group poorly. No direction from management. Teams push work on other groups, distance themselves from errors."
bad,"The hardest part of this job is dealing with management. They are very self centered and show favoritism as though the other employees are blind. The chance for advancement is slim to none if you don't know the right people. It's really sad they want you to jump through hoops to get the work done and then its like pulling teeth to get them to pay you for it. My coworkers were great, they were very encouraging."
bad,"super corporate, zero job security.  constant layoffs and threats."
bad,"Though many intelligent and friendly people worked with me at BFDS, I found the culture as a whole to be less than desirable.  Management seemed to have very little vision or focus and most associates followed their lead. "
bad,"I now know why management does not look employees directly in the eye or acknowledge their presents.  They literally take the ""right to work laws"" seriously.  Anyone can be hired or fired at anytime for any and all reasons. Management values outdated, obsolete computer systems and business models more.  I have never worked in a place where one felt like they were going to loss their ""hall pass"" at anytime.  There is an atmosphere of favoritism and they want you to report poor performance by fellow co-workers.  To me that is like tattling tail on the playground."
bad,"This company has a lot of potential, but because of upper management being in position too long, the company is stagnet."
bad,"For a billion dollar company the work culture and management of projects is non existent. It is like the blind leading the blind. There are no procedures or policies to follow. There is no direction, insight or feedback from management. Even so much as a hello is rare. Employees rely on each other’s experiences and knowledge to accomplish work. Severely under staffed in multiple areas. Little to no work/life balance. Lack of empathy and understanding to single parents."
bad,"This company was a good start to my career. I was able to understand the operations to the investment side of business. I have been able to get a general knowledge of how to work with investors in hedge funds, Private equities and become client facing with this."
bad,"stressful, understaffed and merit raises are a joke. upper level management expectations are too high for lack of staff and pay given. workers don't feel respected."
bad,I chose to work at DST because of tuition assistance and I really do like the hours however it is very stressful to work for specially if you’re dealing with your own mental health issues the job is easy and you do learn a lot about money insurance etc. however it’s very much so like high school and the stress level that is given off of the job compared with the hourly rate is just not worth it so that’s just my review on it. The job is probably good for 18-year-olds or maybe even college students who doesn’t have a lot of experience in the workforce field but if you are someone who is more advanced and knowledgeable on a lot of different The job is probably good for 18-year-olds or maybe even college students who doesn’t have a lot of experience in the workforce field but if you are someone who is more advanced and knowledgeable  in the workforce feel this job will probably be a good part-time  definitely  not full time for you.
bad,"used to be a excellent company not any more. Discouraging employees by chasing what you have done wrong. Bad management, no respect to employees. look for others"
bad,"lots of issues in that place - best to stay away"
bad,"As a former front line employee of more than 9 years, I would not recommend more than a short term stint with this employer. Recent sale to new company SS&C has resulted in many desultory changes. Less benefits - less vacation, more costly benefits, loss of paid holidays, loss of profit sharing, elimination of paltry $250 employee match to 501c charities, etc. Also, it seems that new hires are offered higher hourly salaries than current tenured employees! Hard to get a yearly raise, based on performance criteria hard to adhere to. Not to mention constant turnover, especially managers leaving without replacement. Managers are constantly on the phones themselves, so how can they manage and support their team? Little room for advancement beyond frontline. The facility is very nice, the other employees are wonderful for the most part. Corporate culture - non existent. Over the years many ""flavor-the-month"" initiatives but nothing lasts, nothing improves. You really feel like a cog-in-the-wheel of a machine called Call Center. Not a bad job for recent college graduates; just don't stay too long or you will become a zombie."
bad,Definitely a job you do in progression to somewhere better. Managers never really took responsibility of the team and always in meetings. Leaving their job to help their employees to the leads on their team who are usually new themselves just picking up the job in the last 6 months or so. You rely heavily on your coworkers which results to great bonding experiences.
bad,"A company that was once one of the best around to work for has become fixated on one thing only... earnings per share for the next quarterly report, and has been making decisions based only on that, with no regard for the long term consequences of those decisions.  They are badly understaffed and looking at further reductions in force.  "
bad,"There is no structure here, no one has a clear answer for questions such as vacation and sick time policy. It would be nice for the management to be approcachable."
bad,Low pay compared to market. Consistent Layoffs. No real advancement. There are those there for 20+ years who don't know how to manage people and are keeping the company back. Need to move into the future technologically.
bad,"In my experience, most managers do not work to support those who report to them.  The environment is one where management is constantly pointing out flaws.  Management does not celebrate or acknowledge positive contributions from the staff."
bad,Management style more threatening . Shorts and flip flops at the office are not professional. Hours are not too bad. Benefits are good. Open floor concept.
bad,"As a DST subsidiary, Argus Health Systems offered all of the great benefits that DST had to offer. As part of DST Healthcare Argus Health Systems was the main profit driver for the DST enterprise. This lead to many new executives touting a culture of change and speaking up but not willing to act on information spoken up on associates. Morale is poor in all departments as a result."
bad,"Constantly changing and evolving company that offers little to know job security from what it was like 10 years ago. Constant Layoffs, Restructuring, and Reorganizing."
bad,"Very challenging place to work. A lot of learning on your own, unless you reach out for help. It is a younger environment, with a lot of younger people working there. Have to put in the time"
bad,"Mangers try to treat you like a child  and walk around and watch you dont wont you to advance. managers use you  co workers fine and cool, managers not trained so they do not know how to get the work out  what associates have to do for real"
bad,"SLA driven in-house tech environment with archaic technology and out of date EOL resources that add to an already high pressure environment built on banking / financial industry where  players like to play ""pass the hot potato game"" and ""show me the money"". "
bad,"Work for a division of SS&C Technologies, HQ is Mississagua, Ontario. Management is not involved with the New York office and offers no  training or support of day to day. SS&C will never make the Fortune Best Places to Work. This company SUCKS!"
bad,"Demanding, training doesn't match expectations. No job security, executive management only interested in profit not customer service."
bad,"The company has a reputation for low pay. Benefits were outstanding, but work atmosphere and communication were average at best. Used to be a very stable company, but layoffs are growing more and more common. Definitely would not recommend."
bad,"This company is not what it appears to be. On the outside everything is great. Your team will tell you that you are right on track. You will be coming to work on time every day from a long commute and even staying the long hours. You will be tasked with multiple projects and you will meet the deadlines that were expected. And yet you will get a phone call to report to a conference room with your boss's boss sitting in the room who never saw your work or was evaluating you at all because your own boss is on vacation where you will be told that you did not meet expectations and that you are being let go as of today and given a severance package. What happened ? Where was the disconnect ?"
bad,"After the financial meltdown DST implemented a policy that, for mistakes involving lines of business with high service-level penalties, everyone involved in the chain of failure would be terminated on the spot, regardless of past satisfactory performance. No excuses. Co-workers suffer together and watch each others' backs. The hardest part of the job is being on call and handling 20 to 25 pages over a weekend, being paged around the clock. Monday after on call is a full workday."
bad,Very little flexibility on a day to day basis. Structured day with regards to time in / out and breaks etc. Adherence to daily schedule is imperative.
bad,It is a stressful work environment without boundaries.  There should be more common processes in place to assist everyone in feeling confident in their role.
bad,"Employees are overworked and underpaid. The company refuses to hire additional resources to support volume and demand from clients. The sales team has lied, and promised services to clients that are currently not available. Win the business now, and figure out the details later approach is setting up staff to fail at their jobs. Employees are being promoted for the wrong reasons and everyone knows it. Employees are afraid to voice their concerns due to privacy breaches which explains the HIGH percentage of turnover each year. The environment is toxic and embraces unprofessional behavior. I am embarrassed to be associated with this company."
bad,"Relaxed work environment.  Management does not micro-manage. Many brilliant people working here. However, the work environment is somewhat depressing."
bad,"Recently aquired by SS&C, DST culture has gradually declined over past eight years. Multiple layoffs and do more with less initiatives have turned company into difficult place to feel successful.  Too much bureaucracy and process tasks that constantly leave you feeling like a failure."
bad,"DST was a great company to work at. But as the mutual fund industry has been losing revenue so has DST.  Consequently, job security is not good as there are annual layoffs."
bad,"This company has been on a downward spiral for years. With the recent acquisition by SS&C it's just getting worse. "
bad,The best part about my job was the people that I worked with.  The work really wasn't that interesting but I had great coworkers.  It is a great place to work if you are just beginning your career.
bad,"The company is going through a lot of change.  After the acquisition by SS&C, the company is integrating and with that comes synergies and efficiencies."
bad,I learned a lot on how to be a manager. Upper-management  did not have any sensitivity when it came to staffing. As a manager I had to work with what I got - no questions asked.
bad,"Employee's where nice to work with.  Because they choose an temp service, it makes it unbareable to work with the company.  Training was not the best and they feel if you don't get the concept, then you are out the door.  They don't care about people, they only care about the production only."
bad,Worked hard long hours and some weekends.  You almost feel like a robot.  At that time management did not do there best to help you advance in your career.  Just not treated well.
bad,"Clean and convert hedge fund accounting data into risk related measures. Calibrate and simulate asset price on holding level. Calculate Var, Greek letters and other important risk l metrics. Interpolate the change of the risk metrics to the hedge fund managers base on the change of the portfolio holding and market conditions."
bad,For the first 10 years that I worked at DST it was a great place to work.  The last 8 years it just kept heading down hill.  There were numerous rounds of layoffs and a culture of fear.  The only thing upper management cared about was making the budget numbers and not doing things correctly for long term success.
bad,Learned so much from ground up and took my own initiative to learn more and thankfully met people that allowed me to grown.  
bad,"Direct management good but upper management leaves you in the dark"
bad,"Overall work life balance is great. The pay is not very reasonable considering it to be an ""Accounting Job"". Managers are not someone to learn from here."
bad,"This is again a non-profit organization with day care services for surrounding community. A typical day started with processing accounts payable, consulting with supervisor for different tasks for the day."
bad,"The pay and benefits were great, but they were the only thing that was right at this business. Management was horrible. Schedules were all over the place. They did not follow labor laws, making associates begin work prior to signing in for their shifts, were not willing to allow pregnant women to go to doctor appointments during the day, and even cut a sick associate off from using the restroom."
bad,"Work and Life, that's the exact order of what you should expect when working here. Clients are demanding requires tons of OT due to the management not pushing back and willing to bend over backwards to please them."
bad,"Although most of the people are nice to work with, the atmosphere breeds a lot of stress if you work for a demanding client. The lack of talent and high turnover put a lot of pressure on the employees who remain behind, who constantly need to train new people and take on more responsibility. Unfortunately, over a year at this company and I have yet to see any stability. Expect to work long hours and weekends, especially with a demanding client. Moreover, there is no overtime pay and the salaries here in general are usually less than the market rate. Long hours and below average pay are some of the main reasons people constantly leave for other opportunities. Probably more frustrating is the disconnect between management and the lower level employees. Management seems to constantly make unrealistic promises to their clients, putting unnecessary pressure on the lower level employees who are expected to meet these rigorous deadlines. Stress is at its highest during quarter end closes; unfortunately, it still gets busy when its not quarter end, so there is very little time to breathe. Moreover, it is common for employees to not have the time to take all of their vacation days. If you have paid time off to use, use it as soon as possible so you are not put in a position where you can not use it until the following year. The biggest benefit to working for this company is the high exposure and experience you will gain since there is not enough people to take on the workload, forcing people to learn as fast as possible and take on a lot of work, This is a company that is best suited"
bad,Research inquires for Broker Dealer. Invested monies into different funds for Broker Dealer. Quality Assurance 100%
bad,Recent high turnover in finance. Management is taking steps to improve employee engagement but it is a work in process.Many current employees have been in same position for many years with little opportunity for advancement. Raises capped at 3% for several years and no raises company wide 1 out of last 5 years.
bad,"Very disorganized on boarding process. Training was very disorganized with instructors not even showing up or giving us wrong information. One of the biggest cons was the management and team leads, I never knew who to report to because they were constantly changing."
bad,"Learning Experience."
bad,A typical day at work depended on the work load. Every day was different. Co-workers are friendly. No Job Security though.
bad,One year of employment and the only time you would meet anyone is when you did something wrong. The documentations are not updated but they expected you to know previous history for internal software. When you create documents people had issues with why are you trying to improve things.
bad,"I worked here for a little over a year but left due to the sheer amount of stress the role became. After the company changed hands constantly, watching fellow co-workers leave due to the stress, management taking my smaller team and merging it with an even smaller swamped team that doubled/tripled everyone's workload with next to no training on their clients, I decided to look elsewhere. "
bad,I was working in the call center for DST.  It wasn't the best fit for me.  I did not think that NQR scores were a valid way to review how people talked in the phone to others.
bad,"Co-workers are great, knowledgable, and collaborative.  Executive leadership is weak with lots of change that is not managed and "
bad,"Current employees were not supportive of new employees that were still in training. When a current employee was told to assist with training a couple of new employees, they told their manager ""No!"" They proceeded to make the new employees' time at DST as difficult as possible. They worked to get rid of any new employees brought onto their team."
bad,"Great company to work with, however when it comes to progression  of career and positive working environment, there are a lot of things they need to improve on"
bad,They are in the process of selling the Company and are Throwing Great employees away like taking out the trash. The regular employees that do the day to day work are fantastic hard working people.
bad,"I was first excited to work at DST apart of the State Farm Mutual Funds family (which is DST's client) my coworkers were awesome! They were truly the reason i stayed as long as i did. They made work go by quickly and they had a lot of fun activities that helped to bridge the gap of getting to know people. HOWEVER, training was horrible. It did not prepare me for the real job experience and a result of that I messed up A LOT due to lack of knowledge. Management was not organized it is very chaotic. I would get different information on how to service accounts. State Farm changed policies so much it created tension and chaos in the work place and servicing customers. The managers acted like they NEVER wanted to take supervisor calls when customers requested it. Then later down the line they started accusing older team mates of hanging up on clients regularly which was not true. They also, had mandatory over time and usually we had to work through our lunches although they would buy food it was so stressful. The benefits are awesome but the pay is 14 dollars an hour it is not worth it!  Don't get me started how they miscalculated my PTO and I had to get rid of a lot of my vacation time. I am glad to be moving on...."
bad,Super long hours of unappreciated work. Never satisfying your manager (s). Hight turn over. Poor management that makes their employees feel miserable and unvalued at work.
bad,responsible for assessing client documentation needs and ensuring those needs are met. Must pay extreme attention to detail.
good,I enjoyed working with my first boss. The second boss was not fun at all. And they monitor every single minute on their system. I was overwhelmed. They did not train well.
good,"Very disfunctional organization. There seems to be a triple project manager environment (Business, IT, Client). I'm am familiar to one Project Manager managing the entire project."
good,"Challenging positions, not enough pay, too much time away from family but they do have good benefits!"
good,"The work was fine. With the acquisition by SS&C, major layoffs occurred about 2 months later. Funny thing is, most of the layoffs were at the front-line employee level. Most managers were ""safe."" Why?"
good,"DST can be a great place to work for those that are just entering into the workforce. A decade ago I would have rated them higher overall as a good place to work, but with recent layoffs and more jobs transitioning overseas, it is not a place that you will want to try to build a career. The overall climate in the current environment is fear and distrust."
good,"The private equity services of the company are not a place that your managers appreciate the efforts, the working hours you put and the recognition from the client you receive. Hopefully that can change in the future."
good,"I Love the location its in the heart of downtown Kansas city is has its ups and downs just like any other job, the starting pay i felt was to low for the amount of work i do compared with everyone elsy"
good,Not much opportunity to progress. The people in charge of raises and bonuses are very much removed from your daily activities so there is not a lot of opportunity to show off how well you work.
good,SS&C TECHNOLOGY is a fast paced sales environment and very cut throat.
good,"Great environment at the beginning and awesome working conditions till the sell off started happening and everything that was great turned to trash. (Benefits, vacations, wages, ect.)"
good,"When I first started working at BFDS the work load was reasonable and members of management were knowledgeable and willing to work with individuals. The expectancy of hours worked were set in stone but you did have the ability to flex time and change around breaks if need be for appointments or family needs.  Over time all of those things declined, and multiple mergers meant management didn't have time to settle into their current roles before being changed or stretched to take on more assignments.  When I left the team members had very little support from management which is essential to such a demanding job."
good,"When I started at DST it was a great family workplace, that was ran by local management.  The last 5 years has turned it from a KC company to a Boston company to now a part of a larger company."
good,"This company is an ok place to be at, the work provided is not that difficult to process the only thing is the systems they have can be better. The management can be better in communicating with the workers."
good,DST ( formerly BFDS) is a stressful work place with a lack of effective communication. It is a constant juggle of reporting to multiple managers and getting very little recognition for the work done. I used to enjoy coming into work but with the recent changes it is difficult to enjoy.
good,"Long Working hrs"
good,They drag their feet for everything from transferring an employee to a new position to hiring help. Seem to promote people who dont deserve it and always let the good employees walk away
good,If you are looking for a place to start then this would be it. Salary is not the most competitive and career advancement isn't as great as other places especially if you are __ ethnicity and gender.
good,Loved the ppl and clients. It was very boring days were long. The pay wasnt great. Best part about working here casual dress code and the cafateria food.
good,"DST systems is a great place to begin your technical career supporting a myriad of clients and learning varying technologies.  I feel very fortunate to have spent some great years there using COBOL, DB2, JCL, Syncsort and other tools to support our clients both internal and external.  "
good,This company started as a small dream and has grown into a very successful flourishing company.  It provides critical support to financial companies around the world.
good,"nice place, depending on what department your in.   Layoffs are somewhat common, and rather scary.  Technology varies widely from department to department."
good,Very stressful work environment with mergers happening.  Also pay is average or below.  Management is decent although they are stressed and usually uninformed.  Rumors are where you learn most information
good,"Fast paced environment, with many challenges.  Each of which provide a rich rewarding fulfillment once complete."
good,"Good group of people to work with.  Advancement is not a priority for existing employees; they prefer to hire from outside.  Company has good ideas, but little to no follow through"
good,They would have us work from 4:00 PM to 11:00 PM or so and they would give us ONE 10-minute break and a 30-minute break.  Pay was 12.00 per hour but we would have to work very late Fridays and be in to work at 8:00 AM Saturday mornings.  My co-workers were very pleasant but management stunk.  They want you to relax and use your own words but when you do they lecture you and tell you to read from the script verbatim.
good,"Each day is extremely stressful and busy. Tons of work and not enough people due to high turnover."
good,"Hostile environment, very stressful job. Treated unfairly. The experience working for DST was an interesting experience. You learn a lot about mutual funds."
good,"No room for advancement and security has declined   "
good,"This is a new company aka Boston Financial Data Services. Company was bought out by DST Systems and then sold again in a few months."
good,"DST has some very good managers but many are poorly trained and make the job experience poor. I had good managers,for the most part."
good,"From my experience, in the few positions I've had here at DST, those immediately surrounding you can create a sense of comfort and a bond that you know can be relied on and is transparent."
good,Its an ok place to work. Too many changes and not the greatest work environment. Everyone is to themselves and management plays favoritism.Bad communication as well.
good,Processed check for major invest companies. Fed x and ups. Ran machines. Special handling of checks that could not be shipped. Communicated with investors
good,The management is not great but the benefits are great. I love the people that i would with. There are too many changes occuring and management doesn't care.
good,"While I like the people I work with on my team and I find some managers I worked under really were wonderful, overall I felt this company was being mislead by upper management and as a result It had a domino effect on the staff that did the work."
good,"Management tend to focus too much on the short term as opposed to a long term client centered focus.  This may be partially due to the fact the company is publicly traded.  "
good,"Overall it is an okay company to work for and the company seems as though it is trying to change for the better, but I am not sure who the change is benefitting.  I have noticed that over the last couple years it appears that the turnover rate has increased.  Associates who have been with the company for 15+ years are venturing to different companies or waiting to be included in the rif.  A lot of the technical roles within the company appear to be going offshore as well, leaving less room for domestic job opportunity, creating a disconnect between internal groups, and an increase in mistakes within programs/code.  I hope to see future changes that benefit not only the company, but the employees as well."
good,"Lower level management can be resistant to change, while upper level is beginning to look forward and utilize newer technologies. Quality control area needs more expertise."
good,"Disorganized company with workloads bordering on unreasonable. Management is largely huddled in their own bubbles to execute on their deliverables, making inter team projects more difficult to realize. Great employees who are sometimes under-utilized."
good,"People are really friendly here. I enjoy my co-workers and I do not ever mind to go into work, Ive had jobs before this one that I dreaded going into each day, but this one I never feel that negativity. Flexible with working around sudden things that come up if you have to come in late or leave the office for a little. Option to work from home when sick or bad weather so you dont have to take sick days is great. Compensation is not so great, , no bonuses, very little increment"
good,There seemed to be a lack of structure in management which greatly affected morale.
good,"The company doesn't seem to know what direction they are headed.   The management seems to be constantly in CYA mode.   The salary is great, but you are always worrying if you are going to have a job the next week."
good,"Any level of employees have a good opportunity to further education within the company and outside of the company. Has a great benefit package including: health, dental, vision, and time off."
good,Good people to work with. Leadership set a tone encouraging harmful competition and unrealistic expections.
good,"DST was a great company for the first 18 years I worked there. After the new COO entered the picture, who's only focus was the bottom line with no reguard to people, the entire culture changed. I feel associates only stay with the Company now due to the state of the economy. When that changes, the Company will be jeopardized and that is so sad to me."
good,The work handled by SS&C is fulfilling. As for the culture and work/life balance - it depends on the luck of the draw in terms of what team you land on. Some teams left on time everyday while others stayed late frequently. This was an ongoing issue and was being looked at closely by the leadership group.
good,"Okay company to learn about the hedge fund industry. Odd work culture and not really an environment that fosters a relationship with management or colleagues. Put in your time, get experience then move on."
good,Regards itself as a technology company yet somehow manages to make a lot of tasks manual. Often there is a disconnect between sales department and ongoing client support.
good,"Went through a lot of various management changes thus the culture is unknown/ got lost. Before the recent acquisition by SS&C this was a very old school work place with no real career advancement opportunities; people stayed there forever out of comfort. "
good,"Okay, place to work.  Not much advancement.  Good workload and environment.  Upper management not very good or have a clear vision of the company's future direction."
good,My team noticed a steady decrease in senior management support over the last few years. They just stopped caring about providing guidance on how we got our jobs done or managed corporate changes.
good,"New management is trying to change the culture, but the organization is still full of employees who love to say something isn't their job. Quality is lacking. Also, there is not a lot of room for leadership opportunities and they tend to bring in outside candidates."
good,"DST is a great job for new professionals to start out at. You gain a great deal of experience within the first year, and there are a lot of classes  you can take to gain more understanding of your job/industry."
good,"Fast paced organization but unfortunately, regulations and industry conditions are making it more and more difficult to be a sustainable workplace.  Executive team is making changes to make it sustainable but at a significant cost to the quality of work/life balance in the middle management sector of the workforce."
good,"Use to be a great place to work, has went down hill in the past few years.  They put to much on to little associates. Lower level associates are over worked."
good,Working here has taught me alot in terms of how to be efficient and coordinate myself comofrtably. However the management style here is very poor and lacks any career advancement.
good,"Meetings with core business groups to determine business requirements for new and existing applications."
good,"Experience varies depending on the department. Some groups work long hours, a lot of office politics, sales is the main focus of the company."
good,"typical work day would  6pm -11pm shift. calling shareholders on Avya systems. making inbound and outbound calls. shareholders would be informed of the changes in the stocks.I would then ask shareholders if there ok with the change and vote on their account. I have learned how to communicate with customers that may seem irritated. Management was very professional, we would have a team meeting everyday to keep employees updated on any changes on clients.  I worked with the most amazing co-workers, everyone worked as a team and achieved the task at hand. The hardest part of my job was not being to hard on myself,wanted to do better then I did the previous day. The most Enjoyable part of BFDS was the learning experience, I can honestly say I learned something new everyday."
good,New upper management that hasn't been successful in their careers and has hired non people friendly managers that are good old boys.
good,Great experience alot of lnowledge in the fanancial industry
good,Decent company with high turnover and less than competitive pay
good,"The money was great.  However it was a very stressful environment."
good,"A typical work day consists handling customer concerns. Logging requests, managing any projects that I may be working on for that day. I also handle the priorities for my customer. Conference calls are normally scheduled daily."
good,This company provides great experience and there is a lot that is learned here. Management has very high expectations for those who work hard.  Expect to work late..
good,Less fun and need some creativity on how to have fun while working. Workers should be trained properly to understand the assigned task. Salary should reflect amount of work
good,"Overall a good work place"
good,Good place to work - recently bought out and job security gone.  Management imposed deadlines that were unrealistic and required overtime to complete.  Work environment relaxed -  casual dress flexible schedules with some work from home opportunites
good,"I worked for DST for 6.5 years.  We were continuously understaffed. Senior Management doesn't care about the bottom line associates. Managers were asked to have an engagement committee for their floors. "
good,"The company I used to work for is undergoing dramatic changes and I am not sure what the company will become.  For the sake of all the good employees there, I hope they are positive."
good,"You will stay busy, but it is good work. Lots of meetings and you will find that everyone will not be on the same page. Be ready to voice your opinion and stand up for what you believe."
good,"Learned a great deal management skills. 21 years experience, team based. "
good,"This may be more of a comment on the industry.  Constantly increasing security and industry audit requirements have made it difficult to accomplish anything.  Simple tasks that used to take minutes now take an hour or more of completing request forms, planning, and answering questions from people who are mostly clueless about your task.   Security requirements result in removing capabilities that are needed to do my job, so I have to waste time finding another way to do it, or fill out a special request form."
good,"busy all day, fast paced. the position helped my excel skills. management very cool. culture was cutthroat. hardest part of the job was trying to feel comfortable."
good,"The company itself isn't bad, but the management team I had was terrible. They need dig more, and train more, before they promote people. The trainer was amazing, even though it took forever for me to get a training class."
good,"My entire department went through restructuring, and at no point have the new managers/processes instilled any sense of confidence or worth. None of them are familiar with the work we do or are interested in learning. The previous management was hands on and involved, the new management is only concerned with efficiency and ""getting the work done so we can go home."" "
good,"Used to be a great place to work until all the layoffs, acquisitions, re-orgs and budget cuts. Executive leaders are hard to trust and support because transparency is low and decisions don't seem to make sense."
good,"DST is a great place to work and get experience, then take that experience somewhere else to make a lot more money.  DST starts about $10k less than many other places in KC from what I've seen.  The benefits are pretty good, though.  The health insurance is some of the best I've seen outside of union laborers (though it is getting pricey for that coverage).  They're also commonly flexible with schedules in most salaried areas as well."
good,"Very high turnover in several departments  "
good,I think the management is awful. Not very nice and don't want to help  because they are too busy. Training is not the best. You are left to learn the job on your own.
good,"The companies stability depends on the NYSE.  Busy seasons demands long hours, slow seasons can see lay offs."
good,Answered client calls and strived to meet all their needs. Attended all classes and management training.  I was able to complete my skills in working in the financial industry.
good,Overall DST was a good company to work for that allowed employees to capitalize on new technology offerings.  The management team and employees treated everyone with respect.  The most valuable asset I took from DST was working across peer groups and collaboration with the business leaders.
good,"This is a good company that provides great on boarding (extensive training) and it has a great culture but advancement opportunity is extremely limited and they are constantly laying people off.  Benefits are pretty good and management is well educated, helpful and they treat their employees well."
good,"With this position I answered numerous inbound calls.  We spoke with the members of the different health plans and we also spoke with pharmacist.  We informed the members what type of prescriptions their plan covered, and how much the pricing would be.  The pharmacist would call for assistance on how to code a prescription or to see if a certain prescription would be available to the client with a pre authorization from a doctor.  The best part of the job was of course be able to assist both the members and the pharmacist.  The hardest part I would have to say would of been the long waiting time a caller had to hold on the phone before a representative would answer."
good,"Processing outgoing wires, preparing and distributing reports, placing outbound telephone calls to customers, receiving inbound telephone calls to customers, filing, faxing, data entry and copying documents."
good,"As a Mutual Fund/Securities Control Liaison-"
good,Good company with competitive benefits package. Good training opportunities. Promotions provided to both internal and external candidates but typically more external.
good,I learned a great deal working in the financial services industry at DST. Culture shifted 10+ years ago and the company recently was bought by SS&C Technologies (huge layoffs due to the synergies).
good,"It's an ok place to work depending on what position you want. Most job are probably fine, Mutual funds is just not a good place to work. high stress level and the people that make the rules are not the people that do the job so the rules don't make sense."
good,I really can't comment on this. I left the organization quite a while ago. The management has changed significantly from what I understand. There were a lot of very nice people.
good,"Every employee keep to themselves, not much peer interaction."
good,"25 years ago DST was a great employer.  They encouraged community involvement, career development as well as great benefits.  They have been bought out by another company who is not local to the area.  They are a company more focused on profit margins, which doesn't always contribute to the community and social picture as well as personal development."
good,"night shift is very bad."
good,"DST was a very inspiring, employee caring, and had so many opportunities until the change in leadership occurred in 2014."
good,Previous company was bought out by DST. I miss it! Much better associate appreciation. More opportunity to expand your career. DST does not care about it's employees AT ALL.
good,DST Systems is a profitable financial services company focusing upon retirement services. It is somewhat slow to adopt new technology. Leadership is changing frequently.
good,Answered phone calls from mutual funds representatives and share holders.  Kept track of the stock market daily while transferring shares to multiple funds.
good,DST was acquired and the culture is changing due to this change. The people that I have worked with for over 18 years are the best part of this company. Always willing to help.
good,"New company does not care about the ""Old DST"" or its employees.  SS&C is destroying the reputation of DST both from a prospective employee and the Kansas City community."
good,Was challenged and got to do a verity of work.  The associates there were the best.  Our management was the best at one time and the company grew tremendously.
good,"Stable company, follows mission and vision, nice working environment, etc. Great benefits for its employees and very nice people. Company is very big so there is definitely so room to advance in your careers. I went from Mutual Fund Rep. to Quality Assurance Team Lead."
good,The people within the organizations were great and easy to get along with.  Outside of the mid-line management there seemed to be several hydras running the the upper echelons of the company which seemed to leave it listless among the seas of change.
good,"It wouldn't be fair to provide a view of the company based on the individual organizations that I worked for.  SS&C is more like a conglomerate with 50+ individual business, each can be very different than the other, some are quite successful.  The commonality in my experience is they are very sales focused, which can often overshadow the employee focus, but that said it was a great place to work for and there's a lot of opportunities globally."
good,A typical day at work is flexible timing to come and go. Writing financial software for big financial institutions is pretty much a blah cause - pays the bills.
good,Undergoing a transformation and making progress in that direction. A good opportunity to meld cultures as a result of mergers and acquisitions with all that entails.
good,Good company to work for but will need to put in extra hours at times.  High pace environment.  Associates you work with are very dedicated to what they do.
good,"SS&C is a great company to work for. They treat you with respect. However, it is a stressful and face pace environment to work for. Great people working with you as well."
good,"Wide range of management talent from the excellent to the ineffective. Lots of truly wonderful, talented associates and managers. Be cautious when taking a look at specific positions and groups - management styles run the gamut. A little too much nepotism for my taste."
good,Its a good company to work at. this company has great benefits. There are multiple clients and Department. you are trained for three to five weeks in your desired skill.
good,Enjoyed every opportunity I was given to learn and broaden my knowledge.  Was a very comfortable place to work that stretched you outside your comfort zone.
good,"don't have too many bad things to say about my tenure at DST.  DST provided me with a platform to advance my career, make some decent money, and learn a lot as well, about business, company politics, as well as technically.  85% of my tenure was really good, the final year of my time there was suspect and shaky, due to my own goals and plans as well as due to a complete change in direction in my department as well as the company as a whole.  Which included a full department relocation which created even more stress not only with the job itself, but with the commute.  Cross training became ""required"" and the agenda became crystal clear.  Too much uneasiness to stick around after that. especially when its clear we wont be properly compensated for all of this cross training and extra loads of work."
good,Difficult for me to provide accurate judgement due to forces out of my or their control which impacted my ability to work.  Platform and market positions does seem impressive however and may prove to be a great place for a person of the right fit.
good,"DST was a great place to work. During the time I was there I met many great people and had several great experiences. I grew so much as a person. I learned what it ment to be a team player. I also grew so much perfessionally. I will say towards the end of my career there it because difficult to find work, life balance. The company had developed the philosophy, ""Do more with less."""
good,No loyalty amongst employees. It can be a very cut throat environment where nepotism is displayed. I have found it very difficult to watch many of my co-workers come and go.
good,"Good benefits, good pay, good hours. Ability to work from home, when approved by management.  Flexible with family issues. Travel to Quincy, MA office may happen."
good,"Good company to work for. I would still be trying to stay there if it wasnt for how I have been being made feel by my manager."
good,Good starter job - flexible schedule through school. Good benefits. In my position there wasn't a lot of growth and lack of camaraderie. Not a lot of team building
good,"5 days working, 9am-6pm."
good,"Since the company was mainly focused on the Mutual Fund industry for so long and the Mutual Fund industry has changed a lot, the company is venturing into new businesses."
good,Call center environment and lots of good people. A lot of room for growth within the company. Also everyday you learn something new.
good,"Since I began working here at Boston Financial Data Services, I have been reaching out to people invested in various companies. Some people are invested through an IRA (Roth, Traditional, Simple, and Rollover). Other people you may reach out are invested through the companies 401K plan and 403B. "
good,"Its a great opportunity if you straight out of college, you can have the opportunity to work with great people, but it seems they leave eventually as they move on to bigger and better things."
good,"Overall my experience with this company was good.  Their training program for new associates is excellent. Middle management did need more training, as they were usually so over worked that management classes weren't available to them and their associates suffered for it.  Usually when layoffs took place middle management would take the hit. The company's higher-ups talk about providing their employees with a good work-family life balance but usually due to ""business needs"" this is just talk."
good,Part time position with no benefits.  This job consisted of processing mutual fund and tax-deferred savings account transactions.
good,"Process transactions on mutual fund accounts. Maintains accounts, services shareholders. Places return phone calls and emails in regards to client accounts."
good,"Headquartered in Windsor, CT and with offices throughout North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, SS&C provides the global financial services industry with a broad range of highly specialized software for information management, analysis, trading, accounting, reporting and compliance."
good,"Responsible for evaluating, verifying, and processing service requests from shareholders, third-party entities, institutions, broker/dealer operations, or client Fund/Stock groups."
good,The advantage of working for the company was learning about the various fund products.
good,"Took calls from account holders in a modern call center environment downtown. There were lots of places to get help when clients asked questions. You could look on the websites, there were phone numbers to call, instant message other coworkers who worked for the same mutual fund, and of course your neighbor!"
good,"No room for growth so decided to go into another field"
good,"A regular day consists of researching and responding to inquiries from the client or support teams as it relates to processing errors, trends or procedures. I serve as support to my team to ensure the complex issues are properly escalated and tasks are on target for completion. I also work closely with the client on audit responses, projects, procedures and workflows."
good,"DST was an invaluable experience because of the teamwork atmosphere. I was fortunate to work with a team that was eager to share knowledge, provide assistance, and all were dedicated professionals."
good,"I work in the part time division in Kansas City, MO. Great spot and great pay for college students. Great flexibility and decent hours."
good,"Good to great benefits, decent compensation, excellent, highly talented workforce. Company is going through a transitional period, so job security has become sketchy. Used to be a great place to transition from a customer service type job to a technical position. Still a wonderful place to work if you're in a stable, profitable business segment of the company."
good,"Not the most exciting company to work for but there is little room for advancement and most of the high-level positions are filled with old-blood, lifers."
good,Very typical call center job for financial institution.
good,In house training facility offers plenty of classes and distance learning
good,"Utilized training in Lifecycle Development Process for jobs converting new clients, installing new products, or installing enhancements."
good,Culture is great when you work for the right people. The departments are different if you would like to expand your skills and/or work for different people.
good,"I worked for DST for 2 months. Training was not adequate for the amount of stress and phone calls we had to take. Trainers on the floor or PALS became frustrated and belittled trainees. Managers were good. Pay good. Benefits great! On days when not enough people showed up to work, or day after holiday we had to for go lunch and stay and work through lunch!! Free lunch, but no personal time to breakaway for 30 minutes."
good,Work life balance is very good. Less hikes and less promotions. most of applications are legacy and legacy technologies. They will recruit for one position/role and will assign for other roles.
good,Completing multiple request management requests for changing business requirements made every day a different experience. My years of service cut short due to corporate acquisition.
good,This was my dream job before the merger and the subsequent mass layoffs. The company worked very hard to create an diverse inclusive work environment that was very client focused and was good about continuous improvement in processes and education. That all fell apart after the May 2018 merger with SS&C. The mass layoffs were seemingly indiscriminate and resulted in a huge brain-drain. A lot of good people with 15-25 years of tenure were shown the door without regard to trying to keep up support for applications and platforms that were mainstays of the company. SS&C is all about financial returns. I kind of feel sorry for the folks that survived the layoffs and have to now deal with going forward without necessarily resources.
good,Last 5 years of this job were stressful.  I enjoyed this job because of the variety of tasks in a given day.  I kept busy and enjoyed my co-workers.  Pay was fair and benefits were excellent.  Towards the end everyday was stressful with impending mass layoffs and then shortly after several openings.  Felt unappreciated and overworked.  The company is now being bought...hoping they have better luck keeping employees happy.
good,I enjoyed working at SS&C because of the great colleagues and the collaborative work environment. They had very complex and cumbersome systems but there was always someone willing to help you with your tasks.
good,"Supervised the entire Mailroom.  Metered outgoing mail, received incoming packages at scheduled times.  Completed reports and audits on a daily basis.  Quick-Paced work environment, but manageable.  Management is very knowledgeable and helpful.  Great people to work with, but tough to learn all aspects within entire company (A lot of moving parts)"
good,"Very little collaboration across the deep upper management"
good,"Good company layoffs don't help reputation. I had an excellent manager and good coworkers.  Some of the layoffs got rid of bad apples.  Now cutting to the bone and threatening customer experienced with ""do more with less"" culture."
good,"This company did have good benefits and even helped me pay for some of my college expenses, and I was only a telephone rep when I started.  The pay is good.  I started out around 13.00 four years ago, and when I left, I was in a higher position and making around 16.00 an hour.  The thing that I liked the least about this job was the people that I worked with.  A lot of people wouldn't show up to work, and the company wouldn't fire them.  We would be very short-handed a majority of the time which added a lot of stress to the job.  The company does try to make it fun though by doing little group activities but the bad outweighed the good in my opinion.  This job was a Monday to Friday schedule and a typical shift was 8 to 5.  For an interview, I would recommend wearing dress clothes, but a suit would be over the top."
good,"The pay is great, but there is no training program for new hires. I was lost for at least a month having to ask for help with everything."
good,"If your manager likes you then you will have a good time. They don't really train new employees and aren't run properly. When you go to help out other groups no one knows what to do. "
good,Work life balance can be good depending on the area.  Advancement into management is limited and can be difficult to get into.
good,"10 weeks of training, was taught about 401 k, ira's, dividends, interest earned, retirement. Lot's of math and problem solving for this position. Eight hours on the phone helping mutual fund customers with their funds."
good,the managers made it difficult for you to succeed in your job and did not like to answer questions.
good,"The company is a fast paced place to work for. I have learned a lot in the 5 years being there and was promoted on June 2012 as an associate processor II. All my co-workers, seniors, and managers are fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is to get everything done day 1 as diligent and precisely as possible. The most enjoyable part is the people that I work with. Always laughing and having a great time."
good,Management and co-workers were very helpful. Opportunities to advance and try new positions. I enjoyed working with people passionate about their work.
good,Good to grow and enhance the technical skills. Hectic and challenging but leaning wise good especially during the first ten B.D.'s of a month. Gives a great exposure product wise. Sighted below par with industry standards in terms of the salary bracket. Average work culture.
good,"You can learn a lot by working at DST but you likely will learn to work with their proprietary software so that knowledge is not very transferable. My coworkers were all friendly and management was nice enough, however raises are hard to come by at DST even if you can strongly defend why you deserve one. I would recommend DST to someone who simply wants to get some office experience but if you want to grow quickly in your career I would suggest you keep looking."
good,"The culture has changed and so many great people laid off since we were bought out. It's sad. "
good,"DST is a great work environment overall. However, the pay and lack of job advancement opportunities are a bit damning. Management is fairly carefree, but it seems one can get stuck with no advancement."
good,Worked with good people and learned a lot. Able to work flexible hours and wear jeans. Was able to take training so that I could advance my career. Good place.
good,"stressful work environment, as company in middle of transition after unit sold from Citibank to SS&C. Hours can be long depending on client, my manager was very good but heard from colleagues upper management was in disarray due to the transition. Environment very com"
good,Nothing to say good or bad. It is okay..there is a lot of work and not enough employees to do it.  Hiring practices need help as do Management practices.
good,"A typical day at work would involve researching and resolving customer or broker/dealer inquiries concerning pass or pending transactions, requests for product information, legal requirements for transfers to different account types, etc."
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of responding to emails, training associates located offshore, researching testing issues for my offshore trainees, providing documentation to support resolution to testing or criteria set up issues, as well as setting up and documenting test scenarios for my own assigned work tickets as well as the work tickets assigned to offshore."
good,"Accurately responding to inbound pharmacy and/or member telephone inquiries about pharmacy processing, pharmacy reconciliation, claims adjudication, health plan benefit information, and general inquiries; reviewing, preparing, and processing paper-based claims, industry-standard claim forms (e.g., universal claim forms), or direct member reimbursements; and researching, resolving, and responding to claims-related or pharmacy reconciliation related issues. Ensure customers receive the best service through accurate and timely responses and use online systems to service customers.  Follow established policies and procedures be accountable for adherence to work schedules, availability standards, and quality expectations."
good,The is a male dominated company and it is hard to advance your career as a female employee.
good,The management is inconsistant with how they develop employees.
good,"Boston Financial Data Services is a nice place to work. Unless you're in an upper management position, the pay is low but the benefits are good. The work is not too demanding. The company would benefit from better forethought and follow through as an organization, but as a result they're always busy which helps with job security."
good,"Like any other job, this is a normal job. I've learned a lot over the years and now i'm just looking for something part time to work from home. i'm a very quick learner and very smart."
good,DST had many opportunities for growth and advancement in the past. The latest financial downturn (recession) has affected it as well. There is little opportunity for growth as the company has been doing layoffs over the past few years.
good,"I learned a lot and appreciated the mentorship and enjoyed meeting and working with a diverse group and large number of people.  Also, the benefits were good."
good,"It is hard to rate DST because i have been with them for less than one year and it was though an acquisition process. "
good,"In order to keep up on service levels DST will suspend lunch breaks. They try to make up for it by buying the employees lunch. Unfortunately, there is no price to be put on time to clear your head and tackle the rest of the day the way you started out. It also interferes with making appointments and taking care of other business matters. DST is a great company I just wish there was a way to keep lunch breaks."
good,Good company to get your feet wet fresh out of college. Management is constantly changing and changes are implemented often and it's hard to keep up with them.
good,"DST is a great company to work for when developing a career.  DST has great advancement opportunities."
good,"BFDS provided a comfortable workplace.  Because of the volatility of the industry, job security was nonexistent."
good,Good company that will provide excellent benefits. Very understanding in balancing work and personal life of employees. The company believes in constant training and development. Some co-workers are not as friendly and not always team oriented.
good,"I'm grateful for all the experience I obtained while working there! I learned some incredible core values. This job was a milestone in my career and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity. The employees (including the managers) we're incredible mentors. Unfortunately, I'd have to say they were micromanaged and under staffed."
good,"The company has an amazing culture, however the compensation is not fair for the position and the merit increase system is a joke. Even when getting high scores on performance reviews the increase is less than $0.25."
good,"Training is very informative but could use more in regards to the systems that you use. Free bus travel and car parking facilities, good rates of pay for what you do. Work is repetitive and you must have a good eye for any anomalies. All in all a great place to work with some great people."
good,"It's a great company to work at in order to learn and improve your skills, but ultimately a difficult place to work at long term.  Pay does not scale up well."
good,"good place to work, very helpful IR department.  "
good,Flexibility and training. Stong company values and opportunity for growth.
good,"Over the years, there were many opportunities to expand my experience and knowledge.  Some were lateral and some were promotions.   These opportunities were not always presented to me, but I initiated the communications.   I found that others were open to hearing about recommendations to improve processes that moved the business forward.  "
good,On the phones answering clients questions and handling there accounts. Open door policy and managers are easy going but very forward. Co-works are easy to get along with. Hardest part of the job is taking calls back to back with out a break. Being able to help people with there accounts and getting them connected with online access.
good,"Dedicated to client service but put little into staff development/appreciation. A competitive culture is encouraged, with many acquired companies maintaining distinct personalities."
good,"10 weeks of training, was taught about 401 k, ira's, dividends, interest earned, retirement. Lot's of math and problem solving for this position."
good,"I've learned a lot about product companies participating in third party websites: mutual funds, alternative investment, annuities, and plans. I took in calls from different parties such as broker dealers and financial advisors who wanted access to view their client account. This required me to do research on whether it was appropriate to give access to clients based  on their financial registration. (FINRA)"
good,Eight hours on the phone helping mutual fund customers with their funds. Management in my division was the worst I have ever seen in over thirty years. Very repetitive work.
good,This was a good company.  This was a great job to start leaning about QA and it's role in development. DST could do a better job about promoting within and helping employees like working at the office.
good,Typically there is no manager available to ask questions and when you do find one they don't know the answer. Everything is so gray nothing is black and white
good,I loved my job.  My direct leadership team was amazing.  They trusted in the ability of their team to do their jobs.  We had a fun team. We worked tons of hours and travel was part of our job.  We all worked well together and felt we had a great work family  The sale of the company to SSC technologies seemed to leave the employees without clear leadership. From The announcement of the sale until the first RIF at the end of June there was a feeling of doom and the SSC leadership did little or nothing to stabilize morale.
good,"My typical work day is reviewing day to day operations within compliance by mitigating risk for our clients as part of our due diligence. I have learned how to be a self starter and a leader within my group by initiating indiviual and group projects and helping my group succeed in completing projects accuratly and efficiently. Due to my experience in leading within my group, I have had little to no help facilitating and managing the workflow fairly within my department. The hardest part of my job is having to do so much and management not being able to handle the workload due to micro management. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I am able to work a full time job and still be able to continue with my education with no issues with management."
good,"A great place to learn a variety of skills but it's a demanding company. The organization is short staffed in most teams. Especially within the Pharmacy solutions business area, it's a transient work place."
good,"So much is being juggled at once, its hard not to get exposure to learn new skill sets. If you're interested in growing and broadening skill set, that can be achieved at this firm. Management isnt always the brightest but they work with you"
good,"A typical day would involve another supervisor and myself creating a schedule for our associates based upon client knowledge. From there FedEx and UPS would deliver the packages from over 100 different mutual funds.This was when the associates would scan in the information that was contained in the package that would then go to a virtual library, AWD."
good,Overall was good work experience but not really offered advancement opportunities even though I went out on my own and did some SQL Server training with the thought that I would advance into that type of position.
good,"Company is no longer in business as the owner has passed away."
good,Argus Health Systems is great company to work for. Some jobs in call center works weekends but I do not. We have unlimited soda and some food days....
good,For the most part we come in and there isn't a lot of work to be done until scanning is finished and how much work you will get depends on what you do or what client you work with. The management is not very attentive and are very relaxed which is good if you are a self starter but for those who arent they get buy with not doing a lot. The co-workers are pretty good for the most part there are a few that are lazy and dont do much just like every job. The hardest part of the job is if you are a hard worker and you are on a team that has a bunch of lazy people on it. Overall it is a pretty great company to work for there is room for improvement in some areas but what company doesn't ?
good,- Great experience in Global Operations
good,"Fun and enjoyable place to work, co-workers were excellent and very helpful. Lots of opportunities for learning new technology. Ability to be open and honest with management."
good,"Busy place to work at. Lots of work to do, lot to learn. Salaries are not up to market, benefits are ok. Not much fun, minimal social activities. Staff is ok and friendly."
good,it's fun place to work with limited opportunities for growth and the halifax office didnt grow much. Benefits are decent and working hours are not too bad.
good,People care about the customer and doing the right thing. Customers trust DST with their most important data and work.  The new owners are also focused on customer experience.
good,"In my 24 years of working with DST, I was given many opportunities within the company to develop my career.  I enjoyed my time with the company and was sad to see it be sold."
good,Great company to work for.  I was there 35 years and enjoyed my job and managers.  Had different things to do each day.  I liked doing the monthly reports.
good,Good Company to work for .  company is been sold to SS&C however the feed back given by most employees was good  growing with the change and the new opportunity the company will offer
good,"it was a very good place to work, with opportunity for advancements but the company was moving alot of the work for my department to Kansas City, Many of my co-workers including myself were laid off."
good,Good people but far too set in their ways to innovate. Senior management in US ignores Canadian division and will not hire desperately needed resources. Management needs to communicate better.
good,I worked at DST Systems a long time ago. From my memory the environment was typical corporate America.  There was always room for personal growth and advancement.
good,I worked in the billing department. Started as a billing specialist and then got promoted to the team lead. After that there was no room for advancement.
good,I enjoyed working here for many years. My pay increased over time. However the overtime made available to me was nearly the same as my actual  annual pay.
good,Client focus and customer service oriented. All departments try to maintain a consistent rapport with client processes. Associates can move within the company to work for other clients and seek higher level non-exempt positions.
good,"DST is a nice place to work. The only issue I have is the system problems that we face every day.  The company offers great benefits, 401k and bonuses."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationships I've built with our contacts all over the country and being able to help them with their needs.
good,Good company to work for and offers competitive salary and benefit package. Room for upward mobility within the organization.
good,"No limit to geography, product or asset class.  Must be able to manage your time well in order to be productive while pitching Alternative Funds arose the globe"
good,"Good place to work overall. Good support, good team culture. Not so much on management. Deadlines seem to be implemented last minute with not enough time to meet them."
good,"Ethos within the company is a very strong one, productivity is high. Staff are focussed on ensuring client's experiences are very positive."
good,Great job out of college. Lots of room for growth and opportunities. Challenging at times but can be rewarded. Company is always growing
good,"I have been here 15 years and have grown with the company. When I first started, we were small with about 400 employees. Today, there are about 5,000 employees and growing. Working at the company headquarters helps, knowing they won't close this location."
good,"In the most recent years, DST has focused heavily on employee engagement.  They hold periodic meetings to openly discuss work environments, forecasting, relationships, and much more.  Management is provided with the information discussed; updates to work-life have seen improvements because of these discussions."
good,"you basically pick your own hours, easy job, listen to an audiobook, do decent, you'll outperform everyone else."
good,"My job was to manage, coach, and train associates in the Defined Contribution role.  I have learned throughout the years how defined contribution plans for employers work.  For instance, how they are tested every year and how the 5500 tax reporting is done.  My co-workers were all very good people who all worked very hard.  The hardest part of the job was getting all the Plan Sponsors to submit their plan census to us every year in order for us to accurately test the 401k and prepare the 5500 documents.  The most enjoyable part was working with the Plan Sponsors and providing the high level of customer service each one demanded and deserved.  I find it very rewarding when mistakes are found and then are fixed."
good,This is a great company. However the compensation is low with little opportunity to advance.
good,I worked for DST for 7 years. Out of the 5 managers I worked for only 2 were decent. Not a lot of room for advancement unless you know managers in other areas.
good,"Processed transactions for Mutual Fund companies, wrote and updated current procedures, worked overtime when necessary, contacted dealer for additional information required to establish accounts, process transactions, I maintained high quality during my career at Boston Financial.  "
good,"I was brought in from a temp service but the company does not hire on like rolling over, you have to apply which means you can end up making less than you were making through the temp agency, if I take the job I will also have to quit my second job due to completely different hours plus take a $1.50 an hour pay cut."
good,Great hard working group of people. Freedom to work individually.
good,"I learned a lot about the market, but unable to advance due to lack of sales in area."
good,"As a student worker, my work at DST included clerical work such as filing, data entry, making copies, and answering incoming phone calls."
good,At SS&C you will get an opportunity to gain a wide variety of experience. There are opportunities to start inone area and move to others depending on your goals and aspirations.
good,"SS&C Technologies is a good company to work in. It is challenging because, we deal a lot with demanding clients. We must be able to process, interpret and post financial data within a set time frame, because it is time sensitive. There are chances for career advancement as long as you can prove you are capable. Hours are long and there is much overtime. Management is supportive and helpful. You will learn to work as a team with programmers and developers and clients to improve delivery of products. The most important part of the job was learning new skills."
good,"DST was quite the company for years.  Unfortunately, it has been sold off for the most part.  Would not feel secure working there now.  Too afraid they would close out the area soon after going back."
good,Been here for 10+ years. Stable environment in my office. Each office/department is different. PE is a tough area. Same with tax team and CFR. Ops/OTC has seasoned veterans and you can get help when needed. Good work life environment. Team outings. Job security. Pay is competitive. Strong India mirror team. What you put in is what you get out.
good,"DST was a good place to work although the atmosphere changed after the recession of 2008.   There was more of an upbeat atmosphere during the uptick in the client base, but it was tough when people started getting laid off because of the change in the market. The people were never the issue though. Always good to work with."
good,"Overall working culture is great since there is a lot of diversity. The issue is on how to train staff with new tools to use for work. Example, A programmer introduceses with new programing languege. He should be given time to learn and use the product instead of assuming that he can do it in short time"
good,"For me I had a good time there. My bosses were great. As long as we got the work done we they were okay with just about anything."

good,"If you like working for big companies where the there is room to grow and options for advancement, BFDS is for you. If you are frightened by the fact that your employer is monitoring your your triglycerides, BMI and other vital statistics as part of a new 'wellness' program that seems more akin to Big Brother looking over your shoulder on the treadmill, find a smaller employer. Keep your options open. As part of an effort to be come leaner and meaner current reorganization is silo-ing jobs so that a given job title has narrower responsibilities, which makes it difficult to practice new skills so you can be promoted. "

good,"The main thing I can say about DST is the company made changes, not company wide but to the Enterprise Services Organization, they had several employees that work remotely, the new CIO stopped the practice and made a poor decision to make remote staff move to a DST office or find employment elsewhere. I would have stayed with the company if they allowed remote staff."
good,"Generally DST has a good corporate culture and is working to improve organization and process, but still suffers from big-corporate bureaucracy and red tape, as well as fragmented groups from acquisitions of many smaller companies."

I have learned to research complex issues for customers in order to support their requests, making outbound calls to provide customers with updates or to gain additional information. "
good,"In less than six years at this company I was recognized and rewarded with significant pay increases for performance.  If you can deliver results, be accountable, earn trust, work hard and be willing to step up to the plate, there is a lot of growth opportunity.  It is a culture where commitment is expected and noticed."
good,Great experience for contractor. Great team in place. Professionals but over worked employees. Lack of training on processes due to employee overload is detrimental.

The work that I do as a 529/mutual funds processor is pretty straight forward, though some items are more difficult and require further analysis. This has allowed me to develop greater research skills and better reasoning. When an item calls for additional assistance, managers and other experienced workers are almost always available to help. Sometimes there are areas within processing work items that are a little grey and workers are seemingly expected to know when to perform outside of standard procedures, though this is rarely a problem. Since I have started working at BFDS, I have been trained on multiple different work areas and have become a valuable employee for my team. "

good,"Not like other call centers, most customers aren’t mad. Management is awesome. Work environment could be better but also could be worse. Pay is good. Benefits are good"
good,"I enjoyed my career with all of the DST companies, over the 30+ years I worked there. The opportunities to learn different business skills, from basic computer through operational and systems management were fantastic."
good,"DST was one of the better companies I have worked for. When I was hired, the company was a joint venture between State Street Bank and DST Systems. That venture was known as Boston Financial Data Services. After some time DST bought out State Street's ownership stake and BFDS officially became DST Systems.

In addition, I encourage team members at all levels to brain-storm and come to a consensus on how to complete corrections to accounts.  With a group of individuals with different skill levels, this approach not only completes the task at hand, but also is a learning experience for all."
good,"I loved this job. The benefits were great, they provided fully paid college courses to employees at the Massachusetts College of Finance, the management was very fair, the co-workers were awesome, and the work environment was fun."
good,"We have a great group of people who respect each other. There isn't any micromanaging at all. As long as you get your job done and you do it well, you aren't bothered much. Not many growth opportunities available, but mainly because people stay around forever."
