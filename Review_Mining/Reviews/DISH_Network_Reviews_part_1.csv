rating,review
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"I have seen some of the most petty and backhanded behavior from the management team. They lie, constantly. Not one honest statement was made. They will encourage you to move up in the company then sabotage your career for their personal amusement. This would be a good punishment for the most ruthless of criminals. They did take good care of the office chairs, far better than the people for sure."
bad,"The company is failing. The upper management cares only about numbers. The techs repair washing machines and refrigerators just to keep dish in business."
bad,Suck At the gummy and it makes me want a bacon cheeseburger with tots and a root beer and maintenance of disorders and their accompanying complications
bad,It wasnt the best experience beings the management and other employees were always constantly fighting over small issues and the management didnt seem to care about their employees
bad,Not a place to work if you want somebody to understand life and that people get sick or hurt and are unable to come in. I truly hated working for this company especially when I had a family death and was told I had to choose between my job or my family members funeral
bad,"They basically want you to be a robot, you have one bad call or you sound off key a little bit then they write you up. Horrible job, horrible managers.."
bad,"One thing became apparent, in order to move up and be promoted. You needed to be in with somebody good. It definitely was not about what you knew or how good of a job you did, it was about who you knew or who you were sleeping with."
bad,"This place chews people up and spits them out. Sure what they claim as far as salary potential is true if you make it a year and chances are you won't. 80% of employees won't make it past the first year and Tulsa had a 100% attrition rate. Not sure how you can have 100% attrition but that's what we were told when the regional manager asked for feedback on how this is the case. I think they only give this bonus during training they claim so they can keep claiming the average earnings in you first year cause if you make it 1 month they can then average what you would have made over the year. They promote favorites who have no business supervising then they sit on Facebook or outside smoking while they message you all day about why your productivity is so low when it isn't or tell you why isn't your save rate higher without coaching you how to save those calls. You will get talked down to by customers and superiors. The top performers are there because they're not following rules and you're constantly held up against these people ""If he can do it so can you"". Then they get fired for integrity issues and they're demonized and it's totally forgotten that the agent was held up as the pinnacle of success, it happens all the time. I quit due to the degrading way our supervisor treated everyone on my team. The site manager seemed nice but company culture is cultivated from the top so if he truly cared he and the couple managers above team supervisors would monitor the team supervisors better to ensure these abuses and disrespect weren't occurring. I have been in sales close to 20 years"
bad,"This company only cares about pie if you worked there you would understand, "
bad,"Management staff only cared about themselves and their needs. If you werent meeting perfect goals, you were cast out to fend for yourself. They set you up to fail"
bad,I was there for two years I never had any sick leave because you didn't get it until you were there for 2 years doctor's note for your kids don't count because they could just have a hangover even if they're eight the expectations are extremely high but you are highly disrespected by management and HR and customers. I would not recommend working here to anyone.
bad,Its the third party contract basis job.so there is no job security here.anytime you can get fired by the company without prior notice.so be careful to join tbis company
bad,Dont work here worst place to work. Dont pay like they should like to the customers. Need to learn how to take care of peoe more. Nothing more to sat bout this place do not work here worse place ever
bad,"Long story short watch your back. I started work there when I moved to Greenville, and got my foot in the door by doing a pre employment test. Yet, when I passed all of the tests I was starting to be trained, and half way through my training the contractor decided to get out of the business leaving us half trained, and corporate would not keep us and complete  training. Not to mention mass demotions"
bad,"After being hired early 2019, I soon realized everyone is out for themselves! There was extensive training on subjects that are constantly changing and In regards to quality control, they do not train you in depth however will not hesitate to fire you over something you were not aware you had to do to keep your job. Ok Run the other direction if hired. Money was okay but the job requirements made the money not worth the stress."
bad,"Manager would stand in morning meeting and remind everyone, ""you can be replaced, tons of ppl want your job"". He also cheated me out of my sign on bonus"
bad,after working in principal global services and AON i have joined dishtv if i talk about work culture there is no work culture here. when i joined my teammates even my department head advised me or give me instructions that here work does not matter only your good relation will help to get promotion and good salary. after working here for more than 3 years i am feeling the same your good work will not give you anything here only flattering will help to achieve good growth   in respect of promotion and compensation.
bad,If you haven’t been hired anywhere and needs quick cash go here. It’s not a permanent job but it will help pay bills until you find the job your really looking for.
bad,I would not recommend working for Dish. The Service is dying due to streaming. HR they did not care for employees just the bottom line. If you were bot preforming than you are on your way out. The GM has favorites and the company is aware and dont care.
bad,"My manager was trying to find any and all excuses to fire me, had the quality guy follow me for weeks to find all the tiniest mistakes. One manager was let go because of some shady business going down that he knew about and they basically paid him to not say anything. All about metrics, no care about tech and complex issues on every job."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Absolutely the worst 10 years of my life. No one talks to eachother.  Training teams have huge egos, but dont know anything about actually doing the jobs they train.  Management has no spine and flops to support whatever is convenient. horrible, horrible place. stay far away"
bad,"Hellhole. Low pay. Terrible hours. Terrible management"
bad,Dont work here. You will regret it. This company doesn't care about individual and puts there workers under a lot of pressure and stress. There's a lot of unfair practices .
bad,"Worst place to work, Managers and other techs were awesome.CEO horrible, Job was fun, customers great. Sales sales, you work was measured by sales, Dish is not adding new customers so you are selling to the same customers all the time.The hardest part of the job is trying to sell to someone who had a tech out a day-week-year before and it still counts against you."
bad,"Do not work here been there 5 years and finally let me go over something stupid this job has bunch of favoritism, and don’t treat there employees right if you aren’t high up in the ranks you are nothing there and they won’t give you a pay raise unless another company start taken all there workers. Also the health insurance and dental all suck like why have it then. This place overall just suck do not go here to work"
bad,"Went through a staffing agency. Was sent to Returns department . Started on a Monday, terminated on a Tuesday. Very bad company to work for. They do not explain why you are fired."
bad,"Avoid this company at all costs. Everyone is either on their way out or miserable. Benefits are terrible and burn out culture is constant, Seriously. Do not work here."
bad,Mal horario mal salario mal ambiente bajas comisiones
bad,"i will never wish this job on anyone, worst place I've ever worked. you can have a shift and in the middle of the day they tell you ok, you can go home. the training was horrible they teach you one thing in class and then when you get to your site its another."
bad,"Worst place I ever worked, the manager threatened to fire me because I was sick for two days, other security officers will spread lies about you; you don't even do any security work; DO NOT WORK HERE!"
bad,Not a good place to work PERIOD. They have no sick time or vacation time. You work LONG hours for little money. Managers just sit at the shop most of the time and nothing to help you Excel.
bad,I actually never worked for Dish but wanted to write this because I am outraged to still see them advertise on Indeed pretending to be a legitimate sales job. I spoke to a woman on the phone about this job and found out it’s a call center where you sit there all day waiting to field random calls from people inquiring about Dish only to force them to buy on the first call. The job is garbage!!
bad,"No employee respect. The whole culture is negative from the top down. The upper management is very disrespectful as a whole and have a reputation of running over people in lesser positions. The call centers are structured so that every minute of the day is planned for you, even when you can go to the bathroom."
bad,"Not a good company to work for,low paid .they had no respect for there employees. They would give people a hard time to take a vacation or any sick days."
bad,You are a resource that they don't care about.  Give me a break with the 150 character limit. the place sucked and i won't wish it on my worst enemy !!
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,They work place is everywhere nothing in order at all pay is bad for the hours u work the managers dont teach u much h u get thrown in the field with no experience at all
bad,I have already worked there they are rude and I had many issues I would never consider going back. I don't have anything else to say about Dish I can only hope that the company does continue on.
bad,"Raises are dependent on a matrix of which you have no control over. The management is horrible and if you don’t sell then you won’t be there long. Dish is a company that will talk horribly to their employees at least in the Fairmont WV office, and the head manager will say very inappropriate things to you."
bad,Management was an atrocity. Unqualified so called team leaders who don’t take the time to help or encourage employees. Customers were rude and ignorant as was management
bad,Not what you do but who you know at Dish. Management is a joke and promotes based on who they're friends with. Hard workers are overlooked and taken advantage of.
bad,I didn’t care for the environment. Lots of verbal abuse while management just watched but did nothing.  It was not a great experience. It’s not a job for everyone.
bad,Dish doesn't care about employees that have longevity you are just a number and that's how the company is run by running numbers. Very stressful not only do you have to put up with customers cussing at you but then management harass you for not meeting your metrics. The company has change and it's no longer a good environment it more like micro management so if you aren't at par you will be fired.
bad,"I have been in this industry for 20 yrs I was originally hired on with DRS then the office was taken over by dish"
bad,A day at dish is being bombarded with emails over what your not selling. . You are setup for failure . Do not believe what you hear in the meetings or interviews . Upper management is is a joke especially the GM. You can spot him easily . He's the one that looks at the techs like there no good and they are worth nothing. Hardest part of the job is the upper management.
bad,Pay was good if u could hit comission. They play favorites and if ur not making them the amount of money they need u to make theyll make any excuse to fire u terrible place!
bad,"No valoran a su capital humano, son desechables, malos salarios, poca capacitación, sin motivadores, mala administración de grupos externos e internos, jamás volvería a trabajar con ellos."
bad,"This company used to be a great place to work, but in the last few years it has slowly declined in personnel and quality of life. I think that they are not going in the right direction for the employees or the future of the company."
bad,Dont waste your time working at dish. Over worked under paid. Dont care about employees. 10-15 hour days. Terrible management. Will hire anyone who walks through the door now.
bad,👎bad not really good job   They need to work out  better  no respect for hard work always is something wrong with everyone  please do not apply for this job you will be lost you time
bad,"Training is TERRIBLE, MANAGEMENT EVEN MORE TERRIBLE NO CARES OR TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY BUT PUSHES IT  OFF! Technicians are SALESMAN NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS THEY LIE TO YOU! YOU WILL BE WRITEN UP FIRED HARASSED OVER SALES WHEN YOUR A Tech First They will fire you for not doing that well when there training is driven around sales  oh yeah don’t get hurt at work they will lie big time and do whatever so you can’t get health care or compensates so have a lawyer ready save yourself the time DONT DO IT DONT TAKE THE JOB!!!! Your worth more!"
bad,The pay sucks. In order to even make a decent pay check you had to sell 2000 dollars of smart home sales and that only gives you 10 hours of pto that you can cash out or use as vacation days.  And they would take money out of your checks and not give an explanation on why
bad,"Long hours and sales are king. The positive part is having a van, equipment and uniforms at no cost. Management is very stressed, which rolls over into the technicians. Equipment is hard to come by."
bad,' This was long hours and it kept me away from my family and had to crawl dirty filthy basements and attics spaces and have to work in pouring rain climbing ladders and no training!!!!  And they gave me a Van to use that was roach infested.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,They have favorites its not what you know  its who's butt you kiss! There a whole year no raises unless they want you to have one doesn't  matter how hard you work!
bad,One of the worst places I've ever worked. A lot of bullying a shaming involved. Little coaching and the management is very disconnected from their employees.
bad,"Everyone is disposable and replaceable.  There is no loyalty, no security. Dish thrives on the turn over. If they can get at least three months out of you then they have succeeded."
bad,Horrible !  Litteraly no stability the managers would find any flaw and fire you for no reason.  Managers would take advantage of their position to harrass employees or to see who they liked or not that would depend on you moving up. Were forced to work over time and you get to a level where you cannot get time off even if its an emergency
bad,"Dish won't bother to tell you that A Customer Service rep, the job you ostensibly applied for, is almost completely centered around selling additional channels and packages to the customer, with actual customer service being a secondary concern. If you're not the hard hustle type, and more inclined to be helpful or technical oriented, it doesn't matter. You can't be put into those departments (yes, you would have to re-route into other departments to do the actual service) until you've slogged enough hours into sales. You're treated like garbage for taking your sick days, you'll get taught high-pressure sales tactics and then penalized if you don't feel comfortable using them, innovations, suggestions, and feedback is all discouraged. "
bad,"very low work culture and work life balance. hiring practices could use a lot of work, the tests that they do onsite don't have any relevance after about a year, because in tech the talent gets groomed and typically learns new skills. The tests don't account on that and the hiring managers default to their results"
bad,low pay long hours poor management high expectations with low to no pay incentives the job was literally the worse ive ever had. You are hired as a technician but expected to be a salesman for nothing no commission for your efforts and if you dont sell at the rate they expect out the door you go. Its a dying industry wont be here in 5-10 years and that is actually a relief to me they deserve every thing that comes to them
bad,"Dish will lure you into taking the position promising that you will grow with the company into a nice career but will not promote the most deserving or hardest workers. They will only promote people that say ""Yes"" to everything and that management gets along with in a social setting outside of the workplace."
bad,This company demands a certain level of commitment that most people cannot provide. Technicians are overworked and underpaid. If you apply be ready to be a salesman first and a technician never.
bad,"This place is terrible, do not work here. Managers are liars and do not care about their employees. Being a top salesman and they still treat you like dirt. The best manager quit during my time there because he was tired of how upper management was treating his techs. This place is horrible. NO JOB SECURITY AT ALL. Managers never did this line of work and are clueless. Pay sucks for what you have to deal with. Good luck selling a $750 sound systems that sucks to someone who just paid a lot to get tv in the first place. ONCE AGAIN DO NOT WORK HERE HEED MY WARNING."
bad,"Stay away as far away as you can."
bad,"I am not a disgruntled employee, because not only did I enjoy my work, I would have continued to do it under different circumstances. The management is highly hostile that will harass you every second of your work day to increase sales and increase your speed. If you were a technician like me who was excellent at their job, you were harassed even more. The better you do also, the more hours that were expected of you, some weeks I was pulling 55-60 hours a week. I had repeatedly down 14 hour days. You come home smelling seriously bad, you have to work in the rain, you will crawl in the most god awful places and you will get sick continuously from moisture under the house. This is a sales position, by the way, it says technician, but I have seen technicians fired for not reaching sales quotas. I was not one, I actually performed exceptionally in all parts of this job. This is why i left, i will not be good at something, and then reprimanded when I do the first little thing wrong."
bad,"this company only cares about selling, all there items for sale are overpriced and they will fire you if you don’t sell, they will write you up if your not forcing your customer to sit through a demo of there horrible polk audio system. There training is horrible they teach you the wrong and lazy way to install. They also expect you to ware full ppe every time you touch a tool or they’ll write you up, that includes a hard hat, gloves and safety glasses. Really can’t say enough bad things about this company and there working on eliminating the technician may be a few years"
bad,"The absolute worse company I have ever came in contact with. Their products are horrible and they treat their customers really bad. They say they have an award in customer service.....well they paid someone off for that because there is NO WAY any customer would rate them high in service. "
bad,Nobody was safe at Dish. They do not believe in loyalty and they will find any reason to get rid of you. They only care of themselves and management doesn’t care if you had a baby or got married or had a flat tire. We had a guy die on the job and they management team only talked about numbers during the funeral.
bad,The pay is good but there is a reason the pay is very high comparably speaking.  The environment is very high stress high demand with most leadership not having a true grasp on management
bad,"If you like selling things and installing jobs that are in houses that should be condemned, by all means, apply. However, if you actually realize the work load is heavier than the pay, you're smart to ignore this place."
bad,Poor management - culture is geared toward who you know not who is the best person for the job. Will over work anyone who shows a little bit of getting ahead - will try to claw back earned income by pressuring the compliance team to find mistakes in performance.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,this place is crazy. I think that they could do more for the employees that work there butts off. I worked for the company for almost five years and then 2 weeks before my 5th year there they laid me off
bad,"I worked at DISH Network in Suwannee, at the Warehouse. All your breaks are timed and no grace period. Not only that, they didn’t care if you were sick, you have to make production. Pay was only $10.50 for 10 hour shifts. The ONLY thing I loved was having Monday’s off. Other than that, I would not recommend anyone to work here unless it’s temporary.  Management was sexually harassing me alllll the time which was very uncomfortable. Even the tech people flirt with you. Awful and unprofessional!"
bad,pay sucks if you dont sell 30 dollars on every work order ypur behind hounded if the customer calls back in within 5 days they take 20 dollars from you for that job its piece rate no guaranteed salary
bad,don't care about you just the money always change your work line up throughout the day outside in all weather from -20 to 120 they do pay for training but you must travel out of state for weeks at a time
bad,Best practices are not followed or encouraged.... operates on a burn and churn business model.  Pay is on the low end and systems and tools are not easy to use nor are they clean and up to date
bad,"Very bad, not a place to grow, just a popularity place to work.  Its is not a good place for a long time career, very bad place to work....can't stress enough, stay away they will smile at you to get you in but then its all over you will die there in a bad way."
bad,"I was told if you had nothing nice to say, dont say anything at all. It started out great but then after a CEO change the company went downhill. i would not recommend working here"
bad,"Just an overall stressful place to work, everyday wen you go home your job is not done , you have to come up with ways that can help you sell people hundreds of dollars worth of stuff while your main goal is to set up their t.v."
bad,"Worked at the corporate office located in Englewood, CO.  Commercial Department.  Incredibly stupid place - not a single qualified manager, every manager there is only a manager because the company prefers to hire internally.  As a result you get a bunch of disinterested, under-qualified ""leaders"" who only decided to become manager because they've already worked there for a few years (god knows why) and if they're manager they can get paid a little more.  Nevermind leadership skills, or critical thought, or proactive thinking, or any kind of involvement besides the occasional no-context ""correction"" of their employees, who often aren't trained or they're ""sold"" on a job description that isn't even close to what the actual job is.  This place is sinking and with all of it's unqualified leaders and thoughtless decisions and 'short term convenience over longterm solutions' attitude - it deserves to sink. This business won't be around in 5 to 10 years, it's too poorly run."
bad,The worst place to work for.i would work 60 plus hours a week an never see my wife and kides but one day a week. They would have me driving over 200 miles a day all over noutheast indiana and north west Ohio. I would start at 7:15 a and not get home untill 10 or 11pm.
bad,they don't want you to stay to long. they don't want to give you more money. You hit the ground running. very fast pace. Supervisors don't help in coordinating technicians and areas
bad,Fun job you learn something new everyday the managers were very strict there was never any room for error i worked there as long as i could but eventually left as well
bad,FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO WORK !!!!! Terrible pay raises. Forced to sell items in customers home. extreme weather conditions. mandatory overtime. again....forced to sell items ....
bad,"If you like being told that selling a sound bar is more important than being an actual technician then this job is for you. But for the majority of us this is not the case I've worked for dish for 5 years, they do not give raises for more certification work, all you hear about is sales, your constantly wondering how long you'll have a job because they can and will find any reason to fire someone they dont like, it's very political in moving out of the tech field to management, you basically have to be friends with the people above you to move up at all. The metrics are so skewed its almost impossible to hit the numbers. Management cares more about what time they get off than the techs, its supposed to be a 4 day a week 10 hour day job but it's either super dead in the winter or so busy they run you into the dirt on ""mandatory 5th days"" during the summer, the company doesn't care if your good at your job as a tech as long as you can sell customers things they really dont care about or want. It's awful and I'm doing everything in my power to leave and let other people know to steer far clear of dish and anything to do with this company, it's literally the worst job you could take."
bad,"Heavy-handed management, low pay, veiled threats of termination almost daily if you refused to treat the customers like animals."
bad,"stressful sales job, no room for growth, mandatory overtime, not a friendly environment, dead end joob. I wouldnt recommend this job to anyone. Its a revolving door there."
bad,"worst job "
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Absolute worse job I have every had.  If there is sever weather, they don't care.  Your child's school calls because you child is sick, they don't care.  They preach daily about showing empathy to the customers, but they show zero empathy to their employees.  Pay is decent but not that good.  If you want to promote within the company, you must have relations with someone in upper management.  They do no not promote on merit, skill, experience, or ability.  You must know someone.  The workplace culture is toxic.  There is always rumors about who was recently fired.  People basically walk on egg shells.  Everyday people are looking over there shoulder waiting if today is their last day.  If you have a college degree you will have a chip on your shoulder.  Half of management did not complete college and you will be a instant threat in their eyes.  So due to your hard work and dedication to finish college, it will now be a disadvantage to you to have finished school.   Some idiot came up with the bright idea to make a section of parking spaces dedicated to the employees who have been working there for 10+ years.  That dedicated lot is empty!  The only vehicle there belongs a person from management.  If you are looking for a temporary job for 1-2 years while you are looking for something better, this is the place for you.  If you are looking for a career to better your life and your families life,  you will be sorry."
bad,"Supervisors play favorite and push more work on certain people so their favorites can stand around and talk to them"
bad,"The Management of dish is misguided at best .  Management lies."
bad,"Seriously never apply here it’s not worth it they lie to you about everything!!!!! That description they have when you are applying for a job there is a big lie everything in it is false!!!! If you want your job threatened 24/7 because you didn’t sell 30$ per house then by all means this is the job for you but if you don’t want to be forced into being a salesman instantly of a satellite technician don’t apply here this is the worst place to work ever managers are stupid constantly pushing sales but won’t go sale anything themselves when they try  Frc sucks at knowing how to route as well as fsm you are a number that’s it nothing more once you don’t sale you’re gone they won’t fire you but will starve you out of your check by saying “it’s slow”  huge joke of a company who doesn’t listen to the face of their company which are the technicians and do t even get me started on the unbelievable metric system that they have that thing is absolutely trash!! •You are never getting off at 5 "
bad,"Gave them 9 yrs, level 4. Company hit hard times never wrote up, perfect attendance. Dropped me to level 1 13.75 just to stay employed after working my way up!"
bad,"Coming up 2 months shy of being fully vested and was part of a ""lay off""?? Seems very convenient. 3 days of insurance when they bent you over. I'm only slightly bitter as I would've given them everything and was let go by some corporate snot who didn't know my value."
bad,"1) Los supervisores de cambaceo casi casi te obligan a hacer ventas donde no las hay."
bad,"Call center, strict metrics, 1 min between calls.  They watch break time and lunch time.  High pressure sales high pressure conversion.  Treated like kids."
bad,This company has nothing more going than decent pay. You can be hired as a Tech but then expected to do sales for no real incentive beyond job security.
bad,"pay is terrible, they always say you are replaceable even though your the best. no motivation, high-school gossipers. you cannot live with the pay they provide."
bad,All around bad experience. Injured on the job and basically left me out to dry. The demands of the job were not worth the pay and the atmosphere was oppressive.
bad,"one of the worse to work for when it comes to management, has potential to make great commissions when available. healthcare not the best very expensive and not a great coverage. but mostly management its very bad."
bad,"unless desperate dont do it. there are way better jobs available out there."
bad,"There was no advancement for your job performance. Your performance was based on how well you fraternize with management. Because of this, the workplace was hostile. If you were reprimanded, it was in front of the whole warehouse."
bad,I would not refer this company to anyone for employment.   Each day there was no communication on company changes.  During my review I was never acknowledge of receiving EOM for 2 months each yr.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers that had been with the company longer than myself .  They did not like change.  Change in payroll etc was my biggest challenge
bad,It is a rotating door of lies and inconsistency. Everyone is replaceable and there is little acknowledgement of these problems by the stable executives that keep their jobs regardless of the downward spiral that the company has experienced over the last 5 years. Stock prices have plummeted and the company uses shady sales techniques to squeeze every last penny out of already poor people. It is a shame that they act this way and is a reason that dish ranks very highly on the worst places to work in America!
bad,This was the worst place I’ve ever worked management all needs to be fired this is a temp job they say it’s temp to hire they lie they go around telling lies on u there racist and they have only one thing in mind to never hire u if your white your going to slaved drives u black u straight u cool with these crooks people do not apply here I worked so hard for this place and they make up lies on u stay away for you on good
bad,"Horrible work/life balance. Unapproachable, uncaring leadership.  Company culture is: ""give your life to the company, but your work won't be recognized""."
bad,"No real training and you make 1 mistake and the QA team is on a hunt for 2 more to fire you instead warning you and training you properly. Pay is not worth it for all the back to back customer complaint calls about Dish losing more and more contracts on local channels and premium channels like HBO. You get in trouble if your on a call to long to try and take care of the customer and you get in trouble if you transfer the customer to many times. It's a double edge sword the way they want you to help the customer without getting in trouble. They have a high turnover rate with there supervisors and everybody teaches you differently. they are inconsistent when it comes to training you. I was a good employee. never complained and did what I was trained to do. I made 1 mistake and QA team took that and hunted down 2 more like it to say I have a negative pattern. If they just would have helped me correct my mistake and trained me properly, they would have had a happy employee."
bad,"This company is a nightmare. It really has the worst work culture I have ever seen of ANY major corporation. Senior Managers going on profanity laden screaming matches, executive visits are prescreened because everyone fears the corporate team. Overall stay FAR away."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Horrible company. Not at all professional caliber personnel. Team morale is terrible and general disrespect for hires. Unfunded health care so deductible is outrageous. No commitment at any level of management to create improvements in corporate culture.
bad,"I can't believe this company is still in business.  The management lies in your interview.  The 4 week training is absurd!  You train in a different state for a week and then come back and then do a ride along with a co worker.  "
bad,"Dish has some discrimination situations on certain employees, and without the proper training on the company policies. Lack of communication with Dish"
bad,"Company is very unorganized, no structure and NO LIFE work 24-7. Hiring new management every year; very high turn over. You are not acknowledge for the hard work put out."
bad,"no comment, no job security. They fire you even if you are there 15 yrs . they want to save company money for unrealistic things that wont last in the future"
bad,"Dish was hands down one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. You are nothing more than a number, and they do not care about your success. They will offer you a sign on bonus, but find any reason they can to pull it from you. No schedule flexibility, and no time off or sick time."
bad,"Dish's Current Problem= Declining revenue due to cable cutters generation"
bad,"there was a high turnover rate within the company, making job security unsure."
bad,"over 100 miles between jobs, 60+ hrs. a week, can't reach lever 4 in my area because hopper needs internet everyone uses the're cell for the internet you cant advance to level 4 without connecting every hopper one of many serious flaws in the advancement process."
bad,"There is no work life balance in this company , you have to come on time but there is no fix time to go home you have to complete your work before go home. Sometime you have to work for 12 hours for many days. No recognition of work"
bad,"4-6 jobs a day in random locations across state borders. Pay for your own material, gas, and equipment. Somedays had 18 hours of work. 6-7 day work weeks."
bad,Depending on what they throw at you for jobs. Only thing really learned at this company was how poorly management was. I got along with everyone but as soon as they got a new site manager everyone left. The most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers. They kept me and fellow employees going.
bad,"They don’t value their employees work or time. They do not give pay raises, favoritism is a huge problem. Management sucks and only go after people they do not like."
bad,"Unfortunately DISH has the worse management workplace ever, fill with daily changes and unfit promises for room to grow. the LEADS only care about you if you making their numbers look pretty other than that most of them care less. comp plan changes all the time to the best of its worse improvement ever, where the only beneficiaries are management and of score the company's owner. Don't let them buy you out by showing you how much money you can make, they will show you their best performance agent that aren't even in the company anymore or agent only from customer serv or those who their salary or their commission isn't affected by the millions of tiers that DISH has to offer."
bad,"This job is horrible .  If I bothered to read the reviews in this site I would have never applied for this company.  Horrible management. Zero support from your supervisors.   Every call you get you get yelled and screamed at by customers. It is back to back call without a break between them.  Not even someone with tough skin can deal with this abuse. They don’t pay enough to deal with this. The equipment at the customers home is horrible and they don’t work. This company wants you to perform miracles to fix them over the phone and most of the times you can’t.  I was number one on my team for months andi got zit for recognition. They don’t care about their employees.  They lie to you saying that the turnover rate is high because of attendance and it is a lie. It’s because no one can deal with this bad job. The schedule is horrible . Every 2 months it is different and gets worse. It is said to be performance based and no true at all. You can see the performance for each individual on your team and the bottom people got exactly what they wanted as their schedule preference and me and the other 2 people on the too we got some of what we chose. Everything is metrics based. You get punished for not fixing things overvthe phone.  If you send a tech counts against you. If you replace a broken remote it counts against you. If a customer calls for different reasons in a week, multiple times,even if it is not related to the previous issue it counts against you. We have stubborn and needy people that would call multiple times a day so they can have someone to talk to and that counts against"
bad,"I trained with 8 people when we started 6 of them quit. I was forcing myself to go everyday. Horrible customers and very stressful back to back calls. The pay is bad that I wasn’t able to rent a new place in NY nor NJ. And one day I was not sure where to go As I was moving between friend’s places and I was overwhelmed with my situation and forgot to tell them I will be absent. They fired me after working for them for 8 months. I am not upset or sad. That job was awful. For your own good, stay away."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Think long and hard about this job and they like to make you stay in certain departments . Poor management. Hectic process. I started out in the CSR , moved to the reconnect team which was torture, and then I went to the Loyalty team which was not that bad because of the team that I was on. They don't like to work with you on an personal matter. Its best to be without children and family because they will fire you."
bad,"Working here was stressful, dealing with agitated customer who think they are above everyone, left with little options other than to try and resolve unresolvable issues because the customers choose to be ignorant about the service they wish to have yet refuse to pay for, throughout a 10 he workday of several hundred calls you may have one or two honest and reasonable customers but that does not offset the load of intolerable people you have to speak with"
bad,poor management- horrible management- managment had no idea about tech stuff- revolving door of doom- best thing about dish was leaving the company- bad
bad,"Work Life Balance has been talked about since I started with the company but the hours per day in the office have increased.  Went from working 10 to 12 hours per day.  You are still expected to answer emails and phone calls in a reasonable time on your days off as well.  "
bad,"world worst company for IT, work culture is very bad . for it perspective is bad company, if you want to *** your life then join the dishtv . no worklife balance"
bad,"Customer satisfaction is the overall concept and reaction to services provided, customer experiences, personal connections, and conveniences of services performed. They represent the general views, values, and goals of the organization and it's employees."
bad,"After management changed, the company went downhill. Too many changes to the way things were done. Then ultimately i was forced to look for other work."
bad,They dont care about you here they fire you for doing you job. Schedules change every 3 months and they are not flexible to you family needs. Great for call center experience!
bad,"No matter what you do at this company, nothing is ever good enough. If it's not one thing it's another. As a coach in good standing when I wanted to resign, noone tried to retain me as an employee. This is something that I had to do when one of my agents wanted to quit, but when your at a higher level, who cares.  They expect you to dedicate your whole life and soul to being in the building 50 hours a week. What about people that have kids? I'm no slacker and I would always get my work done. But at the end of the day I never felt valued as an employee. I will never go back to Dish."
bad,they don't care about their employees at all and if you have medical issues that make you miss they try to find ways to get rid of you. No job security.
bad,Do not take care of their employees. Often demand employees do things they are certainly not qualified for. They play favorites with the employees that just accept what ever they are told
bad,"DISH was the worst job I had, they said one thing and required another. The senior management did not look out for junior management or the field workers. Corp. does not understand weather conditions and the adverse effects they have on field installers or the equipment and ability to perform job."
bad,I would never work at Dish again. It was the most stressful environment I have ever worked in. The pay is alright but not for the amount of stress that you endure.
bad,training is lackluster upper management isn't trained enough to answer questions an employee would have so we were fed incorrect answers on a daily basis.
bad,"This is a dying company with no clear direction on its future. Pay is below average, you will not get raises, and management treats their employees poorly. Managers, directors, and other support staff are unqualified for the role they have. Mass layoffs not uncommon. Favoritism is rampant with lazy employees being promoted ahead of the ones who deserve it."
bad,"not recommed it very stressful place very poor managment they fire people for no reason the good thing was work at home no managers but they always have camera meeting which will give you negative feedback to make u hate ur life very stressful not a safe and stable job no careers "
bad,"I disliked working at dish since I was very under paid and was never able to take vacation. Dish doesn't pay enough , it is a very stressful place to work at."
bad,I had started working at dish about 5 months ago. The beginning 2 weeks were very relaxed and my trainer was very nice.. But after the two weeks they sent us to the floor it got really frustrating. Felt like we had no time to improve or ask questions about our job and just got thrown to the wolves. Was struggling with a few things and no coaches on duty would ever help me. But i always seen familiar faces get help through out the whole day. Seems like they help their friends first. No biggie though. Struggled to get to the point of a successful agent. But couldnt give my full potential because there music and environment is too much like high school. Not a very professional work environment.
bad,fire rate is high demand is high lack of training  no good food there staff was not great to work with short notice on change in the company over all just needs a lot of inside help
bad,"The environment is great, along with everyone who works there. However the job itself sucks! The customers are extremely rude! They feel that just because they are upset they can just speak/ say things to you how ever they feel like because they know you have to keep cool or lose your job! being on the phone for 8 hrs with not even a 5 sec moment to catch your breath! And the coaching each week are just frustrating there is only so much you can do on a call not every call is going to be perfect or well scripted like they want it to be! Feels like you are in HS keeping your grades up to pass a class it’s rediculous. No job security at all if a customer has one bad thing to say about you in the VOC it can cost you your job."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Horrible place to work specially ever since they started laying people off. No room to advance management had no idea what they were doing. Company changes the metrics of focus every month.
bad,"I never did work here,I interviewed with them in Fort Worth for Weatherford area technician. The jobs itself is not about being a technician, it is all about upsells-that is their main focus!The interview was horrible!!!It waa more like a interrogation  than a interview. The managers at the Fort worth office are very combative and rude,so if you don't like being a salesman or enjoy a hostel working environment -stay away!!!!"
bad,"Good for individuals seeking a leg up and just starting out but once you've learned the ropes whether in the field or as a team lead, better yourself by looking for more opportunity outside of the company."
bad,I have nothing positive to say about my time with dish network- I was encouraged to take advantage of my customers by selling them overpriced products that would not benefit them in any way. My coworkers would often trade very unethical ways to get older customers to unknowingly purchase add-ons out of fear for their jobs as there were add-on quotas.
bad,At first DISH isn’t a bad place to work. When I worked there I loved it until I received a certain supervisor and it made my life complicated. He didn’t understand family problems that needed to be handled. He didn’t understand when there was certain things you needed assistance with. He was no help to me or certain members of my DISH team.
bad,"The entire experience was terrible from the first day and last day where they tried to charge me for worn tools.  Even though I never used their tools, only mine."
bad,Very poor culture.  Lack of progression.  Poor management.  Badge reports (if you're not there by 9:00 a.m. an email is sent to your manager).  Quite a bit of turnover.  The recruiting process is a joke.  I tried referring colleagues but when they were informed of the recruiting process they declined.
bad,"concerned more with sales, than actual work. no advancement what so ever. management didn't always help. always told us to call other techs.  forced overtime on us"
bad,One hand does not know what the other hand is doing. Way too stressful for your basic customer service job. You are only promoted if you are friends with the management.
bad,"Only if you wish to work at a demeaning, soul sucking, depressing job. The managers are under qualified for the position and only concerned with placing their personal friends into upper positions."
bad,As remote techs so working from home.  We worked in the most out there places with long drives and no connection to the outside world. Having internet connection and time doing the jobs thro the day were very outrageous
bad,"DIsh Network doesn't care about its employees. At all. You're better off going to a competitor, such as DirecTV, Comcast, CenturyLink, etc. If you have a family/kids, do not work here - they don't care about them or you! They chain you to your desks every day from 9am to 4pm because of ""core hours"". It's ridiculous. They need to confirm to current company standards and payment practices!"
bad,"the job was great to start with but I'm a single mom of a  2 year old,  i couldn't afford the benefits package at first so i had to decline, i signed up later and was told my benefits were going to start in a month, when that came i got the flu from my boss and passed it to my daughter. she had to stay home from daycare and i had to stay with her and take her to the er at one point. Dish did not care and wouldn't accept a doctors note since it was my child and not me in the hospital. I ranked 3rd in the site for Retention and they refused to work with me. there were people on my team showing up for work once a week in the same shift as me for 4 months and they are not only still employed but never even got talked about their attendance. i loved the pay but they don't care about their employees. The salary i listed to do this rating is when i was fired."
bad,"Extremely long hours and unclear teams assigned amongst field service managers."
bad,"Unrealistic expectations from pencil pushers who don't know how to do your job and when these exceedingly impossible requirements are not met, you are penalized."
bad,Truly a puppy mill. its not salesits order taking and slamming people into most costly packagaes. Find ways to keep ypur check. 1 min late loss bonus for the week. call in sick lose bonus for week.
bad,They don’t care about Tech safety it’s all about the the numbers and how fast you can get in and out of customers home..Send you up s 40 foot ladder with no fall protection
bad,not enough opportunities to grow to much work and not much time to train very poor management a lot of people was there for very shorts periods of time
bad,"dont work here!  if there were negative ratings i would pick -5 at least!  management is terrible, goals are unreachable, customers are terrible, back to back calls, no time off at all, and etc."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"The managers are yelling and constantly disrespecting agents and supervisors;pay is not consistent; huge horse flies flying around the call center all year; horrible ventilation; FMLA is freely discussed and encouraged by the managers; no compassion for human life;no feedback about your individual performance unless it is your yearly review.  This is the worst company in the world to work for; there is no room for growth unless you kiss up to the managers;  the tier system is another way for Dish to steal money from the employees; the priority routing prevents agents from making money because you can sit idle without taking a call for up to 1 hour based on your priority status while customers are are holding to speak with an agent; I hate the way they referred to credit challenged customer as""scum  of the earth"""
bad,"A typical day would be to do everything and not be acknowledged of the good work."
bad,"i loved what i was doing as an experienced field tech."
bad,"They do not value their employees. Willing to replace you with someone new to keep the overall income down for employees that are making too much, doesn't matter that they have been there for years. Hours are also not constant."
bad,"The pay is low, not enough money to take care of your life. i think the job was ok but its not the best job. Dish was good for learning a new company but stay there and find a new job."
bad,The company cares very little about employees. It's always added pressure but never added benefits. The company is always preaching changes but never for the better equipment fails making tech's jobs harder and goals harder to reach.
bad,My best advise it to not work here. It would be better to struggle and keep looking. Management team is the worst they never answer for help but yet want you to call them for every little thing. This company only focuses on sales and will threaten you if you don't meet their goals. Management team is unreasonable with everything they do!
bad,"They force overtime, let customers talk to you however they want. I had to listen to a guy threaten to find me and kill me over his TV service. 4o minutes because we aren't allowed to hang up on customers. Ultimately the Outbound team was what saved my career there before I left. They dispersed the outbound team and there was no way I was going back to taking incoming calls from those people so I left. Good thing I did because they're downsizing now and firing 400 employees. That's what happens when you treat your employees badly, can't keep the desks full and you don't operate at full capacity."
bad,dishs motto when i worked there was squeeze the employee for everything they got.       if they didn't like you then it was mandatory overtime every day. and then you have to come in on a day off.      mangers  always contradicted each other .
bad,"This place always, always has jobs posted. "
bad,You will get trading that is garbage and then get fired when you promote for things you weren’t trained on. The management don’t answer the phone for questions and when they do don’t know the answer.
bad,"This company offered me a job I accepted.the stating date was to be March 19. I get a call stating they don’t have enough interest in the class so the offer has been rescended. I had already gave notice. The job was offered February 5. So all this time went by. "
bad,Dish is rated as one of the worst companies to work for in America.  There is too much favoritism and no advancement based on merit and performance.  If you know the right people you get promoted and if you don't you get the worst shifts and you always have to work on holidays
bad,I would never recommend for anyone to work there ever. The management is poor and there is so much drama between the employees it makes it hard to focus on the job itself. I was never more disappointed in the management and the micromanagement in their incompetence to handle their own job duties and problems they face with others. I felt as though I was in high school again with no way to resolve issues with anyone. There are no procedures to handle irate customers and no procedures for employment abuse.
bad,"Dish was a 4/10 scheduled job. The managers were unqualified. You were frequently threatened with termination if did not do exactly as they said. Poor leadership, zero creativity. Soul sucking job."
bad,"a good place for someone new to the industry to start to get their feet wet. the hardest part of the job is the stress of workload and performance numbers so you can get a raise, the bar is always raised to a point that it becomes unachievable so the company dousnt half to give you a raise."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Dish network treats you like you are in the military. They show favoritism to certain techs. If you already have experience they will try there best to make you quit
bad,cut throat and very demanding they over work you they dont care about the employee or the customer . excellence is expected but they dont give you time to make that happen. and the managers dont stand up for you
bad,"rude customers, management basically did not know how to answer questions that you may have. every employee is micro managed , if management did not like you , you would be gone fast and have no chance for advancement. horrible pay for all the job duties you have to do"
bad,"Very hard to work here. They pound you with hours for little pay."
bad,You have to sell to get a raise and if you don't sell they will fire you. Also their insurance sucks. The CEO said if you are here for insurance you need to find a different job.
bad,"Quit when I got a ""Promotion"" to the ""Loyalty"" where every call I took was someone really angry who wanted to cancel service. This ""Promotion"" came with less pay, more mandatory overtime. The less pay was supposed to balance out due to ""Incentives"" but amazingly, two weeks after taking the promotion those Incentive programs were canceled."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had with the most hostile management team I've ever had to experience. No one cared about the employees, they always had ineffective training and scripts, and also expected you to get to work in 3 feet of snow"
bad,this place cant keep good people i have seen lots come and lots go. there is no growth her they make promises but never deliver. very stressful under the work environment here in mckinney office.
bad,Very unprofessional . It seemed like a bunch of new grads from High School got their 1st jobs and they were still thinking they were in HS and management did nothing to curtail the behavior
bad,Wold never recommend this to anyone. Highly stressful job dealing with customers. Fast paced with little incentive. Strict rules which you if you do not follow will be punished.
bad,Not the best call center environment. Difficult to get better hours and supervisors were not helpful when there was a difficult subscriber on the phone
bad,"the job itself was decent, the amount of jobs and the time given was a joke. In was remote technician and the jobs that were given were to far apart. Poor Planning"
bad,"Lets just say that being in prison has more rights and privacy "
bad,"the absolute worst place to work in america, you have no work/life balance you will be in the office 5 days a week and 10-12 hours a day, and their goals are unrealistic."
bad,"I hope this is the most helpful review anyone ever reads about being a technician at DISH. Let me first start by saying that I am as unbiased as it gets. I took the job temporarily while I was finishing school. From the start, I had a set date that I would be leaving. (Right around six months.) These are my observations. First, I’ve never received worse training for anything in my entire life than the “training” that I received to be a Dish tech. The trainers have never been in the field. Never climbed a ladder, never drilled holes into someone’s roof, never ran cable through attics or crawlspaces., etc.. They are incompetent morons. Conditions of this job are dangerous. 30ft ladders on concrete with 20mph winds? Do it. Cockroach infested homes? Do it. Ladder breaks or slides out of place on a job? Fix it or quit. No one is coming to help you.  Scheduled for a job at 4:30pm that will take 5 hours to complete an hour away from your garage? Do it. Routing you all over the state to sit in parking lots and wait for jobs to get moved or cancelled? Do it. Impossible standards working for impossible managers. Some of the worst people I’ve ever met. Sales quota? Check. Sales? As a technician? Check. Be prepared to swindle your customers into buying sound bars and remote skin covers under the threat of your job. 4 days on and 3 days off, promised. Right? Nope. A month into my time at DISH we were put on mandatory, indefinite 5th day shifts. 7am start, pray to be home to see your kids or wife before they’re asleep. Low pay. Faulty equipment. THE WORST TRAINING OF ALL TIME. Run for the"
bad,Awful company. Managers only focused on the ones who did well and were quick to fire people who didn't meet their standards. Issues were never addressed which led to my decision to leave
bad,This is the worst place on the planet to work.  Trust me on this as I stayed 3 years when the average person lasts 3 months.  Absolutely THE worst morale of any company on earth and it cannot be changed.  EVER.
bad,"Management was horrible, hours were horrible, breaks were extremely short. Worked as customer service and was promoted to Account Care Specialist (making people not want to switch providers). Was not given enough training or support during this role."
bad,"Dish was a very difficult organization to work for. From what I hear, not much has changed in the past ten years since I've left. Felt like big brother was constantly watching."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"If you like working where there are too many variables you can't control, then this is the place for you...  My immediate supervisor was great to work for, would do anything he could to help.  Unfortunately he was not the person who was able to effect change when it came to the people outside of the location.  I would gladly work with him again in a heart beat but not for DISH."
bad,The atmosphere in this call enter was very high school and in order to recognized for anything you would have to be a suck to the main boss and your supervisor
bad,"it was the worst place I have ever worked,they do not care at all about your safety or your responsibilities to the customer. All your are to them is a door to door sales person thats it."
bad,great jobs are great bad management is bad bad management with a great job = bad job no matter how much you enjoy it.  At the end of the day with a change of personnel and how the metrics work could be a very good job.
bad,"Way too many managers and not enough workers. Poor training and horrible hours. I was set on a schedule where I would have to work 7:30am to 11:30am and then come back and work 3:30pm to 7:30pm. I would have to stay for the full 12 hours because I ride public transportation and told them that when I was hired. I also had a wedding I had to go to and it was oked by multiple people until the wedding came up and all of a sudden, ""well mandatory overtime"". Well I have to go to this wedding, I'm in it. Don't waste your time with this place."
bad,"For one, as someone with severe health issues this company didn't accept doctors notes, there was no sort of consistency at all. The company would tell you to do something one way, the next day you would get in trouble for doing that same thing the way they told you to the day before. Management is quite inappropriate towards their employees. You will not be valued as an employee."
bad,Need negative numbers to rate how bad DISH is...It is really bad - especially in Roseland. Being rated consistently in the top 10 places to work says it all.  I should have seen the crazy coming.
bad,"they like to have team meetings where news is updated to us, but they don't give straight answers. my manager is always talkin like he got the boss lady from denver on speed text. i feel bad for those folk on weekend shift gonne be out of a job when they combine it with 2nd shift. work is super easy. even easier to lay low and not do much. 1 supervisor in my department is good, the rest is idiots. department manager never come around unless there be visitors. ha!"
bad,Horrible place to work. Management doesn't care about people.  You will get talked down to by your supervisor and you will get yelled at in front of your team if you do anything they think is wrong.  Every time you meet your exceed a goal they will find something to call you out on.   Training is a joke.  AVOID and look else where unless your truly desperate.  Mandatory overtime or they change your hours so they can avoid paying you overtime or night pay differential.
bad,"i do not recommend dish at all. bad management, They were firing people left and right. hours are terrible, this is just not a good place to work at.."
bad,"Pésimo empleo fui Supervisor de Cobranza, NO te capacitan, y empleados de más tiempo como el SUPERVISOR que se supone te capacite y tiene más tiempo en la empresa, TE PONE MIL OBSTÁCULOS PARA QUE no te desempeñes correctamente. Y no cuentas con APOYO de tus jefes. EN GENERAL MALA EXPERIENCIA."
bad,I would not take a job here again. Management was not supportive. Constant yelling and name calling. Employees were not happy. Low wages and little to no kudos given
bad,"La peor empresa para trabajar, los empleados somos esclavos con supervisores literal paseándose entre los pasillos vigilándonos, demasiado estrés para el miserable sueldo que pagan (no son ni 5 mil al mes). Te dicen cuando ingresas que hay promociones de ascenso fácilmente pero lo que no te dicen es que para eso tienes que ser la o el favorito del coordinador de tu zona, ya que sin eso, no te ascenderán jamás aunque tengas mayor conocimiento que los que son impuestos por capricho de los coordinadores y supervisores"
bad,I did not enjoy working at DISH but I do like the experience I received working there. My manager was awful and the work environment was very competitive and they did not care if something was going on with your family or something personal.
bad,"Omg that job was a nightmare. It was to stressful and taking calls back to back. Hateful and rude customers.  Customers hated dish but had no choice if they wanted to watch tv. Sad that a co worker from dish told me their motto was ""fake it til you make it"". I have worked a few jobs not many I'm one of them years employees. But that for me was the worse job ever. I quit before clocking in and left.  I would not recommend the job for active people. But for people who like the sit down job environment go for it. And patience is the key."
bad,"This company has no room for advancement. They constantly set you up to fail. You are encourage to apply and promote yourself, but will suddenly be demoted and get a payment cut. Management is a Joke they constantly ride you to fix your stats when there is nothing you can do to save the customer unless you lie or cheat."
bad,"No room for advancement in the company, management treats employees unequally, hostile work environment. I felt as the women were treated better then the men in the work place as they were provided more opportunities and treated better."
bad,"First off very high turn over rate and they literally hiring ANYBODY no experience needed so don't feel special if you get hired. They give you a lot of responsibility for very little pay,  they will sugar coat everything promise you the world, honestly this job is probably the biggest joke ever. You are not a field service technician you will be a salesmen and be required to sell a bunch of junk or not get promoted and Dish customers BEWARE!! if a tech does a trouble call or a new install in your home check your monthly bill, because I was advised If i wanted to meet my monthly sales quota I would have to leave items behind tv like surge protectors and charge their account without the customers knowledge screw that I have a conscience!!"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Sub-par products & services led to dwindling customer base. Management chooses to temporarily fix instead of  updating, which leads to more problems for consumers as well as employees.  When all is said and done, employees are overworked, under appreciated & stressed beyond measure.  In turn, this is passed on to customers by way of bad customer experiences & services."
bad,"Management sucks, no real training. All the owner and his wife care about is them selves. The managers are lazy and don't help the crew. Because they have no job security ether dish is black and white. The owners don't care about you or your life. They don't seem to under stand people"
bad,Receive job orders that morning. Drive to earliest job installations or upgrades or trouble calls. Do what has to be done to give the customer what they want
bad,"I just quit this job. The managers are horrible,and if you don't sell $300.00/day,they will starve you out of your job. You have to promote outdated,and unnecessary products,at a 300% markup. They don't even check to see if you install the equipment correctly. If you take pride in your work,this is not the job for you."
bad,"Dish is the worst play to work. They can fire you for no actual reason any time, does not mater how good you do in the company. you go to work one day and find your boss siting on a share talling you that the company is taking a deferment direction and that you are terminated.  do your research and will find out that other people saids about this company"
bad,"No contaba con seguro medico ni prestaciones de ley y solo me pagaba por venta."
bad,"They actively shut down talk of unions, overwork their employees, and don't provide adequate training.  They regularly get sued for violating OSHA standards & workers rights laws. Most of your paycheck comes from trying to sell useless gadgets off the back of your work truck."
bad,This company doesnt care about it employee. We are a number and only looking to exploit you. The work life balance doesn't exist and the company is never satisfied with your performance. You can be the best employee for 2 years and you have a bad month and that is not acceptable to them. I don't recommend working for Dish.
bad,I got injured and got operated. they refused to take me back as a tech. I was at 100% to go. they offered me a CSA instead. they aren't a good company
bad,"Dish is a great company and a good job but there is a lot of bs you need to put up with in the company it was not that bad when I first started, but now the company feels like they care more about the profits instead of taking care of there employees"
bad,"I do not wish to comment on this company at this time as I do not feel the need to give positive or negative feedback for the company.  It is an ok place to work for young people,"
bad,Didn't know day from day when you went to work if you were going to have a job or not. Very stressfull enviroment . The management is very poor all the way from the coaches to hr.
bad,to keep it short my family member died was told i can have the time off work to take care of said family member got hurt on the job then was fired for not showing up to work smh causing me to sue dish network terrible place to work for
bad,there is a reason they were voted the worst company to work for 3 years in a row. They do not care that you have a family and set impossible goals but when you pass the goals they change them to make them harder to reach.
bad,"If anyone ever tries to talk you into being a CSR for DISH do NOT DO IT. Insurance has a ridiculous deductible, the work is horrid, and God help you if you have to use the bathroom outside of your lunch or 15 minutes breaks (if you do you better deduct that from your next break). If you get sick you're in rough shape because you still get points that count against you even with a doctor's excuse. All but some of the coaches and trainers are only concerned with making themselves look better.  It's cut throat as far as getting a decent shift goes, definitely don't expect to get anything done house wise when you first start. Not to mention that it has the highest turnover rate I've ever seen at a job. Save yourself a lot of trouble and headache, work literally anywhere else."
bad,Micromanagement from the top stifles creativity. Employees are worthless to Dish and are reminded on a constant basis how easily they can be replaced. Job culture is do what you're told or else.
bad,Man this company is horrible from management to culture!! Driving around is cool but outside of that the pay is low and they don't care about you ore your safety only sales!!! They want you too sell this cheap stuff all day only worst company in the Industry Run don't apply especially the grain valley location they are all racist!!!
bad,"Awful job, would never recommend it to anyone. management is very one sided and not willing to listen to what is going on. They are not understanding at all. They have mandatory over time that would mess up your personal schedule."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"terrible leadership, low pay and autocratic work environment. great work environment if you are a contractor. too much churn and lot of new faces all the time."
bad,horrible management....they have a pi system which rates the techs which is very flawed. This company has no loyalty to their employees. No set schedules.... i could go on and on.
bad,"I worked as a Field Resource Coordinator. If you want a job that has standard operating procedures, that no one follows. Then this is the job for you."
bad,It seems like they don't care how they treat their employees. It affects the way they work. They are constantly changing how they work and claims that they care about our input on things but they do the opposite.
bad,This place has very bad management people working for them. My last manager was very much like a dictator and would not accept a different approach to things even if you suggested something different.
bad,do not work here. management is unprofessional. they all speak to the employees as if their better just because they are in a management position. $8 isn't enough to be standing for 12 hours
bad,"Bad place to work, this company isn't known as a career  choice, people are not valued, and they will walk you out in a minute."
bad,I have worked there for 11 years and have seen this company go down hill fast.  Work and family life is no concern for dish anymore they just want a body in the van an rolling to the job.  They don't care what the job looks like just as long as you sell something to the customers.
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company.  The job is difficult and many of the challenges expected to overcome are impossible to figure out. End time is not set and is very stressful.
bad,"This company has already been rated one of the top ten worst companies to work for by many credible websites, and through countless surveys. The management will take all the short cuts possible in order to attain their own success, even when it's on the backs of those who report to them. You are left to make decisions that will benefit the customer, but then you receive disciplinary action because what benefited the customer has now hurt the company. Dish's actual service, and equipment is excellent, the management however, let's just say you are always on eggshells if you're not the managements favorite house pet. Those who get promoted are those who brown-nose incessantly, unless you're just the best employee to ever walk in there. The policies in which the agents are supposed to follow are grey in many areas, leaving an unimaginable amount of room for interpretation and an even greater chance at violating Dish's unwritten, and for the most part, imaginary rules, unless it's benefiting to the numbers that management has to meet. They have such a high turnover rate, but it's not due to the call center culture that normally generates this, but it's due to how the employees are left to their own devices. It is also due to how many times you change teams within your first 3 months, which is hard for someone to adjust to when your schedule also changes over 3 times within your first 3 months, causing a detrimental disruption in your work-home life balance. Sadly, another reason is that they promise incentives, only to do everything in their power to minimize the earning potential"
bad,They closed the doors of the office I worked at and sent it overseas because it was cheaper labor. answered phones daily.
bad,"Dish hires many techs with no experience and provides good training.  The challenge is that once training is over the office that they work at may not support them very well.  Techs have to work outdoors regardless if the weather.  Techs are measured on many metrics and have to skip steps to meet the metrics.  If you work here, learn what you can and than you can go to a better paying company."
bad,"I have been working for dish for almost a year. Only asked for one day off. Have to work new years. Pie chart is a joke. They can manipulate it too easily if an employee is getting close to a promotion. Get blamed for keeping their scores low if a customer doesn't understand the way the rating scale works. Especially the elderly. Dish only cares if an employee sells their overpriced products. Other technicians have told me how to increase sales by leaving equipment in their house and having them sign the form since most people aren't sure what's in the fine print. This technique supposedly works well with elderly and those who's English is poor. I refuse to participate in this practice. Therefore my sales are low and I'm constantly getting blamed for low numbers on my team. Stay away from dish. It's a job, but that's about it."
bad,The company does not have a human atmosphere Treated like numbers or ignored. when they hire they want bodies to fill a seat and do not train you .
bad,I've never worked so hard for some did so well and been treat so poorly. This company has no respect for its employees I wouldnot recommend this job to anywone unless you were just looking to get buy till something better came along use and abuse them because I no they will do it to you.
bad,The management at least on the shift I work do not really care about their employees unless they are a favorite. My co-workers are awesome though
bad,"For the most part, I enjoyed the work at Dish Network but it was hard to make a decent living while doing piece work. It did not matter how many problems a technician runs into on a particular job, each house pays the same."
bad,This company don't care for there employees you are just a number to the and if you ever work up there pay scale they will be fireing you to bring in some one cheaper. What they don't tell you is that every thing you do is tracked and most of there rating systems are set up for stuff you cannot control that way they can get rid of you at any point and if you can meet everything they want the management will lie about it to fire you trust me I was one of the longest techs they had and seen everyone go down like that so if you do get this job don't make friends there they will be short lived
bad,Dish in general I don't think was the best company for me. I worked for Sling which is a company within Dish Network.  It is also tv almost like a Netflix but with a lot of problems.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Follow zero protocols and give you zero opportunities to succeed, on 1 job along while being trained we broke 17 protocols"
bad,No respetan horarios ni comisiones ni tiemposiquiera de descanso
bad,"management team incompetent no room for advancement. No job security, long hours with 10 hours shifts and mandatory overtime. no payed holidays and vacation time is a ripoff."
bad,"The managers do nothing but joke around and play half of the time. Co-workers weren't bad guys at all, everyone was respectful. I was fired along with a manager and another employee with no warning. I walked in to click in and was told not to and taking into an office where they fired me. I was told to sign a paper and I'd get 2 weeks of pay after but I am yet to receive this. Overall Dish Network is a horrrible company who doesn't care for their employees. As long as you're installing and making them money nothing else matters not even you."
bad,"Upper management spreading a ""fear culture"" around the company to obtain results. "
bad,"Created, updated, and maintained work order with integrity"
bad,"Training horrible, work horrible, job horrible kill me kill me now!!! I worked for their Sling department. They didn't put enough training into this department. They made changes daily and didn't let the employees know about it. I ended up in the Hospital one weekend and they wanted to fire me for something I had no control over. Yes they give you their service at a discount, but than when I wanted to cancel it they tried to tell me I couldn't because I was in a contract, which I wasn't. I have nothing good to say about this company."
bad,"Horrible experience with this company.   I spent eight long years with this so called company.  You give more than your all you work long hours give up your weekends and worse of all if you do the job the actually correct way and make the customer happy they punish you for it.  I was always fixing other people's work and doing it the way I would expect it done to my home, the end result of that is that they punish you for not working fast enough.  While the fast guys leave a path of destruction behind them are rewarded.  Worst part of this company is if you get hurt at work soon thereafter you will be fired.  It was not just me I watched people get hurt for eight years and like clock work soon after they were gone!  My advice is stay away... Dish offers the best in technology but the worse when dealing with employees.  As a side note they treat management even worse... I saw at least 30 management members come and go in my time there."
bad,"too much rules and conditions,we were working in hard conditions,where we have to meet certains numbers,(wich i dont have problem width since a good and very experienced tech) the as supervisor we put a lots pressure on tech where they deserve .we make them travel too far to country side then we supervise and wait for them,sometimes late at night,on top of we not allowed to touch any type of cable,network,sattelite work beside company work."
bad,helped customers with satellite tv helped with payments and payment plans troubleshoot all tv problems. advised customers of all promotions.
bad,"I liked everyone i worked with on each time i grew with. I could not stand the management they had no clue how things were ran, what we even did as agents."
bad,"Company consistently has a turn over near 100% for a great reasons. Unrealistic expectation, minimal benefits, and unaccommodating schedules are to name a few. Last time Dish cleaned house, instead of laying off empolyees, they offered base customer service positions to well established employees (a drastic demotion) knowing it was slap in the face in title and pay, hoping one would quit so Dish could avoid paying unemployment. I would not recommend my enemies to work for this company."
bad,Treat employees awful. Treat customers even worse. Coaches suck.. A lot of favoritism. Agents are pretty cool. Anything above an agent sucks. Gotta kiss a lot of behind to stay employed.
bad,"For a multi Billion dollar company you'd expect better. However, they treat people like garbage. As a call center employee you are punching bag."
bad,worst job ever i hated every second of it you get blamed for everything even when its not your fault management is a joke dont ever work for dish
bad,"wouldn't work here again this place doesn't know how to treat its employees, they only move up people management know very well"
bad,just on the phone all day long get short breaks and not paid enough to deal with people yelling at you all day. company doesn't care if your sick you have to sign a contract for the 1st year of no absences.
bad,"I didn't like working at dish."
bad,I believe Dish Network to be a good company however Dish Network is run by Lynkus Corps in Carson City. The overall enviorment from the company is unsatisfactory and immature as a culture.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,The owner of the retail store I worked for was very irresponsible and did not pay his employees. To this day he still owes me commissions.
bad,I worked for this company for a short period of time before they went out of business.  Everyone had to find new jobs.  They had a bad turn over rate for employing honest people.
bad,"My site was closed and Dish did not do much to help with it.  Seemed to be a nice place to work, but turned out to be a disaster when DISH played off over 500 employees."
bad,"I've been a dish tech for 2 years, still currently employed and here I sit with $1.87 in my account and been off work most of the week, Just pretty much all around a horrible company to work for, they care nothing for their employees ""especially contractors"" such as me... Can't wait to find a real job!  Good luck to any that may apply, but don't expect much out of them cause they don't care about you or their customers.. Just numbers and sales"
bad,"A two week training course is not enough to learn all the ins/outs of program changes.  Treatment of customers is the last thing Dish worries about.  It doesn't matter how hard you work or how many awards you get from your customers, because the only thing that matters is Sales, Sales, Sales."
bad,Company is just awful.  Long hours and little pay.ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
bad,"Most unprofessional place I have ever worked. Management gives no feedback, calls are controlled bu queue handlers so 1 person can be queued higher and take 5 to 6 times more calls than an another rep so for a sales job starting out you will be queued to the bottom. After having best stats my manager showed me I was forever neglected from gaining more calls to make more money over personal grudges. Politics check, skirt chasers check, and oh they don't drug test fyi."
bad,this compan doesnt care about their employees and they dont care if you have a family or anything they will make you work until you are dead litterally.
bad,Nothing good about this company. Management leaves much to be desired. Most enjoyable part of the job is your day off.  Hardest part of the job is trying to satisfy a customer while battling with management to do the right thing.
bad,Did not like this company at all. They expect you to sell 10 items in an hour and if you don't they will send you home. So you may work an hour or two tops
bad,With company for 3 years was a lot of back biting and turnover. Need a lot of work to treating employees better. Needs to offer Dish free to employees if making have product.
bad,"A typical day working at a DISH call center is frustrating overall. While you learn skills such as operating phones, chat consoles, and internal billing systems, anything beyond the bare minimum for the job are self taught. "
bad,"I learned a lot form dish when it comes to wiring and how to properly set up a home system. But from that they are THE WORST COMPANY to work for. They have no concept on how it really works in the field vs customer complaints that are put against techs., which are most of the time no reason. It's like the techs are against the phone service and they don't see that those two things do not work together. They dont care about home vs work life. I worked some days up to 18 hours and then have to return back the same time the following morning. The quotas are unreal too. They don't care about holidays they are open all year round even major holidays. IE. Thanksgiving, christmas. I felt they did not care about their employees at all! They tell you not to go on a roof but customers want what they want or they call on you and you have to do it to also get the best service so they turn a blind eye as long as it's done! (Customers & DISH) Supervisors don't back their workers yet set them up to fail. They have policies for employees yet don't follow thru with them until they want you out as well. Good Luck working with them!"
bad,"Not bright people running operations, extremely short sited and all personnel runs in gossip..  Everyone watching over their shoulders."
bad,management did not take care of employees and would not do everything they could to keep customers. Had to deal with customers in the executive office and did not have full authority.
bad,"Dish likes to promise their employees tons of wonderful things that they never follow through with, they make it almost impossible to get time off and work your way up through the company. I hated waking up in the morning because I knew I had to go there, it honestly brought back a lot of old feelings of depression and suicide I had as a teen."
bad,Dish has poor work life balance. Managers are chosen politically as opposed to hiring qualified managers. Many of the poor ratings that dish recieved were well deserved.
bad,horrible job to work at. feels like you are in prison no windows for daylight if things were too slow everyone left early not a place to work at if you have bills to pay. management did not care you were only a statistic
bad,"Micro managed, terrible work environment, CEO is a dictator, all managers expect you to do as they say, not as they do, extremely hard to get promoted. Their ranking systems to get promoted is extremely unfair. In most cases makes it impossible to get promoted, even if you do a great job."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,the company is just bad all the way around.nothing good about the company. I would like nothing more then to change the culture of the company.
bad,"A typical day at work is assisting my customers needs. Whether it be their bill is too high or technical issues. 	"
bad,I was not employed with the company long enough to make a truthful evaluation. The training experience in Nashville was amazing and very detailed.
bad,"An average day in this hectic call center environment was very stressful. Calls were back to back with very little breaks in between. Management has no regard for employees and you're micromanaged to the highest degree. The pay is decent, but it's not worth it for all the stress that place causes."
bad,worse place i ever worked.  They wanted you to lie to customers in order to get service at their location and misrepresent the product.  Management would not communicate to the employees
bad,"Just happy I had a job but you can look up DISH as rated number one worst company to work for."
bad,Most unprofessional company I ever worked for. Very aggressive sales tactics and structure and rules change to much with everything from sales policies to HR and attendance. Very misleading during the interview process as well. Hours are horrible for newbies as they will call you.
bad,was voted the worst place to work 2 years in a row that should say enough. management is two faced and will not defend you. they are always looking for a way to fire someone in a way that they would not have to pay for unemployment and will even bend the law to make sure that happens. They do not care about employee rights.
bad,I do not have much to say about this company other than management does not respect it's employees the way I feel they should.
bad,"This place was toxic, went from an international call center to a sales center.  They stopped focusing on quality and just focused on selling"
bad,"I worked here for about a year. It starts off great, but quickly turns into one of the most demanding and difficult jobs that you could ever do. I was a remote technician and the fact that they are paid the same as metro techs is insane. There is so much more responsibility involved."
bad,"I would not recommend  anyone to work at DISH."
bad,"Worst company ever. First off you don't get any sick day until you have worked there for two years. Mind you, work (drive) in the worst weather conditions. They force you to sell products and if you don't, you can be terminated. I for one refuse to try to sell products to people who cannot afford them and considering I was always in poor neighborhoods I really didn't sell much. Don't plan on having off any weekends. That is for the guys who have been there for years. There benefits are a joke. Do yourself a favor and don't apply."
bad,"i did not enjoy working at boulder calls the training was very short and vague , employers did not care for their employees"
bad,"I sold my lucrative lawn care business and took a job with dish in September as an Ops Manager...upon arriving at the site, one of my new employees asked if I had researched the company prior to taking job. Before I could answer he told of a survey that revealed dish as worst company to work for as voted by employees 2 years in a row. I shrugged it off....should not have as it turned out to be true!"
bad,Managers are not qualified to lead. Employees not treated properly. There is very limited room for growth. Nepotism runs ramped. Anyone that has integrity is shunned.
bad,"i wasn't happy with the company i was working for, because it was a personal job where i had to sale the cable myself. My coworkers couldn't help me out so i had to do it mostly by myself."
bad,"Management was terrible, most of the coworkers were worthless, there was know acknowledgement of our work. There was also very few opportunities to grow within the company. Job was pretty self explanatory, however the terrible management and terrible coworkers  made the job much harder than it needed to be."
bad,"If you can stay away from dealing with management, and are ok with horrible decisions, then this is the place for you!!"
bad,"I went door to door, learned to speak more fluently.  Easy job but boring job."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Worst job ever. Customers always rude, because they have basically been trained that the meaner you are to the person handling your issue the better you will be compensated."
bad,"If you need cash and need a job, this is the place to be. Short term only."
bad,Dish is definitely a stepping stone to a better job. Especially for field personnel.
bad,"And that somewhere is any other job you can find. This company doesn't deserve any good reviews, and the ones on here are to be ignored, as they are most likely made up."
bad,The hours are long when there is work to be done. They hire you at 4 days a week 10 hours a day. Then make you work 5 days a week at close to 15 hours a day. They make getting a raise very hard. They start you out at 12.75 an hour and don't give you a raise for years.
bad,Dish was not a very family orientated company to work for.  They were not sympathetic to needs of family
bad,Continual overturn and policy changes made for a hostile work environment.
bad,NO job security what so ever. All managers care about is NUMBERS NUMBERS NUMBERS if you do not meet them you are out the door faster then the so called training they give you. This company has to be the worst company I have ever worked for by far.
bad,"Constant micromanagement, no freedom to do anything out of the box, managers constantly degrading and beating everyone down. Way too many metrics and changes in policy to ensure failure. The only saving grace has been my co-workers."
bad,"It was like walking on egg shells from the moment I started there."
bad,Worst Company in America by far..everything was bad theres not even real desks there
bad,Dish is just awful....theyre ALWAYS hiring because workers get treated like scum and walk out.
bad,Supervisors show favoritism.  They don't listen to problems of their employees.  Very high turnover rate because they work the good employees to death. Not enough for $10.75!
bad,Go to Glassdoor to read reviews...it's almost unbelievable how bad Dish is to work for. A real eye-opener.
bad,This company is a mess. I only worked for them for 2 months. They have no clue of what their doing.  I remember when they interview me the guy said why do you want to work for the worst company voted 2 yrs in a roll to work for.  Lol now I know cuz they are the worst company to work so glad I found another job quickly so I didn't have to stay at that he'll hole. They want you to make sales sales sales sales that all they talk about. Good luck dish network take my advice don't work here
bad,"Management is the worst.  And because of this supervisor's must follow management orders. So, therefore this place than becomes a place of no advancement. Supervisors, also need to know how to treat people right instead of worrying about there numbers, in other words they need to know what people skills are. Supervisors and management  need to learn how to communicate with there workers instead of tell them that there behind in there numbers or that the Q.C. found a defect on one of the receivers."
bad,its just boring no pay did'nt enjoy my job.what more is there to know about the company. The place i worked at is no longer there.
bad,Good place to start a career to learn the skills you can apply elsewhere. But not to finish a career.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,DISH does not take care of their employees. They force their services on you as an employees. The also have very poor products and services.
bad,"This is an inbound call center. I basically just learned how to perfect my customer service skills. The management isn't very helpful, they really don't seem to care too much for their employees. The co-workers are nice, but not life long friends. Hardest part of the job is just getting through the work day at this company."
bad,"I worked at Dish for nine months as a CSR in the Thornton call center.I began working a Dish on August 12, 2013.  I went through an intensive six week training program to become a customer service agent.  The first I heard of the attendance policy was literally the second or third item of the first day of training.  It was briefly explained that we would earn ½ point if we came in late or left early and one full point if we missed a day.  That was it.  What wasn’t discussed were the penalties or that the points roll off three months after they’re obtained.  That information I learned six weeks later after I was assigned a team on the customer service floor.  At four points you are written up. At five points you are given a final warning.  I also learned after getting to the floor that doctor’s notes or any type of legitimate documentation doesn’t stop the progression of the attendance policy or any disciplinary action that may occur."
bad,"Everywhere I went, when I talked about my previous experiences with DISH, everyone told me DISH was one of the worst palces to work for.  I didn't even realize it until I wasn't working for them.  Would not recommend anyone work there.  Managers are cold and detached. Manipulation of sales extreme.  Customers ALWAYS angry and the automated phone system makes the customers angry before they call in, very inconvenient for customers. It's truly only about the money there.  The representatives are only nice to the customers because of the constant threat of being fired.  Honestly tho it gave me incoming call center experience, and an easy walk to work, I wish I had never worked there"
bad,The top management at this company is evil.  The health care sucks.  Don't work here unless is your last resort! I would rather live under a bridge.  I did have an excellent manager that helped me tolerate it for as long as I did.
bad,"la gerencia una porqueria  sin valores, y mucho privilejios para quien le lamia los zapatos. puce una queja ante sus superiores y solo dijeron, y cito  --el es tu jefe por algo haci que tienes que obedecer lo que te dice aun que creeas que esta mal--"
bad,Install satellite tv and internet. run cat 5 and coax cable. Got to meet new customers and people.
bad,"I do not recommend this place to anyone. If you're a good ol' boy they'll look out for you, if not you're on your own. The politics can be messy and hard to avoid."
bad,The employees are childish and the management is unprofessional.
bad,you do more work then what you get paid for normal 12-14 hour days and management doesnt care how late you are out till. upper management to corrporate dont care weather you succeed. need a college degree to become manager or beyond even after years of service dont promote from within. work in all kinds of weather rain snow heat holidays doesnt matter you will be forced to work. work place was rated #1 worst place to work in in the US for 2 consecutive years. i put 7 in and can vouch for all if it
bad,if u are pregnant don't work here it dont ever last they will try every thing they cant to make u quit or will fire u over anything
bad,not a nice place to work for. only two days of training and the staff was no help
bad,"Dangerous company to work for - I ignored the warnings about this place.  Treated IT employees bad.  In the 18 months I was here, our group went through 5 managers.  Managers are useless and have their favorites.  Even though I never had a performance review when I was laid off I was told me performance wasn't up to par."
bad,"Nothing about this place is worth it, the job is frustrating even outside of dealing with customers who don't know left from right.  You get stuck horrible schedules, mandatory overtime, and bosses that get paid to wonder around the building doing literally nothing at all.  If you call your boss out on doing nothing, it's a ""behavioral issue"".  The only time you're not chained to your desk is if you're getting in trouble for something, usually something out of your control.  Moving up in the company is close to impossible once you get to a certain point.  If you're working full-time and then need to work part-time for a couple of months because, let's say life happens, you can forget about it -- it won't happen, instead they'll ask you to work more overtime.  Some co-workers are alright but most of them are creepy and continue to work here after numerous run-ins with HR for being creepy.  One co-worker admitted to having Swine Flu, saying it was extremely contagious, to our boss and was never asked to go home.  You'll get promised many different things, none of them will ever actually happen.  Best just to stay away."
bad,"There is nothing positive to say about working at this company.  Even the friends that you make working here are not in any way worth the disrespect and lack of leadership at this company.  I worked for DISH for 10 years I worked my way up from the field into operations management.  I managed for my last 6 years of employment. "
bad,Had fun working with the co-workers and management. Learned about the Dish networks and the channels provided by them. Each day was a challenge to attain the targets.
bad,"They will select people who have ties to dish to move forward, and will make you think you are getting fired for weeks, before telling everyone in the office that you will be fired before you."
bad,Dish network is nothing more then a large sales company.  with employes nothing more than a #. the worst company . ive ever worked for.Sales Sales Sales is there main priority. Not the support of there Employes in any way or fashion
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,My work day started at 700 and ended about 900. I didn't learn alot from this company just enough to know that I would never want to be part of that environment again. I meet some good people and some bad. The hardest part of this job would be to actually deal with there day to day business.
bad,"My experience with dish was as long as you were buddy buddy with the management team you had it made. Those techs got away with doing bad installs, never working mandatory 5th day, constantly adding smart home sales products to customers account without the customers acknowledgement, never properly restocking the van with for the next day with product or fuel for the next day. Management had no clue how to install or trouble shoot the system. I would rate the management team as over paid babysitters."
bad,"The culture at Dish Network has not changed. Dish likes everyone to believe that it is a wonderful place to work. In reality, Dish is the worst place to work in the television services industry. Dish is the lowest paying, and you're going to work harder than most other service places. The only way to promote is to become buddies with upper management. I did promote, but I saw far too many guys get passed up for other, under qualified guys. If you challenge upper management without having built a solid case for yourself, you will be shunned and deemed someone to be replaced, regardless of your performance history. You simply cannot say, ""Hey, what's up with this?"". I gave Dish an overall rating of 1 star, simply because that was the lowest rating and I could not rate them any lower. And I say this having worked at 3 different locations. It's all the same."
bad,"Dish Network is a ""grind house"".  Average employee maybe lasts 3 months due to being aggressively over worked and under compensated.  Out the 150 people on my sales floor only 7 make a paycheck thats more then Mcdonalds.  Benefits are terrible to the point where my wife has to work while raising our baby just so we can have insurance that makes going to the doctor affordable.  Worst company in the country to work for."
bad,"Forced overtime, frequent schedule changes, very little respect towards employees. There's a reason it was voted worst company to work for in 2012."
bad,"SUI is the worst most corrupt company you could ever work for, be prepared to lie to customers about why their technicians aren't coming out to their home after they have been waiting for 5 hours...."
bad,"sign on a computer and start making calls to customers asking if they would like to upgrade there satellite packages, offering different prices and a number of packages."
bad,"A slavish amount of work for moderate pay and horrible treatment"
bad,"One of the worst companies in america to work for. Long shift hours, little to no vacation time, opportunities for advancement depends on how much you kiss up to managment, raises are very minimal"
bad,too many corp managers not enough real people. everyones job is in question everyday no matter your performance. I dont know anyone that has ever been happy working for this company.
bad,"sold dish door to door, pitched dish door to door."
bad,"I was told when I started that I would be working remotely from home (as in I would have my own van) but after starting the told me there was a van shortage and I would have to work from the office, which was an hour away. Half a year later, they never gave me a van. You work at least 50 hours a week, and hours vary but are typically 13-15 hours a day but if you get a late call, you can be leaving past midnight and have to be back at work again at 6:30 AM and I had a 2 hour (there and back) drive on top of that. Management is always looking for reasons to reprimand you and will do it in front of the entire crew, even to experience technicians that had been there for years, seemingly just to embarrass them. One worker was so tired from the long hours that he fell asleep at the wheel and rolled his van down a ditch. They set ridiculous goals that you have to maintain for months straight in order to get a raise. Many of the factors, are completely out of your hands and the person that trained me had been there for 6 years and only received one raise. So he was there for 6 years more than me and only made about a dollar and a half more an hour. There is a reason Dish won the ""Worst company to work for"" award."
bad,Arrive at 6:00 AM assist all techs with departure. Manage and distribute an overwhelming work load for techs causing late appointments and customer escalations through out the day. All concerns with daily issues for employees falling on deaf ears from upper management. All holidays required to be worked while upper management was at home. Waiting on last tech to return to office I was there until 10:00 PM weekly. No room for advancement internally all promotions to upper management came from outside the compnay
bad,"The equipment was lousy, the billing was misleading, and they treated their employees badly. Out of 400 people, I was number 1 for over 11 months. That did not matter. My co-workers were great. Most of my phone calls were people wanting to quit, but they had a contract, so they had to pay."
bad,stay away this is modern day slavery!! horrible everything!!
bad,"I can't really say enough. Just stay away, all the bad reviews on here say everything just about, but it's actually even worse. Trust me and let this company die."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"I worked for Dish as a technical support representative and as a retention specialist for about 4 years. Dish is constantly hiring because well they are always firing. Supervisors are not very helpful but you can count on them to give you a write up when you don't meet their almost impossible goals. FYI, their is a lot of favoritism and prepare to be in the midst of drama with management, supervisors, HR, and co-workers. As for the job itself, you must turn yourself into a robot and take about 60 calls a day. About 80% of the calls will be irate customers whom will verbally abuse you. If this sounds like the job for you, feel free to torture yourself."
bad,Dish isn't a place to work when you have a family. They do not take into consideration of children or family needs. They do no care about any hours that you may need to work due to any situation you may have. They pay you well but the treatment and hours are crazy. They were and have been ranked the #1 worst place to work.
bad,They will work you until you can't see straight. The management can't make up their minds about anything so you have to guess on policy. The pro is the almost free dish you get for working there. Its a great place if you want to feel under appreciated and not compensated. They want you to do a perfect job bit not give you the time or proper tools to get it done.
bad,"Hours are horrible and pay is pathetic, over time is expected at no additional pay. sometime the longer you work the less you get paid. Plus they penalize employees with cash from your paycheck."
bad,Typical workday consists of answering calls and handling customers complaints.
bad,Ididn;t ejoying working there. It is a hard place to work for.
bad,Department closed and moved to new jersey. It was okay but it had its moment with management so there is nothing more to say about this company. Glad that I have found a new carrer.
bad,Too bad to review
bad,"From the top down this company only cares about numbers. Are you meeting your quota? They change standards every week. Too many managers not enough workers. The turn over for this company is extremely high. They require extra long shifts and mandatory weekends and holidays. Expect to work Christmas and Thanksgiving Full Shifts! Now does that sound like a company concerned about the labor force? The benefits there are a PPO not an HMO insurance. They will promote you only after you have qualified multiple times. Not only should you not work for this company, you should not do business with them."
bad,"Managers had horrible attitudes! Goals unreachable, robot atmoshpere! Nobody that company marketed to could qualify for Dish services. Hardest part of job was keeping a positive outlook, when everyone around you is down!"
bad,coaching an average of 15 employees
bad,"The company wasn't so bad back in the old days when it was still small, but as the company grew and when it split into 2 companies in 2005, Echostar and Dish Network, that's when it really started going down hill. The DISH side was much worse than the Echo side."
bad,"This Company is one of the cheapest most despicable places I have ever worked. They are not incorporated for a reason, if they were to go public people would laugh their stock, and it would go under in six months. The benefits are a sham, the management is cheapest I have ever seen and they have made the two company's they have purchased even worse (Slingbox and Blockbuster). They can hire whatever CEO they want they will forever pay their expenses with fodder of the rank and file employee. They will never understand companies are made by good hardworking, loyal employees, not saving every penny at their expense. The have a plethora of spare money becuase they wring every dime they can from every avenue, they don't even pay for decent commercials! The best thing I have ever done was to leave this company."
bad,The company itself is a great company. The values of the owners are outstanding. The company is female friendly. There are some down sides to Dish install as with every company. i can say that i did enjoy my time with this company however would never go back.
bad,working at dish made everyother call center look happy and fun. they have aweful benefits and are not employee oriented they dont try to obtain employee loyalty
bad,"Because you won't ever see one."
bad,"Pésima empresa para laborar no hay crecimiento ni oportunidad de emplear tus propias ideas, solo tienes que agachar la cabeza y obedecer, el ambiente general es muy estresante"
bad,Te exige mucho esta empresa y no hay estímulos para el trabajador
bad,"Management drills you to sell products if you’re not selling you’re not a favorite employee,your job also depends on sales IT SUCKS not something to consider."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Poor management"
bad,"It’s a company with some good opportunities but the management , the benefits and the culture it’s terrible."
bad,"I had a very bad experience working here. Unfortunately, is a hard selling job and the reason I say hard is because the company technique of selling is not good and once you do sell there is always a big change of them taking back your commission for anything. The 3 family members that had recommend me to work there are all gone too."
bad,Make sure your priority is on your sales! It can be frustrating for any technician whom prides themselves on their quality of the work. To only have it be overshadowed by pushy sales techniques you MUST use in the field.
bad,"This place was full of drama and had favorites, those were the people who made money because all the leads were sent to them and they had early shift, were able to bring their kids to work also"
bad,"I'm pretty sure half of the people I trained with were illiterate. Seriously, does Dish go out of it's way to hire people that act like they just got released from jail? One guy stole all of the chips from the break room, one threw her hard hat and screamed at the instructor, one guy got so drunk he had to be asked to leave the hotel pool, and (lucky me) my roommate had 3 teeth and wouldn't stop telling me how mass shootings were a government conspiracy to take our guns."
bad,"Horrible hours, mediocre pay. They'll pay for training and your first set of uniforms; however extra sets are expensive. They do give a uniform allowance (2x/yr) but you can only get 1 or 2 items before your allotment is used up. "
bad,"Managers are there to help, only they don't. They only care about making their numbers. This means that you have to make yours. But they also have 10+ other techs to help them achieve their goal you only have you. Company contests seem and feel rigged. Just know this company and management only care for you as long as you are useful. Even when you are useful and your job becomes too easy they will fire you to make room for someone else at a lower pay. They only have Unions in certain offices but I feel like they need them everywhere. They don't care about your work\life balance. They constantly move the goalpost on you when it comes time to promote."
bad,Dish wireless will tell you everything you want to hear during interview. But in reality they have there crews working for another GC out of market working on TMobile 4c upgrades. T Mobile has now canceled all 5g mods so the GC you are working for will barely be able to feed u 40 hrs. This company is years from deployment
bad,"I worked as a Field Technician for a little over a year at Dish. The job itself wasn't too bad, besides the obvious drawbacks of working alone and outside most of the time."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at dish the company has no integrity they expect their installers to lie or use misleading statements to customers in order to get up sales
bad,"You had to reach a certain number of phone calls to get a raise, what you are not told if you don't keep that number you pay goes back down, also when you arrive to work your shift you are told that you are only going to work a half shift."
bad,"There is no such thing as job security unless your CEO. Management and corporate beg and ask for feedback but when it's given you'll be at risk of loosing your job. Tenure doesn't matter. Co-workers are nice to get along with that was before management changed.They want you to ""go above and beyond"" but offer you less in return. Benefits are horrible and to make up for it they offer Dish for almost nothing."
bad,"Extreme hours, mandatory 5th days and sometimes 6.  Work 12 plus hours a day and unreasonable metrics.  Not only does one have to sell $35 a work order average, if you don’t your job is in jeopardy and if you don’t, there is no advancement.  In management role, you are held accountable for the sales quotas.  This is not just a satellite installation company.  You will be required to be a salesman, and must and do whatever is mandated.  If you have pride in your work, well that’s not enough.  The management at Dish is the good ole boy network.  You will not succeed if you just do your job and succeed.  repair appliances,"
bad,"There was lack of appreciation, they told me once that I was disposable. There was a lot of favoritism and they loved to micromanage you.  You were forced to change your job duties even if  you liked the department you were in.  They always had mandatory overtime. You had no option.  You basically had no life working here.  You would usually work 6 days out of week."
bad,"Sweat shop , run now . At first the process seemed great , the training provided , the training instructors were great . The madness  started after the training and you’re  on the floor . The company is heading south , cx  are streaming . Management expects you to literal beg the customers to get them to stay"
bad,"They do not understand work/life balance at all.  While they removed ""mandatory overtime,"" they still stand over your desk and pressure you into extra hours.  In fact, they even gave an award to a woman who worked 90 hours in one week and said she was an example of what we should all be doing.  They made it impossible to accurately track your pay and often changed pay out rules with little or no notice.  Grading on calls was just as difficult.  Your could lose points for a ""trending"" violation, which meant it wasn't against the rules but they might make it a rule soon if they feel like it.  The entire place was a revolving door.  Team leads and sales agents quit regularly.  DO NOT WORK HERE.  They drain employees and abuse them because to DISH you are expendable and replaceable.  The interview area is separated from the rest of the building for a reason."
bad,Micro managed beyond belief . The company calls you a technitian but treats you like a door to door salesman . Everyone including your manager is stressed out all the time due to constant pressure . Never know what your day is going to be like or when you'll get off work . No time for lunch . Asked to do things off the clock and on days off. Terrible expirence.
bad,You’ll feel like you’re just another number because that’s all they care about! You’re dinged for every single thing even though they know there wasn’t anything you could’ve done differently and you’re made to feel like doing your best is never good enough! You can’t just go to work & do your job like normal people. You always have to be worried about how your metrics are looking. Not only that but you’re also compared to everyone with your skill which causes a lot of division amongst you & your coworkers. They also don’t have consistent work schedules that change every 3 months based on your metrics & performance. Nobody seems to be happy at work EVER!!! It’s pretty safe to say that the only people working there are showing up strictly for a paycheck and nothing else!
bad,I started 1/7/19 passed my training and made 10k my first month on the floor didn’t know anything bout the company I invest my heart and soul to understand this company and I got  screwed  over. I got sick with mono and pneumonia and i was so bad I couldn’t even speak so I missed work provided them with proper docs had to put myself in over a $1000 in debt of my own money because I didnt have insurance and it kicked in with dish 4/1 they ran me around for over a week and they had no intentions on keeping me and I didn’t do anything wrong I feel like I was personally targeted for having my medical marijuana card I’m 27 bout to open a  dispensary within the next 2 months a be a self made millionaire by 28. I will never have dish services in my home and I strongly recommend to stay away from this company.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"A typical day at work begins with you coming before 9am (any later and your manager will receive an automated message saying that you are late - yes, even the salary employees)."
bad,Your money will always be funny.  Boss will always lie about how if you sell more you'll get paid more. What he means is he will get paid more.  Stay clear
bad,"worst company to work for "
bad,"This company needs lots of improvement with management, company policy, attendance, and a better environment to work under. There’s no sick days or days off for bad weather. You are expected to be at work even if you have a doctors note."
bad,"I was forced to not take lunch breaks (is that even legal?) work 16 hour days and was micromanaged and harassed by managment to a laughable degree. Some of the people I trained with looked and acted like they would be at home in prison. These are the people you want to be the face of your company? What happened to Dish?"
bad,Management used harsh tactics to coax employees into pulling higher numbers.Challenging a persons integrity and asking them to lie to current and potential customers is not a job worth having.
bad,the building was nice but the job invironment was terrible. flex schedules so work 4 hours have four hours off then come back for another four. very far
bad,"Management was horrible. there was no work/life balance. Management always overbooked and techs got stuck working mandatory ot with zero thanks.. When I started they wanted us to sell one thing per day. By the time I left they were wanting us to average $15 per work order. We received no extra pay for this. We had 6 metrics to meet but all they cared about was $/work order, which wasn't even one of our metrics.. I was the top tech of the month one month but all I heard about was how my $/work order sucked. We were sent out to work in any weather conditions with no thought to our safety. When techs would bring our concerns up in weekly meetings we were told they would look into things- they never did. The health insurance was horrendous with a 2500 deductible. Once the deductible was met they only would pay 80%, not 100%.. The only decent thing was getting every channel for only $20/per month."
bad,It was the first call center job I held and it was a nightmare. The turnover rate is super high. The rules change and aren't communicated in a timely manner.
bad,"The job is not worth the pay. and the supervisors make your life very stressful. as soon as you hit your quota they make it even harder for you to hit and the management team is very inconsistent, you dont know what you should be doing from one person to the next and your constantly worried your going to lose your job."
bad,"Highly centralized decision making."
bad,"Senior management distrusts all employees. For example, they regularly run badge-in time checks on all employees, including exempt, and use that as a basis for disciplinary action."
bad,"Dealing with consistently irate customers, who continually put you down, upper management does not actually care about you, its hard to actually get a schedule you want unless you are absolutely cut throat and get incredible stats which is incredibly hard to do. The company acts like they care about you as a person, but watching a good 75% of employees get fired in 2 days, some even over the phone, shows just how replaceable each and every person is."
bad,"I was one of the top tech agents in the call center, but I was not involved with any management on a personal outside or work basis so I was never offered any promotions that I went up for. I wanted to be an installer but was denied and not given a valid reason why. I also went up for a supervisor position but was told that even after 5 years I was told that I did not qualify for it, but someone that only had 3 months with company got the promotion."
bad,Dish is a place to where they will build you up and break you down. The development is driven by fear for your job. They will make you terminate people for no reason and to tell the person dish is restructuring or they are no longer a fit for the company.
bad,"As a former DISH installer, I encourage anybody and EVERYBODY to stay away from this company ! Where do I even begin... for starters, when I first got hired , I was told I would work 4 10’s with 3 days off and SOME overtime. I ended up having to work MANDATORY overtime for about 7-8 months straight. 5 day weeks working 12-15 hours. Work to life balance at this job is a joke. Company doesn’t care about the techs. This job is no longer a installer based company, all they care about is technicians selling our products to customers. Hitting the metrics to promote is ridiculous. If you have a family or have plans after work , you can forget it . Your day can end as early as 1-2pm or 9-10pm. Worst thing about this job is not knowing what time you be off for the day. Job security is a joke, it was made clear to us at one point that we were “all expendable”. Benefits sucked aswell. Overall, if you know what’s best for you, don’t ever apply at Dish Network.. especially as a tech !"
bad,If you like having absolutely no job security and a stressful work environment this is the place for you! Use it as a jumping off point for breaking into the telecommunications industry and then get out as soon as possible.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Cool people, direct management was good. Upper management is terrible. Goals force technicians to cut corners to avoid termination. They want perfect quality work in a shady work time frame. Most of the goals are out of your control. If you exceed the goals, it does not feel like an accomplishment, it feels like luck. I do not say this lightly. As a veteran and someone that deployed and work in harsh environment conditions, the goals and expectations to leave employees paranoid and stressed out. There are a lot of good workers at the company and they are weighed down by unrealistic corporate mindsets and expectations. Also, moving up would take the death of someone above you. The room to move up its very small. Tick tock, tick tock."
bad,They are not family friendly. They want you to work there rigid schedule. Very very high stress work environment. The demand for profection is very high.
bad,Not everyone is treated fairly and in the end you are just an employee number at DISH.  Definitely no work life balance in this company.  And if you are trying to acquire a job in management it is ten times worse in those jobs.
bad,"This job is awful and most others agree. Jobs are bad sometimes, but compared to Dish they were amazing. Dish has awful working conditions, and it was an awful experience. If you have the chance do NOT work here."
bad,"I do not like working in a call center.  I have a MBA, and I feel that I have acquired the skills in Human Resources to be a Generalist, with potential to become a Director"
bad,If you can tolerate the culture there are opportunities to learn and do meaningful work.  High turnover opens lots of jobs but professional training is poor and failure rates high.
bad,"I use to try to dispell all the negative feedback that accompanied working for Dish even after I had been there for awhile. I turned a blind eye to everything going on under the surface. The place is a social nightmare that compares to high school. Meaning that no matter how hard you work if you are not in the ""In"" crowd you will only be crapped on and will be passed over for advancement. I wouldn't want my worst enemy to have to endure that place."
bad,"I left a job doing telecommunications to take a job because of competitive pay or so I thought. After working my 90 days i asked for a raise, one that I was promised, but even with 7 years in the business and my performance werent enough to move up from 12 an hour even though i was promised more. not to mention no take home vehicle even though i lived close to an hour away. i wouldnt recommend working here unless you enjoy working for less."
bad,This company is a joke. I pursued a career with this company and wish to the heavens above that I didn’t . This company has a high turnover I worked here for about 5 month and durning that time I seen emergency vehicles parked everyday waiting to wheel people out from being stressed the —�— out this place is not healthy. Now if your one of the chosen and their fav you will go far and maybe get the chance to move up this turned out to be the worse  job I have ever worked in my whole working career  they push on you that this is a career but this is a  job to get you by if your welling to deal with the stress and the constant change
bad,poor management. always feeling dismissal at anytime. more concerned about sales than quality of work.no field support. poor route scheduling. just a poor organization.
bad,Dish is run by very corrupt people. They strive to be corrupt and like it that way.  The CEO is an egotistical bore. Eventually Dish will not be player in tv at all. This all seems to be fine with Dish. The attrition rate has always been above 75%. Probably higher.
bad,"A typical day at work, you meet, pick up supplies and tools and you leave praying that you are able to perform the job and it is not above your Tech level."
bad,Dish does not care about your work life balance all you are to them is a van not a tech at all if you don't sell there overpriced shs they will get rid of you
bad,I would reccomend that you never work there. If you choose to do so then may God have mercy on your soul. I would reccomend that you look at the reviews of glassdoor.com. The reviews of the company are true. I worked at that company for 5 years and would get yelled at for not working 14+ hour work shift. I would then get yelled at for getting overtime from working 14+ hours.  Employee's were treated like livestock and when they didn't perform to their ever moving standards they were fired. An example was when an employee was hurt on the workplace and placed in a light work area after treatment. The management then proceeded to fire the employee for getting hurt on the job of no fault to the employee.
bad,"Company is horrible to employees. No warning for schedule changes. No idea what time you will be off. Thing out of your control are held against you (customers not home, customer do not have line of sight, equipment fails inside of 12 days, customers not having Internet, customer changes mind, customers not buying any additional products or service,,,,,) Bottom 10% could be/ will be cut every year. Always adding additional duties. If you are not driven to be the best and are the best...you will fail..PERIOD"
bad,"They steal you money- if you even make one mistake with your disclosures you forfeit your earnings and all the money you earned and counted on gets taken. This is completely objective as the people making the decisions about your ""mistake"" are financially motivated to find mistakes. "
bad,"The days went by quickly and the pay was nice, although the management is very unorganized. One manager will tell you one thing and you will get in trouble with another manager for what the first told you. No absences allowed, sick or not. They don't care."
bad,Although Dish is a big company I found that there work environment in the Denver location was to say the least NOT FAVORABLE. Summer months was horrible. Working in a warehouse environment with absolutely no air conditioning and no windows to speak of. It was dark and quite depressing. and the Turnover rate is way to high.
bad,"As a manager, you usually work around 14-16 hours a day, but are a salaried employee. Therefore, you are only paid for 40 hours a week. Luckily you only have to work 4 days a week. Upper management sets insane goals for lower management and techs. Work/life balance is nonexistent because you are required to work at least 1 weekend day. Generally the first day off is spent sleeping and recuperating. There are those that have managed to be successful, but it has completely altered their personalities. If you can handle a high stress, micro-managed, rapidly changing environment, than this company may be for you."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"There's a reason this company has been consistently rated one of the worst companies to work for for the past few years. I can sum it up to incompetent management, and ridiculous policies. My former office had 3 techs fired, and 3 more quit in a 6 month period.."
bad,The management team is all favoritism. Nothing but peer pressure. Very stressful. Horrible schedules. Must work holidays. This place judges you so be careful nothing but cowards there. I highly don't recommend this place.
bad,"Fue mi primer trabajo, el objetivo era vender el sistema de cable tv. Orientar a los clientes nuevos y existentes. Trabajé en Plaza del Caribe y  Kmart de Ponce y Juana Díaz."
bad,"I worked here for 7 1/2 years. I was released due to low numbers. They raised the goals in 2014 and made it virtually impossible for techs to advance or get bonus. I struggled to the point of making myself sick. I worked sick for 2 months before having emergency surgery to remove my gall bladder. A month after coming back, I tore 2 muscles in my back on personal time and had to take 3 months off to recover. Pressure to come back by management brought me back early and for 2015 my performance appraisal was low due to me being sick and hurt. This was not taken into consideration and I was fired 3/30/16. I was tech of the month in Feb and March, and for the first 3 months of the year had outsold my entire office in smart home services. They didn't care and have denied me unemployment. This company doesn't care about anything but money. I would recommend looking elsewhere for employment."
bad,"Everything that I love about an employer or a company, Dish personified the opposite of. There was no work/life balance, the employees were not priority, the company did not do what was best for the employee in any situation, and we worked in a high stress environment where we were expected to take verbal abuse on a daily basis. I burnt out quickly at this job and stayed only to make ends meet. It is a job I do not miss at all, however I am grateful that it provided me with employment at a time that I was desperate."
bad,"Customers complaining all day, managers on your back to increase stats even when long call is beyond your control, get points for being late even if there is a fatal accident blocking your path or you were in a minor accident (they threaten to fire you all day). I honestly would never work there again, upper management is nothing to aspire to be like, they can't even afford to go to the dentist or windows for their cars.  Staff is very ""unprofessional"". For that pay you are better off at Burger King or McDonald's. Raise after 90 days is $.50 haaaa!!! Who lives off $10.50? Shameful."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. They have no problems lying to their employees to accomplish the bottom line, making money. I never once received a break during my 8-10 hour day except for lunch."
bad,"VERY long hours, they demand a lot, you will be in very hot conditions in attics and crawlspaces, sometimes filthy homes with dead animals under the house, snakes, and poisonous spiders. Ladders are dangerous, they expect you to drive when roads are bad sometimes too (they have classes that tell you not to drive on them, yet it is a catch 22 when they have a point system for your raises with completion percentages, etc.). Don't expect much of a raise at all ever. It was awful. But yes, if you need a job, it is a job and the pay isn't terrible at least. At least it isn't minimum wage."
bad,work you all the time and don't want to pay you for your travel time and some jobs you do not a good job always on the go for no money
bad,This was a great place to learn how Satelite TV works with consumers. The work environment was a call center with poor management teams. The training was inconsistent from team to team. The hardest part was dealing with poor management styles. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their questions about technical side of the operations of their equipment and their bill.
bad,"However, None of the promises are true. Advancement is ridiculously hard and the ""goals"" this company tries to push upon it's employees are quite honestly unobtainable. Working here caused severe issues with my marriage due to me being away from home 12+ hours a day and never being around to help with the home, my newborn child, or spend time with my wife. When I finally did get home all I could muster up the energy to do was shower, eat dinner, then go to bed only to be just as tired when I woke up the next day to do it all over again. The schedule is always changing. I was told 4 days on, 3 days off. By the 3rd month of employment I was working 6 days a week at 10-14+ hours a day. The pay was NOT worth all the work I put in or the trouble it caused me and my family. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving every day and honesty there was even a ridiculously complicated process to that as well. Be VERY wary if you choose to apply for this job."
bad,i felt sick everytime i entered that chicken coop. it was not the best. people costantly getting sick due to sharing computers. we never had our own desk so pretty much where ever you can sit is your place for the day. highly unorganized staff. supervisors were not willing to help anyone that was not on their team and worst of all if you were a kissing up to the right people you got promoted. it was disgusting watching all those rats trying to climb their way up the ladder.
bad,"Dont work for dish. They do not care for you. Hours are horrible, horrible."
bad,The days were predictable but they had unrealistic expectations. While luring you in with promises of possible incentive pays it is almost impossible to reach those goals. Not to mention that if there are circumstances that require a schedule change the possibilities slim to none making it difficult for a working mother.
bad,began work and was laid off with no notice and just told we will call you when we need you.
bad,"Expectations were unbelievable. Management does not take time to develop themselves let alone their employees.They don't know how to but they do expect you to know what to do and how to do it. Politics is the ruling factor in advancement and you have to bust your hump daily in order to get a 'meets expectations' on your annual PA. All meetings are mandatory even if it's your day off. Those same meetings are poorly planned and organized so they tend to go over time. What a waste. Only take this job if you want to be brow beaten, lied to, and managed poorly. This is no exaggeration."
bad,"There's a reason this place is consistently rated at or near the worst places to work at in America. "
bad,They made you work overtime at least 5 hours on top of your shift. They even made you work more then that if it was mandatory. They didn't care about personal issues or if you already met your 5 hour overtime goal.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"I worked here for almost 8 years which turned out to be about 1 too many. The initial mom and pop type of culture was challenging but fun to work with, helping the company grow and develop. As the years went by the atmosphere morphed into a very greedy and ruthless environment where the senior level management team sought to expel free thinkers and respectful mid and lower level managers and replace them with psychophantic minions that operate in automaton fashion. The employee churn and dissatisfaction with this company are off the charts due to the company's attitude which is that they can never ask you to do too much or pay you too little to do it. If your young and seeking experience you will get it here but it will take its toll, just remember this place is just a pit stop and not a career - No one retires from Dish!"
bad,"There is not room for advancement unless you are willing to subjugate yourself to a boy's-club mentality. That is to say if you are a sycophant, Dish will be heaven; however, if you are a person with original thoughts or ideas on how to amplify productivity, you should seek employment at a corporation where originality is welcomed, not denigrated."
bad,A typical day is very frustrating. Upper management does not have a clue of what it takes to be successful. No one consults with front line managers and quality assurance personal. Too far behind in technology. Job performance based on metrics that employees have no control over. The enjoyable part was working with my co-workers and management staff at my location. Upper management has no clue of what is going on other than sorting through data that is very misleading.
bad,No work life balance. No real management.No room for advancement.
bad,"Management keep changing procedures on a weekly basis, informing and giving corrective warnings to people after they deviated from the new procedures that were implemented during the first shift and nobody share with the second. Oppressing and harassing employees who escalated their tier levels to have them resign and avoid pay their higher wages is SOP."
bad,"Inbound, only classroom training but nothing on hand, high accountability but no direction, management reserves the right for any account adjustments and is hard to find a manager able to help therefore in-call time suffers."
bad,Long hours and low pay. Could not depend on having a 40 hour week. Some weeks work was so slow I would only get 20 hrs. Management is a joke and offers more negativity than positivity. All of the helpful managers usually get fired because of branch politics. Would not recommend any who needs a stable and consistent income to work for them.
bad,DISH will continue to purge female leaders unless they address their horrible health insurance and complete lack of paid family leave. The boys club perpetuates & it is clear that the same cookie-cutter promotions will continue.
bad,"The worst place I have ever worked.  To survive you have to ""throw another staffer under the bus"".  Always threatened to be fired.  It does not matter how good of a job one does.  I witnessed a dedicated person who worked very late one night and came in the next morning 5 minutes late and was immediately fired.  Management just does not care (except the bottom line)..."
bad,Son personas que no apoyan al empleado y lo presionan mucho.
bad,"horrible management, long work hours, stressful environment.  not ideal if you have a family.  mandatory overtime, even on holidays. quantity over quality.  faulty equipment and software."
bad,They took as much money has they could from top performers. They mad us work in horrible weather conditions and had mandatory overtime to reach the mentioned salary.
bad,"Hours were great, job wasn’t  bad at all way better than most plant jobs it was just upper management was terrible and had their picks and chooses...."
bad,The management there is terrible. No one is on the same page when it comes to business rules and goals. They lack in training and mentorship but are quick to wright people up and terminate for bad performance.
bad,Some of the People were very helpful and some would not help when you asked for it. You had to fit in to there group or you were nothing there. Stressful
bad,"Poco pago"
bad,"All about sales, if you did not have an average of at least $30.00 per work order in up sales you were told to find other source of income.  Work orders were created by customer service stating that there was a need for a technician to go to customers home when there was no repair needed. "
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Projects are unsupported by management. Chaos wins over structure. Sr Managers and Directors are out to save themselves and if anything goes wrong will blame others on their own team. It is the Dish culture. If you like to operate this way there are opportunities for advancement and a decent paycheck.
bad,"Dying industry, micromanaged by corporate, any trip to the restroom must come from personal breaks or you face repercussions. Prizes offered as sales promotions do not make up for unethically poor health insurance."
bad,"Dish started out good then so many channel losses like HBO and Univision constant price changes on their customers and no support from management, stressful work environment not for the weak"
bad,dish network is by far the worst tv product out there. i couldn't say one good thing about the product or the company. They lied to customers on a daily basis about what their product could do.
bad,"Stressful to the point that most people just leave. They constantly change rules, and ask more and more without additional pay. Random mandatory overtime."
bad,"Honestly,"
bad,"I worked for Dish from 2011-2012 & had to quit due to an illness.  I loved the job so I went back to work there in 2017.  It is NOT the same employee friendly company that they try to portray, nor is the company truly focused on customer satisfaction.  They promote the fact that they have won JD Power award but they constantly change metrics to the point that you basically have to lie or refuse to help a customer in order to maintain a good tier ranking. If you need assistance, you will get a different answer from each coach that you talk to.  They came in and did a sweep of the building and fired employees that had been there for over 10 years & changed the job titles & positions of upper level management which only made things worse.  If you want a stress free job with good security then Dish is not the place for you."
bad,you all need to do better because this job is fun but not worth it. need to pay you techs a whole lot more. need to create better routes closer to home.
bad,"I was attracted to this job because of the ability to work from home and the fact that I have a small child. Other than that and now the flexible schedule choice (which can also be a draw back because it can Bev hard to get hours), there is nothing good about this job. It is one of the most stressful places I have ever worked at which says a lot since I worked in a jail. Their turn over rate is high, and they are always changing rules and regulations. One of the trainers has even said that they care about their customers first which is bad because when u take care of your employees they take care of your business. Do not work here."
bad,"They hire on a slew of people and don’t tell you that once the season slows down, they will pull the metrics which is impossible for most of the new hires to obtain the goal. Then wham you get canned! I was once called into a meeting with a random manager and he says “congrats you made it to the next level of training” moments later he says “never mind I was reading the wrong email” so unorganized and unprofessional. I was told that I met the goal but it wasn’t consistent. Only thing consistent was the customers calling in to cancel service. I had one customer that canceled service a yr ago but Dish kept charging her and she had to call continuously. Terrible business to work for. Some customers were really nice, others yikes. The pay wasn’t terrible.  They say you can move up the ladder in a few years lol that’s if you don’t quit or get the calls from the “dirty que” management knew very little and every time you have a question it’s like a pinball machine, just bounce around til you’re dizzy. My coach/sup. acted like he had all the answers, he’d say “let me check on that and I’ll get back with you” never to return. The policy is that you must do what’s best for the customer but they didn’t allow us to apply special discounts so that they can save money, unless the customer got irate and when you apply the discount, it counts against your metrics. It was a lose lose situation. It’s blind leading the blind with this company, it’s almost funny. But very sad how they get over on the customers, especially the long time/loyal customers."
bad,"They suck you in with the prospect of making 100k, which is attainable, but will be stymied immediately if too many people reach that goal.  Management has admitted they ""dirty"" call queue to keep metrics at a manageable level so they're not paying out as much on a weekly basis."
bad,"The VPN they created to have remote agents was terrible and the IT Specialists knew nothing. If everything in your home was working perfectly fine & your ISP said everything was great, they’d still blame your internet as being down when their VPN had issues. Even when other remote agents were having similar issues, they’d still blame everyone else. The IT Specialists aren’t even sure what equipment is compatible with the VPN or how to properly troubleshoot issues. "
bad,"I liked being a tech. I devoted a monstrous amount of time to Dish through weekly overtime and signing up for out-of-market jobs. I've worked from King of Prussia, PA to Maine. "
bad,If u like constantly being bullied by their customers with name calling and yelling then this is for u! Otherwise most don't last more than 3-6 months before theyve had enough
bad,The technician aspect of this job has been replaced by salesmanship to fund the future of dish. The very future that you are working towards at dish is one that will eliminate the technician job altogether. Dish also claims that they believe in a a work life balance which hasnt been true for some time. If you become a technician you will often work 12 hours plus per day and consistently having your manager ride you about selling items to customers that often do not have the money for. your employment status will always be threatened by your ability to convince some poor individual that they need to spend their last dime on a surround sound system. this profession. the salesman aspect has been pushed so far to make one feel as if theyre working for one of those sappy pyramid schemes with stories in training of how some individual in the middle of no where picked their sales figures to 50 dollars per work order. i would not and will not ever recommend anyone work here.
bad,"If you don't mind being berated in front of everyone on the floor, being treated like a grade schooler and having your commissions taken away from you then you should apply at dish."
bad,Only thing this company cares about is whether or not the technicians are pushing the On Site Sales to customers!!! Customer satisfaction and Quality work are under appreciated!
bad,"Dish was great when I first started, before the smart home sales and harassment from upper management. Now you're more of a saleman than a tech. If you can't meet your quota you will be harassed and eventually fired. They do not care about the install just sell sell sell."
bad,"Hours are not flexible - you are given a schedule that you cannot change and must work and if you leave more than 3 times you were fired. Which included if your kid or family member got sick, or if you got sick, or if life happened 3 days out of the year you were fired."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,after Working as a retention supervisor (lead/coach) the better part of 8 years I can honestly say I’m relieved to have moved on from Dish Thornton. Customer base vastly shrinking. Opportunities shrinking. Incredibly high turnover both voluntary & involuntary. Annual mass layoffs called “Talent Planning”. Health insurance covers nothing until large deductible met. Dishonesty and unethical behavior is recognized and rewarded financially. You will be competing against coworkers who work outside of guidelines. Management is very aware of this however these behaviors are condoned as they also have metrics to meet and bonuses to pursue. Job security is threatened regularly.  Was once told by my GM “If you can’t get your employees to work 10 hours of weekly overtime you’ll be replaced with someone who can.”   Same GM hides motives and transparency from underlings and keeps track of what teams express their feelings on “anonymous” quarterly engagement surveys as he once admitted during one of his rants in a meeting..  regularly Called us supervisors into his office to ask about “negative rumors at the smoke shack” because many people hate working under his system.  Could go on for days... save your time as Pay TV is a rapidly dying industry.  Scarce room for advancement here.  Old school management mentalities result in super low morale.  Although I was being paid decently the opportunity cost of advancing in a growing company with a future was high.  I’d give this place zero stars if I could.  On the positive side if you need a job DISH is always hiring! And now you’ll know why...
bad,"If you like people yelling at you, and don't have a conscience, you can do well. I really do not have anything else to say.   "
bad,It started off great. Because of the great leadership we had. Now that this bird brain is manager everything sucks. Shes so fake and all leads. Fake. They just change the comp plan again but still not good enough.. Im applying for other places because the energy at dish is bad.
bad,"A good way to get yourself into the tech field, and/or call centers, and get experience. You learn troubleshooting skills, customer service, and how to get yelled at, and not always take it personally. There is no culture, unless every man for himself, is a culture. One week overtime is mandatory, and the next week, hours are cut."
bad,there is one way to do things at DISH and they are not interested in improving their culture or the way they operate their business.  There is a complete lack of trust and a steady flow of high quality employees who leave the company.  It is very sad.
bad,Policies were never followed by management. they will fire you even when you haven't done anything wrong just because you don't fall into one of their clicks.
bad,Was a top agent for months in a row and still couldn’t stand the job. To many issues with management and money related problems. Managers seemed to not help during problems and there were too many untrained people working in a group which killed over all team abilities.
bad,"When hired they make you feel that you are very fortunate because you got the job and not any one would accomplish it. "
bad,"ive learned many different things regarding this company, typically worked 5 days a week, 30-40 hours. I loved that I got to make my own hours and also I love the work place atmosphere."
bad,Office moral was awful after a management change.  Failing business model was passed down to the line level by rapidly increasing the expectation without giving any training.  Sales expectations were unrealistic along with the pace and quality of work expected. The stress was overwhelming and the corporate culture from the top down is that you should feel lucky you have a job there.
bad,"Higher management was terrible, suicidal work environment and no job security. I don't want to talk more about this company. It is horrible to work for and at the Resource center was dismal."
bad,Don't believe them.  sales goals and expectations are ever changing with financial penalties for errors no mater how minor. Your time is much better spent elsewhere.
bad,Management will listen to calls and acknowledge there was nothing you can do to help the customer but discipline you because the customer was left satisfied with your service. But unsatisfactory options from the company.   High turnover rates. No work life balance ( even though they say they work with your schedule. I assure you everything said in the interview or beginning of orientation will be thrown out the window by the middle of the first / end of the second week of training
bad,"Top management, CEO on down, are all screamers.  Anything goes wrong they are quick to blame others, scream at you in meetings -- including the CEO, and they only care about the business, not the employees.  The CEO often waits by the lobby and tells people to go home if they enter past a certain time regardless of their excuse, even on snowy days.  People are belittled in front of others. CEO has no use for IT employees and makes it well known. Frequent layoffs."
bad,"Most of the management was horrible, a lot of them didn't know what they were doing and would regularly threaten employees. There are no paid sick days for at least 2 years. Overtime is sometimes mandatory, sometimes optional. It was very stressful. I found out they were closing down by the news report, several months later they told remaining employees."
bad,"You don't get to choose what kind of schedule you want, they constantly yell at you for not making sales quota, too much time on the phone, not follow scripts, etc. The only GOOD things about Dish was the pay and your co-workers."
bad,"If you are hired to be a technician, you will really be a salesman. You will be required to sell things to customers that they don't need and are generally overpriced. Managers were good, but they are under the thumb of their bosses, so they are forced to pressure you to sell. You, in turn, must pressure the customer to buy or you will lose your job at DISH."
bad,"Darned if you don't,and darned if you do work environment, constantly micromanaged.  Given goals that were not able to be reached in a regular work day."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Managers regularly misinform employees and perspective employees about job requirements and opportunities for advancement"
bad,"One if the worst companies I've ever worked for. Starting pay doesn't reflect the work you have to do. You get paid no extra for additional skills they teach you. The company is heavy on sales and is now moving into doing other things like appliance repair. Again, no boost in pay for learning these skills. Career advancement is virtually impossible"
bad,Working with DISH in the beginning was exciting. The management was completely supportive of the agents and that support carried through to help assist our customers.
bad,"There's a policy that HR is open door in case you have a concern related to your  work related ambience or a complain but no, they show that they work and help you once you felt you'll  be assisted by them, management already know what to do with you because of your complain... It's a controversy or against you if you speak up even more if your complain goes against Company's policies, this affect Managers dating employees, Favoritism among supervisors and associates, no salary raises to hard working people, but Management's party friends, they get good non-earned raises.. That's sad because they want us keep our mouth shut! It's worthless to participate on CONFIDENTIAL Surveys online, because they're supposed to be (CONFIDENTIAL) when they era NOT! we don't  see the need to log in with our employee ID?"
bad,"Very stressful working environment"
bad,"Small chance of upward mobility at call center, poor training, lack of support from management, forced to leave if call volume is low, rude customers."
bad,"Typical day consisted of listening to customers complain about the overseas customer service, programming their remotes, and installing their system.  Don't think you are in this just for the cable install, you will learn internet as well.  Want a different skill set?  They are going to force you to learn how to work on washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, and ovens.  You will do this, because this company is subcontracting itself out to the entire world to do odd jobs.  Work conditions do not matter to senior management, most of which have never performed your job, so you will be outside digging holes regardless if there are wind chill advisories, or if it is 100+ degrees.  The training is good, but afterwards you are expected to break company policy to complete jobs, as metrics are the only thing that matter in this company.   You will be forced to sell overpriced goods that customers can find on Amazon for half the price, and the goals are always increasing because the company cannot spend money correctly.  You may have to drive 2+ hours to complete a job, because your neighboring office cannot seem to train their employees to obtain the same certifications as your office, and you will be expected to complete the same work as the others, regardless of drive times.  If you are single, go for this job.  The pay was decent, and you receive a small amount of vacation time.  There were several days I did not see my son, as I was out of the house, and back in while he was in bed.  In the winter, expect your check to be half of what a summer check is."
bad,This was a terrible job most of the time. My trainer was amazing but that didn't make up for the terrible management and procedures that Intertech practiced.
bad,"it seem like they all were out to write you up even when thing were be on ones control"
bad,"It's hard but rewarding work. Used to be a really good place to work for but they decided to make technicians sales persons and base your performance on how much did you upsale dayli. No matter how good of a technician you are, if you didn't upsale anything to a 80 y/o lady on welfare or a customer that doesn't speak English, you will get in trouble and written up. Terrible management. All they care about is numbers and sales. Wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,They don’t care about their employees. They are random about everything they do. When they shut down the shift I was working we were given 4 days to “make a decision” if we were going to switch shifts or not. A lot of people weren’t even given that option.
bad,Dish Receivers are the worst in the industry and their version of how they want their Customer Service Reps. to resolve issues is irresponsible at best.
bad,go work at mcdonalds first..do u want fries with that? All the want you to do is sell stuff you can get at walmart cheaper.You are not an installer anymore you are a salesman.
bad,"In a typical day the expectation of management upon their technicians was completely unrealistic.  While their training was thorough, once technicians entered the field it was unspoken but expected that they cut corners and work as quickly as possible below standard."
bad,"Completely unorganized, I have been with Dish for 5 years and in the past year the company has gotten out of control. The management staff is very uninvolved with their staff. Everyday is like walking on pins and needles since they’ve introduced quartetly performance appraisals. There is a absolutely no consistency, one week you have one coach and the next you have another and they expect someone to evaluate your work after only working under them for a short amount of time so the information you get in regards to your performance is very conflicting. Dish used to be great place to work but I’ve given up and cannot wait to find employment with another company."
bad,"DISH was one of the worst experiences I ever had. The pay was low and their attendance policy was beyond strict as far as days off are concerned. PTO must be used for any and every situation, including emergencies. Management was the worst. No leadership there. Only time anyone would hear from their manager or supervisor was if something bad happened. Direction was never provided by leadership but instead from coworkers. Promises were constantly broken from the beginning when I first started working there. The hardest part of the job becomes not being able to trust your own leadership/management. I was warned by veteran coworkers that shady practices took place there, such as being punished for calling in, which i became a victim of when I was sick for a day. Upon my return I was sent to one of the worst departments there without reason or warning.  There is commission but is distributed unfairly as some departments are offered this incentive and others are not, despite the work demand being the same."
bad,Worked at a call center. Awful work environment. Dish is all about the almighty dollar. Do not be fooled with the high reviews. High turnover is the most accurate measurement. That's why the high premiums for benefits. Don't expect raises. Opportunities are questionable. If you like putting the company before your family then this is your place. Good place for a student without family.
bad,"This place is awful to work for. Not only do they not care about the people they provide service for, they don't care about the people who work for them. they skip bonuses and raises when you've already begun the work. they force you to stay on the phone with a customer and be unethically bombarded with swearwords and unexcusably treated like dirt."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"I had a great first year, then one of the company's most respected executives left. Things changed quickly after that. The work environment become one of apathy toward company employees.  I don't have enough time to describe how much people had been poorly treated there."
bad,muy mal ambiente de trabajo y no hay posibilidad de crecimiento.
bad,company never really could get behind it's enterprise sales team. constant team management changes. lack of internal sales support and an unwillingness to set a course and let it play out. changed focus every 6 months in an environment that had a 6 to 12 month sales cycle.
bad,"Requires a certain mindset and skill.  You have to tolerate a great deal from customers.  Management including coaches are the most  important and volatile part of the job.  Having had to go through many management changes is very frustrating, as getting used to the differences of expectations is very obnoxious.  However; that also goes for career advancement, many people change positions and promotions are earned for good service, attendance, and again, on the luck of who you get as a coach.  Good service, sadly, is rewarded with priority routing which means if you provide great service, more work and responsibility is given to you. Your teammate could sit available (doing nothing) for several hours while you can't get more than a breath between calls."
bad,"Una gran empresa con crecimiento y desarrollo del personal se nos actualizaba con cursos de capacitación y actualizacion de conocimientos gerenciales"
bad,"Dish is full of micromanagers and many of the managers ignore most of the more basic management tools. "
bad,"Work 24/7 leave at dark home at dark"
bad,"be a quick learner,u only get 6-7min to Q/A calls,what ever your lead tells u,or any paperwork they have you sign, get a copy of.they do shift bids.don't miss days that are not perplaned as they will take it from your vacation days and it is held against u,if u are going to be sick you have to plan for it 24hrs before,they act like they care about where you are going in the company, but you have to know someone to really get a chance to advance"
bad,Great company for customers and terrible for employees. I've seen experienced sales reps terminated for saying one wrong word on a phone call. regardless of track record.
bad,If you enjoy feeling like everyday could be your last day working because you might be fired this job is for you.  The careless about you.  You are only a number
bad,Horrible. Stay away from DISH. They are consistently ranked among the worst Fortune 500 companies to work for. The CEO is a sociopath and they treat their employees like s|aves. Just stay away.. or find out for yourself!
bad,"The manager is really really unprofessional, if you disagree with her is about time that you will be fired. Never never use this option as a firsts, use this option only if you are really desespérate."
bad,If you aren't good at selling things dont even bother applying. That's all that they push and if you dont make sales then they will just let you go.
bad,El tiempo ke trabaje con dish estuve bien a gusto por motivos de salud renuncie peo hoy estoy al cien para volver a trabajar y salir adelante
bad,"I started with Dish after moving from the oilfield. Everything going started well, but I quickly learned to watch out for those around me. I was moving to a new city and could not afford an apartment, so I was sleeping out of my car, I was told by my HR manager I would be fired if this continued and they offered to let me bring my camper and set it up on company property. This lasted a week before I was told I would have to move it. Then, I was told my company sponsored insurance would cover my son's health issue by my HR representative, it did not. When I complained I was told I was stuck with the insurance and I should have read the 400 something page manual to be sure. I HAD TO FACT CHECK EVERYTHING!!! You can not trust anyone as there is absolutely no integrity from management. Record all phone calls because they will deny everything. I got in trouble for calling to complain my bill was screwed up after giving my manager and HR person six months to fix it and was given a final warning as my first ever write up. Then, they created some bogus investigation into my conduct stating I had harassed someone and they had a dozen witnesses. I was put on two weeks of paid leave, at which point I was terminated for performance, and nothing about the investigation was cited. Funnily enough, two days after my termination I was awarded Manager of the Month for my performance. I was promised a 4 day work week, that lasted one month before my office went on mandatory 5th days due to not being able to attract new talent. We were told it would stop once we were staffed, but upper management"
bad,"great hands on occupation, but company makes mandatory certification and responsibilities for no compensation. also this company pays less then all its competitors"
bad,Dish is a cut throat company at which  you do not dare speak your mind with regard to improvements or drawbacks effecting your job. Decisions regarding crucial aspects of your job are made by people at corporate or in the call center (Littleton) have absolutely no clue as to what the job actually entails. They operate and motivate with an atmosphere of fear that you will be fired.  Nothing is ever good enough for them and their metrics/stats goals are nothing short of ridiculous for providing good customer service.  Managers act like wardens and essentially do very little except socialize with each other. They care nothing about their employees except how it relates to their bonuses and status.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,If you want to work for a company that doesn't care about their employee's or a job security this is the company to work for. The management a lot of times is crooked and the supervisors that are actually good they tend to let go. If management doesn't like you or feel you don't fit in with them they will find a way to fire you.  In the QA department they want you to tell on your co workers for Facebook post and want you to give ideas that they take credit for in the end.
bad,long work hours. under appreciated for work or time the job required. management was poor at best. training was questionable.
bad,"This is the worst company ever to work for, the installing is great, i loved the work, but the company, dish is going broke because of netflix, and they are trying to make up the loss by so called smart home services, just basically selling junk and trinkets to you whether you want them or not. I wouldnt work for them again ever. The last straw was when our leader, c.e. stated that if the customer is over 60, they better buy something or you will. Crooks to the end."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Managers are a joke. No work/home balance. People getting fired for personal reasons all the time, no trust, always being tracked by gps and questioned about any move you make. No help from managers."
bad,"Any employer who calls you within hours of you applying and immediately puts you through training is just looking for warm bodies to fill a position. They don't actually care about you personally. There is only one manager at this location who truly cares about the employees, the rest only take pleasure in treating you like dirt. The highers up managers are corrupt and demeaning. I witnessed employees being cussed at and talked down to constantly. The metrics they measure your performance are completely ridiculous, unachievable, and it's my opinion that they're made that way on purpose. A typical route can send you over an hour away to do a job that will only take half an hour and then another hour away again. If you take too long at a job, you get yelled at. If you take too little time, you get yelled at. As a technician you are expected to be a sales man as well and if you don't sell their stuff, you get yelled at. Half the time customers aren't home or don't speak English and management does not care about any of it, they view it as your problem. Don't bother applying and don't waste your time with this location. Dish may be a good company to work for, but this location is awful."
bad,This company doesn't treat you with respect they constantly tear you down. It's bad enough the customers treat you poorly with their rude and ignorant and ridiculous requests. Your superiors constantly nag you to death and never tell you good job at anything. They keep you so stressed out with their constant business changes and rules being changed just to trick you up into doing something the wrong way. They constantly tell you how much better the overseas agents are then the US agents. There's no advancement unless you are buddy buddy with  management. If your not in their little click in Bluefield WV you can forget about advancement. The  unemployment office in this area stated they get about 10-15 dish employees weekly applying for benefits due to wrongful termination! The day I quit was one of the best days of my life! It lifted so much stress off of me it felt like I was free!! Think twice before wasting your time applying with this company. It's funny that when I started there over 5 years ago the pay was so much higher then now they are barely paying minimum wage. Its a complete joke!
bad,"Company seems to be good to work for, but its not what it seems behind closed doors if you will. Once hired, there are many shift changes they put you through, schedules are always being changed, days off moved around, seemed to care more about making sure you read the script right instead of helping the customer."
bad,"More numbers focused and not people focused. Although my role when i began was more techinical in nature, by the end it was more that of a salesman."
bad,"I really enjoyed getting to meet the customer and seeing the work my technician did. Making customer's happy was the best part."
bad,"The best part of my job is my team members. "
bad,"It started as a customer service position then they started to change schedules, shifts, everything. at the end they changed positions completely to technical support."
bad,"Uncertain hours, poor job routing, and overworked employees are all exciting things to expect if you are looking to work for this company.  The top-down management structure will leave you pounding your head off a desk in only a few months, and your feedback will fall on the deaf ears of all managers. Expect to do fifteen hour days and then be sent home when there isn't any work. Expect to fight against all sense of your own wisdom and reason as you are forced to abide by a slew of nonsensical corporate policy. And expect to get written up all the time for not hitting metrics that are completely out of your hands. If this sounds good to you go ahead and apply, otherwise I recommend looking elsewhere."
bad,"I worked for them for over 8 yrs. The longer you are there, it feels like they want you out. Managent is a joke. Everyone in management are in their own inner circle."
bad,"Co-Workers were wonderful."
bad,"Not much career growth opportunities,  not good work life balance"
bad,"NO job security. The company only cares about numbers, not customer service. You get promoted only by knowing the right people."
bad,Pressured into sales. Pi is rigged. Would never suggest anyone to work here.
bad,A company run on management by intimidation. Non-existant communication from management and senior managment team that fails repeatedly to follow policies. Very high stress levels and an extemely high turn-over rate at all levels. I really appreciated some of my team.
bad,"Floors were dirty, no one ever smiled.  Management always walked the floors with mean looks on their faces. I liked the organization of tasks, it was easy to take calls, but the technical advisors, as I was shouldd have been more knowledgeable."
bad,"Waking up at 4:30 in the morning Friday, Saturday and Sunday just to be at by 5:00 am. The experience was a good one. I did in fact learn a lot but just doing the same process day by day became over whelming."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Was a long term employee for over 12 years. I was let go without even being provided a reason.
bad,"I had a horrible experience at Dish Network. They have been rated as one of the worst companies to work for. Ever since that report came out of the worst ratings, they we dedicated to fixing it for a while, but this company is founded on their profit, not employees. They keep adjusting the ways to provide more for their workers and then adjusting it so they don't have to provide. They are constantly changing policies on how you get paid, how to make your bonus, and how they grade you as an employee. As for job security you can also forget it. Their management isn't that great, although they do have really good people in management. I found it hard to get anything done sometimes with their management."
bad,"There are several things that are left to be desired.  The pay from around here is better than some but on average, is 63% less pay than other centers for the specialty departments.  The benefits are not great but I am sure they could be worse but if one of my family gets sick and needs a doctor, most of the money after living expenses and benefits withdrawal goes to that visit for the next month or so.  The upper management in this area is typically happy. It seems as though each person is still just a number in a crowd as most of the money that comes into the center goes towards acquisition of new employees and then it seems every Spring, Summer, and Fall there is a firing spree to keep stats up.  Once you get to a certain pay amount, you become expendable to save money.  I am still in the yellow as they have not given me a pay raise in a few years due to one reason or another...there always is a reason."
bad,This place was awful and I would NEVER work there again.  Management is full of idiots.
bad,open to discuss...there are reasons that Dish is rated the worst company in America to work for the last two years running
bad,"this company has no values, and will work you like a slave. there is no work life balance. they want the job done, even if it endangers your life."
bad,Did not really like this place. Being a mother there was no way to balance family and work in this company
bad,"Aprendi puestos nuevos y a usar programas como el exel."
bad,Not a match for my skills and personality.  There was no job satisfaction as all aspects of the job were micro managed.
bad,"Management is horrible..for some reason they think every call should be a sale..even if the customer cannot qualify or doesn't have a debit or credit card...Shady shady people...also walked in on a supervisor doing some lines off the bathroom counter..that was interesting...Some sales supervisors have no sales experience, but know the right people...constantly tell you it is your fault if you don't sell. The EXTRA TIME...not OT, is extreme to put it nicely. Management always talks down to the sales reps.... All that being said..I have to say, it is or can be a fun job talking about television all day...Getting free DISH service is nice..But for what you have to put up with...ABSOLUTELY not worth it...look for another job, sales jobs are all over, especially out in AZ... Funny thing is not one employer is surprised when you explain to them you're leaving DISH.. "
bad,Don't work there unless you have no choice.
bad,"As an Inside Sales Associate, I was ""coached"" to do some very dirty and unethical practices. ""Make people feel guilty for not having programming on Christmas morning"" said one coach. Another changed downgraded the customers equipment and programming, without telling the customer and after I had read legal disclosures, because the customer didn't have enough money for the first month in her account. They preached a 20 minute relationship. After that, the customer was ""someone else's problem"". I sat with the most successful sales reps and they LIE so much it makes an ethical person sick. Earned the title as Worst Company to Work for. Look it up, they earned that title. Something like an 88% first year attrition rate. That is hard to accomplish."
bad,"This company just needs to fold and go out of business. Its a joke. At the morning meetings, instead of uplifiting, promoting speech's, you get ""who wants to get fired today?"" (really) Management is the worst, no College degree managers, such as my buisness degree in accounting, just red necks with no management skills whatsoever. I believe my supervisor is 8th grade approved, with no teeth. FSM. No direction or steering, I swear it's like Jack Sparrow runs the place. Just Bad. But the company turnover rate is awesome, almost 99% turnover. Just use the free training and get a contractor job."
bad,"Dish Network had to have been my worst job ever. Managment could care less about anything other than numbers. Very unorganized place to work for with SOME lazy leads and supervisors, and not much team work."
bad,"This company is awful to work for they say a lot in the interview but none of it is true. They say its easy to get promoted, if you're perfect for 90 days straight, don't drive 100's of miles, and pray that customers like you. Maybe you'll get promoted. If you go in as a field service specialist don't even think you'll become a manager. It won't happen! And if you are told we will see what we can do there not doing anything. They string you along and then crush your hopes. If you want to transfer to a different place in the company ie dish to EchoStar good luck, if your good at your job they pretend they never saw it, it tell ask if you are sure you want to or should we take care of the customers. Promised easy bonuses don't count on it. And be ready not to see your family they work you like a dog and pay you nothing for it! Oh and if you like to constantly wonder if you'll have a job it's a good place to work. Unless you're really hard up for a job don't come here. If you have other offers pick one of them not dish."
bad,Company is run very poorly. Management does not like to promote. Pay is very low for comparable positions at other companies. Good place to get experience straight out of college if you don't have better opportunities. No long-term career here. Sinking ship.
bad,This company pay's poorly. Tells you there is a chance for bonus and makes it impossible to reach. Forces you to subscribe to their service. Managers physically touch you. Managers are uneducated and mircomanage. Petty rules. Constant intimadation. Not allowed to use restroom even in emergencies. Escorts people out of building when fired or quit. Threatens employees with calling police. Changes your job responsibilites and if you dont accept fires you. They are not growing. They have a high turnover because of their policies and lie to you to get you to accept job. Medical benefits don't cover anything and are very expensive. Do yourself a favor and get a job at a place that appreciates you and doesnt treat you like a slave robot.
bad,"70+ hours a week , low hourly wage. Very young and poor management."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,I hated this job due to the people and the amount of time that I was away from the family.
bad,Dish upper management doesn’t care about their employees. All Dish cares about is sales and not making the employee happy or feel like he or she belongs. Dish will chew you up an spit you out if you’re not selling. Dish cares more about what a person says when he or she calls in on a Drivers alert. I wouldn’t recommend working for Dish to anyone.
bad,"Never go for this company. Lot of layoff and job insecurity. In management, there are no leaders only boss and managers who knows only to threat you on your job and plays only blame game."
bad,"After 3.5 years of working there our 3 Field Supervisors, Assistant Manager, General Manager, and Regional Manager, were terminated due to forcing techs into a scam that defrauded Dish Network. Afterwards we were promised an hourly raise after the first of the year for the company to fire all but one tech who was able to train new techs. Men with 10+ years of service let go insignificant reasons"
bad,I enjoyed taking calls and helping the customers with their bills and tech issues. The work culture however was not great. Verbal abuse from customers when they didn't get what they want was allowed and supervisors and managers did not like to help the agents at all.
bad,"The managers are very toxic people. They’ll be there in a crisis but they’ll never have your back. I have seen good dish tech leave because of dishes toxic environment. I have also seen good tech get "
bad,The management never was on the same page. You bounce from manager to manager. The only way to advance is to suck up and being a good employee means nothing.
bad,"The job started out like any other call center job, stressful but manageable. Over the years it has only gotten worse and worse. No control over your shift at all, it changes every 3 months to whatever the company decides to hand you. Always in queue never a time to catch your breath. Customers are your standard customers. Some good but mostly negative and rude. Prepare to be yelled at all day every day back to back. Managment is a joke, broken tools, bad metrics, and you can be written up for anything. Overall I give this company a 1 as there is no way to rate it lower."
bad,"The company constantly changes metrics which are then used to avoid paying annual raises or bonuses. Supposed to be ""open door"" but actually do not want any questions or suggestions.  The management do not want people who wish to advance a career or who are actually wanting to be interactive with their job.  It was revealed after hire that they prefer people with no education or job experience and who will only do what they are told without trying to actually help the customer.  You are abused by customers regularly with no support from supervisors.  Most of the team leads were not available to actually help.  The training is in depth but not applied to actual customer service.  It is all about getting them off the phone as soon as possible."
bad,You are told only what they think you want to hear or just negative comments in general.  One of the worst jobs I have ever had..Lifespan of an agent is approximately 18 mos.
bad,"Job lacks good management, I work 8 hours daily going back to back on calls, learned how to work professionally in a fast paced environment and developed excellent customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was dealing with poor management. the most enjoyable part of the job is talking to the customers on the phone."
bad,"Pay was great, but as a cable technician I shouldn't have to sell dish network's garbage extra items. Selling the stuff wasn't optional, you either sell $31 per job average or you get wrote up. Ridiculous travel times and if they tell you you'll be local? They're lying."
bad,"The division I worked for was overruled with politics and decisions made for the interest of individuals, not their employer. "
bad,I'm happy to be gone. The only thing that kept me there was a pay check. I moved on and would never go back even if i lost my current job. Nothing more to say.
bad,"Dish doesnt care about its employees. I was blessed to have a great field coach who supported me and wanted to help me out. It was unfortunate that management sees you as a dollar sign and not a person. You are rushing to jobs all day to complete them in the time allowed for you. If you are at a job too long it negatively affects your metrics then in turn you are looked upon badly. This job is for somebody who likes to be a cheesy car salesman but also work so quickly you are literally sprinting to get the job done while trying to upsell parts. It was so stressful and management is not understanding if you have difficulties. This is more of a sales job than a tech job. Do yourself a favor and dont work here you will hate it, Also the 4 days on and 3 days off thing is a big lie because you will be working likely 6 days a week and over 12 hours a day most days. Now work/life balance and management really does not care if you left. They hire and fire here for a reason."
bad,Company only cares about extra non dish service products. A poor job and customer experience are fine as long as you sell high dollar amounts of sound systems and very overpriced other products.
bad,"Long hours for ""Extra Bonus Pay"" otherwise low pay, intense stress and calls are listened to for any errors.  Errors result in exponentially increasing ""Bonus Pay"" penalties. Little coaching or mentoring."
bad,"Dish is an average company to work for, it had a terrible work life balance, and my paychecks were inconsistent. The workplace culture was terrible and it had a very high turnover rate."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,The atmosphere promoted by senior leadership and the owner is repressive and authoritarian.  There is no empowerment; only management by fear. It's also a dying industry.
bad,"Dish manages numbers, not people. Was there for 10 years, but only because I had child support to worry about. Great product, but horrible place to work."
bad,i have no comments on my time at dish other then i did not enjoy working for a company that sets unrealistic goals and consistently puts down workers who are not in their top 25%
bad,all they care about is you getting sales. they don't care how you work or the customers. if you don't get sales are take to long on some jobs even its not your fault then the deroute you. you don't work for days sometimes. worst place every.  whats crazy is i work there and i have directv.
bad,"Training was a nightmare they were so disorganized and expect you to work a split shift. For example they would want you to work 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and come back at 4 to 9 p.m. so basically you have no life ever! They only want to pay you $11.50 an hour for this craziness."
bad,"This place is not great, but does work as a stepping stone.  You can earn a lot of money in sales if you perform well.  Not for everyone, but I averaged about $2k a week for six months and moved on as soon as I got a chance."
bad,"Indeed wouldn't even let me submit my review.  What does that tell you?"
bad,This job was very inconsistent. It had weird hours where you would work your normal set hours but they would call you to say you had to work on your days off and it was mandatory. It was never consistent and they would penalize you if you could not make it.
bad,"The only good thing about the job was decent health benefits and 401k plan. The work itself, the hours, the environment, and management, were all to be desired and lacking on all fronts. There was a very high turnaround for field technicians, and for these very reasons. The entire over one and a half years that I worked there until I left, I was the most recent retained field technician. All others after me came and went. That says something."
bad,"Originally told the working hours would be 4 days a week @ 10 hours a day. The hours per day was give or take but, the days wound up being 5 days a week often over 12 hours a day. This coupled with poor management would lead me to never ask someone to to work there."
bad,"a lot of personnel rotation due management , and work schedule is terrible. when a worker comes back to work after a work related injury the company fires you."
bad,This is a job where you have no job security. It's a very stressful environment management doesn't take into consideration the overall business performance versus what they want you to match. Very unwilling to work with any type of medical issue that requires FMLA
bad,"imagine being out in the field waiting for a manager to help you, well the managers are busy flying drones in the warehouse in Brooklyn park.   good luck"
bad,"I originally started working for this company as just a part time and temporary job. I moved and started working full time, but it just seems like all that happens there is that they take advantage of me and what I do and keep adding more work with no extra pay or motivation. It is so frustrating and just super tiring. One good thing is a normal work week is only 4 days, but they are from 10-12 hours. It feels like the higher ups just don't know what all is done at the lower levels."
bad,"I loved my job. Had 3 weeks of bad scores but worked there for a year with some of the highest scores in my sections. Was ""fired"" and they tried to make it sound as if they were laying me off. I filed for unemployment benefits only to get penalized and that's when I found out they fired me, not laid me off. I fought them and won my case cause they couldnt provide ANY grounds for termination. I did some research...they are a failing company. People are not paying for tv anymore. So they hire like crazy through ""busy season"" get yoy hooked in just to lay you off. I wouldnt make this your career company."
bad,If you are trying to support a family don't work at dish. The advancement was based on parameters called a pi chart. It was impossible to hit your numbers in the area I worked. A guy that worked there for 10+ years told me he couldn't maintain the numbers they wanted me to acquire.
bad,"When I took the job, I was told I'd have Friday and Saturday off.  I didn't mind since I was working nights, but once I started, I was told I'd have Monday and Wednesday off.  Apparently they tell everyone that.  Required a Wonderlic test for a warehouse position, which didn't mean anything.  Pulling orders wasn't hard, just incredibly tedious, but having to inventory trucks everyday in the blistering heat was unacceptable.  It wasn't a quick 5 minute count; every truck took an obscene amount of time, with most items on the truck being discontinued, so it was a waste of time counting those items.  The warehouse manager was a nice guy, but he had a severe limp from working on those concrete floors all day and he works years to get that position.  Employees were nice but depressed, which is probably why they give you free Dish service.  Those poor techs were ran into the ground."
bad,"I went back to the service industry because dish tainted my view of corporate life so badly, I don't care to ever return. Upper management speaks to employees as if they were their children (I was chastised for smiling in an informal, weekly meeting)."
bad,"Very stressful job, having to deal with customers of any form. Weird things were happening with management. I learned how rude and disrespectful people can be. Workplace wise was dirty, had wipe stand, but were always empty. Everyday was a different schedule. Hardest part of the job was just constantly getting yelled at by people and not being able to do anything about it."
bad,Start by looking at work orders and making sure you have enough equipment for the day. From installing dish's to problem solving as well as helping other technicians.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"This company requires sales reps to pass two tests in training with 80% which is not very difficult.  "
bad,I have nothing at all good to say about this place your just a person to fill sits until they're tired of you they have groups of new people starting every week or two that's why the always on the internet hiring site because they're turnover rate is off the chart your always threaten to be let  go for something unrealistic metrics and management is horrible. Don't let the money fool you because this is by far the most horrible company to work for and they train you to be scripted to lies to the customer
bad,Expect to work 60+ hours a week plus coming in on your days off. Leads are for the most part unprofessional and work environment is depressing. They hand out redbulls to keep everyone going. Break and lunch times are super strict. If you have to go to the bathroom that comes out of your break time. You cannot be off a call more than 20 seconds. Very toxic environment; I was so relieved to leave.
bad,Not a good fit for any female candidates. A very gender discriminatory environment. Long hours and not enough compensation for what you do. The added stress of being female in an environment that is completely sexist and gender discriminatory will burn you out fast if the long hours and low compensation for the amount of work you will do do not first. The training isn't enough because new employees who have been there a short time and don't fully understand their positions are the ones who will do the majority of your training if hired. The culture of the work site in Grain Valley Mo. lacks ethical values in terms of addressing gender based discrimination and harassment properly and this type of discrimination and harassment is promoted by the culture of the environment as set forth by management.
bad,"I enjoyed the people that worked there. Very phsically demanding job though. Entered data pertaining to smart cards, received in material that customers no longer wanted, palletized material that was received in. Extremely hot in the summer, and extremely cold in the winter."
bad,huge amounts of favoritism. any time you need help from management with treatment or a supervisor you are blown off. you will only advance if your supervisor WANTS to let you get training. I was written up for taking a family member to the hospital. There is little to no communication and a constant worry over layoffs
bad,"Pressure from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave. Always afraid to say something wrong on the phones because someone is always listening and waiting to catch you, that's how they make their money. You have to be careful and make sure that the people listening are not making things up, they'll do it and you get blamed for it."
bad,the managers pressured call center workers to make up-sales for good weekly reports. call times were set to a ridiculously low time mark and going over look bad on you.
bad,Management not very experienced. Cut throat politics there.   Teammates and my manager clients were good to work with. Benefits were not very good compared to Echostar.
bad,"your schedule revolves around dish, your job is held over your head if you have any issues whatsoever, benefits are poor and dont cover mental health."
bad,"Great pay, benefits could be better. Was promoted to Senior Account specialist within 6 months of working there, but they have tiers that if you violate them they will take some of your commission and knock you down levels to get less calls."
bad,"My typical day at work with Dish Network was a fast paced environment. Calls was coming back and forth, some customers was completely rude. The bosses do not care about your family or any issues you had. The only good thing about that job was the pay."
bad,"This job is not worth taking. You will constantly worry about job security and be very hesitant to make an life moves/ decisions. Management is a joke overall and are more than willing to throw an entire office under the bus if it means prolonging their career. Offices get shutdown with no notice and lies abound. Beware of this company."
bad,The hours are terrible and management is downright terrible they are heartless and only care about sales. They strongly encouraged skipping lunches to speed along your route
bad,Management no guided or guiding with work force.  Actual work is not bad however the management group creates a less than positive work environment to the installers.
bad,Una empresa que me abrió las puertas pero por baja de trabajo y pago por comicion su baja afecto nuestra economía
bad,Typical day at work was answering calls back to back ad reaching a daily goal of sales that we closed. Management was very poor and only cared about the numbers and not you. The hardest part about this job was the mandatory overtime. We had to do mandatory overtime for 4 months when it was only supposed to be 3 weeks.
bad,This company doesn't appreciate the employee's. They are always having techs quieting. If u don't sale product's you will get fired. You have alot of responsibilitiesy for low pay.
bad,"Everything in this organization has a core sense of fear because the founder and CEO instills that throughout the whole organization. People don't trust one another and throw each other under the bus in order to advance. People are afraid to make real decisions to help customers because there is no benefit for succeeding, and only punishment if you fail"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"When I first started working with the company it was difficult. 15-17 hour days with the expectation of being back in the morning for the start of another day at 7am. Without the management team that existed I wouldn't of stuck around for more than 2 weeks. It was good for a few years while our local office manager absorbed all the nonsense from the upper management and allowed us to laugh at their ignorance in the morning meetings and instead coached us to be morally decent human beings and gave us flexibility to do our jobs and provided us a positive work environment where people spent time even off the clock. "
bad,"I enjoyed training at DISH Network, however after training was finished and we were assigned teams to work on, it all went erratic. My supervisor didn't do what was required to let me succeed in the company. I just needed a half hour difference to make it to work late he refused. After a week and a half of speeding through traffic trying to make it to work they let me go for being late, ignoring my previous plees to adjust my schedule."
bad,"Use dish like they plan on using you, as a stepping stone. I'm not going to go into big detail just know this, dish has twice in the last five years been voted the worst company to work for in America. Terrible ethics, terrible management, absolute trash turnover rate near 95% for technicians. And the pay is garbage, compared to other companies in the same industry dish pays technicians $6 less to start and you don't get raises."
bad,"If you want to work long days and be yelled at by management when you return from working out in the heat or cold, this is for you! They started off by telling me I would work 4 days, off 3. Maybe my first couple weeks it was like that, then after that I was working 5 and 6 days at about 12 hours a day, they have something called a ""volunteer schedule"", I never volunteered to work extra days, but my name somehow popped up on it almost EVERY WEEK from then on! More like VOLUNTOLD!"
bad,Not a very organized environment. It lacks leadership skills. No motivation with the specific supervisor I've worked with. A typical day would come down to the workers keeping up with quality and quota. My co workers where great. We all worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was when we couldn't hit quota due to technical issues with machinery. The most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks and interacting with my co workers. Also the luncheons we'd have.
bad,"Understand that Dish Network does not care at all about its employees.  "
bad,"Horrible work environment, no communication with any leads or upper management, they retroactively implement new changes and can fire you for something that was not set in place months prior. They expect you to work overtime, if you deny it you are on the list. Call expectations constantly change ( who could understand that HUMAN error can happen) "
bad,"working on the phones was hard, got promoted but only by sheer luck"
bad,"I have had two years of experience in the manufacturing center in El Paso, TX within multiple departments: Engineering, Test Engineering, production, IT, and maintenance. "
bad,Overall compensation was really good but the expectations and goals were not realistic.
bad,I was laid-off from Dish Network Nov. 2013. The pay was very good. I would have still been there if the department wasn't closed. Never really felt secure there and the lay-off proved my intuition was correct
bad,"Training was fun. They made everything seem awesome. When I actually got on the floor I was in for a rude awakening. The supervisors are so unprofessional. I had a supervisor lie to me to get me off the phone because I was on that particular phone call too long. That was the final straw. Their metrics are insane. I never had problems with QA scores, but it's the only place I've ever worked where I just couldn't meet the call time. And oh did I hear about it. "
bad,"I made money working in this company but I didnt have free time to do anything else. Manager (coach) are not professional at all, they are simple people they do not have experience or degress. It is a mess and hard to work enviroment."
bad,"You work 4 10 hour days which sounds great. Your day is never over. They sit in the office and keep giving you one more call. Even our service manager could not wait to leave the company. After installing wires under and around homes they want you to demo a $400 sound bar, and sell anything you can sell. The greed is horrible. These all count against your numbers. After you get back to the shop they white glove the van and treat you like you did something wrong if they find dirt. You don't leave until they approve. I'm an adult treat me like one. I was hired as a remote tech with a van. If your numbers aren't perfect they take the van away and make you drive to the office every day. Again punishment. Everyone was miserable. It could be a great job but they micro manage every move you make."
bad,"Orientation was good and informative, help getting started and securing leads never happen. training was not present"
bad,poor work environment with a lack of communication and general knowledge of field from management
bad,"Almost all managers at the call center have poor management skills, no experience and even willingness to learn. You can come to work and talk to your co-worker all day long, have lunch, go out for coffee, then do some work at the end of the day and you can get away with this for years."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"A typical day at DISH is dealing with all of the chaos. There are constant power plays against each other and politics is the name of the game. Charlie may talk about Theory X and Theory Y, but I think the more apt comparison is to a giant Skinner Box."
bad,"High stress level, schedule changes on a whim, contantly changing job description and requirement, advancement to an unwanted position is eventually forced upon workers, extremely low morale and little reward for continued exceptional performance."
bad,"company had to many chiefs and not enough indians.the left hand did not know what the right was doing, no communication, very disorganized."
bad,"Good for learning a new skill and then moving on to a new company.Extremely high turn over (mostly quiting). Job constantly being threatend. Upper management bullys managers, thus managers bully techs. Certain clicks get the easier jobs with higher bonus. The best part of the job is the customers and being out of the office. Worst part is management and having to audit truck after a 12 plus hour day....audits take at least an hour and management ""hints"""
bad,Company training and advancement very poor. Felt dis-connected from parent headquarters. Unprofessional and highly dis-organized location. Highly political environment.
bad,"Work to life balance was poor. Working conditions were horrible had my van broken into more then once. Was threatend on the job for it taking to long. Landlords would yell if you didnt get permission to install from them first even if tenent gave the ok. Got electrocuted,fall through a roof,slipped off a ladder in freezing rain. I worked there two years almosted died 3 times."
bad,Extremely political and had no respect or value for hardworking employees. Bottom line only mattered and every quarter looking to cut headcount. Extremely shady and deceptive management team.
bad,"The trainers were overwhelmed by the class size and unable to keep up with the format. It was impossible to get needed tools or suspenders for the tool belt before getting onto a ladder. Trainers rushed you even though you just walked up to the event. Everybody hates the new people on site except the manager. Shared hotel with random stranger. Chicken nuggets, chips and a cookie 3/5 days for food. If your going to training, get your own room and lunches."
bad,"Mandatory overtime, horrible management, and an unreasonable tier system which almost guarantees you will be fired. Training for new hires is terrible"
bad,"no work life balance you work 12 hour days minimum 5days straight, managers only care about sales even though youre told they don't matter and your position is a tech. if you don't make sales they cut your hours. managers seriously drop the ball with training and leave you without work for weeks to months processing paperwork they had your whole training to take care of. would not recommend."
bad,"I was hired in as a core Dish employee.  That lasted two years before changing hands with a company call UpDish.  As a Dish employee everyone was treated fairly, but as a sub contractor, we became just a number.  No word of this transition was mentioned.  We walked in for our Monday meeting and were told about the change.  Half the team walked out and quit.  Silly me, I stayed.  Teamwork stopped.  Unattainable metrics were given.  Pay structure changed often.  It went from hourly pay to piece work.  To not getting paid drive time.  We had to be at the office by 7:00am to pick up equipment and supplies for the day and be on-site of 1st job by 8:00am.  That's fine if you are the only tech there getting equipment.  But, there were 40 to 50 techs there at once waiting on equipment and supplies.  So, then, your van is finally loaded at around 8:00am and you're on your way to Kentucky backwoods from Knoxville, TN.  You finally make your first stop at 10:30-11:00, not 8.  Guess what?  You get dinged for that.  Get 3 ""dings"" and you get to enjoy a one on one with your manager who knows that you were in Kentucky last night and didn't get home until 2:00 am.  No work live balance.  You are just a number here.  I always went above and beyond the call of duty.  Provided world-class service to the customers.  I was a good tech.  Low repeats, never late GETTING to the office.  UpDish finds it easier to find ways to let you go and then spend a fortune to hire and train new employees.  Long story short, Dish is great, UpDish, not so great."
bad,"I was a top, voice of the customer agent but they really don't care about you.  If they need or want to get rid of you, you're gone.   They put almost impossible goals and expectations and blame you for sending out technicians, crediting accounts, replacing equipment; in short, they hold it against you for doing your job."
bad,"I hired in October 2018. Hiring process was fair enough, they do a good job of calling you back and coordinating with you, however it's all done through corporate, not your local office. I was the youngest guy in our office (18 at the time) and was fresh out of high school. When you get hired in, you do 4 weeks of training. 2 weeks at an out of state training facility, and 2 weeks working with another tech at your home office. Training was fine, and they do a decent job of telling you what to do and how to do it. The real problems start when you go out on your own. At first, the managers will go easy on you since you're new, but after that 1 month period of being on your own kicks in, they expect you to perform on par with the seasoned veterans that have been there a while. It doesn't help that you are a glorified travelling salesman either. At EVERY job you are REQUIRED to bring in a massive 40 pound bag of ""Smart home services"", a unique way of disguising the fact that it's a bunch of overpriced tech products that people can just run down to their local Walmart and get half priced than what we sold them for. On top of that, we were encouraged in training and by our managers to LIE to the customer like a used car salesman, all just to make a sale. We were REQUIRED to sell something on every job we went to, the mother-lode being a 5.1 surround sound system costing over $500, and if we didn't make that sale, we would get lectured every time came back to the office to unload our trucks. Managers ask you every day how your sales numbers are, even though they already know, just"
bad,"A horrible place to work...if you have no conscience and no sense of right and wrong then this might be the place for you. It is a huge eye opener on how low big business will go and what type of henchmen they hire to ""manage"" things and how little they think of people being actual human beings."
bad,"It was rated the worst company to work for in 2018.  They have not provided a way from that status. Run away don't walk. The money is fantastic, but the price will be your health, mentally and physically."
bad,Management Sucked. Hours we awful no room for advancement. always working no time to take care of yourself or your family. high turn over rate. do not suggest
bad,"As far as the tech side of the job I love it but that’s just it, it’s not a tech job. You are expected to sale a $200 sound bar in a crack house. Dish will fire the best technicians because they aren’t good salesmen and keep the bad techs because they are good salesmen and then wonder why there’s so many trouble calls. People are always up your butt about sales and you hear it EVERY SINGLE DAY. You are trained more about sales than anything and it gets annoying very fast. They’re products are over priced and useless for the most part. The incentives to sale aren’t that great. The boss makes a dollar and you make a dime. Would not recommend to anybody."
bad,"If you don't kiss up the managers immediately, you will be rid of. That place is nothing but a popularity contest. They have ways of routing the calls you get. It's a job where you'll constantly worry if you have your job the next day. They hire every two weeks because people get fired everyday."
bad,"The worst place I have ever workedMy supervisor was very apathetic, would call you a liar to your face. Very disrespectful. The upper management didn’t care when it was brought to them and advised me to talk it out, they only took notice after I turned in my resignation and wanted to offer me a different supervisor at that time."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for a company that lies to your face the way dish does, they give you a option to bid on a schedule but you'll never get what you want if your metrics are low, the reason on why people metrics are low it there are people who cheat the metrics systems, so if you do your job right you're metrics are terrible but dish doesn't care about that. In other words I wouldn't wish this job on my enemy's"
bad,"When I started the job consisted of just driving and installing satellite tv and service calls. Now we do internet, appliances, networking, all for the same money. There is also a sales goal metric that dominates all of the others, meaning if you can sell you will last but if not they will fire you no matter how good your work is. Management only worries about sales."
bad,"At first you will be praise and help but if you dont hit their metrics once, Just once, your whole career will be compromise, you will be punished and it is hard to go back to the top. But once you make it back they will find a way to put you back down, they worry about attendance because no one wants to come back after they punish you. They want people to just work and not have any kind of life, so if you are single and have no friends or life this work is perfect for you. But if you want a good balance between work and life this is not the place for you, also the insurance is a joke, they will tell you that at beginning but you will think really, how bad could it be? Well worst case scenario. This company has a great idea of how they should thread you but somehow they fail at the execution of it, they want everyone to be competitive, and that's great but they recently implemented different color lanyards base on your position status (associated account executive/acount executive/senior account executive) and that just creates a divisive culture within the same department. Also be prepare for undertrained management,  it was a 50/50 if good management and bad management, you can tell they rush their hiring process when creating this departament in tulsa."
bad,"Being security officer, I have nothing but trouble out of all levels of management. I've heard the facilities manager literally tell the cleaning ladies to get on their knees and scrub the floors until they shine like a military school. They ask for overtime but with no thanks for the work done. If you do your job, you get terrible shifts, terrible days off - if any, and essential overtime to do maintenances job and shampoo carpets. Which is why you should never make a janitor the manager over security. Next to impossible to get a holiday off, for the month of November I worked 26 days straight, had one day off, then worked another 30 days straight, and worked 12 hours days on both Christmas and Christmas Eve. The pay is mediocre at best, and is not worth the hours you will put in. You're put in a security position, and are later told that you'll have to be maintenance, shipping and receiving, secretary, log keeper, and babysitter for your coworker(s).  Would not recommend to anyone who has children, or a sense of decency."
bad,"Let me just say this is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. Sell sell sell or lose your job. I know.. it happened to me. Do yourself a favor. Do NOT work for these guys. They give zero craps about you even when you are selling. Eventually they'll run out of people to hire. Also, enjoy working with their broken software that will keep you at a job for hours."
bad,"Highly stressful environment (typical call center) and can end being super micro managed. 95% of the customers are rude and disrespectful. Very difficult at time to balance the metrics for commission. It's like the cartoon where something springs a leak... You plug that hole another leak springs and so on."
bad,Working for dish was nothing special.  You do get discounted television but the work environment is not ideal.  Management was very nice except for the senior OPS manager but he is no longer at that location.
bad,When its 3 in the afternoon and you are an 1 1/2 hours away from the shop. They drop a 4 room new connect 5 hours away from your current location. Then you get to drive home in the snow for 3 1/2 hours back to the shop at 3 in the morning and are expected to come back into work at 7 later that morning. This happened to me multiple times. No thanks.. not worth it.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend Dish to anyone.  The upper management doesn't care about the sales reps, the pay is definitely NOT enough to live in NYC and survive and the benefits especially the health insurance suck!"
bad,poor management and disgusting work environment. roaches are everywhere throughout the building and managers are known for sexually harassing the employees.
bad,"This may have changed, however during my tenure this company was very difficult to work for. It didn’t seem vested in the employees, especially those not actively taking phone calls within the call centers. All bonus money and incentives were shared only with production staff and never shared with support staff. Same was true for celebrations, as everything was one sided. Made it difficult to want to be promoted into a support role, or work for the company at all due to the heavy favoritism."
bad,"On a Tuesday before I had 2 days off, one of the managers took me inside the office and basically said I had the next 3 days I worked to make them $1500+.. (if I didn’t make my quota I would’ve been given a warning for the next month if I didn’t meet it I would have been written up and after that I would’ve had to sit in the office every week for 3 hours talking about sales and I’d i didn’t “”get my act together”” I would be fired).. he must have been drunk cause that killed my mood about the Dish Network dramatically and that Friday I came back I didn’t feel happy about working that day so my first job was my last job. "
bad,I worked there for ten years and did whatever job they asked me to and when they laid off they only laid off people that was there for ten years or longer so they wouldn’t need to increase their pay any higher. It was a very stressful environment and the supervisors did not care about you at you q was only a statistic to them a way to make them look better if not you was gone.
bad,I had great management but the company is set up in such a wearied way that it doesn't work in north GA. it makes for extremely long days and they don't allow the management to do there jobs dish has the potential of a great company but greed blinds them they like most care more about money then there customers or employees
bad,While working at Dish I did nothing but follow procedures. I was disappointed when I was dismissed to due not being able to meet sales quotas. I knew then and there that the quality of work that i was providing to customers didn't matter to the people i was working for so decided not to dispute the arguments for the dismissal.
bad,The management at Dish is very unprofessional and very low caliber. There is not much of a sense of loyalty to the company due to the employees' lack of faith in the management.
bad,"The focus has gone from doing the job right to how much you can sell. The constant threat of being fired for not meeting the sale goal, which keeps going up, makes for a stressful job."
bad,One of the worst places to work. Hr is unfair and inexperienced. Only get promoted if your close to the right people. Raffles are rigged for top sellers.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Was a ok place to work. The company does change frequently. They have good employee benefits. You get almost free dish, has good medical, dental, and vision."
bad,The cxo’s Are back to being the old dish that was voted the worst company to work for.  They are more focused on nepotism than promoting people who are good for the company.  Senior leadership is toxic and makes you dread going to work.  The company offers poor benefits and pushes its employee stock purchase program on you.
bad,"To be at the center of dish, you have to be at the bottom. With a skeleton crew operating at all times and 25 minute hold times, it makes calls exponentially tough with the very limited tools you have to help customers and constant up-selling. With constant changes to the metrics and tools, growth is inconsistent and unreliable."
bad,"The only safe jobs in the building are those that are management and  above. I've seen those that were passed over for promotions due to management being in favor of others that are under qualified and have less experience. All the big-wigs will openly tell you that Dish pays well to keep their people there as ""No one else will pay you as much as we do without a degree.""  Everyone is over worked and very rarely appreciated for their efforts. They recently provided a market-value increase in pay then within a month laid off an entire call center and many others from multiple other centers."
bad,"Pay is great however it is commission based. Management only cares about the ""numbers"" and have no human understanding. If you do not meet their requirements or ""save enough customers from cancelling their accounts you are let go."
bad,"Sixth boughta lot of spectrum, and put a click by the entrance making down the time remaining for this plant. When it reaches 0 dish will do away with receivers and copy direct TV.  Whose thinking is they are not telling the employees so they work through this time remaining."
bad,Dish Network Threatens there Technician with there jobs constantly if they do not meet sales quota for the month high stress due to those hostile conditions
bad,"while it was the best paying job closest to home, it was also really stressful and not because of the customers who maintained their own stress level. the management style the company themselves insisted on was always so knee jerk that nothing was ever consistent and it was always back and forth. I wouldn't go back or recommend this company to work for for anyone no matter how desperate you are"
bad,they trick you by offering good money...then make you work a terrible schdule.. for example 130 to 11 pm with tues wens off... they dont hold mangers to same standerd as agents//alot like high school for adults
bad,"Dish has great benefits, they offer fantastic medical, dental and vision insurance and a 401K plan.  The pay isn't terrible.  Those are the only good things about dish that there are.  They pressure you to sell, sell, sell.  Your hours are crazy and they force you to work overtime so you don't hardly get to see your family.  They expect you to get up as a remote tech and start your day at 7:15 leave your house at 7:20, If your first stop is only 5 minutes away that gets you there before 7:30.  And lets be honest having anyone show up at your house before 8 a.m is absolutely unacceptable.  the metrics are ridiculous, they try to force you to connect every receiver to the internet when a lot of people don't have internet anymore, they force you to make sales on every job even if people don't want to buy stuff your supposed to ""push through the no's.""  Also a lot of customers get a chance to do a survey over the phone and it all counts against you as a technician, but some questions have absolutely nothing to do with you but that hurts you too.  Very stressful place to work I would never recommend this company to anyone for employment they are HORRIBLE!!!"
bad,"es una buena empresa, pero el clima laboral es muy malo, basado en el chisme y radio pasillo, los directivos estan más al pendiente de eso, que del desarrolo y logros laborales del empleado."
bad,"I worked for the thornton call center for 2 weeks shy of 9 years. I resigned after i had work my way up over and was making a decent living for my self. Only to have my position disbanded (no fault of the individuals who held the position) as the company was going a different direction. My fellow coworkers and i were stripped of our titles bumped down to entry level position and stripped of our pay down to entry level. Then told that we needed to take the ""transition"" well or opportunities of promotion o the future ""wouldn't look good""."
bad,More bad days then good much of the time you take 50/70 phone calls and people just want to yell at you. I work every shift they had so I can tell you try to get the late nights it gets slower the longer you are working.
bad,"Working for DISH is stressful as any call center job can be, but with DISH its more so due to the fact that management doesn't care about you as a person, all that matters is metrics. There is no job security and room for advancement is lackluster. Working for DISH would be a last option if you have other call centers you can work for."
bad,"Just basic customer services, I would work everday from 11 am until 10 pm. Really life was just about work, I had no personal time. No benefits at all.I had to get out of there."
bad,trabajo fácil de realizar y rápido compañeros excelentes
bad,Worked here for 5 months and was talked to and treated like a number not an employee. The only thing I liked was the pay. They should train better if they choose to hire within. Make sure the person is cabaple of handling that higher position and if they have ever been in a position like that before.
bad,"Dish is a good place to get your feet wet in the corporate world, but don't expect much more than that. Mobility is very limited with managers using the stick and carrot method of motivation (always just ""one more thing and you can move up"", but one more thing turns into one more thing and so on). Company culture is nowhere to be found. Competitor companies pay more and have better benefits for similar work."
bad,"This is a call center job that has way too much turnaround due to supervisors and managers letting agents go if they don't hit their metrics. However, if you do hit your metrics they have an amazing pay for performance bonus where you can make really good money. Only bad thing is the constant employees leaving due to being treated unfairly."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Most of the people I worked with were nice. It was very hard to get technical support help from management, and customers waited quite a while on hold sometimes which in turn made them even more angry. If you are a technical person you might like the job, but the pay is not enough to live on. The culture in the building where I worked was such that you had to take all of your belongings home every night or good chance it might be stolen by other co-workers."
bad,DISH was a great place to work when I first started a lot of advancement in the building then the beginning of the year everything changed and know they make you do the hardest emotional draining job there is and you have to do it for 6 months prefer transferring locations. Good luck making it through the 6 months.
bad,"work schedules can some times be fair depending on whats given management changes rules as they please for ""company"" purposes and they change your work schedule at times with out much of choice, at times there are certain events that are fun but work experience with being really busy taking calls back to back with out a breather is stressful not really a job i would recommend and moving up in the company is the idea thats given but the chances are slim unless you have leverage with certain people. working there is constant worry trying to do every thing correctly while being told you still need to do more than what can really be done in reality"
bad,Little room for growth and high turn over rate however its a fun place to work at. The tier system doeskin really help. Nice people and exclusive trips
bad,"Dish IT is fast-paced and totally date-driven. HR policy does not allow for any flex time or telecommuting, even during blizzards. Sr. Management is often abusive, and the internal politics often delay progress. Salaries and benefits are below average, and there is very little work/life balance. "
bad,Besides the pay it is a terrible over all place to work no management cares about you they wont even work with you if something comes up in them life absolutely terrible worst place I have ever worked
bad,Best way to move up is being friends with or related to managers.  Dish does not recognize hard work only friends and relatives.
bad,"Long hours, company penalized you if a customer didn't have a landline phone connection to hook receivers to. We would get sent out with work orders where customers knowingly didn't have a landline phone, and that would affect your numbers for advancement.  Also sales people constantly had incorrect equipment for the job which resulted in excessive travel time back to the warehouse to get the correct equipment.  This resulted in lowering your productivity which was graded and factored in on your score for promotion.  Sometimes we would be 70 miles away from the warehouse."
bad,My work at dish is extremely boring and the management that I have to deal with is literally the worst I have ever worked under. The communication is horrible and they do not treat everyone equally.
bad,the pay is good but management is very un professional. The benefits are not very good as well. If you want anything to be confidential with dish forget it. The company as a whole is not there for there employees.
bad,"nothing you would want to do for the rest of your life. traning is next up to dat, and the company isn't sure if they should fire every employee."
bad,"On a typical day, you answered about 200+ calls got a break every two hours an hour lunch. If you did not meat the requirements for the average call time or up-sales you fired. The money was nice, but not nice enough."
bad,"Was with the company for 3 months and didn't even break even."
bad,"A fast, ever-changing environment, with a high stress level.  Constantly learning new materials and having to adjust to unnecessary changes with little notice can become taxing and add to stress levels.  Having to remain flexible and work changing days and hours creates strain on work-life balance.  Compensation becomes fair once advancing through the company, however, job requirements and demands on time increase as well.  Working only 40 hours per week is a rarity (normally more towards 50 or higher sometimes), and administrative tasks are overwhelming on top of normal job duties."
bad,DISH has been rated the worst company to work for in the United States by The Wall Street Journal two consecutive years. I believe they lack the leadership necessary to retain and empower employees.
bad,Was hired as a remote technician. I found out after I went through training that I would not get my van for over 1 year having to commute too far for work every day. The bonuses are too far out of reach. They make you sell other things such as sound bars and threaten your job if you don't. Then they white glove the van when you get back at the end of the 10 hour day. Terrible place to work.
bad,"As Dish explains, ""It's not for everyone"".   Takes a unique personality to do well at the location."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Always fearful of losing your job. You walk in, could be fired. You walk out, could be fired. You're the best employee in the company, you could be fired."
bad,"I personally could not stay at this job due to the illegal practices, and poor treatment. We were asked to call other customers providers and act as the customer to cancel accounts."
bad,Not a place to work for if you want to advance. Nepotism is the only way it will happen.  Company has been in flux. After being rated as one of the worst company to work for the company started annual internal surveys which are supposedly anonymous but are used to confront employees about what they put on the survey regarding their managers.
bad,"It was very emotionally taxing to be yelled at by irate customers and not have a toolbox to treat them properly, all day everyday. It takes a special type of personality to endure this job for the long run. The emphasis on stats was overwhelming, and there were many stats that I felt I had little to no control over, and my performance was still judged on those stats."
bad,Personal who worked there along with me was great. Most willing to drop what they are doing to help you finish a job. Pay was terrible. Expected you to have work order open even if midnight approached. Customersat times wasn't happy. But was not allowed to close unless customer asked you to leave.
bad,"I loved most of people I worked with, the pay and some of the benefits. However, felt like a child there, or a prisoner. They are not flexible with any part of your schedule, training is nearly 3 months long and you still come out, feeling as if you know absolutely nothing."
bad,"i spent my whole time driving 45 to 1.5 hours to next job,,,and they wanted us to make sales only,,,,didnt matter if you couldnt work very good,,,,mgt was stressing me out too,,,,never will i go back"
bad,"Horrible Place!!! When I went to interview the place was unprofessional, the person interviewed me was rude and dressed like they just got out of bed. Everyone was rude there, would not go again and very demanding. Did not get the days I wanted off!!"
bad,"Don't Dish it Up here!  Bad management is allowed to hold qualified applicants back - due to personality conflicts.  Upper management is never willing give employees a chance to answer questions-calls employees disrespectful and writes you up before the facts are known.   Disabilities are ignored and everyone from team leader, coach, management, upper management and human resources ignores the open door policy and requests for confidentiality."
bad,"I have many complaints about Dish Network, but my biggest would be that that they 'reward' doing good at your job with more work.  Like most call centers, you are measured on many metrics.  Agents that consistently surpass their goals are routed more calls, while agents who are behind on goals or are not doing as well sit available.  What that means is that if you are good at your job, you will be taking back to back phone calls while your co-workers sit there doing nothing."
bad,"Up until the recent change in management, the job was great. Good pay, great co-workers, and management that supported you in advancement in the company. That's all changed. Now, they don't care about senior techs. They'd rather see them quit, because in the new management's mind, they can pay two new guys for the cost of one senior tech. Plus, the proficiency numbers that are looked at are much lower for newer guys, giving the appearance that they're ""hitting goal"" when in actuality, they have more cushion to screw up. If that new guy doesn't work, they axe him, too, and find a new one. Plus, the number one metric they focus on is cold sales. What is cold sales? Every tech is to sell additional items to the customer once they have entered your home. So, the customer thinks they're going to have a guy come in, install Dish, and leave, but not so. They will now get hit with sales pitches from everything from screen cleaner, to tv mount, to a full sound system install. And the tech HAS to do this, as he has a minimum goal PER CUSTOMER he is required to hit. You won't have a career here."
bad,"Dish pushes sales to a disgusting level. I was told by multiple managers and employees to push sales on lower income customers. One manager told me to ""Push sales on poor people. They buy that's why they're poor."" Do not work here unless you are ok with working for scum bags."
bad,probably the worst company you could ever work for. do not come to work here worst management ever terrible owner and benefits.
bad,"its an ok place to work at , management doesn't know what their doing the right hand doesn't know what the left hand does, very poor training, the building it descent it would be better with assigned desks. some supervisors not all didn't really care they blew people off when someone would ask a question or they would be like where's your supervisor and direct you to someone else. the bonuses are good if you can reach them which is every once in a while before they change what we have to meet for it again. I hated going in every day but loved leaving the place. my team was pretty nice everyone helped out ,managers well they weren't really the people who you can go to with an issue. its who you know in that place, seriously it is. people were getting promoted who didn't have the experience for the position then you hear them bragging about it outside and all because of who they knew who got them bumped up. but overall its pretty  chill hectic and its an ok pay not the best because tmobile pays way more and they actually care for their employees . then again this was just my opinion and experience working for dish, I stay because it helps with the bills that's the only reason why and because im going to school"
bad,Good Working Environment. I had enjoying my work so much. I want to grow up in my accounts field but the working systems is so good in Dish TV.
bad,Dish Network was an unorganized company and I would never work there again. Management and the work environment is unhealthy.
bad,"After being robbed on the job management didn't care about anything other than what was lost. When talking to the Manager and being told that if I can't work a day after being struck in the head with a concussion that I may need a new job, I left."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Cubrir una zona ya sea en la ciudad o comunidad,proporcionar informacion de dish,llevar una relacion de respeto y compañerismo con los compañeros los supervisores no se integran al tarabajo del vendedor,no los apoyan directamente acompañandolos a realizar ventas .No ntienen un sistema para cubrir la zona de trabajo y  dificulta  al vendedor. Los vendedores pasan y dejan en las casas y negocios la informacion como si fueran  repartidores de publicidad.La presion ddel supervisor trabajar en dish."
bad,Have worked here for over five years now and the only reason I have stayed is for the pay. Management lies all the way up the ladder. Some are good people but most think of techs as pawns on a chess board.
bad,"Una empresa intersante por el servicio que presta."
bad,"They lie in the interview and hire everybody who has more potential than this company deserves. "
bad,"A horrible company.  They've been ranked #1 worst company in America to work for twice!  Breaks are short, management is desensitized to the average workers suggestions.  Everything is mismanaged."
bad,"I spent 5 years with this company. Through that time, I saw management replaced twice, warehouse 4 times, and techs come and go constantly. Not only was I the soul person left from my original batch of hires, I was one of a mere few left from the two batches that came after me. It seemed that even though Dish has numerous subcontractors, their internal techs were the most expendable to them. They flipflopped between instating mandatory overtime, and sending techs home at least one day a week - wouldn't call you to tell you not to come in, would have you arrive by 7 AM to tell you to turn around and drive home. Regardless of the fact that they were cutting into either your paycheck or your personal schedule, they always managed to act like they were doing you some sort of favor. Management was blind, pompous, and infallable in its most recent (and worst) incarnation."
bad,There was a real issue with the company culture. If your ideas or opinions were different than management you were made to feel small and insignificant. Management made it abundantly clear that they were not interested in ideas and  did not care about their employees. It seemed to be a source of pride that they were routinely voted the worst company to work for.
bad,"Everybody understand pros and cons of a job ,but its a difference when you have a office manager who is racist ( greensboro office ) you try to speak to a hr and they defend the om"
bad,"Customer service skills were inhance a little but it wasnt worth the amount of stress. Management always seemed unreachable. And when it came time that I felt I needed assistance with the amount of stress, no one was there. No moral support was available which is a much needed asset for the type of job they were offering."
bad,"They don’t give a c*ap about your success. Rushed training, and the floor support staff is an utter joke. Blind leading the blind. "
bad,Nunca te hacen aclaración sobre las condiciones y siempre te están quedando a deber comiciones aparte te obligan a trabajar los días 25 de diciembre y 1 de enero o amenazan con dejarte sin trabajo si te niegas
bad,The manager does not know how to communicate well with others. They won’t reimburse you for gas if they send you out to another facility. Supervisor is cool though.
bad,"The hours and benefits are great but they make you do things you will hate about yourself, its just the new form of door to door salesman at this point"
bad,"If you're okay with working on average 12 to 14hrs 4 days a week then this is the job for you. On the other hand if you like having a personal life then do not apply. When working for dish I worked at least 14 hr days and when you have plans for an afternoon they wont accommodate you at all. I had Stanley Cup plans starting at 7pm and was forced to miss those cause I was out working till 11pm. Keep in mind they consider a normal working day to be from 7:10am to 5pm and the latest they kept me out till was 12:45 am!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ridiculous, I know. The pay was good and I got to have 3 days off a week but when you are working over 107 hours for 2 weeks it gets old real quick. The expectations at this company are absolutely unreasonable and they also never give you enough time to take care of cardboard, trash, and inventory. They expect you to store all your equipment at your house and you also have to do regular inventory checks, which they don't give you enough time for. All in all i wish i could say it was a pleasure working for them but in reality it wasn't. Most of the time I would end up driving home late in the afternoon cussing dish out the whole way home."
bad,Expect long hours and to work on many things other then tv and internet. Washing machine repairs Samsung recalls on appliances.... thermostats.... if you want to be a sales man then this is the place for you. You can tower the charts of every metric you are suppose to maintain but if you don’t sell at least $30 to every customer you are put on a pip. Management is horrible and the routes have you driving hours at a time for simple jobs that are closer to other techs. Your raises depend on you. There’s no annual raise unless you sell your butt off. Doesn’t matter how much you work or how good you are at the job... you don’t sell you will stay at the bottom . 3 years ago I would’ve recommended this job to everyone now I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone
bad,You will work a boatload of hours at a fair wage but if you like your home life dish network might not be for you they do pay you for your orientation and training you will do two weeks at a training facility and two weeks of on the job
bad,It's a sweatshop. Very unhealthy and unprofessional work environment. Gossip runs rampede @ the El Paso location. Unprofessional management. Most people hate working there but need jobs. Yearly layoffs.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"No room for advancement"
bad,The expectation is unreal and the company does not focus on employee retention. The benefits are mediocre and there is no room for advancement or improvement.
bad,"I had 8 years of experience and I tried for different positions and never got promoted , they would hire someone with less time working there. The pay was good. Their stats were difficult to meet to save ccustomers for internet because it was no good"
bad,"Staff goal was 800, new management came& it went to 200. New manager didn't take the time to get to know me before they laid me off. Very disappointed."
bad,Alright company to work for. Had good Benefits and free tv services. But over all the management was very poor. many people lost their jobs because of management being to head strong.
bad,It was a high stress job. The metrics were impossible to meet. High turnover rate. Pay was good. Management was not good. I was made to feel like I should be a robot.
bad,"The job is easy and stressful. The hard part about working at DISH is their attendance policy. You are giving a schedule based on what the company needs and can vary daily. On top of that you can only miss 8 days in a year and when you do miss any shift for any reason you lose pto time. You will also be forced to not work when call volume is down and forced to work overtime when call volume is high. If you have any life outside of work, do not apply."
bad,"I was a rehire for dish and recently left back in 2014 for better career advancement. I left back than because I was stuck. Reapplied because people told me they fixed that which was not true. They have tons of advancement, but their recruiting team, HR, and management have such a horrible lack of communication that wouldn't know anything about the jobs. Most positions would get a ""Dear John"" letter with no reason on why you were denied the job. They encourage feedback, but when you ask they say we will follow up with the recruiter and nothing. Great place for an easy pay and lot of time off the phones. Building has cafe and a nice break room with games, pool table, air hockey, and arcade console."
bad,Job is very inconsistent. The company basically wants you to live to work there.  Company is not employee bases at all! Would no recommend this job!!!
bad,"Work starts at 7:15 am. must be at first customer by 8. The installs are usually pretty straight forward, but they do require a unreasonable install standard including most often having to tell customers with brand new homes that although they spent thousands of dollars in cabling for the home, that we could not use it due to it was not a brand that Dish approved. (Which only included 5 brands, most of which were not accessible by most consumers. On top of that we were required to sell additional products on site and needed to maintain an average of 20 dollars be work order, regardless if the customer actually needed or wanted the products."
bad,"I work for dish 10 yrs at first its was good except for"
bad,"The schedule for new employees is terrible after training."
bad,"The managers would make it clear that they had ""favorites"" and they would do more them then anyone else. They also wasn't helpful when I got badly sick and got hospitalized. Seemed as if they was using anything to get me out of there."
bad,Pay is not bad for entry level. If you like positive feedback from management forget it. This job is very metrics driven if you have a bad day dont worry they will let you know. Every morning there is a meeting and they discuss your metrics in front of everyone. OM talks to you like you are property that is easily disposed of and he wont let you forget that you are replaceable.
bad,Dish was a great place to work for compensation. Dish has great upper management and training courses that teach you how to overcome objections.
bad,okay company okay place okay pay okay job duties okay hours okay security okay benefits okay employment lenght okay turnover okay everything
bad,"To be fair maybe I just had a terrible manager, but as someone with experience in the cable industry that knows how a good company is ran I knew starting at Dish was going to be a mistake by the first week of training, and asked the weeks progressed it didn't disappoint. "
bad,"I learned skills that will be useful no matter where I go, but other than that there is nothing redeemable about Dish. They fired my branch's entire management team and replaced them with people who were just as bad. The shift schedules are awful. I would not recommend working at any place connected to this company"
bad,"At Dish Network, I worked in the call center in Littleton, CO. I had a cubicle with my own headset and computer, of which I would answer inbound calling customers every day from 6 am until 3 pm, except on weekends. "
bad,A typical day at work was when everybody would pitch in and help others when needed.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"The company had a terrible reason to let me go, they absolutely did not try to advance anyone on my friends that worked there.  They should just hire employees as temps as they offer no benefits and fire before you can receive your benefits."
bad,"I have to say with all honesty that with 35+ years in the workforce, this was the worst employment experience I have ever had.  Criticism is met largely with complete ignorance or an appeasing answer meant only to pacify employees with no intention for addressing the problem.  Scheduling is unfair, and employee requests are prioritized through productivity, with no consideration for seniority, longevity, importance or an employees' personal life. I personally had to jump through a sea of red tape just to co-ordinate time off for jury duty, there is no accommodation for family emergencies or personal needs. You work the schedule management supplies, are docked evaluation points for calling in sick, and are sometimes scheduled mandatory overtime or holiday work and special events whether those types of service fall within your normal schedule or not. "
bad,Overall I'd say that this job is great for those who are energetic and love to talk to people over the phone. The management is very supportive and inspiring. It just wasn't the career for me
bad,Did not really like working here for the amount that i had to do compared to how much i gotten payed just was not worth it. the management and HR teams were almost worthless to a point to where it felt like they did not care.
bad,"No me gusto, me fui en cuando vi que no podía mantener el trabajo con otros aspectos de mi vida"
bad,An ok company. Management can be better. Manager sometimes gave workers the cold shoulder for no reason. I only liked the fact that there was no micro management and met some great people.
bad,"Even though the work was easy, there was really poor management. There was no training plan in effect, and there was miscommunication between the departments."
bad,my direct boss was awesome but other than that the work was hard and you were under paid and all the company cared about was making a dollar did not care about their employees or their customers.
bad,"The first thing you have to accept as an employee for dtv is, you will not see your family. Managers routinely worked from 6am until 9pm everyday they are scheduled. Assumed it would get better with advancement. Not true. Second thing as a manager, never question your bosses."
bad,"Durante mis 5 años y medio de servicios prestados, no tuve problemas con los pagos, pero lamentable a pesar de cumplir los objetivos como empleados jamás nos consideraban y seguíamos bajo el mismo régimen como fuimos contratados. Incluso la razón por la cual deje de laborar fue por pedir un aumento ya que en todo ese tiempo jamás cambió y lo único que demostraron es que para ellos es mejor liquidar al empleado que escucharle."
bad,You start the morning off by filling your van with inventory.  Then finding your route to your first customer of the day.  You deal with clean and very dirty houses.  You must be willing to go into places most people will not tiny crawl spaces and attics. You install coaxial cable and reciever boxes to bring in tv to the customers home.  You work a 10 to 14 hour day.  So if you have family dont expect to see them at all on the days you work.  They do pay good for around this area.  It justs gets old dealing with getting cussed out by customers and getting bit by dogs.
bad,"Typical pressure to keep your metrics up and sell as much as possible while dealing with people angry about their dish being covered with snow and expect the impossible. "
bad,"After 6 years at the company I feel as though I still have no job security.  I have to work off the clock every day to  come close to meeting arbutary set goals.  The companys turn over rate is higher thru resignation, despite slow job market, than any place i have ever heard of. I am the sole provider of my family and need more job security than what Dish provides."
bad,"If you go to work as a field installer, you should start by doing 2 things: say goodbye to your family and get ready to become a satellite robot. They lure you in by promising $1200 - $1500 a week, and then you find yourself showing up at 7am usually 6 days a week. Typical days find you driving for hours and hours (with no gas allowance) to remote rural locations, crawling under houses and creeping through unbearably hot attics. I think the worst part is dealing with the customers - they all smile in your face but they are SO quick to turn on you and complain about the smallest little detail."
bad,"Training coach did nothing but sit in van and snack, while telling me to hurry up so he could go home.  Intentionally lead me to do the wrong thing after I followed companies guidelines and was very unreliable when I needed a hand.  Basic small town b.s.  involving customers lying about jobs I had completed by the book.  Mostly hostli"
bad,"Dish has a lot of opportunities in Colorado or Texas."
bad,I would prefer not to say. Dish Has their own . At this time each person will bring their own opinion about Dish. Many people may not like to try out this company.
bad,I left after my office filed for union unsuccessfully. The company was headed downhill fast at that point and had already been rated worst place to work in the country 3 years running. I advance to level 4 topping out and counldn't get any higher so I moved on to bigger and better things and became an electrician.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"a typical day at work: stressful"
bad,The management at this office is great however the overall dish workplace is horrible. long hours and strict sales requirements are more important than quality of work. Mandatory overtimes days and poor communication between dispatch and the technician.
bad,"I was let go from this job after working there for 4 years. It wasn't my plan to leave before finding another job but Dish had different plans. I'm going to be a first time father in April. I was let go in January. It became apparent that dish was forming there technicians into a sales force rather than a customer based installer . When I first started with Dish there was a demand for sales but it was minimum to being able to provide customers with solutions such as screen cleaners, surge protectors, video audio accessories, and show them the Polk soundbar system we carried. It was ""Sale if you can but its not required"". Then it became you must hit your sales goal for each month, which wasn't too crazy, to you must sale at every job and a per job sales quota, to you MUST MUST MUST sale these items at every job including this much of Polk product as well, and if you don't you will be let go. There were guys on our teams that had been around for near 10 years that were let go because of this. It was such an betraying act of this company to there dedicated employee's that broke there backs giving good customer service and being dedicated to there horrible work days schedule for which they had no way of changing. The team spirit was great because the other techs were great. I was lucky enough to have 2 great Fsm's and a great OM. I defintely miss those guys, but I was somewhat relieved when I was let go. It was a very stressful crazy job. If you are SINGLE and have a SALES drive then this might be fitting. If you have kids and a family this might not. You defintely will not see"
bad,It was a decent place to work but I did not like the business rules that were set and caused too many people problems. For that reason I decided to resign.
bad,The atmosphere and fellow colleagues were amazing. However it is a horrible quality of customers you are dealing with. If you have any emotional instability whatsoever stay away this company will chew you up and spit you out.
bad,"A day at Dish consists of sitting at your desk at the beginning of your shift, logging in, having a team meeting, and taking back to back calls until the day ends. As all sales jobs are usually stressful, Dish is probably at the top of the list. "
bad,"Pay good. Management was horrible there is certainly no job stability. Your are required to work overtime daily, with no hourly pay."
bad,"A lot of the people there can be fun to work with, but a lot of the upper management are fake and phony. They talk about how the customers (the very same people that's keeping the business running) lie, while so do they and want us to lie to customers to either gain or retain their business. Their matrix suck and you feel like you have to claw your way from the bottom of the barrel, just to find you haven't clawed very far. They speak of integrity but they hold absolutely NONE.... And dare you be honest with them about resigning, they'll treat you Just like they treat their customers. And one of the upper managers asked where I was going just so she could scare me into not going with that company.. And they keep talking about the money you COULD make as if you need to ignore your morals. If you don't want to be made to feel like you must argue with customers to stay, PLEASE STAY AWAY from the retention department. And it's like the sales department fights against the retention department all while under Dish umbrella..... How does that equal a win for Dish?!... Their whole concept needs to be trashed and redone......"
bad,"Day begin with the company sending a route of jobs to your phone, then you go over each job to ensure you have the equipment needed for each job."
bad,Earned an awesome salary. Job was stressful but the hours were always available if one wishes to accrue overtime/ with this company it is available. I would recommend.
bad,"DISH was an extremely difficult place to work.  Management was rarely available and when they were, you had to pick and choose who to address because half of the supervisors didn't know how to do our job, hence answer our questions, because all they knew how to do was supervise.  HR was a joke.  We had no HR in our office, just in corporate in Colorado and nearly impossible to get a reply to a call or email.  DISH constantly hires because they constantly fire or force someone to leave based on how they get treated.  It's actually a real shame because with a little tweaking on different people's roles the company could be a good one to work for.  But as for now, I'd say run and don't look back."
bad,The only good thing is the friendships you make with the other techs. You are all in the same sinking ship and use that as a life vest to keep you afloat through the day.
bad,the dish is nothing like the post to be workers are nothing but a number no regard about when you get hurt they say that you are lying .......................................................................
bad,Horrible health insurance. Don't work for them if you are sick. $5000 deductible for a couple! If you can't take care of yourself how will you take care if the business.
bad,Exigen ventas pero no hay apoyo de la parte de gerencia ni administrativa
bad,"Mal ambiente, malos jefes, no hay líderes, faltas de respeto, sin descansos. Sueldo bajo."
bad,"If you’re not a manager, the company doesn’t care about you. They push you to do sales but you’re not compensated for the work that you put in. Big flaw. On the side note they do offer Great Benefits, if you can get past the BS the company throws at you."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Information was always conflicting depending upon whom you ask and yet you are still expected to fully comply. You have no control over the types of calls received and were expected to not send techs or equipment even if the majority of your calls are from the regions who get a lot if weather no matter what the instructions tell us. I think this company could at least be alright if everyone
bad,No comment due to repercussions   still employed there. No room for advancement. Not paid for skills squired. Send you home if you don't sell. Make you drive to office before they send you home
bad,Terrible place to work. Employees are micromanaged to ridiculous degree and treated like school children that are not to be trusted. Even if you are a professional with a white collar career. Have to use badge to log in/out times when you enter/leave the building which gets reviewed by upper management. Get grilled by management if you arrive after 9 am or leave for more than an hour during the day.
bad,The job began as a technician/installer but over time became a sales job with a quota and no commissions. The culture of the job environment became discriminatory in nature and I wouldn't encourage anyone to seek employment there.
bad,"Serious lack of ability to place people in proper roles, poor leadership, uncaring about employee work/life balance and mental well being. Little to no oversight of manager actions, will take a managers word over a subordinate without any investigation of issues. At least 2 people in the IT department committed suicide while employed there and I am 100% positive work life was a major contributing factor."
bad,"Poor management , no room for advancement. Poor pay. No open door policy with HR. Call center in Harlingen lacks leadership and better management. New agents are under trained."
bad,"I applied for a stay at home job through dish. "
bad,"Poor management, to many chiefs and not enough Indians. Workplace and customers were find but management was really 2 faced and wouldn't give the support a technician needed."
bad,environment was just like high school. promotions were based off who you knew not off your hard work. had to brown nose your way to get to any other position or it was not yours.
bad,"La.peor empresa que e trabajado como supervisor , la jefa no te ayuda en nada y los que te pueden ayudar a capacitarse no te ayudan hay mucha envidia termine renunciando ya que no vale la.pena ese empleo mal ávido lo peor de lo.peor"
bad,"it was not a good experience for me, the pay was bad, the stress was high, the time is crazy long, and the management is bad. you ask to do something while by doing that same thing your performance get affected."
bad,"its a basic call center  job that pays but everyones just there to do their job , we take care of customers but they forget that we are their customer also ."
bad,"Responsible for all aspects of supervision associated with hiring, leading, coaching, developing and managing a group of staff within a motivating environment to achieve performance goals and service metrics."
bad,The job was very stressful in that dish did not really care about what you had to do after work nor did they care if you got to anything you wanted to do after work. Also working both weekend days was not the best when they told me i would stop that after 5 months and 1 year later i was still working both days.
bad,"Will not get paid right, Leadership lies constantly when making mistakes, leadership also forges paperwork on employees. The production standards are too high. Unable to work in that type of environment."
bad,On the phones constantly and youre never doing good enough. very quick turn around in these places. Dealt with angry customers and the pay didn't seem worth it. made it impossible to make bonus.
bad,This is the worst place I have ever worked. They do not take care of their employees and treat everyone like a cog in the machine. I would not get a job here if I could help it.
bad,Racist and bigots towards  white people. They don't try to even speak your language or even try to make it an even less hostile place to work. Don't work here.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,No tenía vida propia no tenía seguro un desconsi por quincena era una empresa externa no interna
bad,"No hay ninguna seriedad de su parte ,todos se sienten jefes y la gente que tiene tiempo laborando te pone mil obstaculos para realizar tu trabajo ."
bad,a good domestic company to work with. very well managed. learnt the insights of dishtv. very professional environment. Fun at work
bad,"This franchise does not offer full time opportunities. Great support from staff who has dedicated to work at this location, not so much from owner."
bad,Dish TV is a company where people enjoy their work and company also ensure that proper environment is provided to employees so that work can be completed within time frame.
bad,There was no organization or proper chain of command when it came down to management. If you would want to speak to a higher management department then you would get singled out and written up in retaliation. I would not recommend this hostile work environment to anyone.
bad,"This is not my opinion alone! This is as Dish was rated the worst company to work for in America, three years in a row!"
bad,"Company has to high expectations for the position of CSR. High turn over on CSR. Management was decent, but hours and pay were horrible"
bad,everyone is usually friendly at dish.  do the same thing over and over all day.
bad,"loved my co-workers, however due to the constant schedule changes."
bad,They tell you that they are an family orrenited business THERE not they will threaded your job over sales goals an change your scheduled with out any notice
bad,laid us off to save a pretty penny although our center was top dog for months
bad,"Awful company to work for, didn't care about their employees at all"
bad,"Very bad place to work, full of teens, drama all the time, ridiculous rules. bad arrangement!!"
bad,the company didnt have a very reliable service so it was very busy with angry customers
bad,I would get to work and would have to greet people at the mall. i worked with dish network contractors. the hardest part of the job was closing sales. i would have to train the new employees
bad,"Although I enjoyed working there, I saw favoritism but not enough to loose sleep over.  The health of the company was determined on economy (which was not good in the country in 2011) and subscribers.  They spent over 10 million to launch a new satellite and  to no surprise, due to spending on this extravagance during the recession they saw coming, they laid off their national workforce by 10%.  If I walked away with one thing, it was to avoid working for companies who have Executives who make poor decisions like this."
bad,"Arrive at work log in to the system start taking calls, review policy updates, interact with some co-workers. Supervisor very helpful,"
bad,I was a remote technician that started work from home. Dish delivered equipment to my home and I had a van provided by Dish. It was a very independent position with good advancement.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Dish Network is one of the best comapnies I have every worked for. I just need to get closer to family and that is why I am seeking other employment.
bad,As far as room for advancement this company does have a lot of potential. I was there for three years and got 4 promotions. The management and my co workers were very supportive and encouraging however the human resources department would be much better without a particular members politics and childish antics.
bad,"Several of the Executives are simply just people that could take the verbal abuse and not leave.  All the talented executives they bring on quickly flee for other opportunities. "
bad,"No work life balance whatsoever! Manager had no installation, telecommutincation or satellite experience. Expected to not take lunch breaks and eat while driving. Expected to work in hazardous weather conditions. Benefits are terrible unless you want discounted satellite."
bad,"During my time of employment with Dish Network, I had some medical issues that I needed to attend to rather than getting paid time off or medical leave, I was forced to resign, and my medical benefits did not apply when I needed them most"
bad,Honestly this job was just not for me personally I have a personal life and business is on the side the money wasn’t good and I stayed away from my friends and family because of it so that made enough for me the management wasn’t there either to help guide me in my new role to be successful it was more important to make the money then for me to make money and even to this day they are still giving me a hard time just to get my 1099
bad,Management only cared about themselves. Played a lot of favorites. No care of the employees. I did like the 10 hr work days. I did need a job. Very Fast paced.
bad,"Dish was probably one of the harshest work environments to be in. Their attendance policy is strict and pretty ridiculous. Its a call center with hundreds of employees who are required to be at work even if you have the flu, sadly not joking, you will get fired if you have no free days and are sick. The management team does not listen to your complaints, or ideas. It was a terrible place to be employed"
bad,Not a good fit for me. Training not helpful at all. Management is not at all supportive. Mandatory overtime unless management they should also be there.
bad,"the work environment feels institutionalized. there were no windows to let any sunlight in you couldn't use the internet on your break besides check your email, depending on the forecast your schedule could change prior to shift bid to accompany the company needs which is very challenging if you have kids. the resources they gave us to troubleshoot with a customer was inadequate no inet access to troubleshooting 3rd party peripherals."
bad,Explotan y enganan con falsas promesas trabajo de 12 hor o mas no pagan comisiones trabajando dias festivos y no Los pagan
bad,communication was a problem. I did learn excel more. Co-workers thought they didn't have to do as much because they were their longer than ones who weren't. The most enjoyable part was working with the technicians. The hardest part was working with slackers. No team work.
bad,I became very sick and was fired due to missing work with surgery and the time it took specialist to figure out what was wrong. I was promised part time and fmla and got neither just a phone call telling me I was termed.
bad,"worst place to work, if you don't have any problem and you keep quite then your fine but if anything happen with family or you, they will not work with you and will fired you."
bad,"If you are thinking about applying  for a Tech Position here at Dish my only word is DON'T whatever you do. This company is one of those big corporate companies that simply lost focus of the BIG picture YOU. You will never get ahead in this position because the numbers they hold you to are unreachable. To get promotions etc all those numbers need to be in perfect. One of those numbers is trouble calls,  I will give you a example, you will do a install that has 2 Dish Boxes you hook up both boxes they both work you confirm everything with the customer then two days later they call dish saying the box doesn't work,now say the box went bad or this is the best one customer moved the box into another room that was never connected. ready to laugh that's the Techs  fault and goes against you as a trouble call. The way it should be done is a QC should be going out to these calls seeing what the issue is then make a determination,if its bad equipment or the customer moved or tapered with the equipment then its not the techs fault. But the company has to blame the issue on someone who better than the Tech.  That's why the turnover rate is so high for Techs. Another good one is you will show the customer the mounting location of the dish they sign off giving you the OK you mount the Dish finish the install the other person who lives there comes home doesn't like where the dish location is they call Dish they don't tell them that they weren't there during the install they'll say you put the dish in the wrong spot once again easiest thing to do blame the Tech the customers always right rule."
bad,working at dish was stressful and unpleasant. the managers are not willing to help you without you having to bug them for 20-30 minutes. the customers are never nice and you are never recognized for the good you do only the bad.
bad,"The hardest part of the job is the customers. You are told to listen to them vent, well some vent by cursing and screaming . They are rude and have filthy comments. I had a man say sexual things to me on the phone and when I asked for help from a manager, I was told to handle it. Most supervisor are ok, but some are new, just hired by dish and don't know what they are doing.  They change policies and procedures daily! It is so hard to keep up with there changes, and if something changed while you were off.. And didn't know, you are still held  responsible if you did or didn't do whatever it was. I would love my job really if I didn't have to take abuse from customers. Dish has created horrible customers by letting then abuse the employees and expect the employee to take it. Dish has a horrible turn over as well, because most can stand the customer abuse."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,The management did alot of unethical things use your imagination they probably did with that said I would not recommend it also the benefits are not great alot of overtime good job for someone that does not want to have a life
bad,"Es buena empresa, no tiene buenas prestaciones, pero te ayudan con prestarte el auto o motocicleta"
bad,"Not paid well for the work performed"
bad,"Company keeps change direction, doesn't have a plan to improve it  self. "
bad,"Dish is slave drivers with a demand to sell sub par products to each customer. the leadership was very self absorbed with little on their minds but themselves. the pay was little more than gas money for the month , however there was plenty of overtime to be accomplished, with the leadership demanding installs completed. in my two years there  i saw at least a 1000 % turn over, almost exclusive the upper management ultimately running them off."
bad,believe in Hire and Fire policy.  Not conducive environment for work. No work life balance. There is no value of fresh thoughts. Believe in top management verdict.
bad,Do not go there has a temp they do not treat you good if you came in has a temp I will never work there again the management there sucks they lie to you when they had Christmas dinner they would not let the temp come to work that day
bad,"En el área de almacén, tiene un encargado pésimo es un animal de persona, completamente mal educado, sin capacidad , sin valor de aceptar sus problemas, gracias a el, se salieron 9 personas , además de el sueldo súper bajo, el pésimo ambiente laboral y la gente mal educada y corriente que trabaja ahí , las condiciones del almacén eran pésimas , lo que le sigue de pésimas , piso con hoyos, el tejado gotea, plagas de insectos , poco espacio , te descuentan demasiados impuestos, tienen demasiado trabajo atrasado , en general es una de las peores empresas para trabajar"
bad,"Performance expectations and operating procedure change at the  drop of a hat. Expect to be held accountable for things that you have little to no control of. Prepare yourself for constant abuse  from customers and a culture of  management that values the customer over employees 100 percent of the time. After 13 years of  doing this type of work, my physical and mental health suffered. If you expect to have a life outside of the workplace while employed here, you should reconsider"
bad,The guys I worked with were ok. Can be let go at anytime. They will fix your hours so they don't have to pay you benefits. You do get free dish service but that is it.
bad,"It is sold as a great place with lots of changes but what that actually means is that nothing is consistent, in a year I went through 5 separate supervisors. I saw half of the call center get fired, more and more jobs being sent overseas."
bad,"Dish main focus is to retain customers so you are hired on as sales and moved quickly to retention which is stated as much better and consistent. That is a lie. Constant change in commission and absolutely no life/work balance. They have a point system for attendance with no exceptions. So if your sick, your getting a point. If your child has a emergency you have a point. My advice is to stay away if you want to have a life outside of work and need consistency."
bad,i worked as an installation technician pay was based on a tier system with aspects of your job graded. some of these categories were entirely out of your control and determined your worth to company overpriced equipment sales were a major factor most of these were things you could pick up at walmart or amazon for less than half of what we were expected to sell them for such as hdmi cables which dish charged $40 for that could be bought at walmart or amazon for under $10 other factors included if a job had to be fixed after completion this would go against you which sounds fair until you are told that weather events count against you as well. we had a hurricane come through my area and damage several jobs with wind damage as well as fallen limbs and debris crushing satellites any technician who had this affect a job they did as penalized for the jobs they did and lost pay due to this
bad,Trabajar en la empresa es soportar que te cobren por todo lo que le pase a la unidad y no te pagan las condiciones como tal...
bad,"working with dish network was cool for the first few years. As time went by and management changed the company mode changed.."
bad,"take phone calls and persuade customers to sign up. Run credit checks and inform customer of deposit needed. Introduce different options available in regards to oackages,."
bad,"I have worked at Fortune 100 companies and this place doesn't get it. They advertise the sales job as $100k per yer potential. When I started the job there were 4 people on my team that were making that kind of money before I started. (They showed me their pay check stubs.) It seemed as though come in corporate didn't like that sales employees were making that kind of money. As a result, corporate changed their pps (pay per sale) which DRASTICALLY effected their pay. After I started, corporate changed the pay again. This time, effecting the earning potential even more. All the top performers left within a few weeks. You would be lucky to make $35k at this job now but there was a time in the last  two years when you really could make $150k-$200k. Ridiculous. "
bad,I learned how to help the customer in all of their inquiries and various needs. It is not a place that I would recommend to others as they cannot keep their story straight. You do get good training but the training provided is way behind what Dish is actuallly doing.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Dish has a good Product, too man managers are not on the same page and the Good mangers are always treated nice, and they are hard to come by."
bad,someone with ADHD should not work here. Also not really willing to work with employees on any drastic measures such as medical issues that have come up.
bad,"No future with company, longevity and dedication are not appreciated but used against you as time passes.  Very high stress with no reward. If its only a temporary job you need this will work and you will learn some thing but thats it.  The senior leadership fails to recognize its employees as people with lives outside the company."
bad,"I was a sahm  went looking for a job bc  my hubby retired and we were maybe going to lose our health care. Did 6 weeks of training, should have been called fly by the seat of your pants. When on the phones as a newbie  you had to hunt a sup  down or across the building  for help while still abiding  to the customer on hold 2 mins. Rule. I have been on 6 different shifts since may about all they have are 4 ten hour shifts which leaves you exhausted  and a zombie  on that 3 day off. Also if you get 2 nci's  well that is your final next one no matter what your fired. So it's like walking on eggshell between the attendance points and the calls people are screaming obsenities  at you you can't hang up on them without a sup  and you can't find them, they customers some are receiving  a ton of credits and just want the credits added back on when they roll off, but we are told to find a long term  solution  well the customers don't want to change anything and you just have to deal best you can. So currently looking for another job, will take a point to go to the interview. But they pretend to be a company  to work for but it's a smoke screen, only benefit  is the free tv."
bad,"Las auxiliares tienen un horario de muerte de 9 am a 6pm con una hora de comida en el comedor del mismo lugar, van a trabajar la mayor parte de los domingos y harán muchas funciones que los parásitos supervisores no quieren hacer, olvídense de crecer en la empresa, siempre haran lo mismo, lo peor viene siendo que haces el trabajo de otros mientras los que les corresponde se la pasan chacoteando en la oficina sin hacer nada, no vida social , ni se te ocurra si eres madre soltera, no hay tiempo extra y la presión para lo que pagan es extrema , el area de recursos humanos es inexistente"
bad,No clear cut future for employees or company. inconsistent management. horrible hours/pay/benefits. bad even by call center standards
bad,"Although there were the standard issues with the waterfall management style, Dish exacerbated the issues by promoting people to writing positions who have no writing experience and then did not teach them how to write or how to proofread for grammar. It made working tedious and frustrating."
bad,"It is required for any employee to be available from 7AM to midnight, no matter the shift scheduled. Home life or any extra curricular activity, even if it is not affecting the normal schedule is frowned upon."
bad,"Think twice before you accept a job. It is good if you just want to make some money while looking for something else, but if you do accept the job keep applying at other places the day will come when you wished you had. They force you to try and sell things, make you lie to customers, you take constance abuse from customers and cant do anything about it. If someone is cussing you out on the phone you have to sit and take it, if they are talking nasty to you. You have to sit and take it. You have no one on your side, the management does nothing but group up and talk about everyone, and are rarely there to help you."
bad,"listen to people complain about bill/signal loss/tech support and you can't leave until you fix someone else's mess.  find dead animals. bed bugs, raw sewage in homes: contact manager and they'll usually ask if you can just work thru it.  made alot of money here but only because of forced overtime.  actually looking for a new job now.  my suggestion- don't apply"
bad,fun job to have but the management is terrible with no self checks for themselves ridiculous sale quotas to meet even when customers are not buying anything I personally never met a tech that was not looking for a new job the entire time i was employed there
bad,"Commissions Incorrect frequently"
bad,"Working for dish network was possibly one of the top five things in my life that has regret attached to it, the managements job is to fire employees at the time I worked with this company they had an attrition rate of roughly 150 - 200 employees a month, and would often find ways not to pay employees on time often skipping pay checks and making them monthly. This company also enjoys having employees drive into work regardless of time and distance to tell them that they aren't needed for the day due to the call volume."
bad,"Horribly low pay, long hours and very unsafe work environment."
bad,"The overall training class was very intense. After getting to the floor, I had a very hands off team lead"
bad,"Arriving to work you pass security with camera on you, enter through gate applying forefinger on screen to get your finger print, clock in walk back to shipping and receiving make my list of the trailers and they take it from there. all I did was back in trailers and pull out trailers when they're through with them."
bad,As a Installation tech your day starts from sun up to sun down. You are responsible for meeting all the many different metrics that is set forth by the office even thou they are impossible to achieve. All and any company compliant fall on the technician. Management put all the blame on the tech causing one to feel that he/she is worthless.Hardest part of the job is dealing with management.most enjoyable is working with very good coworker and customers.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Dish Network is a call center dealing with sales, technical support, and escalations. During a work day a handled in bound calls from customers regarding credit card fraud, identity theft, identity verification, BBB complaints, AG complaints, contract disputes, billing, customer complaints, and missing payments. The hardest part of the job was having to take calls from customers who were verbally abusive and threatening. We were required to give our contact information to every customer we spoke to which made it very easy for abusive customers to repeatedly call us with the abuse or leave messages. "
bad,"Rules are constitantly changing, could be told one thing when you start your shift, and by the end of your shift what you were told before is no longer."
bad,"This job was what you'd expect from a low-end utility job.  Extremely long hours, terrible management, and an offensive health care package."
bad,The company basically bleeds its front line management dry. We work incredibly long hours with no compensation for the excessive amount of time. the overall environment was extremely negative; management technique was basically to keep everyone fearing for their jobs.
bad,"Answer inbound phones calls, sales, troubleshooting. Management would also be breathing down the teams necks to meet unrealists numbers for what was being requested by the agents. Was very difficult to promote anywhere within the company."
bad,Management is the worst and you don't get bonuses for all your hard work
bad,"This plant has the worst team enviroment of any plant I have worked.I been in production over 30 yrs but at Dish the moral and low pay is below average, and the managment is very hostil toward ones that not part of their buddy system.The turnover at dish in Spartanburg south carolina is very high.I would not refer anyone to this facilty."
bad,"I luckily had a good manager, but things at DISH are not innovative, they are done the way leadership wants them done. It's work longer not harder. Depends what department you're in but In Home Services Division is probably the toughest to work for. Good place to start your career fresh out of college, learn about business, then everything from there can only go up. They joke, if you have a baby at DISH you'll be paying for it for the rest of your life. Their benefits are really only good for kids fresh out of college with no real life problems."
bad,Management writes up employees for making mistakes instead of using those mistakes for coaching/teaching tools. Make 3 mistakes and your fired. There is no exception to this rule no matter how well your performance numbers are.
bad,poor management no life balance you live to work typical day for start 7;15 til you finish your last job plus drive back you could be finishing 7 or 8 pm if you lucky sometime you could be finishing at11pm
bad,"Call centers are not the best place to work. It’s the drive thru of customer service and technical support. The company pays well but has little to no advancement. Their attendance policy was total garbage and the uniform policy was non existent. The hours were horrendous if you wanted to have a social life. If you wanted to get more pay, you had to work the graveyard shifts. I would not recommend working for any call center, ever."
bad,"If the job only involved being a technician, I would stay in the company for life. Unfortunately they moved in in home services meaning we have to sell products from google, amazon, Polk, they expect you to make at least a $40 dollar sale at every job and it’s very hard most of the time you go to the job to fix the customers cable issues that parts easy and it’s what makes the job fun but then you have to pull out a demo bag and try to almost beg the customer to buy something from just so you can keep your job."
bad,"Your told upon hiring that you work 4 10 hour days. That quickly turns to 5 12 or more hour days, with at lease one day of the weekend included every week. There main focus now is no longer servicing customers, it has turned into cramming products down customers throats to meet a sales goal or they will fire you. Good luck"
bad,Original job interview says you will be working 4 10 hour days. They don’t mention to you at all that once they get busy in the summer you will be working over 12 hours everyday and sometimes getting off at 1 am and clocking back in at 7. Upper management communication is so difficult to try and achieve. There goals that they want you to achieve are so unrealistic that you will never meet them. Training program was a nightmare. Felt like someone was always watching over your shoulder.
bad,"They dont care about how good of a tech you are they oy care if you sell all of these expensive products that an everyday person would just drop money on. If you dont do good in sales the rest of your work experience will be shty. Managment for the most part doesn't care about your problems in the field unless its something wrong with their equipment (there was one cool manager) "
bad,Managers of operations were horrible.  Nobody takes you seriously bc of title.  This job was well beneath my potential but I need a job. Management treated dispatch like dirt.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"A typical day at work would start at 715, we were to be on the road by 720. I would be assigned a route and had to check to make sure the equipment needed was stocked on the van. Everything you were expected to do was based on a metrick such as points per hour or completions. Poor routing and stock would make obtaining these metric base numbers very challenging. On a typical day I would drive for over 5 hours and do about 5 hours worth of actual work. The 2 biggest problems I had with the compnay where the metric base numbers and the turn over. Turn over was very high close to 75%. Out of 60 techs there were less than 10 that had more seniority than me. Due to the constant turnover, workloads would vary from extremely light to extremelly heavy. During the Summer months we would all work mandatory overtime upto 6 days a week with 12 hour days. The metrics were very hard to hit once you achieved the maximum tech level. To further complicate this, your metrics were different than your locations/managment metrics. So you would attempt to focus on your metrics while your boss's would attempt to focus on there's and they didn't match up. I really enjoyed my actual job. Every job was a puzzle that you had to figure out. Once you figured out the puzzle you moved on to the next one. Unfortuntely the company during my 8 years never provided a base rate increase other than achieving the next rank in tehcnican. You could only reach level 4 in technican which I achieved 4 years in. After I achieved that level I did not ""qualify"" for any performance based raises due to the metric scale. So"
bad,"Working for Dish Network, especially as a call center representative is more suited as temporary work, rather then a long term career. It is not possible to progress in the company whatsoever."
bad,It's a typical call center. It takes a certain type of person to be able to do the job correctly. I excelled at the job because I have a natural knack for customer service and I already had experience in the cable/telecommunications field. There was too much favoritism and shady stuff that went on in my particular call center. This is why corporate shut it down and laid off ALL employees at the time with very little warning.
bad,"In my 5 years of employment, I had the feeling that this company is more focused on its image as a 'customer focused"" company. in reality, they are not interested in their long term employees or their customers only their bottom line and profit."
bad,"If you can handle it being busier at certain times of the year, and being sent wherever the work is, and don't mind an environment where they push sales every day, then it is not a basket place to work."
bad,"This job as a manager was tough.  Work days on average were 13-14 hours, 4 days a week while paid by  salary for 40 hour weeks.  I worked way more than I was paid for.  Usually working 7 days a week. High pressure from upper management to complete unrealistic expectations.  Company cares more about numbers than the employee.  Work/life balance was almost impossible to maintain for both techs and management."
bad,"Worked 10 hour days"
bad,"There are always problems, and you are the key to do so, they rely on you, but at the same time that consumes you mentally."
bad,"I've been working at Dish for a very long time.  I have had extreme highs and extreme lows.  I can tell you that the company is certainly more agent focused than it is leadership focused.  At an agent level, we have progressive discipline which warns you when you make a mistake.  As a leader, you are held to an impossible standard that cannot be met.  You often do not get a chance to learn from your mistakes but are rather brutally obliterated for them.  None of your prior contributions are taken into consideration and the entry level employee is always right regardless of their previous contribution.  I am expected to be worked well beyond my current means and have often thought of resigning my position.  It's a difficult job that is underpaid.  I will take my skills elsewhere as I feel that prior contribution does not contribute to my success or character."
bad,"If you are lucky enough to get 2 weeks of field training by a DISH certified field trainer, you can do OK, not good, but OK with installs & trouble calls.    If you don't demand/insist that you get those two weeks in the field with a DISH certified field trainer, you will NOT be competent to have your own van, and on your own after 30 days of training.  There is just too much information.  On top of that, 80% of the actual job is selling each customer something that they don't currently have. Remote skins, HDMI cords, TV mounting, Sound bars, wireless systems, protection plans,etc.  If you cannot successfully sell stuff, you will not get promoted or keep your job.  Everything is a number with DISH, including you!"
bad,"Your schedule can change without warning. And your work load can become overwhelming with out preparation this is a true set up for failure, stress and a lack of work life balance."
bad,Working in a call center was stressful enough then the sold the employees during a slow season to do outsourcing for TurboTax. Most people quit at that point.
bad,Buen ambiente laboral flexibilidad de horarios buen compañerismo
bad,"Poor management, long hours, required to make sales while installing/troubleshooting. 20 plus years of different equipment that you required to have knowledge for. Training only encompasses last 5 years."
bad,The Supervisors stunk bad no support park car and seating with team disaster. they write you up straight out a training class just in case the make you switch providers and each person had to be good in all areas no just focused on one
bad,before i was hired so much was promised and said that made you say hey this is great once you actually start work for the company it all changes there is no work life balance if you have a family this job is perfect if you are single or speak spanish revolving hours make it almost impossible to plan anything and some management personel not all seem to pretend to care and just blow off concerns i definitely do not recommend dish to work for if you value family time and just general leisure they both are not abundant with dish
bad,"I signed on knowing it was a tough environment, but nothing could have prepared me for what happened. The company does not believe in Marketing, so teams are understaffed, overworked and under-compensated. The culture promotes dog eat dog mentality, when reporting a hostile work environment HR does not really help. I did learn a lot, but I don't think it was worth everything I sacrificed, and that includes my health."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,The attendance policy was too lax and allowed associates too much time out of work without real consequences. The culture at DISH was the worst I have been in. There was no respect for Management from associates and not respect from associates to management. Production and process improvement ideas were not followed through. Supervisors did not have real authority to make the changes need to improve their team.
bad,"Working at dish gives you the idea that you have job security. When in fact, they can lay you off at any point in time without any reason. They do not offer sick pay for days off that you are sick, a doctor's note does not cover any kind of an absence, if you do have to take a day off, the point counts against you and they use any paid time off that you have occurred to pay for that day that you missed. All in all dish is a very competitive, stressful and unfair place to work, not giving the employees the option or opportunity to advance if they would like to. I would not recommend working here, as you cannot be sure that you will have a job there in the next 6 months. The company itself has changed since I was there which wasn't more than 6 months ago, they have become very cut-throat and do not offer any kind of leniency should you need a break that is unscheduled for an emergency reason. I highly advise if you do decide to pursue a job there make sure you have a backup option at all times."
bad,This place is not worth working for. They will let you go for the smallest of things without even giving you a chance to sit down and talk to them or sign a final write up or even defend yourself.
bad,I decided call centers are not for me nor is a sales position. People on the phone are mean to csr. will not work at a call center again ever. I even took a pay cut here before getting out.
bad,"Mal trabajo, en especial Guadalupe Alvarado. si le caes bien te permite hacer lo que sea; se le pidió material de trabajo y acondicionar  del área de pintado ; ya que es un lugar cerrado y eso perjudica tu salud con la pintura. Se lo toma muy personal al grado de estar checando que hacías en cada momento."
bad,High turnover rate because of the poor talent that is hired. You can definitely work hard and advance but it will be difficult. Great place for young people entering the workforce
bad,"too many hours for the pay. difficult to take days off. difficult keeping managers due to long hours , hard to take vacation time due to lack of management to cover shifts ."
bad,"No clear measurable goals or career path. Be loud and irrational if you need to advance. Senior executives make all the decisions, mid management and directors  don't have much say."
bad,Not the worst place I’ve worked but definitely very stressful. The training was very long and unmotivating. Once on the phones you felt like you weren’t allowed a fair shot to get into a groove for taking calls.
bad,"working at dish you have to not have a personal life... management drills you on working overtime none stop, also you have no time off if you do take sick days they write you up for especially for not calling in 1hr before etc; you cannot leave home sick or they will mark you for that as if you called out"
bad,bust my behind for company for years never been late. always put my hands up for overtime and when i make one mistake in place of coaching me or helping me they let me go.
bad,"Dish had the potential to be great, but the current Management culture, above the Field Service Manager level, was awful. We tried to lead and develop technicians but were told to make them sell or kick them to the curb. Techs that had good sales numbers could get by with bad installation quality, GREAT techs that that didn't have a knack for sales were pressured to quit (even long term employees). Managers that didn't support this weren't around long either."
bad,"They don't trust their employees, they treat employees like kids in a convent, stressful environment, micro-management mentality, just not a good company to work at. Salary is also very low."
bad,its really cut throat and managers don't interact with there employees that's why I never spoke to them job advancement never happened they hired less qualified people for positions because they made less..no compassion if you had an emergency and had to leave. I wouldn't recommend it to nobody
bad,Used to be decent until they brought in new management. They cut pay and make it impossible to make good money. All day grind talking to trashy welfare cases with money. Dish is so garbage
bad,"Use this job for the experience and move on, it is not worth investing to much time there. Get more out of the company then the company will get out of you. They do not appreciative of the hard work you give them."
bad,"Will have you come in as customer service/frontline. Then make you feel like you getting prompted by making you tech. Then doing it again for dr. dish which is advance tech. Then it will be hard to get prompted because they don't have enough people oh the floor to take calls. They almost beg, you to talk your friends to come work there, but if your smart you won't. When you want to know answers supervisors won't know and give you a general excuse about admin. Also you will probably never physically see the machine your trouble shooting."
bad,worked in Florence office in south Carolina. sups have there favorites. pretty much you are thrown out to the wolves what was done in training is not what was in the field. no help from mangment .
bad,"Bad Place. Dont go here! You will regret everything about this place."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"This job is for people who are looking for a short term job. Your family life will suffer with the inability to schedule anything. The structure changes monthly, employees never can meet the expectations, and bosses change like the weather."
bad,Super long days and very far to drive. I did learn more about tools and the basics structures of a house.
bad,"Typical Day at work includes being at office at 715 Am then you get a brief before you have to go to your first job."
bad,"They set these metrics that you are required to hit or you will not make any money. they want to work you for 70+ hour and pay you based off production. Which is never set in stone. You get a set number of ""units"" for each job. each unit is worth whatever tier you are. so lets say you are a tier 5 tech, a service call is worth 8 units. a tier 5 tech makes $1.95 a unit. so you make less than $20 for service call that could take only 20 minutes, or it could take you 4 hours. but guess what? you dont make any more money. the only thing you get is more attention from management. i do not recommend this company to anyone unless you have absolutely no other options."
bad,The culture is very much your life revolves around them.  The consistently changed the bonus structure to benefit themselves.  There is many times I would achieve a higher bonus to find that the day before the pay check would arrive they have made retroactive changes to your pay.
bad,The pay is good for staring out but the stress and pressure they put on their employees is not worth it. It paid the bills but made spending time with the family hard and the benefits kept getting worse year after year. The only reason i last was because of my co workers but management was a hit or miss. Depending if you were on their good side or bad.
bad,"No respetan vacaciones, días de descanso, no asignan herramientas de trabajo en tiempo."
bad,"I loved the job, I enjoyed my co-workers.  The most difficult prty of the job was management and not willing to be proactive with employees ."
bad,"Dish is committed to hitting numbers above all else.  Everything, from work/life balance to customer satisfaction, takes a back seat to the numbers.  If you hit your numbers, you're great.  If you don't, you're a bum.  Employees are expendable, and they are actually referred to as ""resources"", not people.  If you are looking for an environment which places numbers over people, this is the place for you."
bad,"Installation of cable systems, residential homes and apartment complexes. Daily use of hand tools, and major power tools. Penetration of brick, wood, vinyl, and concrete. Daily routing of distances of up to 30 miles."
bad,"Some days you get only a days notice before your told you need to work. I was actually told to tell my boss everything I had planned, down to soccer games on Saturdays, for scheduling purposes."
bad,"I worked at Dish Network as a CSR and became what's called a Hopper White Glove Specialist. The job itself sucks answer phone calls from customers with problems agents create themselves. Training is horrible at Dish, you do the new hire training in the beginning and that's it. I mean the job is simple but the fact that a lot of people aren't on the same page as everyone else makes it difficult mainly because you will tell a customer the correct answer and then they will say "" well the last agent told me something different"" which makes you look like a liar. Advancement in the company, don't even try to move up unless you want to suck up to all of the under qualified managers. You can be one of the best agents in the entire company and that won't matter. Most of the managers there don't even do any work they just walk around basically being a cheerleader. The shifts aren't too bad, as long as you do a good job you will get the hours you want. The work place environment is extremely unprofessional. Everyone dresses like a bunch of bums and the place is dirty. There were mice in the place and even cockroaches! A lot of people will talk to other people while being on the phones and just mute the customer and sit there and cuss and scream about the customers, which then the customer on your phone will hear it and complain about it. Overall I would not recommend Dish Network to anyone. As far as a company and their products they have a bright future, but the way they treat their employee's don't waste your time."
bad,Good company but benefits such and they always try to add more to your work load with out any raise or benefit.
bad,Learned a lot from some of the managers there. Made some really good friends.
bad,Out of date company stuck in a dying industry leads to insane turnover close to 80% over a 12 month period.
bad,"Dish Network is an ok place to work as long as you dont mind not having any idea about your day, about how many hours you are going to work, ect.  The pay is good right out of the gate but when it gets slow your checks get small and a decent hourly rate doesn't do much when there is no work.  I was told lies in my interview about how the company works and it was def not represented well.  But make sure you are a salesmen if you want to work for them because if you can't make sales then they are a hard place to work for, they require all their techs to reach a certain sales goal every month."
bad,It depends on the department and manager on your experience.
bad,"between crawling in attics and under buildings, starting work at 7:30am and not getting home until midnight sometimes. You don't get paid nearly enough. With only a 30 minute lunch."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,The management was poor. Stressful work environment due hostile management. The company allowed them to make poor reasons to let go of people to achieve numbers goals. Bad job and would not recommend that job to anyone.
bad,"Boring work environment, not challenging enough for my skills."
bad,"Travel about 300-400 miles in a day"
bad,"The front line agents are taken care of, but Supervisor and Managers turnover is horrible. People are in constant fear of loosing their jobs. The site directors are scatterbrained, indecisive, and conniving. The site at which I was employed did not have a permanent director, and within a two year span they turned over four site directors. It was a horrible experience to have worked for Dish Network."
bad,"Essentially, I was in training about 4 hours away from home and I received a phone call that my Grandmother was dying. I had told my managers in advance that my Grandmother was ill and I may have to leave. I called my wife in a panic and started to go (I had just been assigned a vehicle the day before). I handed my supervisor the keys and went to get my stuff. They handed me back the keys and a gas card and told me to go home."
bad,"diariamente tenia que lidiar con quejas de clientes hacia el producto, maltrato laboral por parte de mi jefe, carencias por parte de la empresa y un horario laboral excesivo.aprendi a tranquilizar a los clientes y crear una mejor perspectiva del producto."
bad,terrible place to work. treat you like dirt and over work you. hired on they told me 40 hour weeks were normal and they 'frown' on overtime. completely not the case. expect around 70 hour weeks with no notice.
bad,"I helped customers with technical support or billing questions, add or remove programming, order pay-per-views, work closely with technicians to modify work orders, change the satellite position, or activate accounts and receivers, as well as work with telephone/internet companies for customers who had bundled billing to set up accounts or billing questions. The management was horrible. They would not let anyone advance or made it nearly impossible. They made the quality assurance tests so hard that if you missed one thing on a call, they would fail you as well as write you up. They are rude and lack empathy for others. The hardest part of my job was dealing with very irate customers, being threatened by customers and management, making sure my quality assurance scores were satisfactory, and trying to remain calm when customers or management are screaming at you and degrading you. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I helped customers resolve their issues."
bad,typical day is going into work and taking calls wether they need a tech to come out or I can fix it over the phone.
bad,This job was HORRIBLE. Forced OT for a year work every holiday and required to log in before your shift starts. DONT WORK HERE
bad,"Good job for young people without alot of responsibilities. When there is not enough work you are sent home and won't get paid unless you use your PTO. Alot of pressure from management selling smart home items, even when doing your best you are being put on the spot constantly. Lack of great leadership. More training required on the field. They keep hiring technicians and workload is low. Making 25-30 hours a week or less."
bad,"Very nit picky, too many shift changes and a lot of drama. You would have mandatory overtime with zero notice, forget having plans or a life. Shift bids were not based on tenure but performance. You needed to be prepared to be working 7-5pm one week and then a few weeks later a mandatory shift bid would occur and you could be working until 1Am. Only positive was free tv, which satellite is not that reliable."
bad,"You will be required to work split shifts, meaning 9am-1pm, then 5pm-9pm at one point during training of the job, this is not optional and should be expected and dealt with"
bad,Be prepared to be reviewed and re-reviewed on all calls. You must be 100% perfect on every call. Calls come back to back and you must be ready for the next call before ending the call you are on.
bad,"Management needs help, they are untrustworthy. Dish is a good company as long as you can find an office with good management, which seems unlikely. Maybe one day they’ll wake up"
bad,Other departments may be better but my boss is an extreme micro manager who is never wrong in his mind. The culture at Dish is the good ol' boys club and hasn't come around to the times.
bad,At dish my patience got better due to experiencing same issues from all customers. Management at dish was rarely available to speak with. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sales and winning prizes.
bad,First four weeks its peaches and cream then they throw you to the wolves. They suspect you to be an expert in technician work AND SELLING right after that. No work life balance.  You will be doing 12-15 hour work days. Their metrics is overly goaled. Again they will make you sell. Beware this is not just a technician job. You are a salesperson as well. So technically you have two job titles in one.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Te quieren despedir por todo, te amedretan todo el tiempo, si no estas de acuerdo te avientan cosas feas, no te dejan hacer tu trabajo y todo est amañando"
bad,"The job is stressful enough with customers calling in and upset either because their equipment does not work, or billing issues. That is to be expected. What is not expected is the ""metrics"" they expect you to have each week. Always of being a threat of being fired. THAT is what makes it a horrible place to work. It isn't the customers, it isn't the job, it is how they threaten and fire people over metrics."
bad,never wanted out of a company so bad. Terrible management and hated the hours. Got sent out to different states to work while I was never told I would be traveling past my own.
bad,"Tech duties are secondary. It's a sales job, but you're trying to force customers to impulsively buy 100s of dollars worth of product. Don't close the sales, you get fired. And if you're numbers are low, you're being threatened to be terminated."
bad,"I worked at a Regional Uplink Location. Its a very small team. No real advancement opportunties. If you want to move up in the company, you would need to relocate to Colorado, Wyoming or Arizona. The salary you start is ok, but dont expect quality raises. The normal is 2 or below which doesnt add up to much. The benefits are sub-par for a company this size. The one good perk is you get free Dish and discounts on any product they own. "
bad,There was very poor leadership in my department leading to the office being relocated to another state in order to get rid of him. Job was great but without leadership we crashed and burned.
bad,You are expendable. That's what the Dish motto should be. This company could care less about it's employees. They use you up and then throw you away. There is a lot of discrimination against women. I've had to report my manager several times with no change in the outcome of reporting him. Always short staffed and underpaid. There is a lot of work for an isp and they don't want give you the time you need to complete the work. The day to day is always changing as it latches on to whatever work outside of installing a dish that the company can find. It's going down the drain. They show no appreciation for all that you do. There insurance is terrible. I just wouldn't recommend working there to anyone.
bad,Very unorganized. Lots of promises with no results. No support from management. You are considered less than even a number. No communication. Uncomfortable environment within the office.
bad,"Pay is great for what I did. It did take me almost a decade to get to that point however. If you do your job, keep your head down and don’t start trouble, you will be fine. Insurance is terrible. $5000 deductible for a family and then 70/30 split with insurance. Culture is terrible. Point system for missed days is minimal. They are on a rolling one year period before they fall off your record. I wouldn’t let my child work here. They don’t know how to treat people well. If you make a mistake and punch the wrong button on the time clock you get what they call a coaching! So many coachinga make for a write up. Too many rules, and a ton on stress on a daily basis. Job is easy but they make it much harder with all the ridiculous procedures and rules. They don’t know how to be easy going and live by that old saying. “There is more than one way to skin a cat!” Avoid if you have other options."
bad,"I took this job for a month before quitting. Let me give a rundown of my experiences"
bad,Different people say rules differently its all dont worry and just handle what you need to yet they dont tell you it still counts against you . i like what i was learning and making a difference ...
bad,After you are comfortable with your job it can be pretty boring sitting there for 10 hours. Very few opportunities to walk around which you take for granted once you're stuck to a computer screen. The managers in the department I worked in were a little two-faced and liked to suck up to the department head. They were nice overall though. The best part was the schedule - four work days and three days off. You do have to work holidays and weekends (if that is your set shift).
bad,"They had bed bugs, and then they try to blame it on the worker and tell you that you can't work again until you exterminate your house for $200. I know for a fact they didn't come from me. But also how do you ruin someone's life over a rumor. To me the money isn't worth being treated like that."
bad,"Not willing to discuss to avoid issues. I was targeted and retaliated against for talking to my boss's, boss's boss and unfortunately ""laid off"" because my position was eliminated."
bad,"Terrible work environment, Center management completely unprofessional, favoritism was very prevalent which made for a toxic work environment in an already stressful work setting."
bad,Learn discipline and how to manage yourself at this company. Lower your expectations in terms of career advancement. Free TV service. Potential to get free electronics if you sell a lot of electronics to customers.
bad,"Dish invests a lot of time into their employees, continually trying to grow them through weekly trainings.  Dish is especially good at training Supervisors and above with the skills they need to become great leaders through seminars and various courses."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,this place was not condusive to your family life in order to make money you had to work a million hours a week. Great as a short term monetary goal. BUT DO NOT WORK FOREVER!
bad,"Zero job security, good pay, good benefits but don't plan on investing because you'll go fast and be gone before you know it. Don't make friends and do not be late."
bad,Just look at the news to see how they treat employees. The company is very cut throat and don’t treat their employees with respect. At the end of the day we are a number and nothing more.
bad,"It's a corporate job with corporate nonsense and a lot of higher ups coming up with ideas that ""work"" but when implemented create more work or aren't remotely functional."
bad,"The Tulsa site's management lacks strong communication skills, they do not promote a culture of job security and are more concerned for their perceptions than developing leaders in the company. They do not train leaders but expect possible leaders to perform even when they have yet to get the promotion. Agents, Trainers, Coaches, and Team Leads/OJTs fear for their jobs which creates pressure and stress."
bad,"After worked there for 9 years the company has went downhill with the treatment of it's employees. Your numbers MUST be on par even when most of the time it's out of your control I.E. trouble calls, completion, points per hour , etc ."
bad,"Dont recommend, pay is low and the advancement is hard and they play favorites. They are super cheap, the location is far out, everyone i met there was looking to another job"
bad,"Time spent wasn't that long, the management was in the middle of a complete overhaul and incoming personnel were left without support or guidance on a daily basis."
bad,If you have no life and don’t mind having no life. They get u with 4 10hr days but that never happens.. you work 5 or 6 days 10-14 hr days .. n I understand it’s about the customer but the company really don’t care about the techs at all
bad,"Management doesn't understand why they're continually getting poor engagement scores. Instead of listening to the feedback they get about the old school culture, management has focused on an annual party to boost morale. Schedule is not flexible - an email goes through the executives if you're late by even a second. Working from home is NEVER an option. Health benefits are lacking, and PTO is minimal."
bad,The only good thing about this place is the pay. Good luck advancing without being buddy buddy with the managers. They will work you until they break you. No Work/Life balance whatsoever.
bad,Dish does take the time to train you on basic installs. The pay is really low compared to other companies that provide TV service. You do get free Dish Network TV service...
bad,"The only positive thing I can say about being an installation/repair technician for dish, is that they offer paid training, but even the training they provide is somewhat of a joke. All technicians are required to work weekends and the schedule moves around a lot based on the whims of the management. The company has a weird and manipulative culture. They encourage an unhealthy level of competitive behavior amongst employees, all while they're paying a low wage and pocketing much more of the profits from the sells (they require you to make), than you would typically see in a commission based sales scheme. You're not allowed to opt out of the sales scheme. My advice: stay away."
bad,"All in all if not for management I would still work there. From RM(Regional Manager) down to FSM(Field Service Manager), they only cared about one thing....sales. If your a good salesman then the ""Technician"" job is for you. Insurance is not that great but better than nothing. Discounts are very good. The other Technicians are more often than not great to work with. They need to throw out the number system for evaluating techs. They look at a spreadsheet of numbers to determine if you are a good tech which honesly means very little. As a remote technician there was a lot of freedom....unless you dont sell overpriced electronics. If you do accept a technician job just be very aware selling is the most important thing...if your not a good salesman dont waste your time."
bad,I was hired immediately and was given the impression that I would handle both Spanish & English customers. Spanish only. Most without SSN or fake SSN.
bad,"You never knows what hours you might be working,they ask for you to fill out a preferences schedule then give you what they want you to have  they say you can move up in the company  and your coach don't care if you move up the ladder or not will not give the help that you need to be successful  your coach talk bad about the company. The head person don't like working for the company he's just there. People come in drunk roaches crawling on your desk your fighting nats all day there's mice running around they build a new bathrooms in the lady room the gaps are so wide you can see people in the stall. I can't count how many times EMSA has came out rolling people out on the stretcher, smell like mildew my sinus acts up very bad."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was the lack of transparency from management. Everything was dramatized and secretive when changes were made, promotions, etc. There was too much nepotism and promotions seemed to involved their ""favorites."""
bad,"Typical day at work, there is a quick morning meeting before getting on the phones to take calls from existing customers who have complaints about services, bills, equipment or want to upgrade. The main goal is to solve the issue, sell as much as you can and get off the phone and on to the next as fast as possible. Dish does not care about the customer at all! they just want them to buy. "
bad,"Good luck it takes forever to get a decision, I waited 4 months from time of interview before I got an answer about the promotion. The expectations are unrelealistic and too difficult to accomplish."
bad,"Worked hard, and did the job correctly , would be sent to fix others that hacked job in.Dish doesn't care will use you , abuse you, Then if you stay to long get ride of they can get somebody cheaper. If you go to work for them use it as a stepping stone to better job."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Management was the worst of all things. The hours were awful same with the work. The pay did not match the amount of stress it caused. Not worth dedicating three months of your life
bad,"Management is horrible. Good luck getting any help from them. They do not care about your personal life at all. Don't get sick and pray that your kids don't get sick! There is no room for ""life"" to happen at this job."
bad,"One of the most unbalanced jobs I've ever held. During my two years I had 5 supervisors and 4 leads and I never had the same management for longer then a few months. Policies constantly changed to benefit them and job advancement was rare. They hired anybody to keep the place full and to try to help the high turnover rate. But it actually made it worse cause they would stay a few weeks and we would go back being understaffed and overworked. No ac in the receiving department and it was usually around 90 back there. The job takes a toll on your body constantly bending up and down and side to side. Palatizing receivers, unloading trucks, clarify receivers, and carrying the accessories."
bad,Salary is much low. I have been working for last two year and six months. Outbound process domestic label. Dishtv process in Hindi.
bad,"Selling Dish takes an extra kind of special skill, especially in this area as most people already have the service. I couldn't upgrade or modify customer's existing service, only sell to new customers. Lost leads to customers calling Dish and setting up themselves and loosing the sale or customers already had the service."
bad,"entrada a las 8 de la mañana te entregan cartera como a las 9 casi 10 de la mañana si toca foraneo son 2 horas para llegar al pueblo o municipio realizar minimo 3 cobros , que consiste cobrarles a los clientes el atraso que tienen si el cliente quire seguir con el servicio pero no le alcanza el dinero se le ofrece un descuento del 25%  se le deja la señal en ese momento o un pago parcial del 50% y regresar en 3 dias por el otro pago, si el cliente no quiere seguir con el servicio se le recoge el equipo, si tienes algun problema llamas a oficinas y no contestan asi pasen 2 horas, motivos no se .. llegamos nuevamente a toluca y pasamos adepositar el pago de los clientes antes de las 7 de la noche si estamos en foraneo y no llegamos atiempo a depositar se deposita al otro dia en la mañana no hay horas de salida ya que los ultimos 15 dias son de operativo y salimos hasta las 11 de la noche, nos dan motos"
bad,"When I started it was a great job. Get your route, go do the installs and repairs, go back to the garage, clean out your work van and stock it for the next day. Bosses changed. Micro managing, demoralizing, good work wasn't appreciated. I was glad to leave. I didn't mind the work. The change in policies and constant management interference was stressful. I always did quality work. I take pride in the work I do. The stress was unwarranted so I was glad to leave."
bad,"We ""workers"" are decent people but the environment created by a complete lack of leadership from the managers, causes everyone to perform at a much lower rate.   Supervisor do all the leading yet are treated like welcome mats by plant management.   If they would hire some professional, educated leaders the entire operation would greatly increase."
bad,"One must finger scan every time one enters and exits corporate HQ. EVERYONE must be in building during Core Hours regardless of weather conditions and pay grade. "
bad,"The product is pretty good and something that the employees can get behind. However the Upper middle management was fairly clueless on what was going on and how to achieve any real loyalty with employees and their customers. They over worked and abused their good employees and praised and coddled the ones who were subpar trying to ""motivate"" them to be better. Culture was poor with every good or excellent employeed surrounded by 3-4 people who didn't want to be there and mde the good employees jobs much more difficult."
bad,"It could be a great company to work for as long as you are not working for the Direct Sales Team. Employees are not treated with respect, there is no loyalty and compensation is far from what other companies offer."
bad,"dish."
bad,"Schedules changed semi annually and what you got is what you got. No exceptions. Lottery based heavily on tenure and some performance. Mandatory overtime when they felt like it. Could wait until 15 minutes before the end of your shift to tell you that had to stay an extra hour for mandatory overtime. At times would have mandatory 6th day of work. CEO would not agree to terms with a network, channels would be lost, we would be scheduled for mandatory overtime, CEO goes on vacation"
bad,I started with this company and did not receive proper acknowledment for exceeding in all areas of employment. Management is not acceptable.
bad,This place was voted worst place to work for in the U.S. last year.  Enough said.
bad,Working for a temporary agency you cannot expect much. I was sent to multiple jobs and interviews as every job was a filler for seasonal or if they had increased work load. The only reason I rate it so low is because sometimes the jobs would lay you off without warning or no real reason. Then it was a scramble fest and possible months without employment.
bad,Work overall is ok.  Direct supervisor are good but senior supervisor well not so much.  During high season you get a lot of hour which is ok but you done get enough time home. and during low season you are lucky is you get over 30 hours a week.  Co-workers are ok.  Are working overall is good.  the downside that the way that you are evaluated is out of your control. Like Completions is a tree is on the way or the apartment is facing north it show like is your fault and you get hit for that. Point per hour well that is ok minus driving time. TC-12 well is the customer mess with the system or if the equipment malfunction is your fault. customer satisfaction is not about how well you do your job is more if the customer like it which sometimes you do the install to the book the customer don't like it you get hit. Connectivity is the biggest one because a customer is getting a hd receiver and do not have internet you get it. overall it was ok
bad,bueno aunque en algunos aspectos tienen que cambiar ya que los sueldos son atractivos pero son tardados no llegan como dicen eso hace que pierdamos interes por ellos.
bad,"They are very big on safety which is a good thing but the overall quality of work is very poor. I believe this is because the lack of incentive, if you have the privilege of working there five years, on your anniversary you receive a cheap dollar store desk clock, and at ten years I believe you get a picture frame, at 15 years they give you a fake leather jacket which of course carries the DISH logo. The management does what they want regardless of feedback from leads and supervisors. The work is easy but very unsatisfying and not rewarding whatsoever. The hardest part of the job is being a lead and having to train people who really don't care or take any kind of pride in their work, and then being scolded for their poor performance The most enjoyable part of the day of course is clocking out and going home."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"I worked for Dish in a combined effort for over 10 years.  At first there was great management, growth, rewards. After the past 2 yrs, management stopped promoting from within.  Rewards were taken away.  It got very hard to go to work happy life before.  I worked hard and I was always happy to go to work.. But all the benefits stopped and no reason was given.  Management turned dictatorship.."
bad,"Sales push is to extreme on unqualified customers"
bad,95 % of the people I encountered at Dish were looking outside the company for another job.
bad,"I'm new to the corporate side of the company having worked for them going on 6 years now. I worked my way up from an agent in the call center to the position I'm currently in. I felt I was making the right decision but recently after a year in the corporate atmosphere at DISH I'm second guessing that choice for both lack of enjoyment in coming to work and financial reasons. "
bad,The work is easy and seeing people in different areas everyday is good. Tech are pushed to sell products to customers. The review process leaves a lot to be desired.
bad,I worked for DishNetwork for 12 years and never really felt appreciated. The days were long and growling. The management staff played favortism constantly.
bad,"Mandatory Overtime for hourly employees is a bit ridiculous, but it being a call center, they queues would back up for no reason, so they would make us stay for another hour, no matter if you already had plans or not..."
bad,"Dish Network is an agressive, hard charging dsyfunctional corporation. The company is a great introduction of technolgy and opportuntiy to do a lot in a short period of time. It is not a place to go if you want a work life balance or if you need a lot of hand holding."
bad,"The biggest advantage to working at DISH is the opportunity to work on high-level, visible projects. If you are just starting your career, working at DISH is a great opportunity to build your resume. After about two years at DISH, you will become a valuable comodity in the job market."
bad,"I've worked in various sales environments however in the case of Dish it was my worst experience. The sales managers micro manage sales team and provide a lot of stress on making sales which can stunt your growth with the company. You have the potential to make a nice earning but everything is based on the metrics of that current week and how you did prior to that week. Its almost impossible to find the growth chart and other positions for moving up the ladder, even on a company computer. In the long run if you are looking for something quick or part time this is amazing for work life balance. However if you are looking to create a career or steady income its similar to playing the lottery. Its a fairly easy sale but every sale that you don't get affects your commision rate so be prepared for a stressful ride. In all Dish has the potential to be a nice job opportunity and company. If they were honest and took their employees experience into account and worked together to come up with solutions."
bad,This used to be a great company to work for.  They really cared about the agents.  Then they got new senior management and went cheap on everything.  Non supportive environment with severe work limitations.
bad,"They will train you to do the job so you can start/change careers very easily here and get excellent opportunity for experience. The downside is pay/benefits are very poor so that is the compromise you make. ""DISH pays in opportunity"" is something I hear often. Slow pace but slow pay as well."
bad,"Avoid working here if possible.  Most large companies have a few bad managers and many good managers.  Dish is the opposite, it has few good managers and mostly are bad."
bad,"unrealistic installation goals, which cause fellow technician to cut corners which cause other technicians to suffer by having to redo job that should have been done correct the first time. Forced to up sell to customers with equipment that they already had or didn't want"
bad,"Opportunity exists for very pushy people, so no time to stop and collect your thoughts. The management was overloaded with lifers who's past accomplishments overcame all current shortcomings, even for incompetent managers. Dish can fix and overcome just about any challenge given enough investment, but they can't get rid of the pervasive bad attitudes that have demolished what should have been a great company."
bad,"I loved my job installing satellite dishes and trouble shooting systems ."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"The future of the company doesn't look stable. Witch might explain the reason of the high percentage of employees that quit for other jobs. Or the ones that where unjustly fired."
bad,"I had been speaking with department manager with in Hq about added services that could be provided and then reached out to Hq . I was then shortly released for that by my manager, He said he would give me a good refuril to my next job. I found out from my next employer that my manager gave me a bad refuril to the job I applied for. Not cool !!!!"
bad,"Only work here if you dont have a llive, kid or lover. Not women friendly.... supervisors do not care customer that you get harrassed. Pay is well but the over-time is a killer."
bad,"Standard policy wasn't applied to all employees, favoritism, verry high turnover rate, extremely high call volume, not a set schedule, hardest part of the job is not being treated equally"
bad,"While working at dish i was a little intimidated at first, but then realized how repetitive things were and became succesful, began to view dish as a career vs just a job, how ever when things became rough with the companys overal pay savings, i began to realize job security was no more. At which then came the stress and fear of lossing my job, people around you just look out for thenselves."
bad,I loved the people I worked with but they lacked ordered management and that they did not provide transparent management as they advertised so readily.
bad,"Managers don't care about the technicians, they only care about their image up in corporate.  It's all numbers, technicians come and go. Only good thing about here is the training."
bad,"Worked there for quite a while, was certified to do more than satellite installation, which seems like a great opportunity, but it is not. If you do not make enough sales, you will be treated unfairly. Management is forced to be hard on you due to the Operation Manager stressing everyone about sales. You must sale “top notch” products that are actually overpriced and inferior to products you can buy at Best Buy."
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for! Instead of hiring skilled managers within the company Dish Network would hire McDonalds and Burger King managers with No job experience to manage you!! So that means if you get stuck on o job and need help they can't help you, you'll have to wait  one to two hours for another Tech to finish is route to come help you. High millege and out dated equipment. Terrible customer service."
bad,Management at Dish is a revolving door. There is no healthy work life balance. Managers will be in the building from open to close. Upper management is always micromanaging the metrics. Offices are always being compared to better performing offices and managers.
bad,"Dish used to be a great place to work. Technician quality of workmanship was top priority. now the amount of sales vs quality of work, has made the good techs obsolete. I did not like pushing high cost, sub par items to customers."
bad,"Dish is a fun place to work sometimes. Management is not to great. you get in trouble for putting a customer on hold for more than 3  minutes exactly and you can get fired for it. they dont have many leads on the floor so you have to get up and look around for one sometimes just so you can get your question answered. Sometimes when you have a sup call you go to ask for a lead to take and they dont want to take the call. So you have to go back to the phone when the customer is already mad and does not want to speak with you. You get these tiers. for example. if you are reading a disclosure to a customer and you say one word wrong you can get a tier for it, you can only get 15 tiers before they fire you. One agent that was working there got 15 tiers with out his lead even telling him to fix something or what he was doing wrong before he even hit 15 tiers, so he can stop getting tiers. then he ended up getting fired. You can make a lot of money at Dish but you never know if you will have a job tomorrow."
bad,"With mounting subscriber losses every quarter, senior management seems to keep shrugging it off as simply losing low quality customers. Despite the fact that as a business driven by large fixed costs even low value, break even customers have a great deal of value in supporting our operating costs."
bad,"Dish does not foster any kind of healthy environment for it's employees. Management, teams and work schedules are constantly changing. There is no accountability among management."
bad,"A typical work day is can be up to 12 hours long depends on the jobs you get. It's very customer oriented you get scored by the customer on your performance in an email. So its you best interest to do well by the customer."
bad,Health benefits are trash. You can NOT work your way up. Only way you’ll rise to new height is if you leave the company and come back. Company tools are highly outdated and upper execs think it’ll be too costly to do a system upgrade. You’ll be the last to know about things that affects your department directly. Lack of communication between departments which causes constant confusion and errors.
bad,"el horario era agradable porque solo era el turno de la tarde, pero la presion del trabajo se incremento sin un incremento del salario"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"I was told at hiring that I would work 4 ten-hour days a week with SOME mandatory overtime. For 9 months straight, I worked 5 twelve-hour days per week. Sure, there was lots of overtime pay, but I had a wife and two young kids at home. No half days. No guarantee of daily end time. Not enough PTO. Being a technician is all about sales of their ""Smart Home"" products. Good techs with bad sales are reprimanded while bad techs with good (sometimes unethical) sales are praised. If you're not a salesman, you won't do well here."
bad,"Very unsafe place and you're expected to installations that often required another person to help you given the height of the home, angles or steepness of the ladders."
bad,Plan on starting your day and never know when you are going to be done. If you dont mind being micromanaged then this job is ok. Metrics are very hard to achieve and are conflicting. You can do well in one metric however you have to sacrifice another. Sales sales sales. It seems the company has shifted from being a tv company with technicians to a retailer with salesman. You are as good as your sales. Tho management states they have an open door policy however your opinion or ideas dont matter. You are talked down to and feel threatened to be fired if you dont have sales or hit your metrics every month. LIke I said very stressful
bad,No Review I have nothing too say good or bad about this company i have made a bunch of friends at dish ! It is a fun place to work but moving up in the company you have to be in the in crowd
bad,"Opportunity to make a large amount of money, but no recognition of life/work balance, poor benefits, and little job security leaves much to be desired."
bad,"i was a call center support person here and all day you just get auto connected to calls where people yell at you for stuff they broke."
bad,"Executive Leadership is strategic, Middle and lower management horrible."
bad,"You are just a number not a name.  management is absent and your leads are powerless.  Shady payroll practices.  And employees are not a valued asset.  walk in, do your job, hope you make money, leave.  its sad .  old computers, when phones are down you arent paid commission lost."
bad,"I was employed with Blockbuster LLC when Dish Network purchased the company. I stayed with the company through the transition and accepted a position with Dish Network when the transition was complete. Although I accepted a higher position with Dish, I did have to take a pay cut in order to accept the position. I loved the work I did and the people I worked with up to and including my supervisors. I was in charge of the West and traveled weekly to markets in order to conduct training classes, audits and loss prevention investigations. I thoroughly enjoyed interacting with employees and customers and I loved training employees on how to best run their businesses. I learned a lot about conducting thorough investigations and conducting interviews with suspected employees. Through my training I learned a lot about reading people and judging their truthfulness when interviewing them. The most challenging part of my job was recommending and initiating prosecution based on my investigation findings. "
bad,"If you have a family, do NOT work at Dish Network. You will non-stop work. Unlimited 5th day weeks, not getting off until 7 pm. Normal schedule is 4 10 hour shifts. Those 10 hour shifts turn into 12-15 hour shifts and then they require you to work a fifth day during the week. If one week you are unable to do a fifth day, then you are mandated to work a 6th  day one week. There is ZERO for/life balance."
bad,Its a good job. you are by yourself most of the time and always busy. the pay is decent but to get a raise and advancement is almost impossible. Pretty much a dead end job.
bad,"The benefits are great, the job is extremely stressful and the management acts like they care but they do not. They do a great job pretending to be this inviting, friendly, caring environment but it is not do not be fooled. If you are not perfect the manage will basically make you feel like a failure and make you feel unwanted. I felt like I had to operate on eggshells and they change the rules based on how they feel. The job is not worth what you have to put up with from managers or customers."
bad,Typical day was 50-100 calls. Most people have to tell you how great of a customer they are and how they always get a loyalty discount.and they have to have it or they will go to your competition. The leads will have your back but if you struggle will tell you to go take a walk which affects your pay but makes there numbers look better.the last lead I had was awesome would work thru a tough day untill it got better. Other lead had no clue how to help. Having to care about the callers complaints and lack of brains made for a long dam day.and Everytime there is a channel takedown and it happens a lot. The calls are that much more fun
bad,"I did not like the way the call center was set up. It was in a dusty old Walmart building, They would not let you go to the restroom until break and you could not even have water"
bad,Dish lies to you as soon as you come in the door. There is very little job security or  chance of advancement. the pay is the only compensation. the Management is the worst I ever encountered. you feel like cows headed in and out of  with no dregard for health or well being.
bad,"They want you to sell items to the customer, fix dish equipment, install equipment, fix phones, fix washing machines, any custom jobs for the customer all while keeping good numbers on your stats"
bad,They require you to work weekends and require you to be in the office before 9 and can't leave until at 4.  Management was great and the people I worked with were fantastic.
bad,"Long days.  Techs paid hourly.  Pay could be more competitive.  Overtime available, but closely monitored.  Opportunities to travel out of maket.  Per diem is pretty good.  Benefits are not competitive, but the company provides tools, equipment, and full uniforms.  Schedule is awesome.  Wed through Saturday or Sunday through Wednesday allowing you time to spend with your family.  Work drops off during the slow season Oct-March."
bad,honestly not a secure job and did not have a good experience as well as was very stressful and the most enjoyable part of work would be the breaks and lunches the hardest part was dealing with escalated customers
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Dish was a decent job to begin with and the job its self isnt hard but the management could use improvement. They are not very active in the development of agents and tend to drop the ball alot when it comes to training and information. Nothing is consistent when it comes to management.
bad,its been a few years but when i worked there it was just not a good place to work at.  very little recognition of accomplishments and management taking credit for employees ideas and hard work
bad,"I made calls to customer that had written in about a issue or issues  . Answered  their billing questions , made programming changes if requested , gave programming options. Explained  what to expect on next bill. Educated about any promotion under . Assist with technical issues . Transferred customer to a department that  handle specialty issues . What  I have learned is that I enjoy working with customers and assist them with issues any concern they have. And making them aware of options they may not be aware of . Enjoy the coworkers that I have become friends with . Not a friendly work environment to be working in and not feeling valued  as employee. The  hardest part of the job is the day to day  disagreement between a supervisor and what is called a team lead on how some issues are to resolved .The  most enjoyable part of my  job is that I enjoy the customers I have assisted and working with my coworkers."
bad,"Thumbprint at entrance, log in to computer, auto-in to incoming calls immediately before system is up to prevent any ""aftercall"" or you get docked for inefficiency, negative atmosphere since the general consensus is you'll be fired over anything. Highest turnover rate of a company i've worked for. People literally walked out of the building during training! "
bad,"Overworked, underpaid compared to similar job in the field.  Field managers care about their employees but their hands are tied by middle and upper management.  Expectations keep going up but pay and benefits do not.  So many employees quit that they can never hire enough manpower for the work.  Ive only worked for the company for 1.6 years but I've personally seen5 managers quit and go to different companies"
bad,"Enjoyable job when working with customers"
bad,"Dealing and interacting with customers was always a great or interesting experience. Problem solving and installing new services is something i was excellent at. the work atmosphere was good with my fellow technicians. The only drawback was the lack of proper communication between supervisors,upper management and technicians,which lead to mistrust and complacency."
bad,"Great coworkers.  To a point.  Lead lies to management.  Management lies about most everything.  They met a quota by hiring citizens, then came up with vague B.S. to fire us.  Great product & customer service though!"
bad,Distant remote technicians have no accountability for their actions.  Senior management needs to get in the field and live the PAW as they like to say but don't show it by trying to run the business from the desks.
bad,"I have been with Dish Network for a while now and there has been an on going lack of communication and excuses from upper management that try to explain away problems with equipment or processes that are broken or not working and then put the problems on lower management and the technicians and try to have them deal with it and give them a work around to get past the problem that consumes a lot of time instead of the upper management fixing the problem. We have to deal with this on a daily basis and as of late because the company has taken a hit on stocks and is loosing money now they expect the techs to pickup the tab by doing so many dollars per work order in sails of audio and video equipment. There are really good technicians that are on the chopping block for termination due sale due to mismanagement from upper management. Flat out in so many words were told sell or else, I guess the customer doesn't count as the routing and wrong work orders inconvenience the customer upon arrival coupled with faulty equipment, and Dish is wandering why they are loosing customers and money."
bad,"the culture at dish is hit or miss. when it comes to management, they will bend over backwards for their favorites, but they will push the ones they couldnt care less about as far as they can. they will tell you that there are advancement opportunities, but there are not many beyond taking phone calls."
bad,This job required the technicians to do jobs that required 2-3 people by yourself an some jobs would take hours at a time an we had techs staying from 6am- 8:30-9:00 st night to get everything done an then expect them to be back at 6am an it was super tought an they under appreciated their employees very bad!
bad,"El comienzo en la empresa fue bueno e incluso motivante, sin embargo conforme comence a adaptarme fui descubriendo una serie de arbitrariedades de las cuales termine siendo afectado."
bad,"Dish is a typical call center environment. Very fast paced call types lead to high call volume (about 60-80calls a day), and even fast training (4 weeks). I would not suggest this job for first time workers at a call center."
bad,"i haven't  enjoyed my time here, the entire team seems to thrive on complaining about every little thing every morning. Dish has been voted one of the worse companies to work for many years in a row now. i wouldn't recommend a job here."
bad,My only concern was that when it came to family they really didn't show to much empathy. Had to work OT when they made it required. Had received a raise but never received it. Couldn't release calls when a customer was being very disturbing.
bad,Its like high school. You have to kiss butt to make it anywhere in the company. You take surveys about the company cause they know they arent a good place to work for. Customers are allowed to call you and your whole family out of their names. There is nothing to protect you from the verbal abuse if you hang up your fired. If uou be quiet your fired and if you agree with them your fired! Not worth it the menal/verbal abuse is not worth it. Alot of agents in the last couple weeks have quit and alot more are talking about walking out. Contsct us around the corner are accepting agents asap looks like alot are going there
bad,"A typical day has customers calling in with technical issues, disputing charges and/or contracts, and all around customer support (mostly billing).  "
bad,"Continuous, unexpected and inconvenient business changes; all without warning and with no explanation. Poor management. Some room for advancement but with lack of options for scheduling. Tenure does not matter here. In my opinion this company lacks both direction and reasoning."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,hated the manager. he was terrible to work for. on a daily basis he was controling and very rude. his boss was exactly the same way but worse
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone. Thry are not a company that promotes on what you know. It is more of who you know.
bad,Would have rather worked somewhere else do not think this company is prepare for workers
bad,The local management was fair but the upper management is all over the board with little direction.  Any direction given by upper management was suspect and in flux.  You need very thick skin and the ability to put in a lot of hours.
bad,"I worked there for about 5 years, great place to work just management does care about not one single person, but as long as you work hard and not miss a day your good"
bad,A typical day at work is chatting with agents and customers through our online chat console. We learn about new procedures with our application everyday. Submitting technical errors with our application. Communicating with co workers through IM or face to face.
bad,"A typical day at work with dish i take up to 100 inbound retention calls. The calls vary between technical support, billing and attempts to actually save a customer. I love my co-workers but upper management fails to interact with agents on a lower level which leads to miscommunication on a daily basis. The part of my job I enjoy most is that I can work independently."
bad,Managment was always changing and so were the expectations. It was quite chaotic. They don't take time to develop employees but instead rely on quick mindless decisions that usually backfire.
bad,A typical day was answering phones and trouble shooting technical problems with customers. I learned a lot about how satellite TV works and how to speak to people matching their knowledge.
bad,"I would not recommend working for DISH. In the time I was there they made it very clear that they have very little respect for there work force. My primary job was explaining to customer trying to end their contract why it was legal for DISH to cut and past their signature onto contracts the customers never saw or agreed to. These contracts were then used to justify withdrawing large sums of money, sometime in excess of $400, out of the customers bank account. This is obviously not ok and in order to get their money back the customer was responsible for doing an unreasonable amount of work or file a lawsuit. This level of disrespect and lack of accountability extends to the way DISH deals with their employees."
bad,Every day get to learn more about the business and try to solve them technically.
bad,Not much advancement opportunity. Long unappreciated hours.
bad,I would advise that this only be a temporary position.Advancement in the company is long in coming and short in duration.
bad,Dish is a good place to get some experience early in your career but once you have a year or two of experience in your field you will probably be more than ready to move on. You can easily get in and get some experience and build your resume. This is because Dish is always churning through and burning out employees and so they are always looking for new employees.
bad,I have learned things are always changing. Looking for a different oppurtunity.
bad,"Expect to be here 6 months. The turn over rate is 75% per year.  Imagine,  losing 3/4 of your staff yearly. Ridiculous. Pay is good, benefits are okay."
bad,mala no me gusto trabajar aqui porque mi salario era solo por comisiones
bad,"I spent almost three years at Dish headquarters in Denver.  My job duties were always vague, and I did not choose to partake in the club of opportunists who were pursuing advancement up the company ladder.  Executive management seemed to engage in ethically questionable practices, and the culture grew to accept and advance such a code of conduct."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Días normales menos cuando te pide salir fuera de tu ciudad y no te pagan viáticos no pagan las comisiones o se justifican para no pagarlas siempre ay que andar atrás de los supervisores para confirmar gestiones
bad,The associates are very unprofessional and the management plays favoritism and are racially bias. I would not recommend working there. The work environment is similar to being in a high school.
bad,"I really enjoyed the people at DISH and most folks were very passionate about what they were doing which was great. However, the company offers below average benefits, long hours, and zero flexibility (even during snow days and inclement weather). The company expects you to give 200% while only receiving 50% which did not sit well with me. On to bigger and better things!"
bad,Really a very uninspiring position. The franchise was run by a local family. They spent far too much time on a phone call going over the contract. The city of Ravenna is awful.
bad,Dish as a corporation is a decent company.  Corporate is very safety oriented and wants to ensure that their techs are happy.  This is lost in translation between corporate and local management.  There is a high demand for on site sales even though $/work order isn’t a reviewable metric.  They do review your attach rate which is how many sales you make by how many jobs you have.
bad,The management for my department was terrible. We lacked the help we needed. They tried to put too much on few employees. No one i knew from there works there now as they have either left or got fired because of downsizing.
bad,"PAs every 3 months, always have to pick someone to be on Personal Improvement Plan. If you get a PIP, 95% chances you get fired. They follow rules only when is convenient for the managers, not for the front battle workers"
bad,"Not where I would want to stay long term, but I was able to gain a lot of valuable experience.  The leadership is less than desirable - the president will wait in the lobby to see who comes in late"
bad,"Usually calls/chats were waiting when you got in and that made for a stressful start. We never really had time between calls/chats. "
bad,"There is no actual team building, chemistry, and relationships between you and members of management. If your metrics aren’t up to par you will not be even remotely considered for promotion regardless of strengths in certain areas. You are constantly reminded daily/weekly of how replaceable (disposable) you are if you do not sales and survey aspects of the metrics. As quoted by an field service manager “Sales and Surveys will get you fired. Pph (points per hour), Hip 12 (internet connection), and R12 (repair 12days) will get you talked to.”"
bad,"Empresa en declive, los salarios en cuanto al personal operativo son bajos."
bad,There are pros and cons to working for Dish.  The pros are you can potentially make a lot of money there and you generally have a pretty stable position if you follow the rules.  The cons are that the company makes it very hard to make consistent commissions and that you will eventually dread going to work each day once you see how the company operates.  Working in the sales department is okay if you're careful to follow the rules.  Working in retention is absolute misery.
bad,Siempre estás a merced de las deducciones impulsivas de tus superiores en cualquier área
bad,Dish had quite a double standard from what your  supervisor told you and from the upper management in the building. It seemed they were more interested in keeping seats filled then developing talent. A lot of double talk. They treated everyone very poorly the day they announced the layoff. I would not recommend Dish as far as my employment experience.
bad,"Buy your own tools. Gas. Equipment ect.  And learn quickly no paid training."
bad,"ok company from what I can remember "
bad,"saludos yo trabaje en esta empresa como cobra y la verdad es la peor empresa en la que he he laborado, te mantienen en la empresa con puras promesas en el tiempo que estuve laborando jamas me llego mi uniforme y el demas equipo  de trabajo como el telefono celular que necesitaba me lo dieron ya cuando les dije que iba a renunciar, la peor empresa para laborar, suerte."
bad,"Lots of turnover, and a lot of pressure to work overtime, and not really possible to make a living wage in Colorado working less than 40hr a week.  Would not recommend Inside sales to Dish as a job that you plan to hold for the long term."
bad,"Only care about selling items that's all I can say you become a technician, driver, installer, salesman, tech support, customer service, cashier, its wow"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Everything is based on sales. They will call you 24/7 just to make sure your selling the smart home services products. They will even show up to one of your jobs. Very competitive. They took me off the schedule for a month because they were slow on jobs it can be crazy but don’t work for dish they fuckng suck!!!!!
bad,long hours and i took over as a temp manager and i go on vacation and when i come back they give it to someone else after they promised me the position when i got back from vacation.
bad,I didn't like working there what i did was dirty and i can't stand being dirty. never know what you will find inside the receivers. i will not go back there
bad,Dish expects you to be attached to your phone your entire work day. For a 10 hr shift you get 45 minutes of break time. This includes any time to use the restroom or get water. Between calls you're allowed 30 seconds then you should be ready for the next call.
bad,Dish network is becoming a sales company more than a tv service provider. Even top technicians in performance get hours cut is not selling products to customers.
bad,"Seems like all seasoned supervisors and managers who are consistent and are good performers always get let go when they have too many years working for DISH.  I would think you want to keep these stable employees, but DISH let's them go to save money."
bad,"Dish has the ability to be a great company to work for, however senior management's expectations are not realistic. Dish cannot compete within the larger markets of the country and a career at Dish should only be a stepping stone to something else."
bad,After being with the company for seven years I can say I only found negative coming from management and higher up. I was Employee of the Month out of over 25 technicians and that very morning that they told me I was Employee of the Month they took me in the office and told me I still wasn't doing good enough. No failed quality control .My customer feedback for 7 years was top of the line smooth. They keep you completely on edge and stressed out even if you're doing better than most of the office. And I'm not just talking about me I'm talking about other technicians that did an excellent job and were top of all their numbers still got criticized instead of positive reinforcement.
bad,"New technician to the industry, during my interview I was expressed that there would be an in depth 4 week training period in which ""a bum"" could learn to do the job. I left training more confused than I have with any other employee training programs. Sales is the biggest thing that they want a tech to worry about. Does not matter what situation the clients is currently facing. Example, son of a client going through intinsive cancer treatment, informed my manager and instead of understanding, he made me send a photo to prove I demonstrated a sound bar for a kid who couldn't even walk. Management will talk down to you and laugh when you have a question on how to do your job, even put you on speaker so all the other managers can hear you struggling in front of a client and some how that's a humorous thing? They preach team but unless your driving sales then you are just a number. They would rather cover for a tech that had done serious damage to a client's house just because that tech had the highest numbers for the month instead of taking care of situation they allowed the homeowner to sit without answers for a month and sent a new hire to take the damage claim. They have such a high turnover rate and I see why every single day. Lastly HR is unwilling to take action even if multiple (5-8) technicians complain about the inappropriate actions that a manager will get away with time and time again."
bad,Not interested in being a salesman. Plus they repair washing machines and other stuff not related to cable.Other than that its ok. They supply vehicle and tools
bad,Loved being a technician. Company was great to work for at first. Then they turned to a sales oriented company with ridiculous sales goals which at one point went up to $30 a work order. Expect management to do surprise field visits and if your sales bag isn't inside the house you might get wrote up and they expect you to have the sound bar playing during your installation. Normally worked 50 - 65 hours a week. Working 5 days a week.
bad,"The best thing I can say about this corporation is that they will offer reasonable compensation for hard work. Though when you look at the pitiful benefits provided, it doesn't seem that impressive after all. DISH has a mission statement & 4 main tenants that are relatively standard for the industry but nothing is emphasized more than the phrase ""spend money like it's your own."" This is so engrained in the people of this organization that they no longer make business decisions based on what the company actually needs—they make them based on what is the cheapest solution. Therefore, every system & process is a crippled version of what it should be, requiring additional human resources just to get anything done. I had an incredible manager that sheltered me from the majority of this, but failure due to poor systems/processes & absolutely zero support from upper management, is ultimately the reason I left. Remember—culture starts at the top & trickles down throughout a company. DISH is no different."
bad,this company is a big revolving door they hire and fire like no tomorrow. they say uncapped commission but they put metrics in place to take money from you. i have a feeling they really don't want good reps to work there because they end up making more money then management. the company is so unreliable the GM quit now that should speak volumes.
bad,Management gives all employees a chance to earn overtime pay which is a plus. They have very small rewards for the top sellers and nothing significant. Reviews were constant and burdensome and you are written up very easily and quickly for small errors. No job stability and no room for job advancement.
bad,"trying to advance but a skip button wasn't there. not sure what this is but I just wanted to continue.  trying again just to continue on with my day, thank you."
bad,"At first this was an enjoyable job, but once you get promoted to loyalty they care less about you as an individual and more about your stats. There is almost no job security and the stress level is too high for what you make a month."
bad,Working for OTT sounds sexy but don't believe the hype. Poor management makes this a very undesirable place to work. If you consider going there use it as a springboard for your next job.
bad,"There isn't much to say about this place most folks that have worked there know that it was a hassle at some times. The mandatory overtime to them wasn't ""mandatory"" but you would get a write up if you didn't do it."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Let's just say that I wouldn't want someone I know to work there. If you are a minute late logging into your computer then you will have to use two hours of sick time.
bad,no fueron muy flexibles con los horarios. a pesar de ser de medio tiempo era mucha carga de trabajo
bad,"Hubo muchas cosas que dejaban así sin tomarle importancia... Aún así yo continúe laborando porque me gustaba mucho ese trabajo,"
bad,"DISH recently changed the way it compensates its employees.  I've been stuck at Tech 1 for 3 years now.  There are no base pay raises and you are forced to sell at every appointment.  Also, if a customer cancels their appointment, it counts against you.  Health insurance is a joke.  No doctor or dentist visits and a high 5k deductible.  Not a great place to work if you have a family!!"
bad,"If you don't mind working a lot of repetitive hours, it's fine. When I worked there, they would deduct time from your breaks whenever you were away from your desk.  Meaning going to the bathroom was technically a break.  No free coffee either.  Just kind of felt like a fancy sweatshop."
bad,"Overall I think my time at Dish was more of a learning experience."
bad,"During the last 4 years or so, the corporate has been ""trimming fat"" in about every 6 months or so. The highest paid employees with a lot of seniority get replaced with new entry level employees for about 40% less pay. It goes from workers to all the way to the upper management at the corporate offices."
bad,"when working here, you be better  be able to sell. The management strongly pushes sales, if you cannot sell to customers, you will be promoted, promoted to customer. Work/personal life is awful, you work till the jobs are done. no set time which is what is supposed to a 7-5 job, but could get off at 5, could be 10. Overall, not a pleasant place to work."
bad,"There was way too much drama on the floor. Not Professional at all. Too many people that did not focus on themselves but rather tried to assert themselves as leaders, but with out the skillset"
bad,I didn't like the Mandatory overtime that they had. I had just given birth to my child and they wanted to work extra hours that i couldn't do. They also had the worst tardy policy i have ever seen. They fired you after 3 occurrences.
bad,"This was a decent paying job for this area. Most of what they talk about with new employees is ""your career at Dish"". However after six months employment they laid off 450 people. The customers can be rude but most are just old folks who can't turn their TV on. They instruct you to push back if a customer needs anything (technician, new remote, etc.)."
bad,The management were not willing to help us when there was a problem. And if the computer systems were not working correctly they wanting us to continue working and hope for the best.
bad,Ok place to work but needs to pay techs close to what other cable techs get paid. Company needs a better pay raise and position advancement system. Management was pretty good
bad,"Supervisors and middle level management do not care about the workers. Most of them are still new to call centers, let alone the company itself. If you have 3 good months selling...they make you a supervisor, even with no mgmt experience."
bad,"The company seems amazing when you get there. win prizes, get bonus and paid days off. then once your there for a while you realize its not all that great.  Its stressful and you get yelled at for everything you do. your job is always on the line even when your a good agent.  In the end they dont think of anyone but themselves.  You can be a top performer and you can't get promoted. Coaches have the ability to deny your promotion and some do just to make their stats look good by keeping you. Overall the job isn't worth the stress and anxiety that it is full of."
bad,"terrible atmosphere, good ole boy network, no care for employees.  Look our for friends.  Lay off good people and keep poor performers with no input from supervisors."
bad,there were always people coming and going even in the short time I was there.  Calls are non stop and back to back. Job was really stressful and sometimes dealing with the customer would give you a headache but that's all apart of the job.  if they would offer ways for their employees to relax and offer more fun environment it would probably be better.
bad,"A lot of fixing other people's screw ups, reading scripts, angry customers, trying to maintain company's statistics to get a bonus, unrealistic average call time expectations, requirement to upsell on every call, typical customer service environment. "
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"id work there again if i was very desperate , a typical day was wake up look at your company phone and see what job orders you would have most of the time you would have a job not to far from home but by the end day you may be 6-8 hours away from home they did not scheduled the work orders correctly the thing is you get paid by the job not hourly so the drive home was on you"
bad,"Hired in as an installer.  Was not told I would have to sell several different items to customers or be disciplined,  If I wanted to be in sales I would of hired in at a car lot."
bad,Management is only interested in getting the jobs out for the customers. Not much care taken when it comes to the technicians/employees. I would not recommend working for this company's location.
bad,At the beginning it was fun and great to work. As time went on they started making it a game of sales and you had to meet a certain quota each month and were marked if you didn't.
bad,"Didn't care for the company or it's products. Was lied to about ongoing benefits after employment ended. Found that even persons in management were leaving right and left because of stress, expectations and policy."
bad,"Dish is a fantastic company to work for if you want to risk being under managers that either treat you like a human or treat you like a number that counts towards their selfish success. The people become family and bond over their stress and disappointment of the company. As a leader I was overworked, under appreciated and overlooked constantly. Dish makes strenuous changes without actually thinking through the cause and effect of their rash actions. Work here if you're desperate, if you aren't desperate I'd move along."
bad,"It had an atmosphere of high school. People were expected to go along with the enviornment, even if they didn't agree with it. I felt that I was a target for openly showing that I was different from everyone else."
bad,not that great of a place to work most of the time the right hand dose not know what the left hand is doing ..meaning you had 3 differnt people telling you to do differnt things
bad,Technicians need not apply. The company would rather you have sales skills over technical. Dollar per work order metric is the only concern of management.
bad,Probably the best thing about Dish is the ability to work remote which has its drawbacks due  to the fact you have to be within  miles of the call center. 2 1/2 years ago Dish started changing directions and many of the advanced skills coaches were let go and inexperienced people who have no experience or knowledge of the advanced skills were placed in positions to replace these coaches. Today if we come across issues that require a supervisor to get involved we have little to no support. They have spilt up our teams with what they call preference scheduling which was supposed to enhance our support but had the opposite effect. In order to work remotely we are treated as if we are at Dish's beckon call and they can and will change our schedules without notice. We are expected to double check scheduling and email (which is work related) when we are off duty. We are required to work split shifts which make it almost impossible to have a normal work/life relationship. our salaries are based at the low end of the spectrum considering that the top of our scale is just above starting wages at our competition.
bad,"I worked for Dish Network for the better part of two years, and it wasn't all bad. Ultimately, I left after my wife went into labor. I had requested the day off (months in advance) and then when my wife's due date came along, we were under mandatory six days/week, and I was then told ""no"" and that I would have to call my wife after she had the baby. After protesting to the center manager, I was allowed to leave for ONE HOUR to visit my wife. Also, during the two years I worked here, I was involved in a car accident. When I called Dish, there was no ""are you OK?"" simply ""when can you be here? we're short handed"". It struck me as odd and very impersonal. I was also forced to take a promotion I didn't want, bringing with it a 50 cents/hour raise and being placed on a call split in which every single customer was highly upset, and they were prone to using language."
bad,"Dish was not the worst company I've ever worked for, but their policies are not the best.  No flexibility as far as business hours go, wrongful accusations due to new broken tools introduced into the work environment,  (I've seen get people get fired over this, and it's wrong) I just didn't feel as if I had security with my job when I worked here."
bad,"Stat at 0715 hours and drive from one location to the next. Sometimes locations would be changed without you being notified so you'd drive 40 miles in one direction just to have to turn around and go 20 miles to a different location once arriving. Company has unrealistic times to complete the job and it must be performed to a T with absolutely no mistake or you get a verbal coaching, a write up, and then terminated. When reporting faulty equipment it would not get replaced."
bad,"pay wasnt competitive(not contractor). "
bad,en este trabajo no se preocupaban por ti eran muy lntos los procesos y burocraticos
bad,Dish is an ok company to work for. Their benefits are good management could use some work and assisting employees with family needs and emergencies. Could use better training or retraining
bad,"low wages and not enough money. you will do sales based on manipulation. will deduct pay for not reading script 100% exactly the way it was written even if it means the same. you were paid 10.00 per hour but once your commission was expected to be higher that 400.00 that week, you were paid commission only."
bad,"It's great for when you need something immediately just to get an income. However, if you are looking for a long-term job solution, this is not it. The stress simply is not worth it."
bad,"mi dia empieza checando los folios que distribuimos a las empresas externas checar si estan vendido, cancelados o vencidos."
bad,"Very high call volume.  I answered calls to fix technical issues with equipment and to take payments.  It did get frustrating especially if your not explaining it right.  Every customer is different, so some might need more than others."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"I worked for Dish for about 2 years a couple years back now. When I started it was a smooth and fun workplace. Then a couple months into it the company went through changes. They began wanting unrealistic call times and sells numbers. When I joined Dr. Dish (technical support) they began wanting us to sell product to each caller. Now if I am calling into any companies tech support office the last thing I want to hear out of the representatives mouth is, ""I'm sorry your stuff isn't working right now.I got more stuff you can give us your money for. I haven't even gotten to the calls you will receive either. I along with ever family member the person could think of have been called every name under the sun. The first couple of days you start out you will take easy calls. These are the people that are calling in to add a package. After that you better be ready cause they will open the flood gates on you with no warning. Soon you will be taking all the calls. And at the time anyone higher then the team manager were almost non existent. The people in my teams were great but the company as a whole is utter nonsense. Also be ready for mandatory over times or their personal favorite, ""Voluntelling"" people to sign up for extra time. Most of the time I have witnessed this was because they would send entire teams home early before an unexpected surge of calls would come in."
bad,"I actually enjoyed my job and I was very good at it. I made thousands of extra dollars over several months in job performance bonus and won many sales incentives. The problem is no one lasts there long. The stress is incredible. Yes some from customers but mostly from management. Every little thing is dissected and rated. Most are gone within 1 to 2 years if that. That's why they keep hiring so many people. The turnover is unbelievable. I was separated because they said it was job performance and yet the last quarterly review which happened within two weeks of my admin leave put my performance at a 8 out of 9. After a certain amount of time and if you are earning more than the average rate, it won't be long til they ""find"" a reason to separate. I was told I could reapply in 6 months, of course starting out at the bottom once again."
bad,"great people to work with but the life work balance is not optimal, no job security whatsoever, management is what you would expect in an environment like this."
bad,Typical day was to clean the whole building and outside area. Needs more staff because I was the only one to clean the whole building and outside area.
bad,It's a hard place because you are just a number.  In the grand scheme of life you are nothing more than a small cog to earn them as much money as possible. The value of a person is small.
bad,"Chained to a phone, is timed when going to lunch or the bathroom"
bad,Fast business changes keep employees on their toes. There is not a typical work day at DISH Network. Employees cannot show up after 9 or leave before 4.
bad,"If you enjoy having someone call you every name in the book on a daily basis, this is your job. The pay is good so why not? Working here is a very emotionally degrading job. Oh and breaks, yeah they are very limiting for the stress you go through"
bad,"Gotta get a new job before I can leave this one. "
bad,"Management is unware of employees problem always "
bad,Dish is a hard place to advance in your career if you want to be a lead or manager you really have to be one of there favorites in the company or know them.
bad,Always feel like you could be let go at the drop of a hat for metrics and goals that you are responsible for that are out of your control. Very poor management
bad,"Having a vendor relationship with Best Buy is great and rewarding!"
bad,"Payment processing shouldn't be a difficult as the management and supervisors make it. Constant micromanaging and talk about ""numbers"" lead to a cold relationship with supervisors. The work itself is rather easy to do, but you gain no benefit for going above and beyond the call of your job. Tiny mistakes come back to haunt you during performance reviews even though management says they look at soft skills and not numbers."
bad,Dish is great for learning a lot of skills and advancing your career. They have a very harsh corporate culture that is not employee friendly. They expect maximum productivity with below average pay and horrible benefits. No work-life balance and the upper management team is terrible at predicting future needs of the business and planning ahead. Their lack of foresight ends in the employees paying for it with mandatory overtime cutting of benefits and pay. Apply at your on risk.
bad,Es una buena opción laboral pero con poca oportunidad de crecimiento y estabiliodad
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"I as we well worked for dish for many years and yes reading a lot of this current and or ex technicians statements were very true. I was a level 4 tech with experience installing high speed internet as well. I was even sent out of market a few times and yes in the beginning working there was a blast but as the company grew and got bigger it came with different challenges. Lastly was the in smart home services were they expect you to sell. Power supply,hdmi,sound bars,bluetooth headset etc to every home you visit weather is a new connect or trouble call And yes you will get fired if you don't sell. So here I got out of the car"
bad,Existe un buen ambiente laboral y el trabajo a realizar no es complicado pero el salario si es el minimo
bad,You work long hours and are in some not very safe places at night. You are also told by management do do some things that are not safe to get the installation done even though in the safety meeting you are told not to do it.
bad,"During the six months that I worked as a Customer Service Representative at Dish Network, I found that this job can only suit a very specific type of person. The call center that I worked at was known for a very high turnover rate, and had little to no advancements available during the time that I worked there. The workplace itself was incredibly competitive, and coupled with the stresses of customer service, the environment could lean towards the hectic. Many times I had been featured as one of the top ranking representatives in sales, but as I began to lose my focus of keeping with the company's demanding standards in their regulating of calls, I had to end my employment."
bad,lots of pressure to get done and move on and make sales as well as do perfect installs while doing so in minimal time.. to much hurry up kind of work to allow good quality to be done
bad,"Manage engineer technicians"
bad,"at the time i worked there i did not like the way the company was operating, but things could have changed within the last 10 years."
bad,this company is getting by with the least as possible cutting pay and the people that help us the most is people in the office and now they are not their..they dont know how to manage their money
bad,"The new hired employees at the office are usually wonderful, the more tenured employees seem not to get too many benefits, though. More than a few managers are very unhelpful when you need something important. Too stressful, along with barely being able to actually help the customers with any of their actual problems at all. But other than that, besides the job itself, the culture around the people working there was great."
bad,"I worked at Dish for 2 years as an ISP.  "
bad,its was a great learning experience with DISH TV with respect to communication & team management.
bad,"work get a paycheck"
bad,it  was not a good .it was at lest a 10 to 12 hr. day. I learned how too set up satlights . co workers did not work with me and I was the new guy so it did not go well. job was not enjoyable.
bad,"Worst company I have worked for. "
bad,Trouble Shooting Customers issues when having problem with their cable services and going over steps to fix their cable service if they have a fussy channel or if they didn’t connect there RCA cable or HBMI cable in correctly. I also was in customer resolutions where we would try and save customers from disconnecting their cable services by offering different promotional services. Also setting schedules up for dispatch to have tech go out for more help on site.
bad,"It is like most large companies.  Must be in by 9:00, no work at home policy, except for IT issues after hours."
bad,"Being a manager at Dish is difficult as everything is run from the Headquarters. Local management had very little influence on the daily operations decisions, even though often time our approach was the better decision. They have strict policies, which is a good thing in order for everyone to be on the same page. Typical day for management started at 6am, working with dispatchers to ensure the workload was routed correctly (It never was, and Senior Leadership took away Local Management's ability to adjust the workload). Then we reviewed performance reports, answered any customer calls, and the day sometimes didn't end until 10-11PM, since the closing manager had to stay until last technician returned to the office. I would have enjoyed the job a lot more if I was able to maike some key decisions that directly affected my success with the company."
bad,On a typical day I would handle escalated issues from billing questions to fraud. I work in the Loyalty chat department so I am a very good typist on average I would say at least 40 wpm. In this job I learned how to communicate to people very efficiently and in a productive manner. The management its self was difficult to work with in my opinion I am treated more as a number then a person. The people that work for the company are great I consider them family and we all seem to work very well together. Over all the hardest part of this job was having to deal with difficult people when you work in the retention department you never really deal with happy people. The best part of this job is by far the people we have grow close over the years and they will be missed.
bad,"answering calls , billing , service issues .The hardest part is needing help and not be able to find any .I didn like my co workers"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Would be a good job if not for the management. Worse management i have ever worked for from the top all the way down.
bad,"My typical day is to manage employees. take time to pull agents aside to train or to motivate them. Train agents who need to be trained and to create new goals for agents. I learned how to manage, hire prospective agents and to know when to let agents go that was not motivated by the job. I also learned how to utilize Xcel very well and how to multi task when it comes to what benefits the company. The management is sub par and that was the hardest part about the job. I was a supervisor and I felt like as that I would have managers that cared to bring me to the next step which was not the case which inevitably was the reason why I left. Co workers were sub par as well, most of them would be more into every other persons business then minding their own. Hardest part was managing school and work based on what was needed for me to succeed. The most enjoyable part is the ability to move up quickly in the company if you really wanted to."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of having back to back calls, with supervisors that never want to take the calls from customers who are requesting a supervisor. A day at dish means that the supervisors have no help and are always micromanaging your statistics because their supervisors are always micromanaging those statistics. If those statistics don't meet goal perfectly or below goal (it's backwards), then there are write reprimands given out, meetings are held, ultimatums are given, so on and so forth. Co-workers are for the most part upbeat and positive, until statistics come out, and then the morale in the center is shot. The hardest part of the job, is not being able to always please everyone, and being cussed at constantly by the customers, with no consequences for them as there are in most other companies. The most enjoyable part of the job, is the days off, when they are allowed. If calls are in crisis, there is a risk that you will be told to work mandatory overtime, with little to no notice prior to having to work it. There is also mandatory overtime, for instance, if you work 5 days a week, and they are projecting a high call volume, you may have to work a mandatory 6th day. If you do not show up for the mandatory 6th day, there comes more reprimands, even when only given a few hours or maybe even no notice whatsoever."
bad,i liked this job. it gave me alot of experience with computers and customers.
bad,"Co-worker are great they are great to work with."
bad,"a typical work day could be anywhere from 8-14 hours."
bad,"Good place to start. Bad place to stay."
bad,"i hated this job, it was a terrible company to work for. hated it."
bad,"Ability to gain experience, opportunity to apply internally for promotions. High turnover"
bad,managment needs to be worked with more closly to provide positive work zone.
bad,"A typical day starts with my manager doodling on his dry erase board then chatting with anyone walking by, later he'll take a nap, consult his neighbor for ideas of more things to draw on the white board. At this point he will ask us to quiet down our side conversations (because it interrupts his afternoon nap). The company is cutting corners to try to stay afloat and employee treatment suffers as a result."
bad,Dish was a fine place to work leadership and communication was lacking. advancement was available but pay was not great
bad,Lack of leadership and lack of value that's why they are going under.
bad,todo bien en el trabajo solo que las experiencias malas que tuve son un poco fura de lugar por qu enis siquieran eran laborales se metian  en tu vida privada
bad,"Call centers are horrible and no one should want to work at one. The customers will call and complain about anything and you cannot do a thing other than take it. "
bad,I enjoyed working for dish I really have no complaints because God is always with me
bad,Company and job helped me learn complex equipment and customer situations that I had to work through every day. Dish Network requires long hours in tough working conditions.
bad,"every days is starting from problems."
bad,"It's hard work.  The company is very metric driven.  If you're not meeting the high expectations, they let you know all the time until you're better.  "
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad," Long hours, very little chance of advancement. Almost Impossible to get a raise..Get some experience and get out."
bad,Everyday was hard because training was limited and Dish had you rely on a search engine that never worked or depend on word of mouth so you never knew if what you were telling the customer was right. I wanted to provide world class customer service to customers but Dish made it impossible for me to because we were on a time limit. Would not recommend this job for anyone or the service
bad,Management churn allowed conflicting Company agenda and direction.
bad,Installed sattelite services at customers houses. How to use wireless boxes. never meet the boss worked for a contractor out of utah. working out of home. being my own boss.
bad,test and repair staelite recievers
bad,"My job was to generate workflow for installation and service technicians, monitor their progress, and update computer systems to activate programming."
bad,You get your work orders at the beginning of the day and complete throughout the day. If you were a good technician and were able to get your work completed at a good pace you would then pick up work from a slower employee or work from the next day. Management wasn't too bright just did what theyre told regardless if its right or wrong. Didn't care for employees personal lives. Co workers were great. Managements tricks were hardest part of job.
bad,"They send you out with so many jobs,and once completed they don't encourage helping others."
bad,"DISH has some serious issues within its upper management. Every department is in a ""different book"" as much as they try to believe everyone is ""on the same page"". The company is quick to act on new systems, technology, and ideals without completely testing them, thus setting departments up for failure."
bad,dias sin ventas
bad,"First, every morning I have to review my route and make sure I have the necessary inventory. Then I leave my house and go to my first job. I usually have to crawl under the house or go into the attic at almost every job. Very physically demanding. I only hear from my boss if something is wrong. I dont get the support that I need. I have to work EVERY holiday that falls in my schedule. One thing that I do like is I have lots of freedom, but I dont think it's worth it. I believe that they do not start their pay nearly high enough for the work that they expect. The hours vary from day to day. One day I might work only 3 hours and the next it might be 14 hrs."
bad,"There are a number of requirements this job entails, which don't match what compensation should be. We are required to travel and pay for more items then we are lead to believe when hired on, and then we get reimbursed 10 days later. Why would a company do this when the top leaders have millions and some billions."
bad,The company need to become a team and show that they care for The team so that they can reduce turn over and be more produtive.
bad,I enjoyed my training on how satellites work and it assist me in being more customer oriented.
bad,Great job good insurance. Only bad thing is no guaranteed hours. I went from 80 hours each pay period to 40. Managers are cool but only care about selling.
bad,hours and scheduling is terrible wasn't happy there happy to leave. I dont have 150 characters in me to explain. i was just bad day starts at 7 and when it ends no one knows id pull up at 10 sometimes just horrible .
bad,Evaluated on data points that have little to do with actual work performance. Performance Appraisals are based on a bell curve which do not reflect actual job performance and in turn result in very low merit increases.
bad,Unfair job practices is the only reason I am leaving Dish Network beyond that. I LOVE my job. I love my customers to my core and I may only talk to them once.
bad,"I will forever and always be grateful to Dish for paying me so well before the retention commission structure went to the pits. There is a lot of favoritism here and inside drama. If you’re a mildly attractive expect for a manager to drop a heavy hint that they want to sleep with you, but also remember when they’re over you they’ll find any excuse to get rid of you. QA is always itching to get someone fired to but being honest can still get you fired"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"The workplace policies are about 20 years out of date. No work at home policies in place. Dress code recently switched to include jeans Monday-Friday which is nice. 40+hrs a week is expected when you're salary, but if you work less than that you're penalized. During PA season, you're lucky if you get 3% and while they check how often you didn't hit 40hrs, they don't look at how often you hit 40+hrs"
bad,"I didn't enjoy working there. Call center work is not for me.  If you like taking calls back to back for hours and having scheduled bathroom times, this will be a good job for you."
bad,"You’ll make good money working here as a tech, the overtime is crazy. It’s great if you’re single and don’t have much a personal life and don’t go to school. I personally hated working here because the training was terrible and I had no personal life or time for school. They basically sent me out to the wolves and I had no clue what I was doing. My managers were awful except my operation managers. My regional and field service managers were terrible and need to g. You will make money but you will have no life whatsoever and they don’t care about you or your well being"
bad,"If your supervisor or manager truly supports you, it can be amazing here. Most of the time, they get so caught up with meeting crazy goals, they forget how to be there for their teams. There’s plenty of bosses, not enough leaders. If you’ve worked in a call center before, this one is no different."
bad,"Dish is an ok job, if you like dealing with complaining customers all day, you have to work extremely hard to meet your metrics, even if you do you may still get stuck working every weekend."
bad,"Over all good things, okay employee benefits, good money, excellent if you like technology good company. All techs easy to work with and field managers. Operation manager and regional manage only care about numbers and sells, if no sell you get constan pressure and threatening you that you are out of a job if you don't sell. If you can sell, do a perfect installation, and have excellent customer interaction. Then its Good money and long hours are good. Have to keep upper manager happy or it becomes a hard place to work for. Dish is a great company with great future but some people in management in the installation department make it really hard to work there."
bad,I would not recommend going to work for Dish unless you really need a job. Advancement opportunity for pay raises was a rare occurrence because of the performance requirements that are 90% out of your control.
bad,This occupation is only right if you are willing to make sacrifices and dedicate time and resources. Yes you must dedicate your own resources into this.
bad,"The environment energy sucked, felt like boot camp everyday. They try but because of the people they KEEP in charge they won’t succeed. They play games on the phone lines for example I know there were fake calls that came in through the lines. They told us to do one thing on the phones in meetings but expected the wrong thing to be done on the actual phones in order to close sales. They are money hungry and that’s ok but it costs them dignity and employees"
bad,The amount of pressure that is placed on the new hires is a lot. This job is not for people with no computer or little computer experience. You have to be able to work with multiple computer programs simultaneously and this can be very hard to do with little or no computer knowledge. Favoritism
bad,"The Matrix used to rate your performance is unfair. It's based on things like, losing a contract, making sales, how fast you can finish an installation. Some jobs get cancel due to no line of sight, or potential dish placement does not meet the home owner's satisfaction.  In these cases, it will reflect negatively on you, even though it's out of your control. Instances like these is why there is a high turn over of employees."
bad,"The initial training was good, the compensation is very good if you work hard and close sales calls. They are open 365 days a year (even for sales) there is no path to a good schedule at each center out all the teams! There is only 1 team with weekends off and there is no plan or opportunity to get to that schedule. The only people that get to the good schedules are using doctors notes because of ""stress"" to get to the good schedules. There should be a balanced scorecard to work into a better schedule. Something like -- Tenor, Attendance, Close Rate, Quality."
bad,A day at Dish was driven strictly by the customer. If call volume was high there was no time for development or training even to the detriment of the customer experience.
bad,was a good job until the job became more focused on sales and also when things out of your hands started affecting the job. coverage aera sometimes is long and some days are very long.
bad,"Mid managers are authoritarian, depot managers are all spineless, call center support staff is poorly trained. 4 on 3 off work schedule is great. Internal technician rating system is broken."
bad,"You must do things to the exact specifications.  Their quality assurance team tries to find mistakes you make and fire you.  Very high turnover.  1 minute late, even it legitimate your fired.  People working there are always looking over their backs."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,This is a straight call center environment. Numbers mean everything and sometimes you can not make sales if the person does not have funds. I did not love this job in residential sales at all.
bad,"Working for Dish can be an exercise in frustration. While on the surface there are positive incentives, the fact is that work life there is unstable. Upper management constantly harps about having fun and a good attitude, however, they are quick to change rules that impact your day.  For instance, you may begin your shift with some training on a new policy, halfway through the day the policy may be revamped, or changed and you may be called out for not following it correctly- even though the change may not have been communicated. "
bad,"I believe that if the dish building in bluefield put new management, more people would want to stay with this company instead of constantly looking for a new job."
bad,the company is making changes for the future hopefully it can mange to take some employees with them at this time I cant name changes due to the company hasn't told the audience about this so It would not make it good for this company
bad,"Very little work/life balance. Unreasonable expectations and input from tech's is not really heard. Unreasonable drive times. Long days with OT so you can expect to make plans after work. Work as a tech long enough you can get burned out.  Big emphasis on sales to customer's. High stress job. Reasonable health care cost's. If you're excellent with selling item's then big catalog of stuff to get for free. Which includes trips. Good bonuses, but usually you had to work the system to get the bonuses. A lot of things are not in the tech's favor."
bad,It was a joke after all the managers got promoted up the good office manager quit then the one that took over was an awful leader if he didn’t like you he found wrong regions to terminate then they refuse to give you termination paperwork
bad,The only real thing I liked about dish was the work.  I really enjoyed working on the computer and working with the customers to help them in their concern
bad,Over all this job is a pain. The supervisor doesn't know how to lead to save their life. At times I had to step up and take that roll to get things done. In reality this job is not meant to be stressful. Everything that we do is very easy but with the poor leadership of the supervisor the job becomes very stressful. Pick up the Slack of the supervisor.
bad,"really long hours and their product sucks, not a job you should have when you have children, this job is always hiring because a lot of people get fired."
bad,Personal information went out faster than twitter. The Benefits package is not good. You never know when you will get told to leave early on your working day.
bad,When I first started you could make money and they place was full of employees. Now there's a quarter of the employees left and there commission structure has turned into a joke. Any way they can steal your commission away from you they will. Plus the benefits are garbage. If your just starting out in sales and you haven't learned any skills yet this job is for you. If you want to make money stay away.
bad,Culture is a bit on the negative side & management puts a lot of emphasis on work hours.  Pretty cheap culture when it comes to employee perks.  Comp is not very competitive as well.
bad,"I worked at dish for almost 2 years from sales to retention they try to make it seem like a promotion but it’s really just a more difficult way to make money constantly changing the pay structure,team leaders,mangers, morale is low among the employees because of these things too much stress not worth it"
bad,"This is a sales job, with manual labor involved."
bad,"I spend t almost 5 years with Dish. In that time I enjoyed the positions I had there, until I was unceremoniously let go without warning for no reason other than ""Performance and other factors"" along with 3 other coaches and 32 agents. Dish used to be a place that I would tell all my friends to come work at. If you put the effort in and did your job, you could stay with the company a long time. This turned out to be a lie."
bad,"The expectations at this employer were constantly changing making it difficult for you to advance in the company. The environment was full of fear and nervousness that you would potentially lose your job for doing your job. One on one meetings we're mandatory weekly you might receive one monthly, in those meetings you're advised that the trucks you sent or the equipment you replaced is hurting your stats but you are also advised that the truck you sent was necessary and the equipment you replaced needed to be replaced. This leaves employees unsure of what to do, because if the technician is necessary or if the equipment is necessary how does that hurt your stats as an employee. There is an underlying rule that you are to trick the customer and or push the customer off on another employee to avoid sending trucks and to avoid replacing equipment. It is almost encourage for you to cheat and once you do you will be fired."
bad,"The company was great when I first started, of course that is during training. Once you get out of training you are expected to move fast and sell quickly. This type of company is very competitive which can be fun, but at the same time it creates so MUCH STRESS!!! The managers there are terrible and don't actually have you at heart but rather their own agenda to advance their own future at your cost. You better work hard and fast because it reflects on your ability to be an employee there."
bad,Meeting every week at 6am to go over common sense stuff. Long drives to jobs that were not worth much money. Management tries there best to help you succeed in making sales. Job became more about making sales than doing a good installation. Hardest part of the job would be crawling in attics and under mobile homes. Most enjoyable was getting off early.
bad,"U were expected to perform certain, almost impossible tasks."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,I just think they need to communicate better with the workers. The day could start off great you have your jobs provided the day before. Once you think your day may be done you may receive 1-3 more jobs.
bad,no room to move up. No safety class to help learn. work outside no matter what the weather. it was clear that your safety did not matter. and forced to sell
bad,Negative company culture which can be rather toxic and tends to discourage the employees.  Certain traits are overly strict and make employees feel as though they are being babysat.
bad,"I originally started working at DISH because I knew i had the drive to advance. The company definitely does have ample opportunity to advance so long as you don't mine the constant phone calls. The position I tool I was originally lead to believe would be a promotion away from phone calls (at least for a few months) as well as a raise. In the end I was making less money due to no longer receiving Pay for Performance and shift differential. The whole position was immediately put back on the phones with a lot of responsibilities all of us were barely, and in some cases not trained for at all. Eventually the position became too stressful causing negative impacts in my personal life."
bad,"Great place to go if you're happy in the role you're assigned, because you'll likely never get out of it. Pay was below market rate, and the annual staff cullings were very stressful."
bad,I could come in and have nothing to do for hours. I learned about the different receivers. Management was not the best very unorganized. Crew was fun.
bad,"started at 700 am and did not get home till after 830pm or later most evenings. Overworked, pay compensation could be a lot better, traveled more hours in a day than worked on many occasions. No management help, poor lack of communication, always employees fault and extremely hard company to work for with a family or any loved ones."
bad,Very high absenteeism rate for associates. Often had my best workers moved to other teams due to absenteeism. Hard to meet production goals when my best and fasted associates are replaced with slower associates from other teams again due to absenteeism. Simple improvement ideas-(15 total) were dismissed by the Engineers and Management.
bad,"I started Dish with a positive attitude and was very excited to see what they had in store for my career. Shortly after beginning to work I realized how horrible it really was. multiple ""promotions"" where I had to take on more and more work were frequent. Every two or three months I was earning new skills but with no additional pay compensation."
bad,"Back to back calls, for 10  hours straight.  Management is rigid.  You wouldn't even be able to take off in a bereavement situation without penalty, Zero work life balance."
bad,"Advanced troubleshooting for both internal & external customer over Dish Network equipment & Services,"
bad,they will lie to you and tell you you can have a good schedule after a decade they put me on nights and as a single father I am not able to continue to work there. I am searching for a company that will be loyal.
bad,"DISH provides opportunities for advancement and is committed to promoting from within. However, my experience has been that management is not concerned with providing career development."
bad,"The workplace is very stressful, they are very empowering until you make a mistake. Once a mistake is made they do not give much room for you. If you start this job seeing it as just that, a job, they will always frown at you when trying to advance in the workplace, even if things change, including your view of the job. They will side with the customer often, blame you for escalation, tell you to take responsibility for your role, then when the time comes for frontline communication with the company, I.e.- coaches and managers, they will tell you it's up to you to see the place positively. All the while getting yelled at and cussed at by ppl over the phone."
bad,"production is the same. no accountability for when associates make mistakes."
bad,"Co-workers were awesome, but I felt the company itself just looked at you as a number. Management did whatever they had to to cover themselves.  Overall I would only recommend it as a first job with no experience. If you have experience there are better places to find a career."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"It's great to be able to turn off work after your shift ends, and you are surrounded by awesome people, however, the constant comp plan changes leave you with uncertainty in your paycheck and job security."
bad,"It is a good learning experience if no other job is available, take it for that. Learn the trade and move on as soon as possible. Discounted service is a perk if you have the time to watch tv. They advertise the 4 day week schedule but that was rarely seen. Its all bout the sales. We are not compensated for sales, we get points which you cant get anything good with unless you save them for a year. Sales metrics are pushed hard on technicians so you can bust your butt working hard and its all over looked unless you sell over priced stuff. Starting salary is a joke and also there are a few metrics totally out of technicians control. Health benefits are terrible."
bad,"I worked for dish network for over a year. It wasnt a terrible place to work, just the inconsistency in management is killing the company, Since the time i was there, I have seen many people get up and walk out just because of management"
bad,"As a Technician, every day is different.  New customers, new experiences.  The most enjoyable part of the job is giving the customer a great T.V. viewing experience by ensuring they receive the best in class customer service that Dish is known for.  You'll learn skills in connecting various audio visual components commonly found in most homes today.  You'll also learn how to use various tools such as power drills and other equipment that is specific to your job as an installer.  The job is not for everyone because it's not a 9-5 job.  Your day ends when your route is complete.   Also working in weather extremes."
bad,Not enough work life balance.. Work culture is very bad and conservative. Management does not care about employees. Benefits and compensation is really low compared to industry standards
bad,"work till jobs are done each day "
bad,"A typical day usually involves running cable, crawling in and out of attics and working with expensive equipment."
bad,"Not enough pay for expected job duties, Not enough leadership support, Horrible benefits plan, worked 5 different shifts in the 3 month period of working there"
bad,"Overworked, under-appreciated, not much encouragement or leadership for upward advancement.An unwilling approach to listen to new ideas that may cut costs, improve culture, improve operations/HR. Glass door and other publications had rated Dish as one of the worst companies in America to work with or for. It has been 2 years since I worked here. So, some of this may have changed. Compensation was not on par with same job description with other companies in the same industry,vertical or region. It's always easy to criticize, but the freedom of operations in your day-to-day schedule is a plus! The SOP (Standard Operations Platform), is simple, precise, and keeps the business stable through times of adversity or change!"
bad,"-Came into work logged in and started taking phone calls"
bad,"No job security, heavy emphasis on sales yet no sales training.  Almost impossible to advance and earn a raise.  Frustrating lack of safety training."
bad,"the position i was in is a dead-end position.the pay was low,the room for advancing is not there,the turn rate is high,slow vacation build up."
bad,"Dish Network provides many great services to it's customers.  There are many skills one can acquire by worker for Dish.  As for a part time Inventory Specialist in the warehouse.  There are many disadvantages.  Little to no room for advancement.  Therefore no opportunity to obtain compensations.  The balance between technician side and warehouse side is unbalanced.  Dish is a tech driven company.  The management, I believe,  needs to work on taking more pride in their employees."
bad,"Shady Shady,  Be careful who you trust.  HR will use illegal tactics.  You receive an opportunity but no support from corporate.  They use tactics to take money from their frontline agents."
bad,"Not allowed to go to the restroom when needed if you don't have break times left"
bad,"There are  never supervisors on duty at one time, employees feel overworked and no consideration is given time on telephone when supervisors need to be located."
bad,Compensation is fully based on commission and they provide no training or preparation for what you will encounter from your customers.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"this is a call center for tech support and also customer retention. "
bad,"Some days can be pretty stressful. long hours leaves you with little personal life. To gain advancement you must reach goals that can be almost near impossible. Good for those who doesnt have a personal/social life or who doesnt have a family and not in a relationship, because they pretty much own u. Pay is pretty decent though and all the mandatory overtime quite often pays off."
bad,"todos los dias era de ir a gestionar a clientes deudores, por lo cual era rutidinario mi labaor como gestor."
bad,Could be better. Not enough pay for what is required. Not organized and training is horrible. CSRs  are not prepared when placed on the phone. Training to short.
bad,Falta de horas de trabajo establesidas sin hora de salida buen ambiente de trabajo
bad,ok job with good benefit very nice staff hours was 8to6 which give me time to be with family. management did a good job with us
bad,I got up to 6 leads a day but almost all turned out to be duds not really worth the time
bad,"As a supervisor I was required to work at least 45 hours a week, but I would usually work 50 hours a week. The area I supervised was understaffed so I had to perform the duties of hourly associates to complete the workload faster. I would sometimes make less money than some of the hourly associates because I was a salaried employee and I would not get overtime pay."
bad,"Without the regular complaints one has about their job, i.e. pay and hours. It is a fun, eye opening experience. Few jobs bring you into peoples home and it’s amazing the stories you'll have. Every day is a new challenge and no two days are the same. You are alone, all day every day except for meeting strangers. You'll meet a handful of nice people and a bunch of rude or uncaring ones. All in all Dish is not good. There are reasons turnover is so high and how many jobs have to have a 1000 dollar sign on bonus? It’s no place for babies, they do want you to WORK, but as a career I would recommend else where"
bad,Always wanting your to sale more products and not caring so much about the installs. Never knowing when you will get off is hard. Working  in every sort of weather can be painful at times.
bad,"The job hours are fine, 4 10-hour days are nice. Other than that, the technicians are not treated well. everything is your fault if the company isn't meeting their goals, and sales goals continue to rise while wages do not. You will have your job threatened for not meeting sales goals that go up every quarter. You will not receive any commission on sales, just incentive points that are minuscule compared to the value of what you sell. Your experience will also vary greatly depending on your manager. I had several people quit under my manager, while others that had better managers enjoyed their job much more. Would not recommend."
bad,"I worked at DISH full-time for less than a year"
bad,"Dish doesn’t care about you being a tech, they care more about you sell their junky products. On the flip side the managers give full encouragement (aka pressure) to sell. If not you’ll be fired. You pretty much have a year to be a crafted salesman before the hit you with the door."
bad,"A typical day you start a few minutes before your paid to. Log into an app on a phone so you can prepare your vehicle and equipment for the day, There is a short meeting at 7am then you rush to your first job. Every house and customer is different, every job you have assigned has to get done. If everything goes off without a problem its all good, but invariably a myriad of issues can arise. Management does not allow for extra time that the resolution takes. While some jobs go well, others do not. Your raises and support depend on the jobs going smoothly to make bonuses. If too many issues arise you're not going to fair well. For the most part coworkers are willing to help, but only so much as their jobs don't suffer as well."
bad,Its hard to know exactly what the company wants you to do. One week they will tell you to push one offer. The next you are penalized for making that offer. It's very stressful.
bad,"Originally was told we would work in our markets, with the occasional travel. That was a lie! Dish pimped us out to another company in New York with a travel schedule of 2 weeks in New York and a measly weekend back home then back to New York for 2 more weeks. Not to mention, NOBODY knows anything when you ask questions. How are you suppose raise a family in this environment?"
bad,"Ability to earn great money, but at a cost to work life balance. In order to maximize pay be prepared to work 50+ hours a week with a very strict attendance policy that does not account for how life works."
bad,"Poor management in southern star (DISH) in Longview, Texas and some of the trainers are racist, no time for family and they are more focused on the sales rather than the installations."
bad,"If you are an uneducated person looking for a way to work yourself up through the ranks, DISH is a great place to work. They want to promote from within when they can and they support continuing education with professional development and tuition reimbursement. "
bad,"Great coworkers and supervisors. Not so great management. Can be very stressful at times as well as depressing. This type of worker isn't for everyone, but it definitely helps you with interpersonal skills."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"The pay at Dish is pretty good with overtime.  Unfortunately the company really doesn't care about their employees, at least not their technicians.  All they really care about is how much they can squeeze out of them out of pressuring them to meet increasingly higher in home sales quotas without monetary compensation.  High pressure up selling is the new culture at Dish.  They demand that you embrace it or endure the threat of termination."
bad,"I would have to give a low review as the Dish Network although co-workers are really nice people they are put into very difficult positions by mangers that hide behind the desk and constantly and relentlessly pressure their employees to make decisions that are ""Good for the Company"" The Expectations are really high at Dish with little or no reward. they hire you in a ""FUN' atmosphere everything is fine attitude and then throw your in the mix of a very confusing call center with very high demands."
bad,"I felt like training was horrible.Most of the things that I learned were after I was already in the sales position.I had to learn on the fly,and they are very strict and willing to fire you for 1 mistake"
bad,"Management is all over the place. You get docked for rules you weren't aware of, even if your manager told you to do it. The pay was good for a few months then changed and changed again. They have such a high turnover rate that they are constantly asking for overtime and make you feel terrible for saying no. There are high queue times where it becomes impossible to do your job correctly which then causes a reduction in numbers for the week that are impossible to salvage so your commission goes down the drain."
bad,"Dish requires a lack of work/life balance. It is impossible to know when you're getting home on any given day, and you're expected to work a fifth day more weeks than not. If you crave overtime and are a workaholic who likes working with their hands, this is the position for you. But if you have any interest in pursuing other hobbies or activities with any sort of regularity, you should look elsewhere. Also, you're expected to be more of a salesman than a technician, they constantly pressure you to makes sales rather than focus as much on getting the technical aspect of the job done."
bad,"They will push you to make sales. All management will talk about is sales. Job title says tech which is misleading. You will be trained for 2 weeks, then you will be on your own. So having to balance installs and most important of all making sales makes it stressful. You will have to carry a bag of cheap items that are priced high to every job and push them on to customers to purchase.  An FSM manager will show up randomly to your job to check if you have the sales bag inside customers home, setup and demo items. Even if customer chooses not to purchase or see items for sale management will put blame on you. Your sales have to be around $100 or more a day literally to feel like your job is secure. Most customers just want you to install their dish and leave. What customers don’t want is for the tech to waste 45 minutes of their time trying to sell them cheap overpriced products before you even start you install part of the job. "
bad,"Most team members are friendly, competent, and work well together. to accomplish tasks.  Most management and supervisor level employees also seem to take care of their responsibilities and run solid departments.  The executive team is where DISH is lacking.  Very dishonest and disingenuous.  They talk out of both sides of their mouth and then expect hard work and loyalty from their subordinates.  They give very few liberties to their management teams and often send down illogical and unsupported directives.  The executive team is much too hands on in areas they are not educated in. Let your managers manage."
bad,I worked for this company for a yr and they are all about sales they want techs to focus more on sales than any other part of the job. they preach sales sales sales everyday all day
bad,"Its a stressful call center where you have to produce every minute and often put in positions where success is not an option. The pay is great and you will be some great people there, however it is not meant to be a place where you get comfortable for years."
bad,did not like being on the phones. lack of ability to use the restroom as calls come in back to back to back. dealt a lot with several upset customers.
bad,"BAD Management.   Released from a position by word of mouth by newly appointed"
bad,"Company would disregard any request for additional training but had no issue with putting an employee on a Performance Plan.  Lost major lawsuit, had mass layoffs then fought any unemployment claims."
bad,Horrible place to work. Didn’t work with me on my work conditions when it came to my very difficult pregnancy. Ended up forcing me to quit in order to take care of myself during pregnancy
bad,"Rules changed, internet went down and we were still required to be on the phones. There was preferential treatment to some employees instead of equality. I was new in sales and quickly became top seller until more rules or deals changed. "
bad,"Worked with a great team. Pay was so-so. Healthcare is awful. Company made contributions to a HSA, but didn't compensate for the poor and expensive healthcare options. Immediate supervisory staff is good, but upper management rules with an iron fist. Work/Life balance is terrible. Only allowed 1 picture of family at our desk. Work shift was constantly changing, a nightmare for families with children."
bad,"Not very welcoming by dish employees; management not available, no guidance, very micro-managed, seemed segregated even though there were different cultures working there. you were required to clock in and out at the gated entrance by photo badge and finger print. If you were late or left early during business hours, your manager got a report and people were known to be fired if they didn't have a pre-approved reason for leaving early or coming in late. Just not a comfortable place to work."
bad,Es una empresa muy mal administrada en las distintas areas
bad,Typical day of work was getting chewed out by management and having to work a 12 hour shift and take over a 100 calls while meeting goals. Hardest part of the job was staying in goal and meeting sales quota. Easiest part were the people. Some people were really nice and some where just there for the money.
bad,It's an okay temporary job if you can't get anything else.  The work hours are terrible and you have to be out in the elements.  All with no help.  One good thing is that they do make sure you know what to do.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of you taking calls calls and more calls. The clientele constantly yelled at you. If you aren't a technology oriented person, don't apply."
bad,"Day starts with gathering in the mornings to insure you have correct equipment. Get to first appointment within allotted time. You are based on points per job, and how fast you complete the job. If it takes you all day to do one job then you will quickly be hated by fellow workers. They over burden the workers and in doing so, you cannot plan anything on days that you work. You will also be called in on days off. If you say anything to management, sometime they will accommodate you but its all about bottom line."
bad,Biased management.  Below average pay.  Free TV.  Decent benefits.  Periodic layoffs.  Declining demand for set top boxes resulting in downsizing.  Not a cutting edge company.
bad,"Great starting job for someone needing something no longer then a year. Job security though is fleeting and will cut you typically around spring time. Expect company to move you around positions with varying pay, but do not get use to it. Changes happen often. Guides are extremely helpful and over all great in helping customers. Supervisors are helpful, though not all. Overall a 2 out of 5 as far as jobs go"
bad,"The promotion process is outrageous. Once you promote you are required to complete more jobs, but when work slows down you are penalized for it even though it's no fault of your own."
bad,"don't believe the supervisors or managers ever, they lie. They will tell you one thing then do another,  No warning or notice given.  I don't know how best to continue this review,"
bad,I can't complain about the money but the benefits are not cute. Poor management and dinged for little things on phone calls. Rude management. The people I work with.
bad,"Management is a mess, a lot of employees leave on bad terms. Would not recommend to friends of family. "
bad,"Requiring employees to ""volunteer"" for additional hours makes it rough to create a work/life balance.  The money was great though!"
bad,"Technicians at dish are expected to work from 7AM until the day is complete whether that be 2PM or 2AM. Overtime is mandatory, easily getting 55-60 hours per week. Easy to promote if you are willing to work hard. Management does go trigger happy firing employees over somewhat small mistakes. The nice part is to be alone from other co workers and management for 90% of the day"
bad,"To many forklift employees for that location. Not enough workflow to keep everyone busy for there 8 hour shift. RMA department is a great area, there is always something to do."
bad,the work you do is hard and they stack so much on you that you are basical working a job filling in for two or three positions and not getting compinsated for that and you wont find out about that until you have started and then they start adding all of this on to you and make it a reqirement to keep your job with unreasonable min reqirements
bad,"There is really poor job culture with management who don't care. No job security currently, they are making large cuts throughout the whole company.  I would not recommend this position."
bad,"This company middle level management treats people like lemons. They will squeeze you everyday. If you hit numbers required for bonus, they will raise those numbers for next period. Once you will reach your limit, you will start being blamed for not hitting the numbers. "
bad,"Unpredictable work day, but poor management. Constant sales pressure, poor work environment. Consistently changing schedule. 1 month training period to learn job."
bad,"Good pay overall. Coworkers are helpful yet competitive. Benefits were okay except for dental which couldn't cover a wisdom teeth removal. Management only cares for your sales which was my biggest problem. Techs get cash incentives by helping as many people as possible in the shortest time possible, we also get points incentives by making sales. we then use points to spend on the company store. (I'll take straight cash anyday over points you save up but may never use)"
bad,"After training (which was okay), you get put on a team, typically around 10 people and have a team lead which changes periodically. You definitely learn some data entry and how to read their system, you should always note on a call what you did/talked about. The MAJOR flaw in their system is the call time. They expect you to resolve a call in X (say 5) mins or less. In theory that's not a problem but when you are on a tech call and the system takes five mins. to reset (which it even says on the instructions), after you have figured out the problem, 5 mins total on a call is impossible. That's of course if the customer does not have other questions such as billing."
bad,"Scheduling is terrible. never have a weekend off. EVER! Benefits are completely ridiculous. Being forced to be a salesman. maybe for someone single, but one with a family will not be happy."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Dish Network has a difficult culture to thrive in. I gained skills and tools from this job, but the management structure and style was not for me."
bad,"Not a very good job for the small pay. They put you through a lot of training, but don't train you on important parts of the job. If you have questions don't call management, they will tell you to call someone else."
bad,The company started out a job where you feel really good about the job you are working for. Until they start to promise things like pay increases. No consideration for your health. If you are sick you must still come in. Just only believe half of what you hear.
bad,"They love to micro manage, add to your work load without compensation and try to convince you that they appreciate you with occasional pizza. They are sticklers when it comes to giving raises, don't mind making you work overtime and make advancement almost impossible. They do have good schedules and nice people working in there. After 3 years, They also gave me the skills I need to find a better paying job doing less work- thanks Dish!"
bad,"Management is terrible, they constantly look for reasons to terminate your employment. Its better to get the experience and just leave because longevity means nothing to them."
bad,"Career advancement is difficult. Because of the strict work hours, this may not be an ideal place to work for those with little kids."
bad,DISH has several different departments and schedules to fit your needs which is nice. The training process is a little direct so you have to be self motivated to catch on quick. The managers hold themselves above everyone else and are always busy. All your communication with them is through your coach which is your direct supervisor which is given no power so all decisions are made through your manager so any concerns or questions take a while to be taken care of. Coaches are traded around a lot so dont get used to one Coach.
bad,"The title to this should say it all. The company is run as a ""boys club"" mentality and anyone outside of that club and below that club is easily disposable and replaceable. Don't ever fool yourself into thinking your work matters other than putting money into Charlie Ergens pockets. "
bad,"Una empresa que recien comienza en donde podria haber sido mejor, pero se sacan muchas cosas positivas."
bad,"The hours are long, the pay is no good for the work you do. Appreciation is little to none for the work done. You are required to have their product and pay for it."
bad,Not enough work or pay part time job with full time hours. Not enough pay for the amount of work required
bad,"Customers calling in are sometimes upset, and take it out on whoever they are on the phone with."
bad,If you don't mind customers talking crazy to you at all times then you won't have any problems.
bad,"a typical day at work is very high paced and ever changing, you have to be a person that adjusts well to change otherwise you wont make money in sales at dish. working 60+ hours a week can take a toll on any person. I've learned what it takes to stay focused in a very highly stressful work environment and still make money in sales. the management persons changed so often it was hard to learn any one thing from a particular person, however working at dish for over 21/2 years is rare and taught me to focus on the details/quality of the sale and not s much the quantity."
bad,during training you are taught one thing and told to something else when getting certified. The schedules impossible to meet without cutting serious corners in the installation process.
bad,"I Had to sell cable,"
bad,"everyday starts out the same but you dont know when it will end. the communication between managers and techs is not all there on a good day. for the most part people are easy going but as far as a professional work place goes its kind of like a high school. the hardest part of the job is the attics in the summer and the driving, sometimes driving 2 hours for a cable not being screwed on all the way. the best part of the job would have to be meeting a lot of interesting people."
bad,hard work all day running lines and switches.
bad,"Your job is to sit at a cube, not move and answer to about 100 calls that are incoming. You get training that will help you understand basic things about the company. Most of your learning comes from being on the ""floor"". Gets old fast and customers can really be nasty but if your patient you will learn how to zone out and just solve the problem. Your in good shape if you are bi-lingual because you have a better opportunity when it comes to job growth. Not much moving up and you must fight for raises/increases. Your on a metric system and can get about 1-40% bonus each pay period if you a. don't make customers mad b. don't have callbacks for issues that should have been resolved c. are fast on the phone ""handle time"" d. sell e. DON'T MAKE CUSTOMERS MAD."
bad,"Capacitación constante, aprendizaje todos los días"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"They make it sound like you will be empowered to do right by the customer but are more focused on how many calls you take an hour. A lot of the things customers call in about could very easily be fixed by informing customers of charges before they occur, or by having the sales team not get commission."
bad,"Dish constantly changes compensation plan every couple of months to keep employees on their toes so they can convince employees to work more overtime than earning enough money to live working 40 hours per week. "
bad,"If u think this job is about just installing dish....ur not even close. Now it is all and only about how much you sell. Like polk sound systems for $600. Google nest equipment that cost hundreds of dollars. Dish expects you to average $32 a customer...and if dont hit that goal...they harp and complain about until you either quit or hit the number...and even if u hit that number, the next month start"
bad,"Company overall isn’t that bad. Pay was great. Management at Tulsa location is terrible. They allow leads to encourage behaviors to fudge sales numbers that they fire other employees for. Was told I could take more frequent, smaller breaks to accommodate my ADHD. Was also told to show leadership skills if want"
bad,This position pays well and you are trained appropriately. The work to homelife ratio is something that is decided from person to person but overall i am happy with my employment here.
bad,"For the work load you pull, the pay isn't worth it. The trainers are awesome and so are most of the coaches. There is room for improvement in the apprentice pod stage of training. There isn't enough training for Tech calls. You get some nice perks by working there."
bad,Always changing the way scheduling works no consistency . Also metrics changing and how your measured cause people to loose job. No loyalty to employees get a manager your friend you won’t survive. Benefits high deductibles
bad,"Typical day started at 7:15am, route wouldn't end until they say you can go home, sometimes days would run as late as 10:00pm. Training was PAINFULLY useless as its 90% power point and most of what you learn is in the field. Management was very poor, you either had micro-managers breathing down your neck, or managers that were to aloof to care and usually had no idea what was going on. Terrible managers and the high sales goals made the job environment incredibly stressful and unhealthy. The best part about the job was the physical nature of the work."
bad,"It doesn't matter how hard, fast, or customer pleasing you are at this job. If you do not make any sales your gone. During slow times if you do not sell anything you get put on a first to stay home list and don't get to work. During the fast periods of the year expect to work between 12-14+ hours a day. Also there is no take home work vans they have to be returned everyday. So typical day would go wake up at 5:30 am, get in personal vehicle, drive to shop wasting time and fuel just to get into a company vehicle and drive off to first job. IMO leaving from house to job would be more cost effective. Another aspect of the job is the fulfillment work, doing work for other companies that is completely unrelated to what is supposed to be a TV service job."
bad,If you are thinking about working for this company don't do it! They catch you with the pay but once you start and you work 60 hours a week you have to sell all kinds of things if you don't sell enough they get rid of you. They do not take care of there employees and half the time your left stranded when you need help with something. I got fired for using a fake email for a customer so he could purchase items from dish which the customer has to have to do so and he was elderly and didn't even know what email was so I put in a fake one which my boss told me to do the got fired by corporate for doing so. DONT DO IT!
bad,"I did a month of training and on my first or 2nd day on the floor, they fired me for unknown reasons. I did not try to change their minds. Now I'm jus"
bad,"I loved my job at Dish, but when I kept getting passed over for a shift change by people that started work there after I did, that just really gave me a poor outlook on the management and my immediate supervisor and manager.  I really needed that shift change for medical issues I had with my daughter.  I just didn't find the company fair."
bad,At dish it can be a very stressful environment with the managers constantly pushing their representatives to meet high expectations. 
bad,Labore en sus inicios por lo q habia muchas quejas.
bad,"Work starts at 7:10 AM in which you are given a van with equipment already on the van. The issue with this is you have to hope everything you need is on your van from the person previously using it the day before. You are give a Samsung S8+ as your work phone to see where and what customers you have on your route which changes like 4x throughout the day. You can never predict how long you have to work on any given day. They do have a very high turn over rate so if your new your slow so plenty of hours and once you get better they add more work to balance it. Since there is a high turn over rate be ready to start working five days instead of four. Lots of crawlspace work which is not really all to bad. Ladders work is a must      but usually only with a 16 ft ladder on occasion 28 ft, 32 ft, or 40 ft may have to be use to install dish. It is a very hands on learning process there is just a lot you learn as you go. The Metrics are okay, but can get very stressful if you are looking for a raise that is obtainable. You are also a salesman so once you are done wiggling through a muddy crawlspace be expected to clean up and start demoing products as soon as you are done. Since DISH is also the cheapest cable be prepared for some undesirable areas such as crack houses and so forth. Nothing better then arriving to a home with no doors and the cable line is fed through broken windows. The management was great and friendly though had no issues there. Also be prepared to dig trenches if the customer does not want it on the house you will be returning to dig a hole fill it with concrete"
bad,"no comment at this time,  long hours not enough pay and unreachable goals. needed to by a salesman not a tech. long hour and ask to work more days if needed."
bad,"Typical day at work: Non-stop angry phone calls"
bad,"the pay is good, and the job is interesting, but ultimately the job is ruined by a culture of forcing sale of overpriced items on customers and completely unrealistic time expectations for the quality of work expected.  I loved installs and troubleshoots, the work and customer always something new to mix it up, however the company gives you too little time to complete most tasks and is down your superior's throat so much that you get threatened with firing almost weekly for minor things.  If you can sell products to someone who is angry because their system broke and can work 14  hour shifts at a running pace without making mistakes, you may succeed at this job.  If however you try to be thorough and are not good at selling trinkets to people that may not want them, look elsewhere,"
bad,difficult to track people down.  never bored but always working.  prioritization of i.t. work was the largest operational challenge.  system was always changing but never really working well.
bad,A typical day at dish consist of back to back calls. Breaks are determined by the number of hours that you work that day and also  the time of the break is chosen by you for the resource team. It is very stressful if you cannot handle speaking with irate customers.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"The the job itself is not very difficult unless the customer is being difficult, especially if you are someone who loves talking to people. Dish did provide basic training prior to letting me speak to a customer alone. Basically you deal with basic tech and billing issues all the while providing empathy, rapport, and an up-sell attempt. The culture was very inviting at least at the center where I worked at, cant speak for the other centers. Fellow employees were very nice and talkative, and the center is often buzzing with music. Televisions are available throughout the center so that you can watch as you work (though you likely wont hear anything). It is possible to move up in the company and you will encounter many managers and higher ups that will attest to that fact. However in my experience, I had to adjust to the customer service mentality (as I had never worked in a call center before) but I did learn eventually and my coaches at least attempted to help me get there. Once I adopted the proper mentality I did get promoted to the next tier. That was where the tables turned for me, as training for the loyalty specialty was not very helpful and the coach I was assigned to was nice but very busy (at meetings or coach rallies) and often times not available to help when I began to struggle suddenly after receiving praises on my work throughout my first 2 weeks. I was on the floor as a loyalty specialist for 1 month and with the company just over a year before I was fired. Last thing I am going to say is that while there are those few that have been with a Dish Network call center"
bad,"Go to work pick up a pack for the day and stock up your van to go out for the day. I learned how to install sat. dishes and site them in. Management was ok all in all they were cool and easy to talk to. Great bunch of guy and gals that would help you out if needed. Working outside in the rain, cold, snow and getting on the roofs in the winter that you could fall off. Riding around from job to job was nice."
bad,Typical day was to show up to work and attend to customer. most valuable lesson would be that the customer is always right even if other employees do not believe so. Management was a little irrational but nothing to serious. Coworkers were a little to them selves but hard working. the hardest part of working was not having the resources to accomplish any task. But I got to learned that side of a business.
bad,"For the most part the work was fairly easy, I just wish I could have changed some things especially with my first manager but once I was under new management I really enjoyed working there."
bad,was a good place to work until they changed the pay structure
bad,"I will start out by saying that the actual work at dish is great.  I love going to customers homes and installing TV and fixing problems.  I also like the scheduling.  However, the technicians' pay is based on a system that is completely unfair and which the technician has little to no control over.  For example :  Job completions.  You are judged on the jobs you complete.  However if a customer cancels, or if there are too many trees in a customers yard you will get an ""incomplete"" and they dock your pay. ( they take money out of your bonus that is well needed because the hourly is ridiculously low for the type of work it is).  Sometimes they put cancellations on your route that weren't even yours to begin with.  This happens on a weekly basis.  So it does not matter how good you are or how fast you are.....you get docked."
bad,"I enjoyed working here as I learned fantastic customer service skills. For example being able to assist an irate consumer with billing/technical/general support and resolving the issue with a clear improvement in the customers attitude if you will."
bad,"A typical work day begins between 7 to 8 A.M. and will last until all assigned jobs are completed for the day. This may be anywhere from 5 P.M. to 12 A.M. the next day or beyond. All customers are the technician's responsibility to maintain for 90 days, which usually implies that any days off are dedicated to re-aligning dishes and repairing any damage done by weather, animals, or customers without additional pay."
bad,"i worked with dishtv 16 months ."
bad,"Dish is a high stress environment with an inconsistent upper management team. The co-workers are fantastic and there is opportunity to advance to different positions or teams and duties. The work itself is not difficult, even though handling upset customers is common daily."
bad,"company with low work ethics and culture,decent with salary."
bad,"Long Hours"
bad,"Get up at 4:30am start day off to evaluate what cam in....then reevaluate at 7 and then again at 9"
bad,Como toda novedad al principio de dan todo el apoyo en promociones y en cuanto se tenia ya un pocesicion del mercado cautivo pusieron oficinas cambiaron comiciones y cobraban material de mas seguros y falta de profecionalismo de a tencion a clientes y admistrativos llego el momento que te costaba ser distribuidor empesamos 38 distribuidores oy solamente quedan 5 y ya estan x cerrar tambien
bad,"Let me start off by saying this is not an ""ex employee rant on the company"" like so many others. I like Dish, and I like my job. The biggest concern comes in with the low level of trust they place in their employees."
bad,The hardest part of the job was talking to customers that thought they KNEW how to work there satellite receiver or simple remote issues.
bad,"Benefits suck. Management is ridiculous. However, there is a good work/life balance compared to other media companies."
bad,Short term great not looking to keep anyone long term. You can make great money but they will only try to work you harder if you are a good performer. they do a lot for agents however it doesn't make up for the anxiety and stress
bad,if you enjoy customer service and going to different places then this is the good for you. A lot is expected of you and it is very organized. There is growth potential.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Found out I was pregnant when first hired. Had morning sickness all day everyday , missed a few days and then had ""weather days"" that were counted against me even though I was told that they were excused, and was told if I missed one more day I was fired. Ended up in the hospital and lost my job at 22 weeks pregnant.  Great pay, decent schedule , treated as a child ."
bad,I loved my bosses but the job itself was horrible. The culture of the company is very you have to push others down to make it to the top. The training was minimal.
bad,Good place to work just no work life balance. I’ve been working for dish 3 years. I enjoy the people I work with and the pay. It’s just the hours which makes everything stressful
bad,"When I worked at DISH, it was a very stressful environment.  The manager was very patient though and was helpful.  The hardest part of the job to me would have to be the loud room, constant chattering of other associates helping customers on the phone.  Contest were motivational in keeping your interest.  I felt like a little ant in this huge room."
bad,"This job comes with many perks but dealing w/ hostile customer will wear on you. There are also many stats that an employee must keep up in order to  do well in performance reviews. For example, if you are found to have canceled too many accounts in order to avoid spending more than your allotted budget you will get in trouble, but then if you start spending too much money in order to prevent customer's from canceling you get in trouble for spending too much. It can feel like a lose lose situation."
bad,Does not pay enough for the amount of work required. The day is long and stressful and pretty much you are rated on the areas you receive and the field management
bad,"My time with Dish was interesting and full of change.  This is a company in a declining business trying to figure out how to remain relevant and find their way to the future which creates a lot of chaos at lower levels.  The majority of my tenure was spent at the highest levels of customer escalation working to resolve complex customer situations and was the position I truly enjoyed.  Unfortunately Dish decided that this position should be in another state and my center should be under direction of direct sales instead of CSC and those employed there will be retention agents.  While retentions is not necessarily a bad thing, those with integrity will find it incredibly challenging to meet the requirements and performance levels the position requires."
bad,"Never was a typical day, you might do a brand new 4 room install which you are timed on everyjob, then go to your next job for troubleshooting to find out you have to replace all the cable, connectors, etc while having to make your ""quota"" in sales. It was just honestly made more complicated and it could have had the main issues causing complaints or problems fixed and saved alot of money for the company."
bad,typical day is chaos.. nobody knows what they are doing.. some of the supervisors are cluessless how to do their jobs.. they do not honor dr notes.. even if it is for an emergancy
bad,"I could write a book, but overall I believe the founders are not happy and don't know what to do about them or the company.  I just think the company is a disaster in many ways.  Like any bad place to work, it seems like there are a ton of really good people.  I wish the best for them."
bad,I worked at wheelhouse restorer and renewing sat elite receivers many people works there .The hardest part of there is the long shefits
bad,"The people I worked WITH were some of the best in my 15 years of working in the corporate world.  My boss was good but management in general (particularly his boss) and executive leadership leaves a lot to be desired, as nepotism and open interpretation of the company handbook reigned supreme.  Pay was better than your average inside sales job, but the benefits were not, and the work itself varied from season to season.  The hardest part of the job, while NOT Dish's fault, was the lengthy commute.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships with my accounts.  "
bad,Changes from being customer oriented to business related on regular basis.helped customers with their issues and enjoyed it
bad,Overall my experience here was ok. I enjoyed my co-workers. They were always helpful and full of energy. The management team could use some work.
bad,stressful place to work. So many tasks given everyday and expected to be completed on time
bad,They won't let you work more than 30 hrs a week and only pay 5 dollars an hour. You sit at a desk all day making cold calls and hearing angry ppl tell you  they already have cable or satellite or that the service isnt offered in their area.
bad,A typical day at work was quite easy and enjoyable once you get the experience in but unfortunately this aspect of the job is overshadowed by the incredibly bad benefits and the always changing management.  I DO NOT recommend working for this company if you need a steady job with good benefits.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Enjoyed the people I worked with. management was very helpful. Didn't enjoy the short notice of shift change that they imposed on us.
bad,"not good management, high volume calls inbound and outbound, set up dish network accounts"
bad,"Its a work based in commissions, and wasn't good. I prefer work by salary hour."
bad,Se ha vuelto una empresa solo preocupada del interés del valor de la empresa y está dejando de lado a sus empleados
bad,Dish’s motto is change. And they change a lot. Including budget cuts. The job itself is exciting but also mentally tiring. They lose a lot of channels which affects your pay.
bad,Sells are all that is relevant. Multiple times FSM Positions opened and then there were no promotions. Had to have shoulder surgery. Was informed I would be able to transfer to warehouse by Operations Manager several times. Got cleared and suddenly three open positions are no longer available. They are not worried about you professionally or personally. Best part was being told I was why they District Manager was fried because of Workman’s Comp.
bad,Es una empresa que maneja buenos horarios el trabajo no es estresante lo malo de la empresa son los jefes de islas que abuzan de su puesto
bad,"bad, to much work not enough people they burn you out in matter of months. that's all I have for a review you should reconsider the amount of characters it takes to review a company"
bad,Grandes logros de crecimiento y ascensos logré grandes desarrollos del personal a mi mando y el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno
bad,"Cuando entre estaba regular porque las comisiones eran buenas y porque te podías llevar la unidad a tu casa "
bad,"I dont recommend working there unless you like getting your earbuds stolen.  I left my earbuds at my desk one night and the next day that I went in, the were gone and they were hot pink and I was the only female that worked there."
bad,My job at dish was a job that demanded you to work hard fast. They are a company who's focus is all about numbers the employees have to keep a quota and kwpp it or you will not advance overall the job is very demanding.
bad,Dish was ok. Very busy and a lot of work to be done. I had the luxury of working form home and also with a very supportive manager. The pay could have been better hourly but bonuses were offered for upselling.
bad,The culture was unnecessarily strict and unproductive. The company policy is that it is better to take the entire day off than to be a minute late. No work from home options ever despite a tech role that is often fully remote.
bad,I was normally in a classroom environment. I traveled when other centers needed support in or out of the country. I learned superior customer service and delivered my best practices to my coworkers.Great experience and lots of knowledge gain throughout my years. The people are amazing and the culture is fast paced. There is always something going on to make it fun for the employees. The hardest part of my job was having to pay everything out of pocket when traveling and waiting to be reimbursed.
bad,"It's a place where one may feel overwhelmed, stressed out, and underappreciated. The individual is just a cog in the machine and can and will be replaced without notice."
bad,Pay could’ve been better dealing with different attitudes and a lot of times we were paid off of commissions sometimes i meet the quota and sometimes i didn’t
bad,Liked the job and the people I worked with but the company itself was not doing well so they decided to close down leaving tons of people without jobs.
bad,"The benefits are marginal.  Paid time off is a joke, and there is NO working from home, even if you are waiting for the plumber.  They don't treat the employees well, in general.  But you get stuff done with really smart people.  You do work that you will be proud of for the rest of your career.  DISH used to be meritocracy, but the last few years have moved to rewarding those that ""have that corporate look and language"" - because of leadership changes that value ""corporate speak"" over ""telling like it is""."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Nice but almost impossible to meet daily requirements; no job security; everyday feels stressful as if you could lose your job. Management seems to be more concerned with each other than actually helping employees. You have team leads but told not to ask them for help
bad,"I was told that I would be working four ten hour days. This is far from the truth on a normal day i'd work from 7 too at least 7. That's on a good day and they did not route you 2 to 3 hours from your house. You just never knew what time you may get off, so you couldn't plan anything at all. The management would not communicate with one another so one manager wouldn't know what the other one told you. Also you would need a big space to store all the equipment that you would need not a 5 by 10 space that they say you need as a remote technician."
bad,"fast paste environment, good managers, co workers get along, learned a lot about safe driving and teamwork, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,"Inconsistent management  structure. Lack of consistent communication. The path for advancement is a tug of war, but you are giving the opportunity. Management accountability not demanded."
bad,"Typical call center environment. Stressful days as well as fun days. Decent pay, but high expectations from management that are sometimes impossible to achieve."
bad,"a normal day you just go in a take phone calls and solve customers issues"
bad,"The job itself it not hard whatsoever. Calls are pretty consistent throughout the day. Management is not acceptable though. The higher ups have a close knit circle, and if you are not liked they will find a way to make sure your are fired."
bad,This place is okay to work as far as the duties. The downside to working here is the supervisors do NOTHING with the vulgarity that comes out of the coworkers mouths.
bad,this is a good working environment for a call center it is a fun place to work and it also provides good pay and fun activities while at work.
bad,"Lots of lack of communication within the company. Overall, an OK company to work for - I do like the fact that there is a younger generation working there. Many things I would change to keep a higher morale within the company."
bad,good environment with great people that are willing to help with anything you might need. A regular day would consist of assisting customers over the phone
bad,"schedules were hectic, computer problems all around, calls kept getting routed to incorrect departments and training was a joke"
bad,"Yes there is advancement in this company. Few cents in raise annually if you perform well. But towards the end, they have too much expectation from employees. We are technicians, we did not sign up to sell stuff to our customers."
bad,"I will give Dish the credit that is due they have the superior product in the market when it comes to television,   They have the best hardware and pricing when it comes to television.  The problem I have with Dish is their internet they are trying to sell.  It is expensive and has a lot of limitation such as data caps, cannot stream anything such as Netflix or Hulu and Xbox will not work with this product.  Their pricing is double of that of other internet providers and if you don't have sell it you get docked.  For people that live in Rural areas though this is the only viable option for them.  Most people do not qualify credit wise when trying to buy the internet but pretty flexible when it comes to Tv."
bad,"a typical day at work consists of calls after calls. I learned a lot about real life experiences, I was able to lean how to fix a tv without even being there I also learned the difference between a RCA cable a Coax cable and an HDMI cable. etc. Honestly I don't think the management team did a very good job at there job. My co-workers were great and very positive, the hardest part of my job was when customers didn't understand what I was trying to tell them, and I had to reiterate myself for over an hour.. the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to go to work and interact with customers all over the USA. I am able to get along with just about anyone."
bad,"the hours suck and the days off are during the week and they never change, we have to work every holiday.  you have to meet ridiculous time schedules"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working for this company. Very poorly controlled by HR, doesnt offer good benefits, doesnt treat employees with respect."
bad,A typical day of work would consist of getting there and handling flyers which people dumped on the trash after I gave them away. I learned some things about sales. The management was all over the place.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"La empresa es muy buena, solo que hay muchas preferencias laborales, tiene buenas prestaciones un buen ambiente laboral."
bad,"If your into working your life away, this is the job for you. Very long hours (Sometimes 15 hour days.) and lots of required overtime."
bad,Not enough money coming in as opposed to going out being that this job was contracted
bad,"A typical work day is anywhere from six to seven jobs and working until nine or later at night. Which is hard to have a good work/life balance. Installing dish for customers and fixing problems with current customers. I have learned to have a better work ethic and to stay focused. Also being able to be aware of my surroundings better and keep on schedule. Our management is alright, it needs some work because one day you work. Then the next day you come in and they ask why you are there and workers tell them because I am on the schedule. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the new technology and having to keep good metrics with all the different tasks we are expected to do. I would say the most enjoyable part is being able to see places in Kansas I haven't seen before and meeting different people."
bad,"•	Payments and Billing - accept payment by credit card, offer self-serve payment solutions, and explain charges on the customer’s bill. "
bad,"The people there including the managers at the install site level are all top notch people. "
bad,There is great opportunity to gain on the job experience but up to a point.  It is easy to get burn out quickly as management tends to be very demanding in some cases.
bad,"Very fast paced environment took over at least 300 calls a day, I was able to work from home for over 2 1/2 years loved it."
bad,The company has taught me a lot of things. Taught me how to speak English fluently.
bad,"It takes a certain kind of person to work here. Pay is much less than a similar position at other companies, and you're not allowed to have much fun."
bad,Dish is a great place to work as an agent. We provide a fun work atmosphere with alot of perks that are won for daily performance while paying a nice hourly wage.The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees its a great feeling to come to work and see the enthusiasm in their faces to come to work.
bad,"I enjoy the people I work with on an daily basis, however the company as a whole is more interested in profit, than their entry level employees. "
bad,"Provide technical and billing assistance for all Dish products. Strong emphasis on customer satisfaction and technical support. "
bad,"Good Job for someone that likes outside work, company supplies all equipment , the advancement part of the job needs some work"
bad,Enhanced my skills on paying attention to detail. Maintained a high quality of satellite dishes.
bad,"Made some great friends, but very stressful job. Always pushing numbers and look down on employees on fmla. Alot of injuries due to the repetitive work and do not rotate people enough. Constantly riding you."
bad,"Summary says it all, as a whole the company is a good company to work for the part that I don't like is that you are required to attempt to sell products at every job you go to which normally wouldn't be an issue but cuz the price the products themselves are awesome but when you are not bilingual and the customer does not understand you you're still required to try and sell products to that customer using Google translate or the phone a friend option it's stressful in and of itself in that part"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,"Started out great until changes were made by the new CEOs which resulted in cut off time, higher expectations on sales and performance, longer days, less compassion for employees, and less team meetings. I was told when I started that I would be just doing troubleshooting and billing management which then turned very heavily into a sales based position. Your metrics are gauged constantly against all other call agents in the enterprise with a coaching session every week about your performance. "
bad,Back to back customer service calls ranging for billing questions to fixing technological problems.I thoroughly enjoyed my job and with the help of our coaches I found it very rewarding to continue to grow and succeed.
bad,"My advice to Dish is to make the ongoing job as fun as the training period was.  Once you hit ""the floor"", you are literally taking back to back calls, with at best a 15 minute meeting once a week.  If you enjoy talking to seniors that are frustrated and can't follow instruction, this job might just be for you."
bad,"long hours and horrible customers. inconsistent scheduling now that its ""preference"" based. Constantly changing supervisors and work stations. If rude comments and people screaming at you don't bother you, this is the job for you."
bad,"Management and co-workers are a plus at Dish, but the work/life balance and stressful environment of a call center are not worth it. You are measured based on certain stats, and if you do not meet those, it will affect your rating as an agent. The scheduling is not very flexible, they have changed it to where we set preferences, and your schedule is then determined by your stats. Usually these schedules are all over the place with times of day and shifts that will vary during the week. Overall, the people who work at Dish on site have been the best part of the job. The call center environment is not for everyone, it is a highly stressful place to be, and turnover rates are incredibly high because of this. Dish does a wonderful job with training."
bad,"They didn't take much time with those who were not understanding to further train them and help them have more of a chance to advance. the staff was wonderful, the atmosphere was fantastic. But if you're a slow learner you may not get far."
bad,muy buen trabajo hay buen ambiente laboral es un trabajo donde sacas lo que tu quieres ganar con las comisiones
bad,"a typical day at work: Have an awesome team meeting, work with employees, speak with customers and then go home."
bad,The owner didn't paid us in time and bad customer service also they make us to call to Puerto Rico to give the customer the services some customer got mad
bad,"If you are single it's a great job. The other techs were great to work with, understanding on certain jobs. Management wasn't the greatest but was able to deal with."
bad,"If you enjoy having every moment of your life monitored while at work, this is the place for you. They treat you more like a mule than a person. Good environment, but extremely unrealistic standards."
bad,"I am remote (work from home, not a warehouse), so my drives are very long, sometimes in the upwards of 4 hours to get to one job. The physical work is very fulfilling, although there is a strong aspect of sales that is very overbearing. These sales only account for a small amount of your bonus (No commission unfortunately) but is the most important metric in regards to promotions and pay raises. You can be fired for not selling enough product, so consider this job only if you enjoy sales in addition to the technical work."
bad,Left due to business practices that I found unacceptable to defend to customers.  Also frequently received conflicting answers to questions.
bad,Call monitoring was very biased and some managers oftentimes were not open to resolving representative issues within the call quality flow.
bad,Policies would change and people would not be made aware of which cause stressful situation.  Lack of communication between management. The culture was amazing. The people made it worth coming to work.
bad,They don’t really work with their employees with the schedules . I understand there’s thousands of people but we still have personal lives. And it would be best to at least be met half way on things .
bad,Lovely job but no career opportunity according to my opinion it's just for present earning and needs ..salary is good enough but no increment on salary nor promotion ..though in company payroll but the company can terminate the whole team without giving you any notice..
bad,Happy work place I would have stayed forevrr the  vompan eill bend over backwards to help train i and assist u in everyway. I would have retired from their but due to lay offs I was asked to leave.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
bad,Fun work place with supportive management.Not all about the number but how you grow and develop. Great opportunity for growth and excel to different levels of the company. Multiple schedules available. Paid time off.
bad,"Dish is a great company to work for if your are interested in  advancing quickly within the company.  However, if you are customer service driven and always want to help the customer to the best of your ability, regardless of how much time or effort it takes, this is not the company for you."
bad,"Walking into work from 8 am to 7:30 pm , working a 10 hour shift , assisting customers with their questions and concerns. Scheduling appointments (tech visit) , also helping troubleshoot their equipment (receiver) if having trouble. If we have meetings to attend ... we wait for our team manager to assist us with what all needs to be done and inform us on a brief summary what the meeting is about ....."
bad,"Great company hardest part is all the calls they come really fast and you cant catch your breath. Fun environment , managers are dedicated ."
good,not a good enviroment for work people are very mean. they will QA you before you go out into the floor and if you make a mistake the QA team will count it towards you even though you are still in training and they will make you sign or ask you too leave
good,We had stupid meetings that didn’t do us a bit of good dish is more about sales the. Keeping customers happier thought if ya as sales men routing sometime sucked
good,"Job description arbitrarily changes with the whims of ANY supervisor, whether it is in their purview or not.  Duties assigned continually exceed the ability to complete.  Praise is never given, though criticism is overwhelming and plentiful.  High turnover rate of management chain is incredible due to the demands placed upon them.  Guidance is seldom given when requested.  Consistency unheard of.  Whether you are support staff, management, or technician, expectations from those on high exceed the realms of reality. Morale is horrendous."
good,"Wasn't to bad of a job I liked it besides the management they switched to after me being their 3 months , we also were a contracting company for dish so probably actually working for the company dish net work would have been better I work for satellite country."
good,"Dish was not a good company to work for, all I received from them was good case managing skills that got me entry level positions to new companies. Over all they didn't help with my success."
good,"I worked as an inventory specialist in the warehouse. My job duties included, auditing technician vans on a daily basis, down stocking inventory, auditing total merchandise on hand, as well as entering customer data into Oracle."
good,"es una buena empresa aunque le hace falta comunicar al personal de ciertas actividades, y dar mayor capacitación de acuerdo a que se debe tratar con clientes que no han pagado un servicio y es muy díficil  por que se ponen difíciles sobre todo si la empresa les ha quedado mal y ademas capacitar a los supervisores para que desempeñen sus labores con mas animo,entusiasmo y compromiso"
good,"•	Involved in all stages of SDLC: Requirements, Design, Coding and Unit Testing."
good,"Not bad very mercenary call center..lots of advancement because they are firing the guy above you,,also no job security..couldn't tell you about benefits because they either keep them a secret or tell you they are not worth having.....trying to get some..maybe soon...but from what peeps tell me they stink anyway."
good,Solo buscan que caigas en un error para cobrar  o tratar de desaserse de ti.
good,"This is a company that eats up people.  "
good,Loved the job management sucked at my location they don't care about your well being you ask for help and will not receive any they don't tell you all that you need to know in training certain locations are racist they tell you they don't want to see you fail yet put you in situations that there is a high chance of you fail seem like the rules change at anytime
good,"Management has a dog eat dog mentality. Middle management is the problem. Most of them had never been a tech. They don't really have a clue other than what Tech's tell them. Long hours, customer service didn't seem to be priority in my office but sales were. As long as you sell 30 per work order you're good"
good,Steady work. Was not hard but fast paced a lot of the time. You are very replaceable there. If you don't hit numbers you will be gone quickly. if you stay busy you'll be fine.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"You work at your own pace but make sure it in a timely manner."
good,"After almost 9 years I was let go.  The goals they set for you are hard to legitimately achieve.  If you take pride in your work and like to do your best for your customers, this is not the place for you.  They want your work done quick and dirty and on to the next.  Also, sales.  Lots and lots of sales with personal monthly goals.  Goal is set for the office regardless of the number of people that work there so the less techs you have the more you are expected to sell."
good,"Failed to provide training. "
good,Load van. Go to first appointment. (This could change within the first 30 minuets and have you go the wrong direction.  Then you were late to start your day).  Never really met co-workers.
good,"The job itself could have been really fun. But management did not care about there employees. Co-workers were great, Hardest part of the job was having to do the job without the right equipment on a steady bases. Meeting new customers is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Taking as many as 30 plus calls in a days work. I learded that you cannot go to work and let your attitude reflect on your customers. Management was outsanding, if you had any concerns someone would be there to help. My co-workers were great. The heardest part of my job at dish was making sales sometimes. The most enjoyable part of my job at dish had to be just me being apart of something so new."
good,"If you can handle getting yelled at all day because customers messed up their systems, its not a bad job. The hardest part of the job is understanding what the customer is saying, you will discover just how many stupid people there are out there. Managment was ok, however, if you're not a suck up, don't expect to get promoted."
good,"I love my job, but there is no room for advancement. There are no benefits, and yearly raises."
good,"I took this job because they were willing to train and provided uniforms, tools, vehicle, the works. After 9 months of good work, travelling to a few cities, things got suspicious. People were getting let go. We asked the supervisors and they assured us we would be fine. Well we all got laid off and new workers got hired in to replace us. I worked for 11 months. Later I notice Dish advertising for the same positions. Can't trust it."
good,"Would not recommend unless you are in need of a job, any job, asap. Poisonous environment that will feel like Stockholm Syndrome. "
good,"desarrollé la tolerancia a la frustracion, la escucha activa y la capacidad de analizar a detalle cada situacion, asi como generar la empatia."
good,It was a good job good people to be around and ok pay. They said they was over paying me and wanted to take 300 out of my check for the next 5 check and I did not like it so I quit.
good,If you are looking to get a good paycheck apply but if you are looking to make a career out of working here look elsewhere. They will tell you and make you believe wonderful things about working here but at the end of the day it is all Smoke and Mirrors. Nobody really cares for you they will attempt to get the most out of you and stretch the dollar as much as they are legally aloud to. Coworkers are great and some supervisors and trainers are but management only cares about the customer and that the work is completed. They do not and will not care about you or anybody else but themselves. When trained they only teach you how to follow directions and will not provide you on how to properly conduct a specific task but to only know how to read a step by step instruction page on how to do a specific task. So I recommend you only apply and expect the lowest of this place if you are willing to work yourself to death here.
good,"manejo de gurpos y actividades a realizar, seguimiento de servicio."
good,"DISH is an ok job to work for however the cultural enviorment is not the best and is very seperated. Benefits that are given can not be adjusted until a year later or during open enrollment. A typical day of work which normally runs 10 hours a day can go more than 12 hours a day. Never a set schedule as agreed upon contract but you learn alot within the duties that are performed. The hardest part of my job is really nothing. Timing, communtion and orginaization however is an issue. A huge issue. The only enjoyable moments of the job is team building days which are after work hours or during weekends."
good,Trabajo independiente de la empresa.no tienes ninguna prestación salvó tu pago por cada venta e instalación.
good,"Dish was good for the overtime, lots of rules to follow with random visits on jobsites, overall it was not bad, with the turning economy streaming and such, it was looking like it was going to start turning for the worst."
good,VERY HIGH TURNOVER DUE TO POOR MANAGEMENT. Training is fun and once you are on the floor taking calls the support is poor and management is very cut throat.
good,"After Training I was sent out to my coach ant there was little to no feedback n how I was doing Job wise. This led to lower performance due to not knowing where we stood in accordance to numbers needed to succeed.. As of the time I was let go 10 coaches had been fired and over 25 people were let go the same day, more were fired in the following weeks."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"I worked for up dish services who was contracted by dish network.  Dish network came in and took over UpDish  and during this time I was in the hospital and was able to send an application since I was not able to be there for the rehire event but I was not hired back and I was a really good technician.  I don’t really know how it is now but previously when working for UpDish There was very poor management, inventory issues and not having enough equipment to do your job, the software and stuff you had to use on your phone like ETA was broken as well as boss, I was all the time having to explain where stuff went when I documented it correctly in ETA and then I had to search for where it was so I wouldn’t have to pay for it there was very poor management, inventory issues and not having enough equipment to do your job, the software and stuff you had to use on your phone like ETA was broken as well as boss, I was all the time having to explain where stuff went when I documented it correctly in ETA and then I had a search for where was so I wouldn’t have to pay for it, . I would like to work for Dish but if there anything like before then I would highly recommend staying away from this job, it will affect your family life due to the long hours you will be working."
good,The hours are very stressful. When hired was informed it was 7am until 3:30 pm. Once I started it was set as 10 hours a day and 8 hours on Sat. They did terrible yearly layoffs
good,Cut-throat environment. Upper management did not manage me well and then I was blamed for their failure to develop me. They said I had 6 months to become efficient but I was let go after 3. I hardly ever saw the managers or others in charge. The field managers were good however.
good,Co workers are great along with middle management. Very little to no support from Upper management. Good place for advancement if you are willing to relocate out of state to cooperate offices. Very little to no advancement.
good,"place was unprofessional, lots of favoritism. had great compensation, great schedules. they always had incentives going. at times when the company was struggling with sales a lot of pressure would be applied to the reps. there was MANDATORY overtime. if I was scheduled to work till 3 pm. at 2 on we would be told we had to stay an extra hour or get written up."
good,"Everything Else Is Bad. Insane in the membrane. Why do I feel this way? Because they suck bigly. They need help badly. no planning. The nasal marketing guy is an idiot. only thing that scumbag should do is clean the place with his, u know."
good,"I enjoyed working at DISH, for the simple fact, that it gave a good vibe. Otherwise, I think the management isn't so great. They will promote people who can barely do the regular customer service duties. The company is so unorganized"
good,"Un dia típico en el trabajo, revisar las altas de personal, para gestionar capacitación a el área que requiera. "
good,"Fast paced, what have you done for me lately position."
good,No job security. High turn overs in all positions. Fast paced great for energetic employees.
good,"A typical day at Dish - "
good,"The Dish corporate office is a great place to build experience early in your career, but is not a good long term plan for anyone. The culture is cutthroat and everything is highly politicized. Pay in the corporate office is well below average both nationally and for similar positions in the greater Denver area."
good,Handle a lot of calls
good,En la empreza dish me ayudo a fortalecer varios conocimientos asi como de atencion a clientes y de manejar mas la pc en sus funciones de recuperacion de cartera vencida asi como de seguimiento de activacion de servicio.
good,"Dish wasn’t completely terrible. some of the management was. When it came to the hiring process for jobs like, manager, ojt, etc it was mainly based on who you knew and were close to. The people you work with are great."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Sales are a big part of this job. If you do not meet requirements you will be let go, other metrics also affect job security. Benefits are not good, high deductibles. Possibility for a good potion of paid time off."
good,Workers are very helpful and professional. Management is poor. They don't tell you that you are a sales agent. Forget your title you only keep your job if you sell. Your employment is based on metrics mostly from sales not how well you do your job...
good,"I currently work for dish as a technician. At first I loved the job. Always something different every day to keep things fresh. But things quickly took a turn in a different direction. Dish expects you to sell at every single job. And if you don't sell they will cut your hours and force you to quit. This is the only thing they care about if you are a good salesperson you will have job security. There are dangerous work conditions. Inside nasty houses and sometimes hostile environments. you will have to crawl under houses where you will run into snakes, spiders and other ""creatures."" And no matter how hard you work or how much the customers love you. You will only ever get asked how much you sold today."
good,"Buen trabajo para empezar, pero no para vida adulta o con familia, pésimo personal de recursos humanos con pésimas ideas y supuestas optimizaciones"
good,Management always look for negative things to say instead of focusing on positive. Has great insentives for sales but it’s very micromanaged. Never feel welcomed
good,"Dish focused on too many things at once, every day was a new challenge as it seemed they wanted to refine and simplify the process that it took all autonomy away from supervisors."
good,A typical day involved you adhering to your given schedule and speaking with many different types of customers to resolve their issues.  Management was only focused on you meeting your sales metrics and you were reviewed by quality assurance reps to insure that you were following company guidelines.
good,"Good learning, chances to learn all departments activities and need inter communications skills to manage the show.,  Provided good space to understand Taxation and SCM Operations too.,"
good,"Not for everyone. There are great advancement opportunities. However, the executive management team is very weak and the business is a dying industry."
good,Very stressful and disorganized and tge training was inadaquate. The company assumed that staff knows more then they do and does not provide adequate back up training when needed.
good,"its a great place to work. "
good,"when i started the job at dish i was elated . shortly after starting i quit my part time job and remained here full time ; shortly afterwards i realized i was better off keeping my part time job . aside from the benefits and the scheduling this has to be one of the worst jobs. i started in sales and went to retention ; this job is a revolving door you meet and see more new people than anything else ive witnessed . the pay is AMAZING when its in season , but you have to take advantage of it then because if not youll be in a rut of no money . the management is horrible and everyone is pinning the blame on someone else . theres constant round table meetings that they have to ""get the employees feedback"" but you soon realize they don't take any action unless its something small such as lunch times . they have adjusted the commission structure to a point where if you work your full 40hrs/wk its almost impossible to hit commission and if you do its very minimal. the company loses employees in bulk and they don't seem to see the trend. i wouldn't recommend this job to anyone with a child as it is almost impossible to get a day off unless you have FMLA or a good relationship with management"
good,Es una empresa en donde no se valora el trabajo del empleado solo se utiliza
good,I learned a lot at DISH. The employee turnover in my department created opportunities for me to present my capability and I was able to gain better access to management and showcase my ability.
good,"On average, managed around 17-20 direct reports. listened to 3 calls per agent every week, as well as a seperate one on one form. Workplace culture was very generic. Typical day at work consist of delivering real time feedback to employees taking phone calls, as well as evaluating calls. The most enjoyable part was being able to work directly with vendors such as HBO. Being able to draw attention to the whole call center to get agent by-in's to sell the current incentive."
good,Time spent at Dish was very interesting. Management at this location are not concerned about the worki life balance not team work and work environment
good,"I always felt unwelcome working here. You may fit in but I didn't. As long as you play their stupid games, you'll be fine. Just don't expect a raise or growth in your career of any kind."
good,"This was a great place to start at.  Started as a tech, worked my way up through management.  Started many things there and was able to get credit for doing so.  Was just my last boss that turned it sour along with the lack of development opportunities."
good,Cut throat company. No matter how many years of service served you are expendable. Higher paid tenured employees are targeted. Entire departments are eliminated without notice. New initiatives and projects are launched with out prior training. Constant shortage of equipment requires jobs not getting completed and negatively impacts the employee. Not a desirable place to work. ( 17 years experience )
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"The warehouse portion of dish network was a very fast paced production based job, Employees were required to meet a daily quota based on the amount of product available that day."
good,me parecio muy bien ambiente laborar .tambien el trato de personal todo muy bien solo el salario era muy bajo
good,Overall good but not if you don't want to work six days a week in the summer and possibly only four in the winter. Worst part is trying to keep up worth sales demands after the install of Dish's over priced trinket stuff they want you to pawn off on the customer. Got written up for not being a salesperson and just wanted to install.
good,"The company tells you that the culture is one thing and then it is the complete opposite. They claim that there are no politics in the workplace, however the company is nothing but politics. Management expects complete flexibility from you but offers none in return. It is also hard for some to get Dish service at their home, however if you do not you are fired."
good,"I would like to say that I respected and appreciated my immediate supervisor/ Field Service Manager, and that I had no problem with the work that I physically did as a satellite technician. It is work. It has its good days and bad days. My problem is certain company expectations and policies that I personally consider unrealistic, and others that I considered unethical. I enjoyed the challenge of responding to a call to someone's residence or place of business to install their satellite or to troubleshoot a problem with it. I did not enjoy when I had to say things or promote ideas that I disagreed with."
good,I really do not feel comfortable writing a review. The only comment I can truly make is Dish's technician role is very stressful and if planning to become a technician you MUST be a salesman first.
good,"not much room for advancement with the company, most people in charge were put there because of their relation to someone else or they transferred from somewhere else"
good,"Long Hours not a problem its the long hours standing all day, you have access to water but at the fear of falling behind in work, you work in hot environment dehydrated and tired from standing all day. it is terrible in that sense. dish should do a better job of making this something they can change"
good,"I was very very very hot, I would always have to change my clothes before my shift was over because i would be soaked from sweat. Do not expect to keep your hair neat if you work here because you will sweat it out. you stay busy from the moment you walk in during your shift til you leave. Felt like high school because they monitor how long you stay in the bathroom and have to sign in and out to use the bathroom. managers were very tight about giving out extra hours. could not go over five minutes when your shift was over. made good friends, and they were always willing to help you get caught up if you were having problems"
good,The work was ok. Some days would be extremely long but you got paid if you had to work long. Would not pay more than 40 hours if they could.
good,impossible to thrive and be made a better company when most of the focus is on sales instead of providing good customer service and making sure equipment is installed properly. constantly being blamed when issues happen instead of giving us the time to make sure services are installed properly the first time instead of timing up to the very second with limitations and sales expectations that make no sense. makes u question is the customer really the ones that are being taken care of.
good,"overall my experience with satellite installers prepared me for the obstacles that I'm now aware of and now prepared to deal with. and it also prepared me when dealing with customers. every customer has a different objective or issue and needs to be delt with in a professional and sensitive manner. "
good,Hay buen ambiente laboral lastima que esta ubicadavalgo lejos
good,bad company they work you like a robot and donot get injured here ore you will be gone asap unable to contact bosses or corprate they do not have time  for field tech issues or concerns
good,"1. tipico trabajar los domingos"
good,really hard to get a supportive helpful supervisor. making good money is difficult unless you are an amazing sales person. hard to want to stay.
good,"Great co-workers and Dish is able to hire strong management talent but Directors and VP's hands are tied to make necessary decisions and dish is late to market consistently.  This inability to allow management the tools and resources they need to succeed made for rapid turn over at the company. "
good,"Management was never available for help they would always make excuses and would end up leaving coworkers without much needed assistance,"
good,Inbound phone job.  Really have to grind out every day.  A lot of income potential if you are willing to work 12+ hour days.  Sink or swim environment.
good,Dish Network is not an average job. It requires a very special kind of person to be able to take up the kind of responsibility that a technician does on the daily basis.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"I learned how to manage up to 25 technicians, the millions of dollars of equipment on a daily basis, how to prioritize and learn how to use Excel."
good,Loved working here at first. I was very good at technical troubleshooting. I won many awards for great customer service and qualifying for a bonus of 35% for months at a time.
good,"I didn't like the culture, too purile.  Supervisors were selected based on personal performance, apparently no leadership skills or training was provided or required."
good,"Its a very metrics driven and obsessed culture. If you are comfortable with that, you will flourish and advance quickly. However, it seems their loyalty is fleeting and have very little patience before choosing to part ways."
good,"learn to work with different types of people,hardest part of the job long hours and no motivational activity at work to improve the environment, stress full environment, most enjoyable part of the job is diversity, co workers,"
good,"Fast paced,busy ,alot of up and down ladders,stressful, meet alot of different cultures, vehicle maintenance. some people are easier to get along with,long hours,dogs,dogs, eat on the run, safety 1st"
good,"The job its self i didnt have a roblem with. The management yelling, constant comission changes, and oor job security was the reason i left. I did enjoy helping customers and being able to make an unlimited amount of income."
good,Typical day is 14-16 hours. Being on salary I am not compensated enough for the work I perform and the hours worked.
good,enjoyed outside environment and working in community. also enjoyed co workers
good,Evaluación de empresa es un horario corto con algo de estrés el cierre de mi contrato laboral fue tardado se tardan en entregar fondo de ahorro no liquidan por antigüedad
good,Es un excelente trabajo para estudiantes y amas de casa pero hay pésimos jefes de islas que no merecen el puesto ya que no subes por tus conocimientos o ha ilidades desgraciadamente
good,"It was a hard job but it had its rewards, they cared little for the people that were doing the work but it is deffinetly a different experience and you finish when your day is done."
good,"You're a salesmen, not a Tech. Sure you install peoples dish and set up their TV but now you have to also be a sales men and its Highly Expected. Most likely out of state training. You work until your route is done. If you're not selling enough the managers will schedule ride a longs to see why your can't sell."
good,"Working at dish in the manufacturing area was good, everyone was nice friendly and it made the challenging work more easy, hours of the job were good."
good,When I started at Dish was green about the industry. Moved threw the levels of technician and eventually management but feared for my job most of the way. Seemed as the more you learned and longer you were there the less secure your job was because they didnt want to keep paying top pay
good,it was not that bad but i wanted a better job that paid more and i like to move around and have the freedom of movement not on a chair for 10 to 15 hours
good,Have to apply for every promotion all interviews are in special format and require a panel. Though hours and Mandatory overtime customer consitantly yell at you over the phone need to have thick skin and not be emotional.
good,"-Management is completely incompetent"
good,"I enjoyed much of working for Dish.  Their corporate structure is strict,  but necessarily so.  The supervisors you directly report to in the call center are a joke...must be why 1/2 of them were recently fired. Hopefully they restaff with people that are more in line with their philosophy."
good,"The technical support training that is given before going into productive is not extensive to where when you hit the floor you are not fully prepared. Then, when you are needing guidance you don't get assistance from management."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Dish has a very unique culture,  which if it works for you, you’ll do great. The turnover is high and morale varies dramatically by department.  I would highly recommend Dish for those starting their career as they offer tremendous training and you’ll work on projects above your title.  I wouldn’t recommend Dish for those later in their career due to the many restrictions, poor ability to create change and overall culture."
good,I worked at dish almost 20 years the pay was good but the health care cost to much. Very fast paced and stressfull and management treated you as a number instead of employee.The positive is you can gain alot of skills in other fields wich you can use to find other work
good,"For some people DISH provides fantastic opportunities but if you are not 100% behind the quirky culture it can be difficult.  While some internal career migration can be good, too many under qualified people are getting promoted into IT which is going to cause problems longer term."
good,"Dish claims to care about customer service but what they really seem to care about is ""happy talk"". I've had many customers compliment me on resolving their issues quickly and efficiently, but because I don't do the ""got any plans for the weekend?"" thing with customers, I'm not a considered a good agent.  As in most large call centers, metrics are the be all and end all.  I have seen countless agents refuse to set up service calls for customers because doing so negatively impacts their metrics.  The system is designed to promote those that are chatty and unhelpful, which means that many of the coaches have that mind set: that it's better to talk with a customer about the weather than actually resolving their issues."
good,"Employees were nice, but not very helpful when needing assistance on a job. Was putting 10 to 12 hour work days almost every week. Job locations would constantly change throughout a work day."
good,"They do not care about their front line or coaches lives.  The stress is so bad people are taken out by ambulance all they time, not a health or good environment"
good,"That's the best I can give you.  My direct manager was great, overall an average work experience so far.  Need clear direction for future of  company."
good,"I had worker for this company for 11 years, training the majority of their techs, being their biggest ambassador, most loyal employee, all of a sudden, manager calls me into his office and was fired on the spot, according to them, it was because of productivity or lack there-off, prior to this day, i was tech of the month 3 consecutive months, the day of, i was training a new hire. upper management is clueless about what goes on in the field and would be completely loss without their techs, this company needs to take better care of their employees."
good,es muy bonito el trabajo ya que andas en las calles ofreciendo entretenimiento para la familia pero el personal administrativo no es el correcto.
good,Empresas externas mal no dan ningún seguro ni nada
good,"All the metrics you are graded on are based on nation wide averages and are not reasonable. In order to meet time requirements, one must take shortcuts and perform unsafe not-totally-complete jobs. Totally against my work ethics."
good,"Local warehouse has been poorly managed for many years. It is continually understaffed. Required to maintain 50+ remote technicians, 12+ local technicians inventories as well as the warehouse's daily. Technicians consistently fail to do their part so the team dynamic never works. Most of every day is spent researching and correcting technician's discrepancies."
good,The company fired 200 people in two weeks. I was one of them. two weeks later they fired another 200 people for no reason. I received unemployment due to beinf fired/ laid off.
good,Every job has its pros and cons.  Not every situation affects every person.  Work/life balance is subject to the person's view that is directly involved.  Compensation is probably below adequate for the expectations.
good,DISH was an ok work environment but Dispatcher is a mindless position designed to take the human equation out of the planning process as they were transitioning to an automated routing device as I was leaving.
good,"Normal company to work with basic benefits , at least you can get to paid your bills, management lacks of experience and knowledge about how treat people"
good,"You are expected to bust your tail, in any and all weather conditions, at high personal risk, for minimal pay. They do supply all PPE and tools, though."
good,"It's not the worst job to have. However, it is very stressful and fast paced. The better your stats the more calls get routed to you so it's almost like if you have to work harder for performing better. Management has all been replaced for performance. Everything is scripted when it comes to customer support and you can be terminated for going off-script"
good,Team managers have a tight clique and you need to stay in good with each and every one of them to remain a good agent. I was Dr. Dish and its really a over glorified technical support agent position. In all fairness their equipment and agent tools are cutting edge.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Job was fun for awhile but there has been a big shift to continually increasing sales goals of tv wall mounts, protection plans, sound systems, etc. That along with the continually falling value of dishes stock has given me reason to start looking elsewhere for future employment. I didn't sign up to be a salesmen and especially don't like being treated like all of us techs are the reason the company is not doing so hot. Even when we do hit our sales goal for the month as a team we are then rewarded with an increased goal the very next month. And where not talking pennies here, more like if you hit a $20 per work order goal they turn around the next month and increase that to $25. That along with the fact that you are not rewarded with commissions or money that you could use to support your family, but rather these cheesy points that you can use to order electronics of of their flimsy awards site. Not even like theres a potential to increase your income with these sales. sorry my rant is now over."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the work, until I got out onto the floor. They started cutting hours, and the metrics by which you are graded are not fair. For instance, if you are in tech support and a customer calls in demanding a technician for something you can easily fix over the phone, and you try to work with them but they still demand a tech, that counts against you. If a customer calls in with hard drive failure on their DVR, you either have to replace their equipment or upgrade it. Replacing it counts against you. Even in tech support, call time counts against you.. All calls on average need to be about ten to twelve minutes long, even if you are working with an eighty year old customer with a bad hip who has a corded phone. "
good,"I enjoyed working there. The schedule was consistent, the people that worked  there in management were supportive and helpful. The only thing I didnt like is that it was a seasonal job"
good,Yo salí de hay por el bajo sueldo y las pocas comisiones
good,"Typical work day at Dish Consisted of long hours with little pay when you first start off. In order to make a decent salary you had to work ridiculous hours and perform at the companies standards which changed every other week, "
good,"I was always pushed to complete job. Quality was not a requirement. I always had to fix previous work. never had enough time. When I told my supervisor that I was more concerned with quality NOT his numbers, I was fired."
good,"Overall great place to work, not a lot of room for advancement. Coaches are not on the same page. Lack of updating and communication. Over taxed, they supply payouts that are separated from paycheck and taxed. Shift changes about every 2 weeks no flexibility. If you miss a day they take your paid time off and give a point. Not correcting agents mistakes until they are ready to fire them."
good,Overall it's a decent job you know the pay is okay you know work balance isn't all that good time off it's hard to come by requesting time off anyway it's hard to come by but overall if you can deal with that it's okay job
good,"While some managers do an amazing job trying to motivate their employees, I've found that some managers sometimes ignore poor business practices in the drive to improve numbers. It's frustrating when you are trying to develop employees with correct procedural knowledge and practices. Management looks for employees who fit a certain profile or are members of the exclusive club and will not promote outside of the box."
good,At dish you can make lots of money but the there is a huge turnover rate and the high stress levels caused by management. Dish does offer lots of perks and prizes for top sales people.
good,"Working at Dish for 7 years gave me a real insight into the organization. It is still operated by the founders. They try to run a huge company like a family run business, as a result ""Managers"" never really get to manage."
good,this is a good job if you want to work long hours and travel up to three hours away daily. you get a good amount of overtime due to the extremely long route
good,"Dishtv , concerned to sales profile(channel - alt- dstrbn) -  is goal oriented and aggressive i,e, product pricing,placement of products. In terms of environment it is not at all good there is no well interactions between seniors n juniors (treatment is extremely bias)"
good,"The work life balance is a bit ridiculous sometimes, required to have separate days off so you can't really plan anything. Requesting time off had better be months in advance or it's ""not on the calendar"". If you have an emergency, forget it, that's going to be a point on your attendance total. Work was terrible, like any call center job, but the people were all right. Nobody's going to stick their neck out for you, but why should they?"
good,"Low 3 star job, its hard enough to meet demands of installing but on top of that you must meet the demands of sales. The hours were good if you want to work 40+ a week but if you are a new father, expect missing a whole lot of family dinners."
good,"This work is easy but keeps you busy, which I enjoy. The environment isn't necessarily ideal, difficult co-workers as well as manager. I feel like I'm doing the same work everyday with no opportunity for growth. I'm excelling in the work I am doing but feel like I am not getting enough recognition. The hardest part of the job is lack of team work and acknowledgement."
good,"When I first started, the atmosphere was great. I loved coming to work. the Only down part was they stresses you about making quotas to the point you may want to leave and micro-manage you a lot. Towards the rest of my time there they begin to do less and less incentives to for the sales representative which made it no fun to work as much anymore. CEO's of the Company does not care about employees unless you are apart of H.R."
good,I always considered Dish my family.  We did have new management come in and took the family atmosphere away and caused our work life balance to be horrible.  The new management came in and let go of a bunch of good workers and ruined morale throughout the shop.  If there was new management it would be a great place to work!
good,"Not bad may include civic activities, awards and recognitions, volunteering or cultural skills like language or travel. ... You should use good and nice"
good,"When I began with Dish, it wasn't a bad place to work if you met all your call metrics and were willing to work the MANDATORY overtime that was required.  After 2 years, I was able to work my way up to a corporate position.  I enjoyed the team and management that I was working with, then management changed. My new manager had no experience working the job and started making changes that didn't fit with the work that was being done.  She had horrible soft skills, she never said good morning or goodbye, in fact there were many days she didn't even speak to her team at all the whole day.  This woman made working at Dish the worst work experience I have ever had!  I tried to change positions and even call her out on bad management practices, but Dish would rather employ brainless robots that will do everything asked rather than free thinkers who want to learn and grow!  Bad managers run Dish and make the job unpleasant!  Dish recently laid off many tenured employees to bring in College graduates to make their bottom line look better. They would rather have inexperience and cheap labor, than pay for top quality work!"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,I feel like dish is a good place to work if customer service is your specialty i am more of a manual labor type of person but it was a good and friendly place to work.
good,"Job itself is great.  Allows you to be outside in the elements and work independently.  Direct supervisors are great and easy to work with, it's the upper management that has no leeway and understanding what the jobject requires of you both mentally and physically."
good,"my the hardest part of this is 20 days tour in a month...."
good,"A typical day consist of about 10 to 20 inbound calls working on sales for tv, internet and phone services threw 30 different providers. I've learned how to improve on my social skills, communication and listening skills, rebuttals, being informative and knowing the product. I feel the management is poor there is a lot of lack on there ability to communicate with one another and also with the reps on the floor. The co-workers make the place enjoyable, very easy to work with and always there to help in the time of need. One of the hardest things about my job is dealing with some type of computer issue other then that I try not to stress about any thing just sell service with a smile. Most enjoyable is closing a sale since commission is involved."
good,Having to meet CSAT scores and sales goals that were almost impossible and always telling you to hang up on customers even if their problems were not solved. Almost always telling you to do the opposite of what they told you not to do.
good,"I wouldn't recommend anyone work there. It's alot of hard work with low pay. I've been working there for almost a year and they still haven't hired me full time. I'm still in the ""90 day trial period"" and it's almost been a year."
good,"bad part of the job, being sent to different locations daily, having to crawl under houses, not compensated fairly for work done. Always felt rushed against the clock."
good,loud music and tvs always on full blast unable to hear the customers  coaches are not fully trained ... and I wish I had more training ..
good,"very fast paced which makes your day go by fast, I took a whole new aspect on satellite services and the story on how dish network was brought to life is interesting"
good,Taking inbound calls from potential customers wanting information on packages and promotions currently going on. Lots of mandatory overtime and strange hours depending on what team you are on.
good,"Dish is not a bad job, stressful at times due to the fact that they measure stats on employees through an index. Lots of opportunities to win things and plenty of incentives. A typical day at work is to come in and have a team meeting for 10 minutes talking about how to improve, we learn new things about the company and any changes that have been made. My coworkers for the most part are positive and outgoing, willing to help each other out. The hardest part of the job is keeping all stats above index. The most enjoyable part of the job is accomplishing goals and task that are set for you."
good,"Worked there just over 5 years. Wasn't to bad at first then progressively went down hill after year 2. When Charles Ergon stepped down and Bill Clayton became CEO seemed to be the big change. Became a rat race to do as many jobs in a day even if it took time away from the customer. Summer time comes in Arizona and the heat increases rather then get off at a decent time it meant work later since there was more daylight. Every year the bar went up and up even though we didn't have more time so we would have to work faster making short cuts and less customer ed just to get the work done so we didn't get fired which they threatened a lot. now comes sales. They started dish home services selling sound bars and tv mounts. Now we have to try and make more time with the customer to sell stuff and get our jobs done or be fired. Since I was fired I feel much better and I sleep much better at night. Charles Ergon has become CEO again so time will tell where it leaves my friends. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you don't have a family. Pay can be good and they provide medical, 401k, and dental. Not much room for advancement as a tech."
good,It is just an okay company to work for. Upper management is more focused on the company making money VS making the employees happy
good,"Fast paced, knowledgeable staff, ok benefits, will promote from within. Learned a lot in a short period of time. Working in an environment with knowledgeable co-workers."
good,"Dish was voted worst company in america so you can use that to get a clue/,"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,The most enjoyable part of work is during the moring because i am full of energy and ready to work the job consists of the same task for 12 hours so it can get pretty boring and un enjoyable after lunch.
good,management in Denver had no clue how things were run in Atlanta! It was black and white-favoritism.
good,Historically rated in the worst companies to work for. Always had to work mandatory overtime and health care coverage was lousy.
good,if you want long hours and no holidays then this is the place for you
good,I was a Call Center Supervisor and managed up to 25 employees.
good,"They give you free TV.  They have pool table, ping pong table and K-cup machines."
good,"Great teamwork among co-workers, depending on time of day management was good in terms of field managers."
good,Pulling orders and closing then out. Loading and unloading trucks with forklifts. Learned how to use UPS and FedEx programs to process expedited orders. Great co-workers. Management was okay at times. Enjoyed working at own pace but getting work done at the end of a day and over time.
good,Go to work log on....take calls alot of them.
good,a lot of customer service dealing with irate customers alot of trouble shooting and billing learned how to interact more with customers over the phone how to de-escalate situations managment was helpful the co workers where very freindly made alot of new friends the haedest part of the job would be the lack of movement having to be sitting 10 hours a day the most enjoyable part i would say is knowing there was always someone available for help if i needed managers as well as swnior member employees
good,It was a very demanding environment with some unrealistic expectations.
good,"Customer service oriented, which rely heavy on field workers but management support is slow and little notice of inpending change"
good,"the place is a downer, but is it a call center so it is typical. the bosses just worry about if you are getting good surveys and don't actually care about you."
good,"DISH can be a great place to work but is not without it's problems. The dress code is relaxed, remote/work from home is allowed occasionally, and management is mostly approachable and transparent. That said, there are a lot of changes happening within the business and it seems that some of those changes need a bit more thought put into the implementation. Overall, DISH is a good company to work for and the TV benefits are pretty sweet."
good,"The people there were great but the job itself was not. This company strives for you to do the job as quick as possible they want all calls under 2 to 3 minutes, which I understand, but each customer issue will vary. Some calls can last up to 15 minutes which too many of these calls will make you fall behind but in some cases, it's out of your hand yet they don't understand that. The constant back to back phone calls just was not for me."
good,Competitive call center environment. Back to back calls for duration of shift. Good hands on training team provides product knowledge and tool utilization.
good,"A lot of repetitive hand work in PI and Cos A/B, some rude people, some good people, every shift gets stiffed by the shift before them and no one really appreciates you, even when you do good work. Promises of a raise for over a year and nothing happened about it, workers coming in after me were getting paid more just walking in and when i tried to change the shift i was on they took too long and I lost my patience but still no raise."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Dish is a good company but will never be a great company. There is a huge disconnect between corporate and call center. Blame rolls downhill, success is celebrated at the corporate level."
good,Easy job. Packing remote controls. Some of the employees are laid back and helpful. Some of the supervisors are unrealistic about some of their expectations
good,No job security. Never know when they will downsize. They hired over a hundred people just to lay off two hundred less than three months after. It was fun while it lasted.
good,I didn't feel appreciated as a person. Dish is very much a churn and burn company. You will be replaceable and you must watch your pay stubs to avoid errors.
good,Working there was good to get me back on my feet. But it was just not the right fit for me. I would like a job that is more to do with my degree of education.
good,It’s a fast paced stressful investment. Shifts change frequently. Not very family friendly when it comes to schedules. The money is good. Takes a strong patient personally to work there
good,Really enjoyed my position and work that I did even with the weekly travel schedule. I knew I made a difference for good in the business but I was not politically savvy enough to navigate the shark infested waters of senior management at the time. I know the company has continued to evolve its culture to make it a better place to work and wish them the best. Lots of great upper level leadership there continuing to make it a better place.
good,"In the time I worked here hourly pay was good plus a handsome commission, But the mandatory hours were hard to keep a good work to life balance. Management at the time wasn't the best and made work stressful. You also need thick skin as customers can always be rude over the phone, as there isn't a human connection."
good,"Working at DISH was certainly interesting.  They set expectations very high and stats even higher. It's not easy work, its incredibly stressful but decent pay. Overtime was great. My GM was great, my supervisor was relaxed. One thing to know is when applying is, be prepared to learn alot all at once, be adaptable to your surroundings, and listen to your dish coach."
good,This is a great job for someone with no children and no physical ailments or disabilities. The turn over rate is very high but the key to success is to post attention in training and learn all you can during nesting period because once you're on the floor there will be little to no help.
good,"Culture shifted from Installation based to sales based, if you aren't a salesman, this is not the company for you."
good,I don't really want to make any comment. I am just trying to reach a minimum amount of characters to move on. Having this be mandatory is kind of ridiculous.
good,Not PCI  and you can use your cell phone on the floor and while on calls. I use to video chat with my girlfriend daily and they can see everything on the floor. Not good at protecting Clint info
good,"The company has a poor work culture in terms of work/life balance,"
good,To much to say after 6 years. I got bored of the company. A company I had no desire to help grow. Television is not my line of work. Warehouse is no longer my line of work. Art is my line of work and there was no advancement there.
good,"It was bad when I was there long ago, it may or may not be better now. A lot of work from home spots, a new cozy spot in the mall, still decent pay, but I am sure the same issues are there"
good,"Me dedicaba a la captación de nuevos distribuidores autorizados por DISH los capacitaba, me hacia cargo de todo el proceso administrativo para dar de alta a su empresa ante el SAT e IMSS."
good,"The managers at my office were great and loved working for them. Everything else about the company was just horrible. Could complain all day but don't have the time."
good,"The work wasn't terrible, but your work day would change so much with new jobs coming in, or jobs being cancelled, you could not plan out your day. Normally you were supposed to be done at 5, but half the time they would schedual and install at 4:30 that you wouldnt get done with until 7. Also the forced sales. I was hired in and no sales were mentioned to me, come to find out you had to sell a variety of Bluetooth speakers, HDMI cords, and other junk, and have an average of $30 of items sold PER HOUSE you visited, and if you didn't you would always be on the lowest pay scale. No opportunities to advance and almost impossible to move up on the pay scale. Me"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"I am never one to write a review but felt it necessary. No work place is perfect and they all come with pros and cons. However you must have tight skin to work at a place like this. Let's face it , when you think about it satellite services are given to customers who have primarily no other options. And dish/ direct tv sucks it does not matter. You constantly deal with customers bashing you and belittling you on a CONSTANT basis. The work you do is NEVER enough for management and when you are a top performer your expected to be at a certain standard everyday. 365 24/7 a day job. Management makes agents compete with one another which is uncomfortable. if your having a bad day with numbers they make you as well as the whole call center aware how bad your doing. I've seen management degrade employees and agents walking out crying and abandoning their jobs. This is suppose to be a place of employment but it's like high school all over again. It got to the point I would get an immediate headache entering the building and when I got home I would sit on the couch and decompress for 2 hrs. I was practically begged to be a lead which I turned down many times. I was terminated eventually because Quality Assurance did not feel I held the call to standard. However I still stand by my decision to assist the customer being as though my job was to prevent customers from canceling service. I did not look at this job as a permanent place of employment but I did make great money and worked 60-70 hr work weeks as well. Lesson learned when accepting a job think about yourself as well as your mental"
good,"Fantastic pay and benefits the only problem is if these people don't like you they will do everything they can including lying to HR to get you fired."
good,"fast pace"
good,"Working at dish was a fun place to work. however the managers dont care about the employees, and the work is very competitive. If you are not perfect."
good,Es una buena empresa pero no para crecer laboralmente
good,"well, what can i say. this company (Spi global) was my first company  to work with in this industry. ive worked for them for 2 yrs. yes 2 yrs. and nothing happened as far as my career growth is concerned.' you see, im the kind of an employee who strive for improvement. i always listened  to  their coaching sessions, done this, done that, and still im stuck on the same ground. i totally understand the part wherein there might be still some missing pieces in my search for the recipe to promotion but, i wish they couldve just been upfront on what i dont have so i can continuously improve."
good,Se realizaría mejor el trabajo si siguen los procesos
good,"For a student still in college this was a good job, but after college this isn't a desirable job. It is contracted work with no benefits or job security. The work is monotonous and not very exciting."
good,"Sinceramente no tuve una buena experiencia en ese trabajo, es por eso que, solo fueron unos meses laborando en esa empresa."
good,"Always understaffed and the work load tends to be very skewed. Lazy coworkers, but the management are great people to work with and talk to. Best part."
good,"Hi pressure to work overtime. Difficult to advance. Job security was minimal and management seemed to make it known. Overall, it's a an average call center experience."
good,"This company is a very good, bt some i am so afraid bcz of electricity, one time electric heart me very much. While I have left this company. Bt it's very good job"
good,"They sell you on what you can make but are quick to take away your sales commission for any mistakes. They also base your commission on a call to sales ratio, so a sale isn't the same as another sale. Too many tries without success lowers your percentage at getting sales and lower your payout for the week."
good,I didn't care for it to much after I got hurt they didn't want anything to do with me. They stick you in a corner to clean doors and hope you will quit.
good,"Dish is a great place to work if you don't mind making bare minimum while they load you up with new skills that are not optional. Dish is spreading their in home services as a contracted company for Sears, Samsung and Bosch. Which are great skills and impressive that one technician can do it all. However, while these skills are forced on all technicians the company does not financially compensate the technicians for these skills. Other Satellite and Cable companies start their Technicians at almost double the salary of a seasoned Dish Technician for only one skill set. Now that I have acquired other Technical skills, I hope to achieve a better financial career opportunity."
good,"Job has decent pay, but the stress load is not worth it for someone like myself, who is also a full-time student. However, I would recommend for someone who is looking to make decent money, and has a lot of patience."
good,"I choose not to answer any questions providing information about my employment while employed at Dish. My choice, my answer............................................."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"I worked as a contractor in the programming department.  I learned alot of what goes into programming and why it's so complicated.  I processed payments to networks like Hallmark , but it was very complicated and the training sucked,"
good,"A typical day consisted of taking inbound  calls fro individuals inquiring about DISH services. Through open ended questions and active listening I would right size the most appropriate entertainment package/option t fit their needs. "
good,"Mala  comunicación  entre jefesby subordinados,  Buenas instalaciones"
good,"I got lucky and had some decent managers directly above me, but a lot of the management team I worked with is frankly corrupt. It created a hostile work environment and was mentally unhealthy to stay there. The work itself was great. You get a ton of hours and the pay is fair. Advancement is difficult, particularly considering the management problem."
good,"Pay was fair for my age. Hours were good. Advancement was possible, but was unable to do so as I was focusing on school. It was a job that sucked the energy out of you, but it wasn't the worst of jobs out there."
good,If your willing to put enormous amount of effort to be promoted. Along with basically doing the job that the want to be promoted to before you get raise this is for you. I've been lied to promise an amount for my salary then seeing that its wasn't correct they basically said they would not fix it.
good,"The company has a highly specialized and intense culture.  If you align with these values, it can be a rewarding and uniquely immersive experience.  The firm is also trying earnestly to transform itself into a different kind of company and is hiring lots of millennials in pursuit of that goal."
good,"You'll either thrive under Dish politics, be affected by them, or won't be there long enough to have them affect you."
good,a typical day of work is back to back call of tech and billing questions. I have learned to take care of your customers even when they are rued to you . the management need to learn to hear there employees and what they have to say. in all its a fun place to work and very nice people to work with. the hardest part of you job is the back to back call for 8 or 10 hour days.the best part of my day are my breaks.
good,there is opportunity for advancement as long as you can sustain total commitment and be  required above the normal expectations average team member. staying in one positions is not recommended
good,"Most managers were cool, some weren't. Be prepared to dress well every day, the place was basically a fashion show. If you can handle being yelled at about things completely out of your control then it's not a bad place."
good,"typical day started at 5:30am printing technician route and pulling inventory needed for job "
good,My co workers were awesome to work with.  Everyone in my department helped each other.  My department did not have much support from management staff.
good,"A lack of communication causes many issues throughout the company. Constantly changing roles and expectations make working efficient impossible. Huge push toward sales, yet they don't try to hire salesmen"
good,"I've what builds employee morale and what kills employee morale and contaminates the culture. This could be a much better place to work if they resolve the true issue, which is poor leadership."
good,"I would say Dish helped me in many ways as for as developing skills, but when it came to the work life balance and thing they where not very forgiving. I was terminated from my job for attendance, because they chose a new attendance system that basically was built to weed out people who had families. It is a company designed for single dedicated people with no children. If you have kids and try an work at Dish they are not forgiving for missed absences due to your children being sick or needing there parents at home."
good,Sell all day in a very stressful environment. It was not very enjoyable and most people wanted to go home after the first hour. They pay good but may not be worth it.
good,Not people friendly. They enslave you and when you commit a small error they fire you right of the bat. They do not recognize your hard work. Pay is not fair for the work done
good,"Installation and trouble shooting at customers home. Provide good commutation skills ."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,You log in before your shift if your a minute late you lose all the extra things you can make money throughout that week. You cant log in too early or you'll be in a aux and get yelled at. They just have a lot of unnecessary rules which makes it a hard environment to work in.managment
good,"long hours on your feet, managers supervisors and leads meetings most of day. no seniority always was work no slowdowns high turnover. Work conditions are good refrigerated air for satellite boxes, bathroom and cafeteria clean most of the time.I'd be there still if not laid off."
good,A good place to get some experience but can't be considered a long term career option. There are some seriously archaic management practices that individually are tolerable but taken in aggregate become unbearable and cause many employees to leave in less than two years. The company is completely unfriendly towards single parents and anyone needing occasional schedule flexibility.
good,"Minijuntas al momento de entrada,aprendí a mejorar la atención al cliente, el supervisor siempre se preocupaba por nuestras metas, los compañeros brindaban apoyo técnico, lo más agradable fué llevar a cabo negociaciones con los clientes"
good,"I have no problem working 50+ hours a week, but at min wage and no one at either location or corporate office can explain the pay scale, its hard to get my paycheck explained when money is taken out or questioned how to make more."
good,"It's a job. Little room for advancement. Culture and people are ok.  Management isn't honest with workers, and you can be blindsided."
good,"At Dish, I take customer service and technical support phone calls. The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to help people find solutions to their problems."
good,"A micromanaged culture, not a lot of trust made it difficult to perform my job function. When leaving the building to perform work at other locations, reports went to Executives to see why I was leaving the office during the day."
good,"Not the best management, and they didnt work with you to much. Hardest part about the job is not speaking other languages and going into dirty homes..."
good,"Good company to retire. Although management takes transformational decisions, but the decision making process is slow and competitors are eating away their share."
good,"Muy poco reconocido tu trabajo"
good,"a typical day was aprox 10 -12 hrs, my imediate managers were good cooperative and helpful. As for the job work orders were often incorrect jobs would take much longer than the time given which is not a problem, but we were not given credit for the extra time. dish wanted us to defrauad the customers with our Broad Band installations by not telling them about the limit of streaming due to data caps and latency in gaming."
good,I learned how to work with mulitiple inventorys daily. I had a warehouse inventory along with 12 van sub inventorys. It was a challenge daily to keep these correct along with doing other daily duties.
good,"For the most part, DISH is a fairly simple job when you first come in. They immediately train you for cosmetics if you're an hourly employee and that's where the high turnover rate comes in at. Overall, I enjoyed dish because of my co-workers. Management treats you like dirt and expects you to go above and beyond with little to no incentive. I'd recommend this place if you like being constantly monitored. And the benefits and pay suck! I still work here because of the schedule and that's it."
good,I made good money but I had no life because I worked to much. It was hard to advance because of politics.
good,"Very disoriented company , constantly changing your metrics and your get penalized for things you have no control over  . Example anyone who calls and want to cancel , u are told to ask them why , noted and then you have to transfer to the cancellation department . You have people calling wanting 20-100 off they bill and that's a transfer to the retention department (loyality).  Now if u get multiple pple who call who wants to cancel then your transfer metric will be in red hurting u and then making u unable to get the monthly bonus. Even though they tell u to transfer they have a system in placed meant for u to fail so you don't get your monthly bonus."
good,A great place to build skills for further advancements. Dish encourages educational growth offering tuition reimbursement.
good,Exciting place to work. Get to see every home game from Chicagos biggest sports teams. Meet lots of new people. Very light workload.
good,"I enjoyed working for Dish. However, It is time for me to move on. I am seeking a career that more closely matches my education and interests. There isn't much room for advancement within Dish at the local level."
good,"On a typical day you are out on your own installing cable television on your own. You have to be out in all types of weather conditions (rain, snow,heat). They send you through a pretty good training program so that you know what you are doing on a job. The management has changed so much I really can't say anything about them. I had great co-workers who were there for you if you got stuck on a job. The hardest thing about the job is learning the different kinds of equipment. I enjoyed that no one was sitting over me watching your every move."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Días laborales muy activos siempre, atención a usuarios de manera presencial telefónico o vía remoto, Solución de problemas toma de decisiones, responsabilidad de que todo funcionara lo mejor posible tanto equipo de computo, periféricos, laptops, Tablet, equipos móviles T3G, etc. Aprendí muchísimo en cuanto a tecnología, sistemas de información, producción y venta, aprendí como se maneja cada departamento ya que siempre tenia relación con ellos de manera constante, La dirección de mi área era general, tenia comunicación constante con las áreas de Infraestructura, Administración de proyectos, Soporte técnico, Administrador de servidores etc, Muy buena comunicación con ellos, Mis colegas o compañeros de trabajo en mi área todo bien, excelentes personas que me brindaron su ayuda desde la ciudad de México, un trato muy amable de manera reciproca muy buena comunicación con todos ellos y me gane su respeto apoyo, orgullo y sobre todo creo que también el cariño de todos ellos, La parte mas difícil de mi trabajo eran las demás áreas, las áreas administrativas, querían realizar malos manejos dentro de mi departamento, ordenes que querían imponer obligaciones ajenos a mi departamento que me querían imponer, en muchas ocasiones quisieron dirigirse a mi persona de una manera un poco altaneros, pero son cosas típicas y diarias o gajes del oficio y mas sin embargo siempre trate de sobrellevar de manera adecuada la situacion con etica y profesionalismo, y por otro lado lo que no me agrado mucho era la poca posibilidad de crecimiento dentro de la empresa, nunca tuve un momento real de crecimiento"
good,"Great teamwork among co-workers, depending on time of day management was good in terms of field managers."
good,Job itself was challenging and provided additional skills.  Horrible benefits; poor management and communication.  Misguided communication.  Random decisions without forethought.
good,"talk on the phone all  day , Loved the job, hated the company policies  and procedures.   "
good,"great place to work and make a career out of it but needs new management skills, and training departments."
good,"Coaches don't coach, daily sales meetings are mostly beat down sessions"
good,Potential to be. Great company. Positions are relative to market standards.
good,Always something to learn.great co-workers always willing to help you out.Management was always changeing.so you didnt no who to go to when things needed to get done out of you hands and on your own
good,I started as a helper working my up which is fine with me.
good,"You show up, do your work, and then you get paid. It's not terrible but it isn't fun."
good,Good company just very poorly managed. It used to be a fun and goal oriented company but since management change a lot of employees have resigned due to leadership.
good,"Aprendi a instalar, hay buen ambiente de trabajo conoces muchos lugares"
good,Long hours. Installers are also sales people. Which i did not like. Management pushes sales. Too much. I signed on to be a installer not a in home sales rep.
good,Great experience selling dish to previous cable customers showing them a better way & different option to accommodate there area or location better. This job had great employers.
good,"Each appointment you’ll be expected to sell something, get a perfect customer satisfaction score and complete it no matter what. You never know what the day has in store, where you’ll be or the people you’ll meet, you go from being at a million dollar mansion one moment to crawling under a trailer at a horrible trailer park the next. The best part is being paid to drive and looking at the scenery between jobs which can be a lot of the day. The job takes truly special determined people as you’ll be climbing an icy roof in the dark to put up a dish in the winter and crawling through an attic where the air is so hot it takes like fire in the summer"
good,"The company has been making a conscious effort to provide competitive benefits consistent with up and coming technology companies. However, visibility is still something that executive leadership prizes and the business always seems to come before the employees."
good,If you are looking to learn the basics of cabling and audio video then dish is great. I really did not care t=for the sales aspect. You are called to repair a issue the last thing a customer wants is to be harrassed by another sales pitch.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Loved the training, loved the job even through tough weather. Disliked being told you had to be a sales person more than a tech. Other techs would directly tell customers if thet werent going to buy anything they werent worth spending time at and would rush through jobs. "
good,"Horario de entrada 9am. y salida 9pm. el 90% del tiempo. Conocimientos adquiridos marketing digital, KPIS gerenciales, desarrollo estrategico de ventas. La cultura laboral amigable. En general es una buena empresa. Lo que me agrado fue los conocimientos adquiridos y la practica de ellos mismos."
good,"Training is poor. They give you some bullcrap videos and powerpoints and expect every single technician to perform at high levels just because the few that figured out the system in their own (not always correct) way. It's unfair and if you ask for help they send you back to handbooks and videos. Their main focus is selling smart home products to customers and if you dont sell then you dont work. Installing cable isnt extremely  hard. It's the houses or simple mistakes that make a simple job become a 6 or 8 hour headache. If you get stuck on something far away from your office dont even bother calling for help because they just expect you to figure it out. Even when you get in a rhythm for like a couple weeks it will get worse. I miss it somedays but then again I do not want to crawl under houses with snakes , be in 110 degree attics or drive 2 hours for a job you cant complete and then get punished for it. If you want good money then by all means but if you hate non sense. Stay away from Dish"
good,Love the people hate the fact that litterally every second of your day is counted. People are constantly getting fired Bc of a point system. Easy with tho
good,Cuenta con muy buenas prestaciones superiores a las de ley
good,"My experiences at Dish do very. After 6 months, I got a promotion to Chat Support with promises of promoting higher within chat and it was amazing, I loved it. That was shot down pretty quickly. After almost 2 years, they ended chat at our site and moved us to a different department with promises of promoting higher after a couple months. Then something happened to cause our customers to not be notified that we had to decline all their tickets and only the original company could assist. No one had no idea what was going on for a couple days. They then demoted about half of that department down to basic tech support on the phone and that is where I decided enough was enough."
good,Overall not too bad of company. But the work culture is non-existent. Good benefits but the health care is not the best. My main issue is how stat driven everything was and always changing systems/took usage without proper amount of time for training for them.
good,They Always rotate management. Hire people with no experience. And lack of knowledge. Fire people with no reason. Just because your earnings are too high. People who want to move on. Need to have a friendly attitude to management and supervisora. They do not care if you are efficient
good,"I'll start by stating it's been several years since I left.  Once you're up to speed the expectations are a bit extreme.  The standards of installation/customer service are reasonable with the exception of the point system.  I was on a points per job system in which they expected you to run so many points per hour.  The issue was they loaded a number of points in a day that was impossible to reach unless you somehow ran almost double their expectation, sometimes worse, so you were sometimes forced to cut corners which affected your pay.  At the point in which I left they added sales as a part of our metrics and cared more about nothing else once launched.  My superior's superior intentionally adjusted my schedule to differ from that which I earned over the years to use as bait over my head so that he could hit his numbers. I found out later he had done the same to other more seasoned techs that in some cases destroyed their family/personal lives.  Ultimately My time ended with an inquiry with HR that went nowhere.  I do not recommend working as a dish tech unless you're single with no kids."
good,"This was a very stressful job.  While direct management was great and supporting, the upper management would not take their advisement and did what they thought was good for company on paper.  No matter how it effected employees.  "
good,"The pay is decent, however the healthcare should be better. There is also no work/ home balance. The overtime is mandatory. You never know what time you will get off work."
good,"This job is great for someone who has no family commitments. I came from a role where my days started and ended the same. Doing this, you might get off at 6 pm, might be at midnight or later, and come winter time you’ll do good to get 35 hours a week. It’s marketed as 4 day work weeks, but when management decides, you go to mandatory 5th days. When on a job if customer will be an hour or two if there is nothing else for the day you are expected to be on site UNPAID on “lunch” break, even if you already took lunch. The trucks are ok, speed limited and annoying road line sensors. The pay is not great but not the worst either. Most of the guys/ girls I work with are good people, but there are a few bad apples in every crowd. Management is laid back unless sales are down. You are pushed to sell. Every. Single. Job. Or you’re not “doing your job” if you can handle the BS it’s pretty much like any other service oriented job."
good,"My Boss was great but work got to much about selling and not customer service.I learned alot of new services but they do not want to pay you more money for it,working with co workers was great untill we could not work together anymore.The hardest part of the job was the trainning for new stuff was really bad.The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the customer and putting a smile on there face."
good,Hard work... hard to succeed in a dying industry. Unruly customers can ruin a day. Often time fixing someone else's work. Working in all weather conditions.
good,"Dish Network is a good  company to work ,company provides good  benefits.I would  recommend anyone  to work for Dish there is a lots of room for  advancement."
good,"Been here for a little over 3 months now, and so far..................."
good,"• I am currently Working as Team lead-Engineer in MYBOX technologies the manufacturer of Digital set top boxes with Make in India platform • Preparing monthly & weekly report, field failure investigation report • Coordinate with all ASC across india & solving quires with maintain data • Handling Service customer call regarding service issues in STBs • Maintain daily service inputs with recording in Data sheet • Maintain all weekly & monthly TAT • Training to clients & ASC of stbs service skills • Testing, trouble shooting with fault finding • Maintain incoming & outgoing data • Able to Soldering or Disordering."
good,"This company was one of those which you hear them talk about how much they care about there employees but their actions speak otherwise. I was in a position that I had planned on staying with dish for an extensive period of time. To cut costs, they outsourced my job to another third party company."
good,"Training for my position was 6 months. Normal call center metrics were not part of the job when I was hired. When I had completed six months of training, they made it a requirement. Normally Okay, but the metrics provided for the position (executive/corporate resolutions) made it almost impossible to effectively do your job and meet those metrics. Without meeting the metrics on a consistent basis, you were not able to promote or qualify for raises. "
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Average company, business declining due to Netflix and other online video channels nobody really wants dish service also when the competing service of Direct TV offers better service at reasonable pricing. Cables companies are still relevant also which makes it another competing business"
good,Upper Management will need to communicate the vision and mission in a more concise way. There are so many changes that the evaluation methods can not keep up.Also some are asked to do more than others and it creates a sense of inequity.
good,"Linkus Techs have to be good in up sales and skilled maintain better than average install times."
good,El tipo de trabajo que ofrecen es muy exigente especialmente con los vendedores
good,Management in the call center was terrible. You had to know someone otherwise you wouldn't advance or get the schedule you wanted.There wasn't any help from any other manager except from the one in charge of your team. Aside from that the job was easy and benefits were ok.
good,"Dish Network introduced me to call centers. It was a horrible introduction. They do not take care of their employees, and the pay is horrible. I would not ever go back to work there. They have a horrible retention rate, because it's a horrible place to work at. They put so much stress on their employees. I would never recommend dish network to anyone."
good,"Working at Dish takes a lot out of you. Physically and mentally and sometimes emotionally.  The job was fun don’t get me wrong but working 10 to 14 hrs and having schedulers across the country is terrible because they send you to locations hours apart from each other.  The supervisors in Southbend, Indiana are terrible.  The company only cares about selling accessories and making quota."
good,"DISH can be very political in how the processes are run, and can be slow to change old systems out with new and improved ones. One benefit is they give those a chance who deserve it and are willing to put people into roles where they may not have any background in people want to try new areas of the company."
good,not bad pay but you will sell your soul for a company that doesnt care about its emplyee's. Benefits arent bad. For employee medical is about $113 a paycheck.
good,"dish will start you as a sale rep the force you in to the retention department, they do not offer raises at all since sales took over retention, where everyone wants to cancel, you become a used car sales man in a sense. it is committion based as well but the company keeps on changing the way it works,"
good,It wasn't a very structured world. Favoritism played a large roll in promotions. There was far to much inter office drama. Standards were higher for some than others.
good,Working at this was very hectic. Hard to find a balance between work and life after. Dish required mandatory overtime with was a disaster. Sales techniques very aggressive
good,"DISH network has very high expectations and it can be difficult to maintain a strong work/life balance. They promoted early and often but when doing so, they often set individuals up for failure."
good,"A typical day was to review billing statements and/or troubleshoot the cable services. Sometimes we had to order remotes and/or receivers.  The management wasn't really fair, I needed to go part-time for school and my school amendment form wasn't accepted. I was told my schedule would be modified if I was in school, that they would work with me on it during the hiring process. I had to resign to go to school."
good,"When i first stared the morale was really high, great, fun place to work.. as time went on, management changed, morale changed, employees changed. Not a fun place to work"
good,"too many managers that all had different approaches...no cohesion.. with so many people on the sales floor, there was too much chaos.. nobody seemed to be on the same page"
good,"If you are coming into a warehouse that has been led into the wrong direction you'll have a tough time but if you come into an established situation it'll be your dream job a lot of time to kill, but like I said if the managers are idiots at what they do then trust me it will be a complete stress job with little to no rewards or recognition."
good,"There are contradictions. There is an active culture of trying to be ""Tuned in"" to the customer. However, required performance metrics do not accurately  indicate how a specific agent is performing to this end. The company is overly numbers based, and weighs heavily on numbers (metrics) that are not an indication of issues being resolved or customer's satisfaction. The metrics exist for these two key areas, but have almost no weight at all in how an agent's performance is rated and judged. And if your numbers are not at or above average, then you are assigned a schedule that may not work for you, and you have no say in the matter. They call it Preference Based Scheduling (PBS) but really, it's performance based scheduling."
good,"I had to talk to people that walked through Costco and had to get them interested in talking to me about switching their cable provider to Dish.  People did not want to talk to me and made hard remarks. Lack of sales, no benefits and very little pay."
good,Dispatch from home we have to be at our first customers by 8.00 a.m.. We are given a very short time frame to get the job completed no matter if we have to reinstall the whole job if it is a trouble call we have 45 mins. to get in and get out if we have to replace certain receivers they can take up to 1.30 to download. The Field Service Manger are good but from the Regional and up are not so great they are always sending emails out about metrics but they won't take the time to look at the routes and the drive time between jobs and the time it takes us to do the job and we get emails with them threatening with our jobs. We don't get the proper training the only thing we get is a deal to read over our work phone. then in the winter we don't get to work 40 hours because it is slow. The management makes the job very stressful all the time because we signed up to install satellite dish network and internet now we are working on washer machines and dishwashers and we don't get paid any extra when we are trained to work on them. The company used to care about the employees and their family's but now they have gotten so greedy they don't care weather you as a employee lives or die.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"You have to want to work hard at Dish. There are no excuses for those that do not want to get very dirty and dig in. Overall, this is a very exciting environment and you get out of it what you put in. "
good,"Empresa de bajo costo, muchas limitaciones presupuestales, y criterios de administración muy cerrados,"
good,If you aren't a salesperson willing to sell an elderly person a 350 dollar soundbar that they don't need don't try to work for Dish because if you aren't making extra sells you will get let go from the company
good,"Did had a good time with Dish when we were starting back in 2007. As the years went on though, the demands went as steep as it could to the point were you felt overused and underpaid."
good,"No room for advancement. 12 + hours per work day."
good,"Dishtv company is a very good dth company."
good,"There is no drive to improve employee knowledge to advance the companies technology. Management doesn't reward you for growing your knowledge about your craft/field. Because of this, production suffers as rooted older people tend to fight newer technologies or ideas brought forth to streamline production."
good,The company itself is very good! The retention part of the job is the hardest as you are faced with negative customers that you need to attempt to keep as a dish customer.  The company rewards the employees who cut corners and save customers without integrity and there is no recourse or reporting for agents who are not correctly doing their job.
good,"Fast-Paced environment and always room for advancement"
good,No estaban bien organizados los insentivos y casi nunca los daban
good,"its a great place to work if you enjoy talking to people, and being in a very fasted paced work location. management was not professional, they played a lot of favoritism. compensation was great, based on performance."
good,"La relacion laboran entre los departamentos no es el todo satifactoria, aun cuando el personal, pone de su parte para la buena convivencia"
good,They are always hiring if you need a job. Swinging door policy. Hard sales environment cut throat but they will hire you on the spot. You will work hard and have overtime.
good,"Dish advises that it is a fast paced environment, but everything just feels rushed from the very beginning.  Even during training, questions and discussion are limited due to time constraints.  The team continuously tells you to ask if you have questions and that they are there to help. But the concern does not feel genuine."
good,Horrible management; promotions not in line with what is best for the team. Plays by the good ol' boy rules. IE it's about who you know and not what you know
good,"Working here was great at first.  I loved the type of work and there was something different everyday.  However, the culture was completely centered around doing the most jobs you possibly could in a day.  I would clock in at 6am and most days not be home until after 9pm.  We were supposed to be working a 4 day work week but every single week I was there we had ""mandatory"" overtime.  This overtime consisted of working 5-7 days a week.  For the entire month of September I worked every day without a full day off.  I left the job because I was never home with my family.  I made a lot of money during my time there.  It just wasn't worth missing so much time with my family.  The opportunities for advancement were very limited just because there were 4 managers in an office with over 30 techs. And the Managers didn't leave unless they were fired."
good,"It was a call center environment. Many customers call angry about the service charges increasing over time and not knowing about it. When companies compete, customers are the ones who are stuck in the middle. Dish did try their best to get employees to buy more services, and in return we would be able to enter into a raffle for prices at the end of the day. The hardest part of this job is receiving angry calls and customers cursing because of the decisions Dish had to make to stay in the competitive level. The most enjoyable part of my job is the co-workers I got to meet. The workplace was always clean and everyone conducted themselves with respect."
good,"A normal workday is calls, calls, and more calls. It is not a bad job. It genuinely is not but it is non stop and very stressful. The company will take the customers side more often than not, which is to be expected. But, it can make the job a lot more difficult than it should be."
good,Okay place to work. Not much room for advancement. Okay environment to work in nonethless workers could get paid a higher wage in shipping and recieving
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Work for dish for a bit but they don't work with you to well and when asked for info they won't tell you in a reasonable time line they need to better train managers to be better leaders
good,"This job is for specific people that can deal with a high stress environment. Definitely not something for everyone, but most of the people are nice. The goals of the company are admirable, but it seems like some of the management doesn't understand the high turnover rate."
good,Some of the managers care about you and your life outside dish but there's one that only cares about the company. There's no say on what you work just hope you better than the person that wants you hours or hours days
good,"You basically just take phone calls all day. Do not get comfortable with your schedule, every month they change. Management is unprofessional and absent. If you decide you need a job until something better comes along this will work. Not much room for advancement. Mornings and late evenings are really light, so harder shifts to get. Second shift time frames more busy so easier to get those shifts. "
good,Very stressful .  Constant ridicule . Rewards included candy. Candy is for kids. Work environment was suited for high school kids.  Calls were graded.
good,Work three years..countless hours.. 7 supervisors during that time..last one laid me off a day before thanksgiving..Did I mention that was the first time I met the guy..they don't care about job quality just how many HDMI cables you can rip people off for
good,"Fun environment most times, however not a good company for people with children. As you are penalized, if you ever need to leave in case of emergency.  Schedule changes sometimes, so can't really plan ahead"
good,"every day is different, you will visit 3-7 customers on an average day.  Starting pay is better now, but still on the low side if you have a family to support.  The standard 4 day work week is nice, but you must work one weekend day minimum"
good,"like being off on Fridays. pretty good working conditions, air conditioned & heated buildings. Yearly reviews. Discount on cable & internet. Well trained supervisors"
good,Enjoyed meeting new customers  while hooking up their satellite televisions.also grateful that I met some really good technicians while working there that also became good friends.
good,"Es una empresa que piensa en la reciclaje de sus unidades, dando mas tiempo de vida, preocupados por su personal operario dando prestamos, facilidades de pago al adquirir sus propios servicios, dando uniformes."
good,"The job was a great job for the time being,it tought new techniques involved in sales. I also gained the ability to rebuttal a costmers problem and help them fund a solution. I left due to policy changes and CEO change. Incentives were taken away and the company had a tier system, creating a stressful environment for both workers and costomers."
good,"DISH is a great place to grow your career if you choose to do so. If you want to learn about accounting and be the next CFO, this is the company to join."
good,"DISH as a company is pretty weird. It opertated like a weird cult. The ""DISH Culture"" is something that people talk about. The internal politics are ridiculous, but when you get on a great team the day to day life of working for DISH fades. "
good,"Dish Network (stylized as ""dish"") is an American direct-broadcast satellite service provider. The company provides satellite television, satellite Internet access, audio programming, and interactive television services to commercial and residential customers in the United States"
good,"Poor Management , but u can learn a lot of things from here .There is low treatment off employees of DIshtv Then the Other Companies of the same group ,"
good,it was boring. very boring... There is not much to say. It was boring. My boss was an idiot and I felt like I wasted my life working there.
good,As a customer service rep sometimes the company set goals that are not realistic. The pay is good but if you could not get a set number of calls in a day or hour they would let you go. Sometimes it is not that simple but that is how they do it.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"My days went fast, I spoke to a lot of people on the phone. Most called in for a problem and I did my best to solve it. Some that called were angry and I would have to turn the conversation towards a positive by the end of the conversation."
good,"The hardest part of working at this company is dealing with management who will not take on advice of the teams that they lead."
good,"Is a good place to work while in school, but with a civil engineering degree, not the place for me. Fast pace most of the time which can be beneficial but very difficult to get days off."
good,The work wasn't hard I enjoyed every day other than days I had to go  up in the office management curses at employees that do anything they don't like and they write people up for anything if they don't like you and want you gone. All my fellow technicians I still talk to almost everyday. Great co-workers just management needs to be wiped out and get some new guys that really care about the office and actually push safety instead of making technicians unsafe by not giving them new tires when they have bald tires with wires sticking out. Was forced to go to Snowshoe a day we got hit with 2 feet of snow in a 2 wheel drive van with bald tires and even had another tech with bald tires in a 4x4 truck behind me that kept going in the ditch and almost hit by truck drivers twice because they couldn't brake. That finished me with DISH I turned my management in Fairmont in for not giving us new tires and making me risk my life time after time there was 3 times total I took pictures and gave them to the head safety guy in the NE and he got me new tires but with a price I was constantly harassed and eventually fired for something they had no proof to.
good,"There is a lot of opportunity for growth in Dish, but it is also very limited."
good,very stressful workplace with to many demands and also want you to be sales rep as well as technician this is definitely a temporary job this job is also physically demanding and i mean very physically demanding
good,"It's not an awful place to work, but do not have high expectations. It somehow feels micro-managed and chaotic at the same time. No job is safe, and advancement is rare."
good,"The atmosphere was very positive, in most cases, however it was the procedures and operations and overall management that, unfortunately took the air out of the sails (metaphorically speaking), also the instability of work scheduling that cause a lot of disarray and conflict..."
good,"Although I enjoy the position itself, it feels that at many times I am no longer selling but rather finding a way to get a willing prospect set up with an account. Many of the prospects are broke with poor credit and we are required to take payment upfront. This leads to a struggle to find the money rather than following a traditional sales flow. The stress of dealing with this type of person imposes high stress levels on most agents."
good,Like I stated above its a factory. Your gonna work long hours and make little money but its a rewarding blue collar lifestyle. We weren't told how much overtime we were gonna get till the day before. overall the company was good to me and i advanced just about as far as i could in under 4 years. Its like anything you get what you put in.
good,Dish offers the ability to learn a lot and have a lot of responsibility.  The people we work around are amazing!
good,"el trabajo es monótono solo salir a ofrecer el servicio de tv de paga "
good,"Though the job was challenging, I believe that this company is not family oriented especially for single parent families whether it is due to deoployment or a breakdown in the family unit.  They believe that you get the shift where you arrive at 5:00 am or get off at 11:00 pm the business would be the most important reason for your shifht and would not be flexible to allow your to get someone to trade time slots.  I felt bad for may people that had to quit because they were unable to be flexible for drastic shifts as most daycares work from 600 am 6:00 pm"
good,"Service Operations , Training technical , soft skill for Karnataka"
good,fast paced sales environment with potential of growth to sales supervisor and or manager
good,it was a ok place to work for they treated there employees good
good,"Un dia de trabajo, llegar a mi punto de venta, acomodar el modulo, prender la tv, empesar a prospectar a los ctes de la plaza, ofrecer bolantes, abordar ctes. Convencerlos de la mejor obcion en television de paga. Y a mejor costo y me jor calidad. Rellenar contratos darlos de alta en el sistema, y reportarlo con mi supervisor las ventas del dia.."
good,The techs are often sent out to homes having to explain the system to customers after there are lied to by customer service. We are the face of the company but have very little security. This company hire and fire people more than any company I ever seen. No consistent working day. Some days you go all the way in and they send you home becaus there are no vans.
good,A typicall day at work is we login start with team meeting 2 days out of the week. start taking calls.
good,"Whole day at work, need represent our calibirity on customer satisfaction. with manages the recruitment function/strategy for the Credit Union;. looks for creative ways to build a pipeline of qualified candidates and is often involved in..."
good,"As a Dish employee, be ready to work 5am to 10pm most days. they are long days but the overtime makes up for the days"
good,its totally about management.
good,I typical day at Dish would start with an abundance of energy. Challenging yourself to stay focused and competing with others to do the best.
good,"The employee benefits here are almost non-existent. Health wise I had a $2500 deductible. Needless to say I am up to my ears in medical bills. Comcast and Directv employees get completely free service. Dish employees get their package free and that's it. I still have a $42 a month bill from equipment fee and taxes and then any extras I want. The work environment is awful. The chairs are mostly broken and run down. If you don't have back problems you will after working for Dish. In many areas of the building there are no windows and they keep the thermostat at a freezing temperature. Bring a parka or a quilt...your choice. Management is on a power trip and helps literally no one. They now push you through a months training and on the phones in 3 days. They push trainees onto the floor before they are even ready. It's a set up for failure. Dish's qa department makes it nearly impossible to get any kind of performance bonus no matter what you're doing right. If you have any kind of personal emergency do not expect any cooperation from this company. I was in a car accident and received 3 no call no shows even though I had a doctors note which they confirmed by calling my doctor, I called in the day that it happened and informed them that I would be gone for 3 days. There was no cooperation. This is just a few explanations for their #1 rating for worst company to work for."
good,Coming to work was an easy process almost everyday even on Mondays . Learned that customers can be difficult when you cant see them. The most enjoyable part was a good deal on cable.
good,A good company for whom to work if one is able to dedicate all time and energy to the company. There are many opportunities for advancement.
good,Work personally with business owners to help develop and maintain their business.
good,A typical work day was great. Workload was ideal. Management had poor communication with direct employees. Hardest part of job is many of the jobs overlapped and when a mistake was made management wanted to put the blame on one person or department instead of correcting communication between management and employees. The most enjoyable part was the hours and fellow employees expressed similar complaints.
good,"En general hay buen ambiente , y mucho tiempo muerto... Poneme metas muy altas para el mercado que es bajo , ya que la competencia les agrada mas a las personas.."
good,Difficult management long hours typically work weekend and holidays. It's a bad enviroment for anyone who wants to advance in their life and it's easy to get stuck.
good,Job was as expected. Days were open-ended and occasionally worked 6 days a week. Pay is by points per job. You earn more money the more you work. Involved going into many customer homes and interacting with people
good,"Mucha libertad pero al mimo tiempo mucha presion, contabamo con mas de 100 vacantes por cubrir y abriendose cada vez mas, habia mucha libertad en cuanto podia ir a reclutar a campo o hacer reclutamiento en oficina, ir a ferias de empleo, bolsas de trabajo, intercambiar carteras, etc, pero era muy dificil la promocion dentro de la empresa y no hace recontrataciones, una vez que sales de la empresa, no puedes volver a trabajar ahi."
good,"Great people to work with --- This was the best part of the job.  That is, the daily interactions with coworkers."
good,"attendance is crucial will work with you for any IT issues. overall good company, training is very good and beneficial. at first you are thrown on the phones but than you get the hang of things fast lots of tools to help you out."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"If you're visiting this page, you're likely here because you're searching for a random sentence. Sometimes a random word just isn't enough, and that is where the random sentence generator comes into play. By inputting the desired number, you can make a list of as many random sentences as you want or need. Producing random sentences can be helpful in a number of different ways."
good,"Managment will have you waste your valuable time with lots of head games which is a huge abuse of power."
good,Great place to work. The training staff has done a wonderful job in training the new hires and setting them up for success. The opportunity of making good money is wide open.
good,"Outdated management styles at the local offices even though they provide training to all managers. ""If you don't like it, there's the door mentality""."
good,"Hard work, but good environment.  Management was not great, but training was excellent."
good,"The overall job is awesome. Fairly easy, does have it's days. Meet new people everyday, troubleshooting was my favorite. I like to use my brain. The only issue was management. They laid off ALOT of techs for not making enough sales, which we are cable techs not salesmen. Which made things harder on us.  Caught my boss sleeping at his desk but yet they threaten your job over sales. Reason why I left"
good,"Working for dish is pretty laid back"
good,"Fun place to work, they typically fed you once a week and always had contests going on, you were expected to sit at your desk 95% of the time and that was rough at times."
good,"I have some mixed feelings on this one. South bend managers were amazing and the work was good dispite being forced to sell to people inside their own homes coupled with long hours, 1 hour commute to and from work, and unfair scheduling. Training was probably the best month of 2018. The chicago training facility knows what they are doing and they have an amazing and helpful staff (not to mention the free food, rental cars, and nice hotel). After training the work was harsh at times and the drive to several different customers sometimes hours apart from eachother was grating but never too much to handle. I really enjoyed my time at dish in south bend. My problems started after I transferred to indianapolis. At first everyone was friendly and my first week or two was full of easier shifts with customers all within 20 mins to an hour away. I was even able to make a few great sales while on the job. Soon after we got back from the final 3rd chicago visit for dishtech advanced training I started to notice the managers pushing me a bit harder than normal and I chalked it up to expectations of a full technician. This was not the case. Eventually shifts got worst and worst with work from out of our district being pushed on me seemingly at random. I was expected to do a multi hour job in less than 40 minutes and not miss anything along the way, all while selling hundreds in junk side merch to the customers I was sent to help. All of this for upwards of 12-15 hours a day. It did not matter to my manager if I was sent for a new install or even for a repair job. The name of the game was"
good,"Upper Management was hard to deal with."
good,"not many position open for promotion, can't expect to a large increase in salary. "
good,"Great Co workers more like a brotherhood, But as a company they would not have such a high turnover rate with employees if they would stop forcing the technician to do smart home sales"
good,"We did not have a locker room or a ping pong table. Hard work and no play at dish network, once a year a catering service will bbq for there employees."
good,"As a new technician working for this company, I am really disappointed In how this company operates. There is a lot of favoritism in this job. they start you off with training which is 5 days a week with an extra day as ""OVERTIME"", but listen this is only during training after the training period. That nice lovely check that you was receiving during training days are over. After training they expect you to sell speakers and high ticket items to your customers which cost about 300 or more dollars per jobs so it can keep there metrics up. if you are not averaging at least 40 dollars a job they will cut your hours, and lie saying there is no jobs when in reality those jobs are going to the veterans. As a new technician, you would think that they would give you a chance to get better but they will lie to you to the point you don't even feel like working for them anymore.  this is truthfully how I feel about the job, when I started the job, I loved everything about it, now its trash to m"
good,"Most of my day involves helping ungrateful customers, who are very passionate about their TV programming. My immediate supervisor(s) are very kind and compassionate, but the management higher up can be very messy."
good,I was working mornings and when they moved me to a different department they changed my hours to nights and this resulting in me having to quit. I attempted to get hours changed but they could not accommodate. I enjoyed the people and the job.
good,"We started at 7:00 AM and worked at least a 10 hour shift 4 days a week.  Climbed ladders to install dish, ran cables to connect to receiver locations as needed that were often to difficult to reach.  Learned to point dish correctly for best reception, how to diagnose reception issues, and best way to route cables for appearance.  The management was good at the lower level but the general manager was known to try to trick employees into safety violations.  Hardest part was coming in from the cold to sometimes extremely hot indoors.  The was not too much that was enjoyable about this job."
good,"good place to work at and work for."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"The environment at Dish was extremely loud and unprofessional.  The pay schedule was very fair when I first started, but then they changed it to salary or commission, and made the sales harder to obtain.."
good,Would not work for them again. The management staff does not seem to care about their employees. There are perks like lunch delivered sometimes and food trucks but commissions are low.
good,"I enjoyed Working for this company. There were great benefits and tons of perks to take advantage of but to start the cons, the displayed “4 days a week” is far from true. I would work a minimum of 6 for the 7 months I was there. Secondly, the expectations for sales are outrageous. On top of having a time limit at each job you arrive at, even once the job is completed you are still expected to sell a minimum of 30 dollars worth of their “smart home services”  AT EVERY HOUSE. And regardless of whether you’re doing every job right or making every customer as happy as they can be, at the end of the day if the sales aren’t there, your management tends to look down on you."
good,"I enjoyed working for Southern Star, INC as a Dish Network Installation Tech. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and learning what my customer's needed to help their experience with Dish Network.  However, the management could have been better. I was expected to hit the ground running like I had been doing this for several years. This was the ultimate factor in me leaving this position."
good,Worked any where from 10-11 hours per night. Fast pace working environment. Rarely had mandatory overtime.  Received two 30 minutes breaks. Company had different food vendors during lunch break.
good,The people are great and what makes the place great. The managers could care less about you. Most of the time they literally do nothing. My manager watched anime all day long.
good,"Great environment, awesome team work. Lots of recognition, but pay can be better. There is opportunity to grow, there is always uptrainings and keeping you up to date with there products and services."
good,"They treat salary employees like hourly workers in a factory. If you expect managers to reward you for your work rather than the amount of time you show per week, look elsewhere."
good,Dish Network is a very good company and has taught me a a lot about cable TV. They have a very good training module which makes it easy and even technical training is easy to grasp.
good,"Dish is a good company to work for, they keep you interested, and they make it be fun.  The coaches is and are there for you they will help you anytime you need it, it you go to them for help they are there."
good,You are treated like a hourly employee expected to clock in and out everyday. You are expected to be in the office everyday even if there is a raging blizzard outside.
good,You can earn good money if you work hard but the job is stressful and often dangerous and you never know when you'll get off. It can be tough to balance your work life and personal life if you go to school or have a family.
good,"Es buena empresa solo que no hay crecimiento, las presiones muchas y los jefes  nuevos o de promoción que solo hay en México dejan mucho que desear"
good,Overall Dish provides a great training program to groom and produce productive managers. Open communication between the departs allows each manger to be able to get the information needed to be successful in his/her position. The training department is always providing continuing education to ensure the company's management team stays up to date and competent. The company's philosophy from the owner was clear and concise.
good,"I'm all for companies that constantly change to meet customers needs. However, at the root of this change, the employees need to know whats being changed and be trained so they can know how to effectively deal with new rules and protocol. the higher up I got with this company, the more hoops i would have to jump through to get an actual answer to questions i had because no one seems to know. and if you get an answer and talk to a different person they will tell you that's not how it should be done."
good,"Benefits and pay are below industry averages, management is spotty at best with only a handful of quality mangers. Work environment was highly stressful."
good,"Worked at dish for over 6 months which is considered a long time for them. They’ll treat you like a zoo animal but my coworkers were awesome. No bathrooms breaks aside from two prescheduled ones per day. If you need more than that this is not the job for you. Constant verbal abuse over the phones. If you complain you’re told to basically quit the job if you can’t take it. Very emotionally and physically stressful, low pay (minimum wage) but you’re basically guaranteed to be hired if you do the bare minimum."
good,They are not the best place to work for but they are not the worst place to work for.  They change your shifts every 6 months and it makes it very difficult when you have a family and kids if you get a shift that doesn't work for you.  They make it very hard to get your shift changed once they have assigned you to one and you don't get to choose your shift or even tell them what will work best for you to work.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,No career advancement tools to enhance skillsets just a stepping stone I’d recommend dish for those seeking call center experience and technical experience
good,"el trabajo es bueno para las personas que les gusta trabajar en campo, lo malo es que les falta mas organización y sentido humanitario con los empleados."
good,"The initial work environment was pretty fun the incentives available the abundance of overtime. You make friends with your coworkers, they make it more fun. Depending on leadership you'll be ok, some leaders aren't fair."
good,"the company promotes its self as a company with a heart for the customer. However working there, it's a 6 minute average call time to spend with each customer, less is even better. Agents are scrutinized if they don't get their call times down low. Even if they are doing everything they can to assist the customer with their issue, to resolve and prevent a call back. "
good,"I had a good experience overall, I've learnt a lot from dish network that surely helped me to develop my skills .I try to learnt positive from everything ."
good,"Dish is a call center. Everyone is management sleeps their way to the top. They don't help people excel unless you have something to give them in return. S$X. if you want to have s$x to move ahead, dish is a  place to be."
good,I used to take calls daily troubleshooting customers issues and taking payments for tv services. Now i train people to do this. The hardest part of the job is the work life balance. They do not care if you go to school. They do not work with you on a schedule that allows you to attend school and still be able to work.
good,"Orders were somewhat disorganized. Physical inventories were somewhat disorganized, these occured every quarter. Lots of responsibilty for my location, as I opened/closed and managed the small team of people at the location. I most enjoyed my coworkers."
good,There are always people needing tv and internet so theres always jobs. Lots of driving involved. Always learning something new and figureing out way to solve problems
good,"Dish is a good company to work for,. We rate fairly high in customer satisfaction. We are always trying to improve our product by being innovative and progressive."
good,"El trabajo es bueno aun que el problema es que no te pagan lo que deberia ser, yo muchas veces llegue a los bonos y nunca me llego nada"
good,"As far as production jobs go, it was a good place to work. Quality and production must be met daily. Dish provides a  clean, safe environment to work."
good,"If you can stick it out, there are good opportunities for promotion with DISH. However, it seems like most of senior leadership was selected to say ""yes"", the more exposure you have to that, the more frustration you may find. "
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, pero mal esquema de comisiones."
good,"un dia de tranajo era bueno un poco pasivo, aprendi a dirijirme mas con el cliente odtuve un poco de convencimiento la presion a lo que nos sometia el jefe era  razonable, lo dificil fue complacer las exigencias de mi jefa cuando habia  dias no se podian lograr, me gusto el aprender mas facilidad de palabre para porder lograr mis objetivos"
good,"dish is ok if you need to put food on the table.fun work, own boss, work in cold and heat.techs come and go. fsm good to work for. om not good to work for"
good,Que los jefes se preocupen por el interes del personal
good,Training was fun and I learned a lot.. unfortunately only 3 of us left from my training class... my best friend is probably moving out of town in a few months... they do provide us with food alot.. we also get a good discount on our bill... that helps a lot
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,It was a good job for someone who really was dedicated and especially wanted opportunities to move up. Moving up was very easy if you worked for it but it also came with additional pressures. Mostly all employees are very nice but the hardest part of the job is being constantly berated by customers and little time off. The best part of the job was getting discounts on Dish tv service.
good,"Take upwards of 40-100 customer service/ technical support calls a day. There is generally no time in between the calls. So, that makes it a very fast paced, and can be some what stressful job."
good,Very stressful both from customers and the job.  There were lots of perks but also had to work for 3 years before given any sick time or vacation time due to date hired.
good,A lot of management had a do as I say not as I do mentality. R though the majority of the staff and him please were great easy to work with much of the management staff and higher level executives were out of touch with the industry needs and the work environment of most of their employees. Work was not difficult however the environment can sometimes complicate or Lengthen your days in drivetime can sometimes be a bit much. The company does Have Room for growth but often these opportunities were given to those that fell in the good O boys club.
good,Responsable. Puntual. Honesto muy rentable.trabajos al 100% en horas
good,After a brief personal break I returned to the BPO world with 24/7 Customer where I was involved in providing technical support. Excelled and won accolades via good CSat ratings. Was associated with the organization for close to 12 months.
good,"Overall, the company is a decent place to work. Advancements are inadequate. Compensation does not align well with the demand of work. Metrics changed to often."
good,The work itself is great. I enjoyed the change from job to job. It was hard work but enjoyed learning the job. The pay is not worth the work most of the time. Management I did not care for. They were arrogant and sometimes just nasty.
good,"I have heard that working for the company of dish network is much better than who I actually worked for.  I installed dish network through a company called Linkus.  We did do satellite installation and trouble shooting, but they also had us do side sales which seemed like they cared about more than actually making the customer happy, or just doing an overall amazing installation."
good,"Early mornings and late nights make this job difficult.  It's a great hourly job, if you're willing to work 50-60 hrs per week. If meeting new people daily, and find ways to overcome obstacles is what you're looking for, this could possibly be the right fit for you. Management could be better, it seemed to me as though they were always burnt out. If you decide to apply for a technician job, make sure that you're a decent salesman, because that seems to be the way this company is going. Monthly sales goals can be hard to meet,  and if you don't have strong sales, this may not be the job for you."
good,El es quema de comiciones es muy bajo y no es lo q busco
good,"Very fast paced, good opportunity to make uncapped commission and some opportunity for overtime. "
good,"Dish network and its subsidiary Sling TV, both provide a number of positives, including good benefits and the ability to advance and shift departments as needed, along with a supportive and skilled training staff. However, the culture of the management levels of the company can make many feel stifled or punished for trying to live lives outside of the company, with increasingly unreasonable schedules (changed weekly or monthly, often resulting in chaos and long stretches of days reaching up to 6 ten hour days in a row) can make it hard to make the place a long term workplace."
good,It was your typical call center position. Dealing with irate customers 90% of the time. I learned a lot about deescalation. They did try to empower the employees with certain perks or events.
good,Hard work and you dont know what time you get off work.its hard to move up in the company with pay and management.you have three day off thats one thing i liked.
good,I enjoyed working here because it was the first adult job I have had. When I was there I thought it was great but after working in different places I realized it wasn't as good as I had thought.
good,Great Place to work for the employee with Home pickup & Drop Facility provided by the company. Salary package is very low for the freshers. However you have a great opportunity to work with Zee Network.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Me gusta estar siempre en movimiento, tratar con la gente y darle al cliente la mejor atencion posible."
good,"Very Click oriented & if you are not in you wont advance"
good,"The overall experience at DISH was great, I worked with some wonderful people and have made lots of friends. They train you extremely well for the job but, when it comes to management they are lacking. Management doesn't understand that life happens (i.e sick, kids sick, car broke down, etc.) they will immediately dock you a point for even being 5 minutes late and once you reach 5 points they will fire you with no hesitation. Benefits were okay and your schedule stays about the same after the first 90 days, in the beginning it changes several times a you go through different training sessions."
good,Overall its ok. The work is fast pace and challenging. Managers train and help you as much as they can. Benefits are good but bonuses and incentives are almost impossible to get. Route scheduling is a nightmare an be ready to rive all over the place for no reason. The policies change constantly and they usually make it harder on the employee.
good,"Gran empresa pero el modelo economico que quieren llevar acabo es muy deficiente."
good,"Each day you are bombarded with phone calls of the most unpredictable nature, you could end up being someone's best friend or worst enemy. Management doesn't seem to care about their employees as they are never around and don't seem to be interested in your future and investments. You do not get much choice in what you want at DISH as they will make the choices for you."
good,"like any other job it has its ups and downs management is ok until you get to the higher ups, job is pretty well easy no one bothers you,an like most places they are all about numbers"
good,"Management overhired technicians and starting let go employees for random reasons. If you were honest, they let you go. If you broke policy, they let you go. You went to work and wondered if you had a job or if you were going to be sent home. Benefits were awesome with the company along with the pay."
good,"great and fast work enviornment                                                                                 "
good,"The job was an easy job, but there weren't alot of opportunity to grow. A typical work day we come in get set up to work some days we knew the number of receivers we needed and hour some days we didn't. The communication between the shift managers, superviors, and team leads down to us was very poor. I learned that there wasn't any real opportunities there and that regardless of what youre told before you go into a job you may not get all of the truth. the most enjoyable part of my job at Dish were my coworkers."
good,Good pay and vacation. Good co employees to work with. Horrble management. Company sets goals to high and changes and added more to the job title with no pay compensation.
good,Easy money. Come to work on time. Try your best. Get paid. 10 to 12 hr work days. Four days on three days off. When your tenure (time on) increases. It will be three off days straight. Every wk. The company is ever changing btw as it should be to continue to be relevant in a very competitive industry. Can suck. But its the truth of business.
good,Dish has a competitive product and good employees. The culture of the company needs improvement. This is proven by the high churn the company experiences.
good,"Very much a culture of ""focus on your job"" and keep your head off upper management's radar. Too willing to cut corners and make ethically questionable decisions to increase productivity."
good,Very corporate minded.  Excellent place to learn technical trouble shooting for video.  Management is hands off.  Co-workers must be high energy and self sufficient.  Hardest part of the job is finding support.  Most enjoyable part of the day is having the customer say thank you.
good,"Dish is an excellent company to get your foot in the door and get the experience you need. I wouldn't consider this the place you'd want to work forever, but a really good start. Although there are great managers in place, they are very limited by their executives. Appreciation and advancement opportunities are rare for most, regardless of how hard you work. I plan on gaining my experience at this Fortune 200 company before moving on to bigger and better things."
good,"Could have been better with a better management team, especially our Senior Manager. Corporate Management did not care about their employees unless it benefited them one way or another."
good,lies and steals and cheats. they try to kick out our union and drop our pay from 40 hr to 14 illegally. They are always lying and trying to be corrupt
good,"ambiente poco favorable, desvió de responsabilidades por parte de los directivos"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Loved my coworkers! Hours kinda stink when you start.Benefits are horrible. Cool leaders. Clear job guidelines and what was expected of me.
good,"Was probly the third best I job I ever had (not including the military). You would go out and work 12 - 14 a day and come back to the office and could enjoy time with your co-worker (had a pool table in the warehouse). And that was taken away, and it became only about business, even when we as a office reached the top position. That changed the moral of the employees, so the turn over rate at the job became a problem. Had great field employees, but some bad office managers. And that's all I would say."
good,"un día normal en el trabajo es estar bajo presión, aprendí mucho de la empresa a desarrollar mis habilidades en campo y en conjunto con la gente a mi cargo, la dirección fue un poco mala en algunos aspectos, mis colegas siempre aprendí mucho de ellos, y lo que mas me gusto es que aprendí mucho de como saber llevar a un grupo de personas a logros tanto profesionales como personales."
good,Hard to work with fired me for new GPS system taking me to the wrong address and since las vegas is a right to work state i had no chance at contending the accusations
good,"Buena empresa, pero el tiempo que trabaje en ella les faltaba mucho para poder dar libertad a los supervisores para poder desarrollar el puesto ya que diario se tenia que salir a ruta con un vendedor, descuidando ese día a los otros vendedores y a los promotores."
good,"Dish was a good place to work. The metrics that are applied to techs are unreachable, but the staff is great and the work environment is ok."
good,"Installing and training customers on new satellite tv."
good,"Aprendi cosas que nunca pense que iba a conocer me refiero a la instalacion de sistema de cable satelital que nunca pense que fuera una gama de información como que inclinación debe tener la antena para que pueda bajar señal, la acomodación perfecta de cables  y conectores, esta es en cierta parte lo que mas me intereso de la empresa donde trabaje-"
good,"This job is for single people who don't have any kids. You can work the regular 40 hours a week and make 700 a week, but they will take some if you make mistakes which is really easy to do."
good,"With no consistent wages across the company - wages and salaries are based on cost-of-living analysis in the area where a call center is established - Dish Network maintains its commitment to keep its customer costs low by diminishing the value of those who work for the company. The hours, even for those who have worked their way up the chain of command, are ridiculous for anyone hoping to achieve any sort of normalcy with a family. One might think Dish would compensate employees who must face the vagaries of an ever-changing schedule with better pay, but such is not the case. My call center started at $10/hour, while others around the country range anywhere between $8.50/hour and $15/hour."
good,"Company culture no female friendly on technical side. Less than 5% of employees I worked with were female and the few that were seemed very miserable in their jobs and did not last long in their positions. NOT a place that values input from employees to better the company, NOT a place that values intellect and experience outside the company to be promoted."
good,Having to do any call center CSR job can be stressful. Being around so many people in the environment also can cause you to get sick easily. I decided to drop this job because for 2 weeks I got strep then my voice just went out and decided to go back to school.
good,"It was all about the numbers, with incessant changes in procedures from corporate, making job more difficult than it needed to be. Loved the work, speaking to customers from across U.S. from all social strata. Best co-workers I ever had."
good,"Maintain stock in service vans, daily count for reports, Unload merchandise Put counts in computer and restock all sections as needed for next day."
good,"A typical day at work involved answering and addressing multiple emails and internal communication requests, both internal and external to the department; processing and editing payroll; developing and distributing productivity reports; conducting team meetings; delegating and distributing assignments for working orders and addressing internal chat requests; working one on one with individual agents, developing current skills, addressing attendance or policy issues and focusing on resolving any current complaints; resolving escalated issues from customers; and clarifying best practices involving order types for agents."
good,"The group I worked in provided a lot of opportunity to work on a variety of projects and to gain hands-on, on-the-job training.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the variety of work.  "
good,Dish can be a very good company to work for however it seems there is little upward mobility. Co-workers are fun and energetic
good,"A typical day was to receive my work order for the day, and load my van with inventory needed.go out and greet coustomers and show them my plan of action for the work I was going to do , for the Dish satellite installation. using tools provided by company I drilled , bolted , ran cable wire, crawled in attics and under floors, I loved what I did , because I made the customers happy and I was like my own boss and was proud of the work I did, the bad part was being on  a pie scale by the company, forced to make sales, do unsafe work ( they said to work safely and the training was a good experience throughout the company ranks , but you were in trouble and your job was threatened constantly if your numbers were not on point, I had great customer feedback and they would also get threatening if you turned down an unsafe job. My first manager Trey was great and then was replaced by Herman who had a personal problem with me for some reason , because I really got a good attitude and try to always be a team player, so I don't get it? miss doing the job though."
good,"I enjoy the job & helping others. I believe that my true strength is in Customer Service. My job requires many hours of sitting and taking incoming calls with stats that are unreasonable, for anyone. Loyalty Department handles the calls and wants to save every customer. In regards to management, it seems like they forgot what its like to take care of the employees and the customers. The sick time and the attendance policies, really needs revision. They lost perspective."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"I really don't have that bad of an opinion of the company overall. However, there is a ""what have you done for me lately"" mentality with dish. As they say on the mob movies you are only as good as your last envelope. It would be better if they taught more advanced sales techniques to the field service specialist. The job itself is good, demanding at times.. Your work day starts @7:30 am goes until the last job is completed. There are times when you will work 12+ hrs a day. You may work holidays too depending on what shift you  are on. The other guys you work with are for the most part friendly and helpful.."
good,"In a typical day, there is always more work to do than time"
good,"Es un empresa de tele comunicaciones, donde se dedicaba a regrabar los aratos y dejar las en buenas condiciones para así volverlas a regresar al cliente."
good,"DISH is a Good company to learn customer service skills from as they heavily stress the importance of offering the customer the best possible experience with their frontline agents. The Atmosphere at the call centers is fast paced, friendly and competitive. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the changing goals and focuses of Upper Management."
good,A typical day is answering phones non stop and doing it all within a certain amount of time.  My coworkers were great.  If you start doing well they look at you like you are cheating. The hire people to keep the numbers up but hire people who can not pass the entrance test.
good,Dish requires a lot from an agent. They have high expectations that often can not be met by individuals who properly do their jobs.
good,It is a fast job.  Good co workers. Many days unsupervised. many tasks to fill the day. Good people to work with.
good,"Typical day at Dish was being on the phone for extended periods of time. Customer range from content to extremely aggravated, part of my job was to calm those customer down. I had a 90% save rate on customers that were calling into cancel their account.  I assisted customer in setting up new accounts, moving existing customer to new locations and cancel account if needed. Also assisted customer in billing/equipment questions, and technical troubleshooting."
good,Decent place to work ups and downs but overall decent. Peak season can be a lot but it is worth it.
good,"I learned lots of thing in this company because it was my 1st job."
good,"The rules are changing per se; when a team loses a person, his/her duties are re-assigned to the rest of the team and the management is not willing to fulfill the position. The co-workers are friendly at the most of the time; however, some of them are not afraid to stub a knife in your back. Luckily, there are just a few people like that I faced personally."
good,"Dish network is understaffed, and isn't following proper safety guidelines for their employees."
good,"door to door sales"
good,"The job consisted of answering billing questions, and trouble shooting receiver issues."
good,"DISH is a growing communications company that fails to communicate within the organization. The bad thing about the workplace is lack of consistency and lack of leadership.  Depending on your position, growth is very limited.  You can work hard for years but remain in the very same spot.  As an ISP its bad, you are the bottom of the bottom.  For all of the work and demands they put on you, you get paid little."
good,"Driving around Install Satellite dishes on customers homes. You'll spend most of the day climbing up and down ladders with satellite dishes, wiring, and about a 20-30 lbs tool belt."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"A typical day at work is loadind /unloading trucks and pulling orders. I learned to improve my skills every day by learning something different. Management is fair, but can be sterio typing employess. Co-workers show good teamwork skills. I do not find nothing hard about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing you had no mistakes at the end of the day."
good,"ok place to work, discount satellite TV"
good,On my feet 12s hours a day with very short breaks and doesnt pay very well
good,"Dish can be a rough place to work especially if you have kids and working on 1st shift. Hours are 5am-3:30.  Pay is descent 10.75. Management is ok but Ray white is the worst and doesn't care about the employees, Charlie Ergen either. Breaks are way too short for 10 hour shifts. And they need to offer more OT opportunities."
good,It paid the bills. It had unrealistic views on vacation and personal time even though you had it to spare.
good,"They hire anyone that is a veteran, even if they have know idea what they are doing."
good,"The classroom training is great and you learn a lot, but the field training, at least in my case was awful, I didn't learn anything from my trainer and by the time I got out on the field on my own I really had no clue what I was doing."
good,"near the end of my time here corprate changed the reqired goals that needed to be maintained in a stanard call center setting, added some new ones, then made the policies so it was near impossible to meet these goals, alot of people, myself included, are no longer there because of this"
good,"too much work for the pay and managers were horrible. he people are very cranky and ""as expected"" customers are extremely rude"
good,"Physically demanding activities, heavy objects lifting. Down to earth co workers."
good,"There is no such thing as a ""typical day"" at DISH Network. Of all the places I've ever worked, it was my least favorite. I was good at my job, but the job wasn't good to me, nor to many others. The pay scale is not what it should, or could be, and the benefits are laughable. You pay so much for so little. With a large corporation like DISH, they should either pay for your benefits, or at least get plans that are worth paying for. The scheduling is what it is. You have to be available 7 days a week, including holidays- NO EXCEPTIONS. For people with families, this is certainly difficult. They also like to implement what they call ""Mandatory 6th Day"". Yes. MANDATORY. They make you work an extra shift a week. This is a driving factor behind being voted the worst company to work for in America."
good,"Management was very poor. When something went wrong, I did not know who to contact. I did not have a manager directly above me. My job was to get Dish Network sales while staying inside of the boundaries the store provided for me. That was the only guidance Dish Network would give me towards sales."
good,great work place but the management was a bit demanding about things the employee could not control
good,"wonderful coaches, co-workers--is reason why I have stayed so long with company but the benefits are not helpful for a family , they are unflexible for anything , any reason and at any time , i enjoy talking to technicians and customers about accounts and service."
good,"Overall this company is decent as a whole. It needs improvement but I have remained loyal to them as they have taken care of the employees. After hurricane Ike damaged our call center, we were unable to work for 2 weeks. Dish paid us our 40 hours even though we didn't actually work. No other company did this. It is hard to balance life and work at the company but when they take such good care of you when it counts, it's easy to move past that."
good,"Dish Network has figured out how to provide the best service possible to those who subscribe to their services and are changing to become the best possible employer as well. Dish was recently voted the worst place in America to work by GlassDoor. Since then they have made a lot of changes to try and improve the working environment/culture in their organization. Despite having a long way to go, they are making progress."
good,Pros: Let's you move around different teams to learn a lot
good,• Install satellite dishes on residential and commercial buildings for customers.
good,"l ambiente era padre y mas por que trabajaba con unos primos que me invitaron a laborar con ellos y yo acepte por que mi objetivo era conseguir dinero para seguir estudiando, y la parte mas dificil del trabajo era trabajar en las alturas y bajo los rayos del sol pero solo un rato."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Dish is a fairly decent company to work. You are granted 3 off days with pretty good pay.
good,the company was good to work for. It was a fast paced environment. I enjoyed working with the customers and teaching them how to use the satellite system.
good,I get to work always ahead of time to plan my work day.I enjoy interacting with my co-workers but don't keep track of my duties.I love my schedule since I start very early but can leave very early as well.
good,At first I loved this place was fun work place great co-workers. When I first started my area was wonderful great supervisor wonderful friendly co-workers dress code was very relaxed always had movies and ppv's going on when we went on break they had pool tables foosball games you could get on the computers it was just a wonderful work place they were more worried about the customers issues there wasnt really a time limit to be on the phone with a customer as long as you helped them but in a matter of a monthe or two everything changed they were more worried about call times than customer help if you were on the phone for more than 5 min they would start rushing you to get off and then get onto you for not rushing through the call just wasnt fun enjoyable anymore and it was interfering with school because my hours and they where adding extra mandatory days and didnt care about your school schedule.
good,"- Helping customers with programming, technical support."
good,"The individual office was excellent, however the culture from the top down was lacking vision and ethics."
good,I worked there for a bit over two years and the biggest issue I had there was the low wage and the forcing of upselling products to customers. The work to home life was also way out of balance. The customer service side of the job I actually enjoyed for the most part and the management staff was decent in trying to look out for you.
good,Otorgar unidad para realizar supervisiones en campo
good,"Visionary company - tough, but rewards you good.  Dish is growing into the 5G and leaving set up boxes behind.  There is a lot of great people to work with.  Always create your own climate."
good,"DISH is a company that strives to excellent work, but at the expense of the life in work/life balance.  If you're willing to sacrifice the life outside of work you'll go far."
good,Operations based on points per hour but travel too much to maintain consistent pph and for lower than expected compensation. Had many 15+ hour days with hard to meet bonus requirements
good,Trabajo estresante por las metas mensuales y las malas evaluaciones de los supervisores que catalogaban los trabajos
good,"I would not recommend this job unless you like to sale.Thats all they care about. People can screw the job up but if they sale they get a pat on the back."
good,Low wages for dealing with stressful clients all day. They did provide loads of training which was above and beyond compared to other places. There was very strict criteria to prove how productive you were every day but the supervisors did a good job making sure you had the tools you needed to be successful.
good,"The work is hard. It's not for most people. Your job is 50% being a tech and 50% being a salesman. You have to sell sound systems, HDMI cables, Google nest products ECT to get promoted and get bonuses. Some days you'll work 9 hours, others 12+ hours but only work 4 days a week."
good,"Good learning experience, you will gain a lot of valuable learning experience working there. No paid bonus here but noticed salary is a bit higher than other companies in greater DTC area."
good,Get a route everyday for new and old customers for installing or fixing satellite tv systems. Your day starts at 7:15 on your scheduled days and work until all jobs for the day are complete. This is a very social type job as you meet new people everyday and provide top notch customer service and state of the art equipment for peoples entertainment. The hardest part of the job is some of the physical aspects like getting in crawl spaces and climbing ladders. The best part of this job is knowing that when you finish and the customer is just overwhelmed with excitement for giving them a great experience.
good,I enjoyed working at dish however it was very stressful and I could no longer afford to live and work once I had my kids and I never saw my son do to weird hours
good,"I never felt pressured or under stress, environment and staff were all amazing! If You never experienced a call center, this place might be the perfect place for you!"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"As an RSO at Dish TV it was a very good opportunity to learn to interact with people, drive the service team to finish their SLA in time, be productive to achieve the monthly target etc.,"
good,Salary wasn't sufficient. they don't pay in time. I can't find my salary at the right time. And to give me different pressurized in the workplac. That's it.
good,"Dish has one of those stressful job I had, its not because its customer based but also because some things were not seen fairly to the employees. for eg. if there is a takedown we had to to hear all sorts of tantrums from the cast and if we would get bad feedback it would also on us. this kind of things made me dislike dish. Other thing also because of dish I am here today, so I will always appreciate in dish for teaching me for what I am today."
good,"Not a bad job - but if you're going to work in a call center try Comcast first. It's almost impossible to move up if you start at frontline, and they understaff to the point that they will have your phone ringing off the hook for your entire shift"
good,"Benefits are amazing, job itself is stressful.There is a disconnect between corporate expectations and what is realistic. If you were 5 minutes late because of traffic they would take 4 hours of your PTO. That being said opportunity for advancement was amazing and you can move up very quickly if you work hard."
good,"If your not a remote, it’s worse. I didn’t become one until 6 months after( due to my branch merging with another). In the interview they tell you that they’ll be mandatory overtime basically working another day. Which many of us agree to, but then it turns to 14-15 hour shifts 5 days a week. For a person who doesn’t mind a heavy workload this wouldn’t be a bad job."
good,"The best thing about working there was the ability to ask for days off 2 weeks in advance. When I joined DISH they said we'd be judged based on our own performance, but then they switched it and judged as a group.  No raises for 2 years. Didn't feel appreciated."
good,"Overall it is a decent place to work. However, I'd make sure customer call center is a profession you'd want to be in. Some of those calls do get rough."
good,"I used to love my job because I felt their employees mattered but they have made so many changes in the last couple years, it is blatantly apparent that is not the case anymore so I am moving on"
good,"This can be fulfilling if you like to talk on the phone and are comfortable with that."
good,"Management isn't the best, There are some good supervisor's, but overall the management was limited to what they could do to employees. Corporate has final say in many issues. Fellow employees come to work high and management looks the other way. As long as the employee is there. that's all that matters.THe pay is decent to start."
good,"- Start up meeting with team, Pass on daily updates if there are any from Management. Management gives daily process needed for the day. Work place culture is in the process of changing. Hardest part of the job is the hours, the enjoyable part of the job is working with the team."
good,It was a great start to the sales environment. But goals were unrealistic and the hours were long. Good training classes and great people for the most part.
good,working for the el paso site you will meet some genuine people but with the barrage of  calls and no real breaks in between what u have on your schedule it can get intense.
good,Some great  employees. few great managers. lack of respect or confidentiality.  Boring trainers and boring training. half of the equipment didn’t work some of the time. Helpful stress free rooms. Sometimes not the best customers result in upsetting calls but the atmosphere helps relieve stress in many ways.
good,They have metrics that are measured and they can stop the call volume for an agent not to get calls which the agent need call volume to be able to perform in good standing with the company.
good,"Your work performance doesn't matter as much as sell customers additional products or services that they sometime don't even need. You a pushed to sell $28 dollar per work order, and when you make that goal it will increase."
good,"I liked the hours, working four 10 hour days made it easier to schedule thing and easier to enjoy time not at work. What wasn't great was the customers. They leave you feeling drained and the experience overall feels empty. If there were more advancement opportunities that were non customer facing, it would be a better option."
good,"A typical day is coming in and exercise and making sure that you get work and do exactly what they say. It is also where you have to look at a receiver,"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,A typical day at work involves taking high volumes of calls. Company has a high turnover rate and there is no job security. Compensation and benefits are decent.
good,Oportunidad en crecimiento y de aprender actividades nuevas
good,Day-to-day work can be a bit stressful which is why the give you four - ten hour work days. But I found that after the fourth day I essentially couldn't do much on my first day off because I was so sore/exhausted. I learned a good bit of hands on technician experience. The management set some unrealistic goals and there were multiple times I felt like my only options were do the job quickly and get reprimanded on my poor procedure or do the job correctly and get reprimanded on taking too much time. The culture is ultimately why I decided to leave. There really isn't much of a culture at Dish. But I enjoyed the technical aspect of the job like running cables and installing the boxes.
good,"It's a good place to work. I learned how to install cable and satellite dishes, the management was nice, the hardest part of the job was fitting into tight/cramped spaces."
good,"The job was ok. You had freedom being out on the road, going to different homes in different towns and cities. The pay was the big issue with me. Just wasn't enough to live comfortable with a family. Only way of moving up was becoming a manager after maxing out in pay as a technician."
good,"A typical day at work was clock in at 7 in the morning to be out of the shop by 8 after the meeting and stocking the vans. After you leave the office to go on your route. You will complete the jobs assigned to you and possibly get more added depending on customer calling in or not. After all the work has been completed, you drive back to the office and count your van, turn in all needed paperwork and go home.  The management seemed like they did not communicate well with one another. The hardest part of the job is doing outside work in 100+ degree weather. Most enjoyable part is seeing the customers appreciative at all the hard work put in."
good,"I was not super enthusiastic about the pay or the management. if you get in to the Retention department you will make good money but as a tech rep you will make less then 14/hr, most of the management that I dealt with personally were less then I wanted to see. Several of them, most that no longer work there, were good managers and cared not only for there people but for the future of those people. Now granted the health and dental benefits were not the greatest but they were enough as long as you don't need/want any mental assistance. They do have good 401k and stock benefits and the options that they give you to buy those options, and they do offer a lot of different ""employee days"" where they will offer food or some other little day of things. I still have friends that work there but I know that I will never work there again if I can help it"
good,Great environment. Lots of incentives and games. Always an opportunity to learn. The pay and benefits are great. Management is unstable and gets swapped alot which could cause you to feel left out.
good,"No work / family balance, be ready for shift bids every 2 months, inconsistent schedule and work on weekends. If they offered a part time or a more flexible schedule like a 30+ it would be great."
good,My pay and benefits at dish were great but it felt as if you were always replaceable. Large classes of new hires cause for high turnover and a feeling as if your job was never safe. If your stats were good it was a great place to work but if you had a bad period it seemed as if they were looking for reasons to get rid of you
good,se realizaba gestion de cobranza donde se buscaba recuperar al cliente realizando una reconeccion de su servicio de tv satelital o caso contrario se buscaba la recuperacion del equipo si el clliente ya no deseaba contiuar con la empresa dish
good,"Dish Network is a company that has many opportunities for people to move up.  However, the stressful nature and demands of a call center can cause stress about job security. In addition, management is inconsistent as there are coaches that will help you with the stress of a call center and some that will add to it. Working with a team with good leadership is essential to longevity within the company and promotion."
good,This is a good place to start in the cable business and/or customer service. They had a good training program when starting and good benefits such as free service.
good,"gives you opportunity to learn a lot but management isnt very great"
good,"a job you take when you havent finished school and need to make decent money quick, full time lots of overtime decent pay, when i worked last year they really pushed for the satellite techs to do more sales which seems unreasonable especially in urban areas. seems like lots of freedom working on your own but managers constantly call you and show up randomly at job sites. lots of pressure to do good installations and make sales."
good,Its a good job if your starting to work at call center. They have Overtime at time and great to take it. overall i would say its a good job. if you like being in one place for a couple hours than this your job.
good,"Do not expect to be working in a clean and predictable work environment, the work can be hazardous but you are compensated well for the work. Meeting interesting people and being able to have conversations with customers is great. long hours and tough working environments are gonna be very common so be prepared."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Enjoy the work and installing systems but being forced to sell Smart Home products is not what I signed up for. Being promised Sundays off after Training for Samsung Appliances and then having that taken away, very disappointing."
good,Working at Dish Network as a Line of Business developer is fun and challenging. Corporate culture is disconnected from our team and direction can feel lacking. Development team is hard working and cooperative with each other. Team can be overloaded with work due to product maintenance.
good,"they had a food available"
good,It was fun working with dish I enjoyed the customers the most I enjoyed the challenges of the installs always something new to learn really Sparks your creative side
good,"El ambiente  y el trato de tú súper visor excelente, buen acomodo de horarios para que no confluyan con los estudios."
good,"Dish is a great company to work for but from a personal experience and opinion the longr you work for the company the more you become just a number. Rather you are doing well and hit your numbers for the week or if you have a bad week and dont, you arent seen as a good or top agent unless you make yourself know around the entire call center,"
good,The training is good. Support while out in the field could be improved. Some of the weekly training is alright. Expect to work long days and stay busy on your feet all day.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, sin problemas recomiendo"
good,"Inbound calls"
good,Muy buen trabajo me gustaba salia a ligares retirados por días con biaticos
good,Pues bien buena comunicación con compañeros y jefe
good,"Very fast paced, they want you off the phone and with the next customer as soon as possible. It was hard to build rapport with the customers if you rsh them."
good,"Es una empresa enorme y muy responsable lo cual la convierte en una de las mejores para laborar en ella si fuera pareja, ya que sus sueldos son muy pero muy bajos y se premia al area de reclutamiento por contratar nuevo personal lo cual hace que constantemente esten corriendo gente para tener vacantes, y como lo hacen? pues sencillo ofreciendo un salario que me parece incluso denigrante y enamorandote con excelentes comisiones que nunca te pagan."
good,"Se trabajaba bien, haste Que se transformó. De ser gestor de cobranza a repartidor de comida."
good,"The scheduling was terrible. We were often understaffed and forced to work mandatory extra days. At other times, we were forced to have our hours cut."
good,"I worked in Dish's Tulsa call center. It was my first call center job, and they do a great job of training you. The pay is competitive for the area, and the benefits are on-par. Your schedule is the worst part - it changes on a rolling basis, but most people don't seem to end up with exactly what they want (as would be expected), but there's no way of getting a permanent schedule change if needed. Similarly, most of the issues at Dish come from prioritization of corporate rules instead of figuring things out on a case-by-case basis"
good,Was a technician but seemed more like door to door sales. In their eyes they want you to sell sell sell. And must explain why you could not sell something at every job i go to.
good,"Es bueno el entorno, falta capacitacion, informacion de tus jefes inmediatos, falta de comunicacion"
good,"Enjoyed my job, a lot of org changes caused a lot of concerns on job security. A lot of benefits and before all this the culture was great, really enjoyed my job there"
good,This was one of the physically toughest jobs I've worked. The winter is brutally cold and you spend the majority of your time outside. The summer is oppressively hot and you spend the majority of your time outside.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Dish is kind of a failing company. as such they have to constantly make changes. people are hired and fired on a regular basis, not just regular employees, but on the manager level to. there is a nice famly feeling at the local level though. your manager and other techs realy try to help you out when they can."
good,"empresa independiente que le trabajaba a dish,tu pones tu horario y los dias que deseas trbajar, conoces mucha gente."
good,"A typical day at work is to come in, clock in and review your route, and get any pertinent information from management. You finish your route, and check with front office to clear for the day. Most of the time, there is another job waiting to keep you late. Helping the other Techs is cool, but staying late to take on more work gets old after the first two or three months.I learned some thing about satellite TV(of course), some retail sales tips and tricks, and even though we are not salespeople, they come in handy. Management is pretty good about getting you what you need to succeed at work, but sometimes it feels like it's all about numbers, and that coupled with the killer hours can wear you down. The workplace culture is positive, but it's go time all the time. But they do take time to do things for the community. The hardest part of the job would be the long hours on top of the extra days. But if you like ""over""-overtime, this is not a problem for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the other Techs."
good,"Dish expects you to put 100% in to your job, but they do not do that for their employees.It always feels like your job is in jeopardy. It never felt like you were on a team."
good,"The schedule is a 4 day 10 hour shift, but it usually ends up being over the normal 10 hours.   Most months techs are required to pull two or more overtime days which can make it really hard to balance work and personal life,  especially  if you have a family.   You are required to be a salesman as well as a tech which can be pretty aggravating, especially when there is more focus on sales than there is the actual tech portion of the job.   It gets annoying after spending 4+ hours on an install and you're hot,  sweaty and dirty then you have to try and sell some product that someone else from another department has tried to sell to the customer when the install was contracted.   I was told about  the sales part during my interview but had no idea that the focus on sales would so vastly dilute the tech side of the job.  Continuous software and hardware issues make for a nightmare during installs and repairs and the lack of communication with sales center and customer adds a tremendous amount of extra work and headaches for the techs in the field. "
good,"All employees are to perform on an enterprise-level and be ranked periodically sit down with their coaches weekly and discuss in detail processes to become better agents to assist the customers better, the training is erratic many agents tell customers one thing customers have to call back and get told something different from another agent, the company only makes money off existing customers for years but treats new customers better, agents aren't taught properly how to assist customers when they call in upset for every issue and waste customers time placing them on hold to get help through te chat or jabber instead of having help right there, specific agents are only required to handle specific callers needs otherwise causing callers to be transferred around the department and further upsetting them, when you think you're doing really good in the company and making more than fifty customers per day happy the company fires you to make room for more new hires, I will not recommend dish to any of my friends are family.  saying that this is a company with a extremely high turnover rate and they do not fully represent the brand that they are trying to establish to their customers."
good,It wasn't a difficult job and life got better there over the years. Job security isn't a things although. They can and will let you go if they see fit. Repetitive with high turn-over rate.
good,"all depends who you work with, at this time I have been gone for 4 years, so I have nom idea how the structure is but I know if I had the same crew I work with and had the benefits I need and could move up, I would have stayed"
good,"It was nothing special. It wasn't too stressful, but the hours and days that I was given did not allow me to see my daughter during the weekend, when I had her."
good,The workplace is very stressful because the managers are driven to unrealistic standards. Performance reviews are based upon a set curve that supervisors cannot change but must fit employees into. Employees are constantly at risk of being terminated without reason
good,"when i first started, it was a great place to work. With the changing of technology, it did get a bit more stressful. but recently they completely changed how we should work. if you didnt comply, you were reprimanded. there is no communication between managers and techs. they enforced rules that required training without training you first. the sales goals are attainable but if you were slightly short you were written up."
good,the management be on you about your sales numbers if they're not good enough then you're at risk of losing your job and that's not fair. the coworkers were nice and helpful but management could use some work
good,"So much turnover, it was ridiculous. Can't even remember how many people I worked with that left during my time. That said, if you're willing to work hard they will give you opportunities. Just don't get in after 9"
good,"Dish is always changing, everyday some new flow is launched and nothing is ever the same. The management team is not on top of every change and there is a lot of shuffling of positions and responsibilty on the corporate side which leads to issues with department follow through. Because of the constant shuffle we see 3-4 changes a year on certain work flows that either repeat the same mistakes as a previous flow or completely dismantles the progress made by previous flow. IF you are looking for consistency Dish is not the place for you. If you are fast paced individual and are extremely adaptable dish is the place for you."
good,"I rather not comment on this section.  This job was very stressful but I did learn a lot while with the company. The management staff was not consistent, such high turnover."
good,"You learn a lot  in  short amount of time.  However, you must be willing to sacrifice your job work/life balance.  HR lacks leadership and the policies are old and out dated."
good,There's not much of a culture here but there is a lot to learn in an overall relaxed atmosphere.  There is potential to progress given the right circumstances.
good,start your day deal with customers and help with adding and removing packages from accounts processing payments lodging complaints. Culture was cool hardest part of the job was dealing with cheap customers helping customers solve issues was the best part of the job.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Great opportunity but very physically demanding. Very poor mid/upper management and company ethics. Upper management encourages dishonesty from representatives in the field.
good,"Not necessarily a bad place to work, but the work/life balance is pretty awful, and so is the fact that you become brainwashed to think for the benefit of the company rather than the customer.  Overall it wasn't bad."
good,You just do you work and go home; highly competitive job to advance due to high volume of employees. doesn't really require any special talents or qualifications.
good,DISH was a great place to work as a technician. The weatherford office has an amazing management team. With the lack of incentive pay with increased metrics has made the once fun loving job not so fun.
good,en diversas areas de las oficinas administrativas hay jefes despotas y prepotentes que aprovechan su cargo para hacer un mal uso
good,"There was not much relief from the stress. Most of the calls were to report outages or complain about service technicians not showing up."
good,"The daily sales goals were easy to obtain. Providing accurate information, quality service, and and overall good customer experience is what I found to be the key to my success."
good,trabajo en campo organizable y capacitacion constante se tiene la oportunidad de conocer otros lugares y personas lugares. se aprende a medir objetivos. las metas son medibles. el trabajo es muy agradable.
good,Hard to keep up with corporate policy. The performance matrix to achieve a bonus was very difficult to meet. The structure dictated how things were done with no variation to make adjustments on your own as a manger.
good,Decent job to work at. Most of the issues lay with the managers again. They don't put enough focus on developing their employees or their skills
good,"Company is really good on helping employees that really need the extra help in assisting you with problem areas you feel you need the most help on. Meet a lot of awesome people management is even really cool with employees they try to make it fun as possible, they do have events and bbq every now and then they even on special occasions have you decorate your work desk. The hardest part would be deal with customers, learned how to be more efficient on calls and handle customers who are irate. Job security is not really ordeal, thought i was going to be there for like 5 to 10 years. That was not the case, they are constantly letting people go including SUP who are the your coaches throughout your time there. Even Senior Management people go. Definitely not job security!!!!!"
good,"I've never had a full time role but had a phenomenal internship experience. Many full time employees criticized management and the overall culture, but felt it was all worth it to be in Colorado."
good,"Can be a good  company, just dont want to support their loyal customer and if you do, you will lose your job like i did.  Great prizes and money for upsellings"
good,"I have worked several jobs and I always enjoyed the environment at most of them. I like to do work involving projects such as volunteering. They did not have this. A typical day at work to me was a ten minute team meeting, taking incoming calls non stop throughout the day, sometimes doing trainings."
good,"Faced paced, high pressure, tough not to get burned out.  Helps if you get a good supervisor.  Questionable ethics in extra work required of sales associates."
good,Dish Network is ok but I felt like they were in too much competition with the other plants. there are two other plants in Colorado (the main campus) and El Passo Texas. They were always saying something about El Passo. El Passo was doing it so we had to do it. It got boring real quick. I was un able to transfer to another department so I slowly dwindled down and was soon let go.
good,"el ambiente de trabajo es bueno, los compañeros tienen la apertura para ayudarte en alguna duda pero es un trabajo con pocas prestaciones y lo mas complicadoes atender situaciones dificiles con los clientes"
good,"El poder socializar con la gente que trabaja contigo es bueno, lo malo es el bajo salario."
good,"I liked this job. I believed in this company. I didn't have direction, necessarily, on where I wanted to go in the levels of this job. But that was ok. I enjoyed going to work for the most part. You have your good days and your bad. But the bad wasn't so bad. Until they decided to cut ties with our site and disregard us/find any excuse to fire anyone thy could before our last day of work. May 7th. Almost as if to reduce their expenses even further. As if it weren't enough to shut down our American site that housed over 500 employees in a small town just to open up an offshore site. Sure, business is business. Don't take it personal. But its really just another company contributing to the inevitable downfall of our economy once more. I'll never work for dish again. The trust is gone. And there are more sites to come to the same end as ours. Just watch."
good,"aveces viajar constantemente, en ocasiones si se volvía un poco tenso el ambiente laboral, por cuestiones internas entre los compañeros o que tenían malentendidos, suele ser imparcial el supervisor, ya que había favoritismo dentro de mi grupo..lo que mas me gusta de ese trabajo es la atención al cliente, ya que cualquier duda que surgía, me gusta ayudarle y brindar la información necesaria para que el cliente este bien informado"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Dish had great benefits and pay but people with poor managing skills. Not really a good place to work for.
good,"10 hour work day, learned how to build rapport with any type of customer and close on every call."
good,Inbound residential sales. I took inbound calls to set up satellite TV for residents. The hardest part of the job was being micro managed to the point you couldn't take a drink of water in between calls. The job pays well.
good,"I liked the peoople that worked in the office that i was in. The techs, the FSM's, O.M.s, personnel. they pushed you to get your numbers in and if you didnt they would write you up. The upper management always made it seem so easy to get to where you needed to be. but in truth never had a clue of any of it. They nit pick your work and when you don't meet your numbers they write you up and find any little thing to try to get rid of you. Sometimes there is more important things then stickers on remotes and silicone around a cable penetration."
good,"I loved going to work and interact with all my customers. Always something new. My co-workers were the best, friendly and I was very helpful to them and they to me."
good,el ambiente la voral era muy bueno no existian tantas rivalidades lo unico malo es que no se nos comunicaba lo que  nosotros teniamos ddas no no las aclaraban
good,I enjoyed my time there and  had a lot of opportunity to learn things that you would not have been able to do at other companies. I also enjoyed that I was able to travel to other call centers and help them.
good,"High call volumes, very busy work, light up selling, began as a customer support rep, job transitioned into a technical support rep."
good,"When I first started with Dish in 2012 I was actually looking forward to go into work. What happened almost a year later that made me want to leave along with several other top tier Techs? They have increased the expectations dramatically making it almost impossible to achieve. I became a FSS2 within almost a year but once the PI system changed, it was a rollercoaster ride that went from ""job security"" to almost loosing my job to almost getting a promotion almost every month. It's simply too much for my soul to handle. It pulls my focus from my customer's needs to stressing out over ""numbers.'"
good,Working over nights it's more of a slower paced of work not as many calls come in at night but you do get to talk to some interesting people. It was a fun place to work due to the other workers that you get to work with
good,"Fast pace job , standing for long period of hours.  I learned to take inventory of the warehouse.  Team work is necessary.  I liked that i used to get weekends off."
good,"There's always something to do at DISH, but there's an old mentality about everything from the way to treat people to the way to run IT that shows that no real progress will ever be made. I do enjoy the challenge, but hate the negative attitudes and the way that management puts people down."
good,"assisting customers, answering phones, fast paced, advancement oppurtunities"
good,It was okay.  It was not my true career choice.  Management was okay.
good,Nice place to get job experience if you enjoy face-paced work environment.
good,"I have never worked in a production driven environment before. I am accustomed to interacting with the general public. My typical day consists of a 10 to 11 hour day, either disassembling or reassembling satellite television receivers or changing burnt out components on the circuit boards of the same receivers. I have gained some knowledge about running a department in a manufacturing setting."
good,take inbound calls from new and existing customers looking to set up service
good,"Long days, short nights. Management over myself were no very nice to employees or customers. I learned management skills."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,A typical day at work would involve following up on accounts
good,"I worked for almost 18 hours due to manpower lapse, it was really a hectic experience. Experience in this field is only possible in this industry as it is flexible in this approach. Co- workers are nice to work with and management part is also good as compared to Rotational shift problem which an individual faces sometimes. Rotational shift is the hardest part and the nature of work is enjoyable excluding Rotational shift and Salary issues."
good,"Worked behind a desk in a cubicle environment, answering telephone calls from Dish Network customers. Depending on the issue that the customer was experience, we followed scripted solutions to better assist the customers. What I learn the most from this job is many times allowing customers to talk while listening intently and asking the correct questions will solve many problems, mainly because the issue is more often caused by that user whom is more aware of the actions that transpired before the problem existed."
good,I worked from 6 am until all jobs were done no matter what they entailed. we were often assigned 5 to 6 jobs a day and had to often travel a distance between them. this company had a very high turnover rate. The managers were all about production production production  and if you were to slow you were let go. the hardest part was working in less than desirable conditions   snow pouring rain etc. the best part of the job was the clients and going home maybe after 8 hours maybe 12 or 14
good,"Some days can be pretty stressful. long hours leaves you with little personal life. To gain advancement you must reach goals that can be almost near impossible. Good for those who doesnt have a personal/social life or who doesnt have a family and not in a relationship, because they pretty much own you. Pay is pretty decent."
good,"A typical day at work was, check inventory, check work orders, go and set up customers satilite dish for them to recieve tv."
good,Dish compensates well but is a very difficult company to work for. Upper management does not listen to employees much. They also over work their employees and do not support them in activities outside of work. The co-workers are great. The best part of my job is helping the customer get what they want.
good,"Long hours required by management, no real possibility of advancement, required to work below -35 without windchill. All customer orientated but without the recognition of the employees in the field."
good,Days at Dish Network were defiantly busy days!
good,*Incomplete job orders
good,"i enjoyed my co workers, job location very good, not good fam hours, my mangement at end sucked they was very selfish n a88 kissing bunch"
good,"Fun to work with coworkers, pay was pretty good, The work was pretty good meeting different people."
good,"Take lots of calls from all over the country about services, Often feels like your defending the company more than you are promoting it. Very stressful at times, not easy to get an answer back from supervisors or management"
good,"Working for this company leaves you with no time for a personal life. Technicians have to constantly worry about the smallest details they might have missed due to their enormous work load. You have no set out time to go home. You are not allowed to leave a customers home with out finishing the job and it doesn't matter what time it is. Safety is first to this company,but when it comes to a situation when the tech feels unsafe in the customers home its unacceptable and the job needs to be finished."
good,The pay is good...management is the complete opposite. Daily you're getting yelled at by customers and getting called down by management for stats and long calls. Help in a difficult situation is hard to come by. Dish management runs completely by the books. It's great for the company but the customer loses.
good,"Great starting point for a Customer Service Rep. Great training class, although the hardship of the irate customers maybe off putting at first, this position assisted me with being able to handle every type of customer from great to not so great"
good,employees are valued as long as target metrics are met. if not you are tossed aside. as long as you are on top of your numbers then you are valued and appreciated by the company.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Long hours of back to back calls. Learned computer systems and tech related skills to assist customer. Management could have been better. Enjoyed my cowoworkers and customers. Dealing with tech issues was difficult if you couldn't solve over the phone.
good,Well the job is a good place to learn new things about installation but the pay was not to good the people are great teachers and i was upset that the company had to close at that location.
good,"Really high deductibles, insurance covers next to nothing. Hard to transfer between departments. Comparatively low compensation. Lots of career opportunities if willing to relocate."
good,Sales per work order is $27 each job (probably now more). Jobs are technical and sales based. You dont meet quota=let go. Roughly 3 to 6 jobs per day.
good,"money is good, management has no oversight, floor leads can act like teenagers and are never spoken 2. one good floor manager in retention and pto is a joke, you lose a lot of money taking time any earned time off."
good,"My overall experience at Dish was great until I had a work injury that caused medical problems. The leadership staff was not as pleasant as I would have expected them to be.  They did make sure I was accommodated to get my job done, but the attitude of some of the supervisors and some of the HR representatives were less than professional.  It is a great company, but I've noticed when it comes to the employees being ill they are not as kind."
good,"DISH Network was an enjoyable workplace environment that recognized and valued the impact made by all of its various employees. There was always raffles, giveaways, production based contests, and other employee incentives that helped to not only motivate the workers, but also drive production metrics (i.e. sales, customer satisfaction surveys, etc.). The job itself is not difficult, but depending on the day and mitigating factors, some of the clientele can be a bit intense."
good,DISH was great when I first started as they hired me when I was 4 mo pregnant and never made me feel like my pending maternity leave would be an issue.
good,The pay isn't worth the required amount of time and effort that you put into this place. So much time spent away from your family 8 days of pto a year till 5 year mark.
good,upper management is great local management is terrible. great schedule options. fun place to work and training is always available. overall was happy with the company
good,Los usuarios son comprensivos en cuanto a los procesos a seguir y al tiempo de atención en que se les dará seguimiento a sus solicitudes. Apoyan para un tiempo de atención más rápido a los soportes.
good,Contractor thru DISH. long daily hours including weekends. Enjoyed the work preformed. Company vehicle and uniform was provided. Was plenty of work at the time
good,Dish's work culture has high goals. And despite its short comings. They still manage to try and do their best with what they have.  It can definitely grow as a company by taking the time to really invest in their employees
good,Good training ground for lean manufacturing. Employee safety was a top priority.  Quality and efficiency performance was highly regarded. Yearly appraisal system for job performance is very poor.
good,Required to sell as well as install and repair. Items for sale could be found on local web sites less costly and same quality making sales difficult to obtain.
good,"Overall, this job had a lot of driving and was not scheduled to easily accommodate the drive time. The hours were not 9 to 5. No real opinion about this job."
good,it was alright. high call volume. had video games and pool table for when you werent working. dont really have a whole lot to say about it. but here is my review
good,Good company management team needs to work harder on training new employees. Could provide better supply of equipment.  Sales take presidance of service.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Muy buena empresa muy confiable al contratarlos excelente
good,"Hours are ROUGH. Good luck seeing on spending time with your family again. I was told we'd be short staffed and would be asked to work for 8 days. 8 days turned into 12. They also do Fulfillment. The Fulfillment is harder than the actual DISH work. If you get in as an ISP, get ready for a ridiculous work load."
good,"Good benefit give u everything while going through training and all that but if you fail the test after training you will be terminated which is ridiculous to me as I said they give you absolutely everything uniform, tools, gloves, helmet etc. But fail a test your terminated which is not necessary because you will never get the full hang of the job unless your literally do on the job training for at least 5-6 months"
good,"Good first job, I would not recommend staying there after your first or second position. Salary is not comparable, management can be hard to work with, no benefits."
good,Must make sales or you may be laid off. Installation of cable tv and technologies. Trouble shoot and great customer service required. Must be well versed in construction and company policies.
good,It's money to be made. You will work allot of hours. Little work life balance. One minute late and you are penalized. Free meals when platinum. Free snacks when platinum status achieved.
good,There are many good managers at Dish with positive vibes but unfortunately there are too many empty promises within the company. I personally did not get an opportunity to grow.
good,"Your a salesman first and a technician second. Lots of training on the tech side no problem there but once you actually start working you will slowly start to see all that matters is sales. Management is good at what they do, keep your sales rate high and they will be happy. If not they are on you every day about it and they start looking for any reason to fire you if you can't meet your numbers"
good,"Over all decent place to work , company ran four days ;10 hour shifts for installers when I was employed. As a field service tech you are required to install,educate and sell various products to customers ."
good,learnt a lot on the Free to Air industry and its operational things. highly pressured and customer centric job. every customer feedback received after sales and service are precious and few cases still holds in my heart.
good,Its a job that can be stressful but also very stimulating you get to go to new places and meet new people all the time I liked it but it's not for everybody they can be aggravating at times
good,"This is a sales job for people with an advanced technician's skillset. The hours are very long and the overtime days become mandatory during the summer. You'll come home exhausted at the end of the day then have to start at 7:15am the next morning. Management is cool for the most part, the regional manager only cares about sales, however, and barely gives you time to celebrate your win before he is ""encouraging"" you to reach some other barely achievable benchmark. If you can keep up, they'll pay you decent and there is plenty of room for advancement, but many are unable to keep.up."
good,"DISH is a very large corporation that has its ups and downs. One of the biggest downs? You can't teach an old dog new tricks. They are stuck in their ways about a lot of policies and don't have the employees in mind when asked to change them. You will be overworked for the job you were hired to do with no help in sight. "
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo un trabajo donde te dan prestaciones seguras
good,"Typlical day at work: Arrive on time, work with all pendings and new challenges. I learned from the new issues, our co workers from differente areas. About the management all help a lot when we ask question or informations need it to do my job. Culture is a good culture if it's applied fairly to all. Harderst part of the job is when you have some issues with the materials but at the end the mos enjoable part is when is get resolved."
good,"Administracion mala, comisiones no siempre bien pagadas "
good,"Company all about metrics. Watched a management meeting where they printed all of the techs metrics on a 12 foot piece of paper, covered the names, picked the 6 lowest scores of people that worked a certain amount of time. Told the maagers they could protect 2 then fired the rest."
good,"If you are into talking on the phone a lot, then this job is for you. I will never disrespect anybody's fit for any job category. It's a job where you have the potential of making some good money. If you are a social butterfly and enjoy talking, what I will say to you is go get that money."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,This company is ran by moraly bankrupt women in hr who will never meet. True story. Perfect metrics and superior performance will get you fired at dish. This company is a feelings oriented karmic disaster
good,I was in a tester 2 position and the pay way was not good and shoud be more for the work being done. Not many chances to grow within the conpany without being a favorite.
good,The culture at the work place was very pleasant. I learned a lot in both work experience and personal social experience. Everyday is different but it keeps you on your toe's.
good,I have mixed emotions. I would not go back if opportunity was there. I enjoyed coworkers but management was not always the best. There were a few good mangers.
good,No work life balance have to earn your pay to make commission team leads have a lot of pressure from upper management so you will be micromanaged. Company is a revolving door when it comes to its agents
good,"Cómo promotor de ventas podías ganar lo que quisieras, aparte de tu sueldo base el esquema de comisiones era excelente"
good,"I assisted is some technical resolutions, assisted with channel line ups as well as assisted with billing inquiries related to monthly billing statements for a satellite company."
good,good job if you would like to work on multi tasking. good work environment but need to be on your toes. Moves with bwork at each station on assembly line
good,"For some reason had problems getting paid for some of my hours I worked don’t know why, other from that they do not care about customer service it’s all about sale and I was told that by my manager"
good,"My time with Dish has been enlightening. I never knew so much about how a receiver worked and everything you can do with it. I definitely liked the tenure of my bosses with the company. Almost all of them has been with the company for a minimum of 4 years. None of them were hired in to be a boss so the hire from within for management. "
good,"Really good company to work for if your consistent with your goals."
good,"The company was still changing to focus around their smart home services. It went from focusing mostly to taking care of customers to putting more focus on the technicians successfully offering the smart home services. The company was starting to mostly focus on repeat visits which cost money and smart home services which made more money, all other metrics were being looked at less."
good,The job was overall ok. Only problem I had was when I got hospitalized it took literally an arm and leg to get my time off approved. Other than that it was a cool job.
good,"Good local management, poor top down management.  Salary is non-competitive, facility does have events. Stock-buying options, cafeteria on site. Would not work again"
good,This was a good sells job. Nothing to complain about. Great training and great people to work with.  The day goes pretty fast. Hardest part of the day is dealing with cable customers
good,"Was a very great place to work at first. Lots of paid training and really prepare you for the job. Company has shifted to focus primarily on in home sales to customers. Had a manager say that selling the smart home products that dish now offers is almost more important to them then installing the satellite systems. Expected to meet unreasonable sales numbers of smart home products in customers homes(sound bars, surge protectors, and other random electronics that most people aren't looking for) Aside from the sales aspect of the job, working as a technician is awesome if you enjoy hands on work and meeting people. You see something new every day and constantly learn new things. Pay is decent and there is opportunity for advancement if you can meet all of the metrics. Managers were very good and supportive but the higher up management structure only cares about numbers not employees."
good,"My time working at DISH was a pleasant experience.  This was a decent job for a young person who was just entering the workforce.  The work culture of the job was pleasant.  I enjoyed working at my own pace.  However, I did not like working during times when there would be snakes and wasps in the yards of customers.  Overall, it was a decent job."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Learned a lot at Dish.  Had great training and resources. Would do about 3-5 installs and repairs a day. Management was good, work place was fun and I enjoyed my job."
good,No appreciation for employees. Hardest part of the job is troubleshooting issues blindly. Most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere. Workplace culture was not great nor was management.
good,installing dish network equipment in customers home. Give the customers a piece of mind on the equipment by showing and teaching the customers on how to use the equipment.
good,"Good company with target oriented working system. "
good,stressful at times cut throat environment work hard but not appreciated. Proper training wasnt given. Employees are not treated equally ie pay perks benfits
good,"Use problem solving and technical skills to install satellite dishes and related equipment."
good,"Overall my experience with dish has been average, lower level management is decent, the work is stressful at times and responsibilities change constantly. That being said I really enjoy working with everyone and we have accomplished a lot together. Good team mentality in the warehouse."
good,"expedited training"
good,Work wasn't stressful.  Standard technical service support role.  Learned about the services and products that the company offered.  Provided any technical assistance for the products and services and dish network had
good,"Overall, good place to work. If, your a technical person it's the place for you. The people are helpful and they will work with you to make sure you're understanding your job."
good,"The job was fine, it was my first real foray into billing which made it different and slightly challenging. The job was fine until a new manager was hired and the entire atmosphere changed for the worse."
good,"Dead end Job, latter movement to other positions with small wage increase. jobs under 30K per year as a full timer, Dont make this place a career. not worth it."
good,Show up to the office looking at our routes for the day. I learned how to troubleshoot and install peoples cable. Hardest part of the day would be doing full new installs on bigger homes and figuring out the route you would take to complete the job. Management wouldn't really be help to someone who was stuck on a job.
good,Great salary opportunity but not a lot of job security. Pleasant work environment and friendly work conditions. Poor benefits and hard to understand/calculate pay structure.
good,i enjoyed working for dish until they let me go for medical reasons if i would have never gotten sick i would still be there they made it a fun place to work
good,It was okay. Couldnt make a career of it. Weather conditions make it very hard to enjoy what you do. But if your a hard nosed man looking to do hard work then goood
good,"started out  ok then became a bit stressful "
good,"At the time, I was working for dish network I recently got out of the military. With ambition to staying in Virginia the cost of living was to much for a single father."
good,I respectfully am leaving this open. My opinions about Dish Network are mainly indifferent. The reactionary environment does not lead to one that can have proper coaching or career growth.
good,Money was good but that was it was a bit much when dealing with very angry customers but did not care to listen when you were trying to explain why they bill were not where they wanted it.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Management was horrible. there was no work/life balance. Management always overbooked and techs got stuck working mandatory ot with zero thanks.. When I started they wanted us to sell one thing per day. By the time I left they were wanting us to average $15 per work order. We received no extra pay for this. We had 6 metrics to meet but all they cared about was $/work order, which wasn't even one of our metrics.. I was the top tech of the month one month but all I heard about was how my $/work order sucked. We were sent out to work in any weather conditions with no thought to our safety. When techs would bring our concerns up in weekly meetings we were told they would look into things- they never did. The health insurance was horrendous with a 2500 deductible. Once the deductible was met they only would pay 80%, not 100%.. The only decent thing was getting every channel for only $20/per month."
good,"Recent changes in the type of business Dish is entertaining is too much for 1 full time and 2 part time employees to handle. There is nothing being done to relieve the warehouse workers so they can complete their daily tasks.  Consequently, we fall behind in various areas that will definitely have a reflection on our annual review.  I feel uncomfortable about my decision but I am not able to continue with out some additional help being installed,  I was contracted to work an average of 20-23 hours per week but have been doing 34  plus recently along with being expected to properly two recent replacements.  I wish Dish the best in the future but senor management needs to be a little more forthcoming in what they will do about our employee numbers at my level."
good,"4 days a week which is nice, but those days are pretty much 7am until you are done which could be 10 some nights. Long days.The three days off are nice though."
good,It was a decent place to work at. I didn't like the hours they provided. And they didn't work with you if you had kids. but other than that it was an okay place to work
good,"a typical day at work"
good,This was an outside of the US call center located in a Caribbean island. Work environment was fun and enjoyable. The pay was competitive compared to what others made in the country.
good,My time at Dish was very enjoyable. We were well trained and compensated during that training period. The only draw back was the lack of advancement. But overall a good company to work for.
good,seating all day  making sales inbound calls and outbound calls  got paid  per sale  you make  usually hard sales  where customer was not approved for any discount
good,"After your first few weeks of training you have to go to 11 hour days with a 1 hour lunch. Some of the managers are cool at the Tulsa location especially near The Apprentice pod (prepare to see more bearded men as managers than anywhere ever before, lol) after a few months you will be going to tech training. Tech calls are very stressful & they sort of throw you into taking calls when you're not really ready because there's so much to remember. there are no breaks on calls, the only breaks you will get is your 15 minute and your lunch other than that when you're at your desk, calls are back to back as soon as one customer hangs up the phone rings again so it is a very high-stress job. If you have children or other things in life that require you to have an advance notice of schedule changes or a more flexible schedule than this would not be the job for you. I will say they do make an effort to make sure that the employees have fun. After you've been employed for a few months you will start earning PTO, however they do let you borrow against your PTO at that time even if you have not earned it yet and then as you earn it you pay that back. You can borrow up to 80 hours, but be aware that if you leave your job or are terminated from your job you do have to pay back all that PTO that you borrowed from your final check."
good,Dish headquarters was great at interacting with employees. Providing information that reps would need to assist customer properly. The environment would sometimes be a little stressful due to some supervisors not stepping in and helping with needed to resolve customer issues.
good,"I don't have time for this. I just want to post my resume and find a job. If you want to learn more about Dish, ask someone who works there. I haven't worked there in 4 years."
good,"I started DISH in 2008 as a IT Support Technician. This was a complete career change from Sales Management for 20 years. DISH allowed me to advance fairly quickly. The quicker i excelled the quicker I was able to advance. "
good,When it comes to the job itself it is great and fun. But Dish now doesn’t care if you do the job right or not. They want you to rush through each job and sell a sound system to each customer and that’s all they care about. Doesn’t matter if you fix their tv or not. Also if you your a great tech hit all number but don’t sell you are gone.
good,"No es para todos, tiene sus pros y sus contras, pruebalo tu mismo."
good,Good placed to work for. Great experience for customer service. Hours are where not my favorite due to having to work holidays. great people at dish to work with
good,"It was a good job, I was just to busy working and not comfortable with my education being placed on hold. I believe that management did their best to train every representative, however I was unsure of some tasks when entering the actual job floor."
good,"The workload was enough to stretch through out the day. Upper management was always hire outside the company, so they didn't always understand the work process in the office/warehouse."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,the job was awesome i loved the awards they would give us like the point we can get and get anything that can fit in your home. The schedule since you are able to get a 10 by four and have more days off. the pay was great i would be making big dollars every 2 weeks. but everything started to be bad when they started to down staff people and sending them home after an hr of being on the floor.
good,Don't have anything bad to say or good. You just have to find out for yourself. Everyone benefits or experiences things in a different way. so with that being said. go find out
good,"Analysed and offered TV package products for the right customers and business.  I learned of customer needs and wants and how to match them to the right product.  I learned better phone skills, presentations, listing skills, managing people, delegating authority.   Workplace culture was not the best, dirty backroom, old computers. "
good,Its a decent job if you can put up with dealing with people on the phone all day. Most conversations are not pleasant ones. Not a bad place to advance if you're into call center careers.
good,dish network is not a long term workplace for a stable career. Not much opportunity for advancement in your career. Overall it is a decent place to work but not to pursue a career.
good,"It started out being a great place to work, but the call center I worked at was very poorly managed and is now shut down due to that fact. With the right people it would have had more reason to stay."
good,Call center environment is stressful. Limited breaks between calls. Calls are every 3 seconds . Pay is good but not worth for amount of stress you will have
good,"Its extremely hard to balance work and personal life. Certain days you don't know when you will be home. Pretty much free programming is a nice bonus. Hourly pay is not bad, but like I stated before you do not know when you will be home.The metrics for being promoted to a higher tech level are a little messed up in my opinion. You could do everything right but get hit with unlucky equipment that fails and it counts against you. Overall its a nice job if you like being out and about with limited supervision."
good,I was a chat representative. Corrected technical issues and or sent out technicians when needed. This job gave me alot of customer service experience.
good,I liked working here just never knew how far I was honing to have to travel each day. Some days where 1 or 2 hours of driving and some where 6 hours for a 80 dollar job.
good,El trabajo era muy monótono pero fue una ayuda para mejorar mis relaciones interpersonales ya que solía tratar cualquier tipo de clientes y situaciones.
good,There are plenty of opportunities and switching jobs within Dish is encouraged. Everyone is in a position to have a positive affect on the business.  Coworkers are great.
good,Dish is for ever changing in these times when TV installation is going online more than an installer coming to your home. We have different oppurtunites with new adventures
good,I worked for Dish faithfully for eight years and was one of the top technicians in the office. The company introduced Smart Home Sales where we had to sale none satellite television to the customers and if we did not me the quota it counted against us. Management cared nothing about your loyalty to the company or your great work ethic they only cared about numbers. Dish has the potential to be a great company but the there thinking needs to change.
good,Great place to work the people are amazing and the company was growing there was alot of room to grow. I would definitely recommend the job to a friend
good,Busy work place hours are okay management is good wrk space is good long hours depending what hours you picked and if they got accepted but other than that it is okay
good,"its an okay stepping stone, must be able to work on your feet and get creative to get the job done.  very cut throat but you learn a whole lot of new things."
good,"The nature of the job is stressful, but the benefits are pretty good.  Easy to notice the 'corporate mindset' and see changes that don't do well for the specific individual or location, but are a good corporate investment."
good,"I was working as an Account Specialist and I learned how to up sale clients. The environment was spacious. They focused a lot on quality, which was really important."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Everyday at this job was stressful.  Company was constantly trying to push sales.  Poor support for technicians.  The days were long and trying.  Lots of driving.
good,"they need to take better care of their employees... dish it self was an ok company to work for but there was lack of motivation "
good,Lots of opportunity at the beginning of your time there. Opportunity slows down when you reach a management level unless you are looking to relocate. Work life balance is inconsistent. Quality working schedules are extremely limited.
good,"Would normally be rated one of the worse Companies to work for.  Although there were very capable and ready Employee that could lead, they were regularly passed over for candidates more closely considered friends with Management."
good,"Dish network call center,  This was completely at learning experience for me as I learned how to deal with Escalated situations, and how to come to a fair solution which benefited the customer as well as the company."
good,"Too much work daily  (12-17. Hrs daily ) micromanagement,  have to meet standards which are too demanding in order to get full pay. Pay grade based on customers opinion of you and surveys by phone or email."
good,"""Emotionally draining, lots of long hours, schedule dependent of the need of the school so you could have few or short breaks"" (in 7 reviews)"
good,"working at dish network was a challenge that I enjoyed. The money was good and so were many of the customers. The only con was the weather, particularly summer."
good,"Good place to start off working. Good first job. Good co-workers great potlucks, fast paced. Good training. Okay managers, high pressure, but manageable. Pay was good."
good,very busy from the beginning to the end. very competitive with sales. Sales will make or break you and that is not right when you are a technician or a manager.We were not sales associates
good,"started off fine until things went south. scheduled to complete commercial jobs as a new technician when was told that new technicians were exempt from commercial jobs.  was never shown how to use SHS points for stuff. Area manager had zero field experience so if you had a question about a job, was told to call another technician and ask."
good,Installation of dish and all cable lines from dish to each devise. Very physically challenging job.  Must be able to lift 28 foot ladder. Required to keep track of a lot of tools.
good,Fast paced sy job lots of work friendly coworkers. Good job for independent people looking to work alot of hrs on the road in your local state fair pay
good,"Dish was a place I worked at while transitioning from unemployment.  I must say while grateful for the opportunity, I wouldn't recommend the job to anyone.  I honestly think they closed the center where I worked."
good,"It's a pretty good company with the founder heavily involved in operations and strategy.  I interned in operations and had a good experience.  I accepted a job in corporate finance that started out ok.  I had some leadership changes that were pretty terrible.  These leaders (managers, directors, even VPs) in finance were all great analysts but don't know how to lead, train and develop talent.  They won't work with you to try to improve but just expect you to do it on your own.  The other analysts were great people but the leadership was terrible.  Even when I tried to leave the finance organization they blocked that.  I had a friend who was going to apply for a corporate finance job and I had to warn him off.  Also vacation and benefits are absolutely terrible."
good,Extremely fast paced and competitive market. Was constantly busy on the phones with productive results. A great learning experience for entry level customer service and sales rep.
good,Must be at work by 7:30 am then we have a morning meeting before we get our routes for the day. Then get everything ready in your truck for the day. Then you are off on your route to the first appointment by 8:00 am. Usually you have between 3-5 jobs to do for the day depending if its a new connect/service call or trouble call.
good,I was terminating over a tier 3 . Supposedly cannot disconnect q account the  retention training was only about two weeks and they’re not cover the situation my hands from supervisors to trainers can ever be on the same page about dish expectations and what to do with a certain accounts.  I personally will be suing for unlawful termination of this company has low types of job security I went from being one of the top agents in the enterprise to fired over a training error .
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,A job I had going through college. I worked sales via inbound calls. It was interesting and the money we were able to make via selling certain items was really fun during that time.
good,"this is a great company to work for, the stuff is great, we are like a family , I feel very happy in the morning to wake up and go to work, its a very friendly environment."
good,Commission is Good but the company will Steal it from you. By making excuses of Auto Fail and Non Negotiable.. Bad Tactics to use to play with people lives and Money
good,It's a good job but you are required by everyone to worry about selling stuff to customers no matter what and less about performing the technical side.
good,My most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers and the paycheck. I learned a lot about working as a team. I also learned about TV services and that DISH likes to screw customers over.
good,"Just like any other public company there was no room to advance within the company. new and informative areas. "
good,"Working as a Dish Technician, you can expect to work long hours, and be really tired at the end of your shift. This is a physical and demanding job, with different types of jobs given to you each day. The managers are knowledgeable, overall management is just okay. There are a lot of moving parts with this job so if you are a messy or unorganized person. I wouldn't suggest it. If you do not want to carry heavy equipment or concrete bags, I would not suggest this job to you."
good,it is a good place to work but job is revolved around sales and nothing else. management feels as if the job is only about saling things and nothing else.
good,"I prefer not to post any type of review as my departure from the company was not a good one, and I fear that it would slant my opinion of the company for other potential employees"
good,"The work you do isn't very bad, it just requires patience and good listening skills.  If unfamiliar with a call center environment, once logged in for the day, you'll have a couple minutes to prepare before your first call comes in.  After assisting with their particular technical or billing issue, depending on your training and department, another call IMMEDIATELY comes in, so there is absolutely NO down-time between breaks, so you must have at least the patience to work non-stop in that manner for hours at a time."
good,"I loved that this job gave you overtime that was optional. You able to choose exactly what hours of overtime, if any, that you wanted to work to earn extra money."
good,Dish is a great place to work if you want to spend 12 to 14 hours a day working and have no real life outside work.  They do have  some good sales contest and great giveaways such as cars etc.  My last two paychecks there were 3800 and 3500 both were for two weeks.  You can expect to work on average 6 days a week and lots of hours. My day started at 7am I would start takiing calls at that time.  Typically I would take about 50 calls a day and make about 12 to 16 sales.  Hardest part of job was long hours.  Enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
good,This is a different kind of customer service in my opinion. It was hard for me to get screamed at all day over the phone by extremely upset customers.  They would use profanity and obscene language towards me and sometimes it was hard for me to get my managers to take the call for me when the customer asked for a supervisor multiple times.
good,"DISH is not afraid to take on challenges when it comes to broadcasting and telecommunications. Pride, Adventure, Winning are their core values and they are aiming to be the industry leader."
good,After receiving decent training your managers expect you to be out there on your own and doing everything perfectly. They will ride you and nit pick your work. They push sales like crazy and just expect you to be able to sell to customers with no real training on the sales aspect at first. took 6 months to get sales training and it was held against me in my reviews before the training.
good,Dish was a really mellow job you worked on your own time and when ever you had time. The more sales you made the more commission you will make it all depended on you how much you wanted to make
good,My boss and direct reports are great but upper management is immune to the struggles of the field. The industry is in trouble of being phased out and the product has become extremely hard to sell.
good,"As a Satellite TV Technician / Installer at DISH, you'll find more opportunities and career potential than anywhere else. Our Fortune 200 Company continues to transform the entertainment industry. We are constantly striving to deliver the best experience at the best value for our customers. Come join us!"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,I am not inclined to review this company.  There are many facets of this company.  Some are very good and some are very poor.  I believe this is normal for any large organization.
good,"Poor management and never consider the employee feelings etc."
good,"I didn't much like the job culture which is the reason why I left. Plus the building made me feel like I was spending the day in jail, which is a no go for 10 hours a shift (11 including lunch). Sales are competitive though, with lots of prizes, which was fun. And the break room was great, multiple TV's, arcade and other games, and massage chairs. Nice amenities aren't enough to keep me though!"
good,As a sales men in Dish you have to work under pressure. If you don't do your goal you can get written up and some of the locations ware dead. The job is strictly about selling and nothing more. You have to know your product as well as the competition. Once someone wants to buy you have to fill the proper documentations to see if the person is eligible for the service. Open and close the place is pretty easy.
good,Work/life balance and the fact that you cap out in your pay in certain positions are a big complaint. I enjoy what I do and don't want to work in a different position but even though I am good at what I do I have no chance of getting a pay increase at this point because I am already capped out.
good,"They pay you very well, as long as you don't have to travel far beyond your home/main hub. Great face to face customer service experiences, customer relations, and dealing with people in their own homes. A great experience to learn how people are at home, and in business."
good,"A clear vision and identity. ..."
good,"this place was nice at first. now, they have increased call volume to an insane amount, same pay, more demands. Everyone, including supervisors/ higher authority has also seemed to view the quality is decreasing as quantity is increasing. The demands are insane. The workplace culture is horrible. Everyone creates drama, dirty people clipping their nails/ toe nails at work. call after call after call is very expected. with having outsourced agents from different countries makes our US agents' jobs more difficult."
good,"Good company to work for."
good,"The vision of the company big picture is amazing.  And it is easy to quickly implement changes from the top down.  I worked in the ""in-home"" department..the guys who come out to your home.  They are in constant fear of losing their job due to not meeting all metrics at one time."
good,"The video retailers are dying out and moving up is hard. The job has long hours, you almost never get out on time, the management is hard on you, the sales expectations are too large."
good,"Manejo de inventarios, excelente empresa, lastima que se cerro en maazatlan"
good,Working here gave me a lot of great experience as management trusts you and your work right off the bat. Lots of opportunities to gain experience in areas you may not be familiar with.
good,"Learned alot of basic essentials. How to be safe at all times, become independent, and be a team player. Good place to work if you are young and are looking for a good start. Job is a hustle job have to be a hard worker.  If you are lazy you won't enjoy it.  Work hard four days rest three."
good,Dish didn't have good management and showed favoritism. The agent events that they did was pretty god and it took some ease off the overall rating but Dish has a lot to work on.
good,"Good way to start out my working career, I learned how to handle upset customers and the data base systems that were utilized.  It's a mix of hardworking individuals and individuals that are just there for the money."
good,"Overall the experience was great. For better or worse, DISH has a culture of requiring people to become experts in things they otherwise have no experience in. "
good,"Working here i was able to get back on my feet after a tough time. Though the job and pay were great, the hours desired were not the best. The team bonding you find is one you grow to appreciate."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Te ayudan a desarrollar tus capacidades, y aprender todo acerca del almacén."
good,It was an alright place to work.  There were a lot of contests up for  grabs but the stress to up sell on every call was too much. If you didn't meet you quality calls and sales goals would not get bonus.
good,"Depending on what department you work in, you can go home everyday happy or with a major headache. There is quite a bit to learn here but this place is all about cutting pay."
good,Pay was pretty good. Work conditions were extreme at times and expected to be done regardless of weather. The trouble calls needed to be re examined as to if the actual trouble was due to the employee or not and if not then the employee should not be held liable
good,"If you're an amazing salesman this is great for you. If not, you can learn some skills but it'll be a tough go. You can get sales experience but you'll be better off taking it from here and applying it elsewhere."
good,At stream Global services was where I started my call center career and was provided with my first shot at assisting customers. I thank them for the opportunity and verall it was a great experience.
good,"Dish is really a great company to work for.. The training staff was excellent, but you must pay attention in class. Pay increase was based of your performance. Really have a great atmosphere."
good,Provided many opportunities to grow in the field. I was able to get on the job training and I was able to create my own schedule. I traveled  quite a bit while working.
good,En dish. Lo que no me gusto al final es que ya no pagaban todas las comisiones.
good,the frustrating part was handling calls from Angry customers.  I enjoyed helping solve and provide solutions to customers.  A .great job for someone out of high school
good,"a typical day at work consisted of daily inventory counts and submissions to company as requested, shipping and receiving,load and unload equipment as needed for techs vans also inventory same. Enter all information required into database as needed daily. clean warehouse and grounds as needed. Workplace culture was good. Supervsion good as well."
good,"Work days are long, but go fast with a fast work pace.  You work independently, must think for yourself most of the time on trouble calls and installations. It's a very physical job."
good,"Alegre"
good,"Customers were mean. The supervisors were lazy and my coworkers were greedy and needy. They did have a flexible work schedule for me while I was in school though, so it worked for me. And the pay was decent."
good,Working at the airport being able to interact with so many different people as well as handling so many different accounts can be overwhelming for one person and the company was looking to expand
good,management is the worst.worked. the people are great the politics sucks. Worked a lot of over time taking phone calls work place was good. management plays games
good,good place to make money. very stressful at times but has great benefits. the company is a great company to work for it's the customers who will make the job hard on you.
good,Long shifts great pay the hardest part of the job was finding different things to talk about customers about.Management is great and the work environment will get the best out of you .
good,work here if you really need some A/V experience. expect to work about 12 hours plus a day. i was a remote tech. i had to keep track of my own inventory.
good,"Really not the funniest place to work , didnt really enjoy working for this company. Have to be at work for long hours of the day. same thing every day. long phone calls"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Y buen ambiente de trabajo y buenas persona conoces
good,"The job offered variety from day to day. I gained valuable knowledge about installation procedures and work safety. The physical aspect of the job was very rewarding. I enjoyed the technical aspects of the job, however I was not particularly fond of the sales aspect of being an installation technician."
good,"Me gustó el trabajo desempeñado, las prestaciones y salarios no están mal, falta un poco más la cultura de identidad con la empresa, mucho descontento en puestos de bajo nivel"
good,on a daily basis I would travel to customers home to either install new or upgrade there current system. Additionally I would diagnose and repair faulty dish systems.
good,You have to be self-motivated to really feel you are succeeding in the call center environment.  The repetitiveness of action is what makes the job hard.  You have to seek or build support around you to fight off boredom.
good,"Fun and relaxing work environment."
good,"Great opportunity, awesome pay, excellent hours. What more could you want from a job. This position challenged me to utilized my skill set and become a better smarter manager than ever before."
good,"poor management and very childish antics amongst employees , much like going back to high school, plus they are practically scamming people off processing fees"
good,As that was calling process and we had to attend back to back calls of customers related their dishtv. Some times irrated customers were called and spoke very rudly. But we had to handle them very politely.
good,I  really enjoyed  starting work at  Dish Network corporation after leaving the Army.   It gave me a  good insight to the  American corporate   world.
good,Working for Dish was fun and I had the opportunity to learn a lot about their equipment. I also learned a lot of people skills.
good,"Good work environment, good management, simple job.  Just show up on time, do your work and go home.  Would recommend to anyone looking for an entry level position."
good,after 90 days you get benifits and you get great opportunities to move up in the company and win alot of prizes for upselling premium channels with pto
good,"Es un trabajo en donde tienes que lidiar con gente que realmente no entiende el compromiso de un contrato y aveces solo llegan quejas pero eso es lo tipico de una empresa como DISH lo mas dificil es estar en el sol y vender en dias muy calorosos y aveces suele pasar que ventas son dificiles de hacer, pero aun asi es una experience laboral que me gusto tener ya que me ayudo a desenvolverme y ser un poco compresivo con las personas"
good,"The training and equipment is all paid for and are the meals while in training. The company does good on that part, but seemed to fall short on helping technicians advance. they make it very difficult to advance, your advancement is mostly out of your hands. As it is greatly dependent on the customers experience and if you have a bad customer you could potentially lose all progress because of that one anger person."
good,"You have to willing to work in all environments without judgement. You will be working within people's homes, and you will continuously have to go against policy in order to get your job done. When you bring up company policy and procedure you will get told to do it anyway. Hours are good, compensation is good, training is good,"
good,"Great lunch breaks, entertainment options, good infrastructure and good work-life balance..overall excellent place to work"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"This was a decent place to work; however as someone with a chronic health issue, I felt like I was being constantly questioned about any absences, even after getting medical documentation. The medical insurance was awful, and the management was a bit aloof and overworked for my taste. Very hard to get any one on one skill building. However the schedule was great and it was nice to have a whole hour off for lunch!"
good,Although they did require us to do overtime at times it was unnecessary due to contracting of representatives over seas we did not always get calls unless the customer was very angry do to the language barrier i always tried to get the issue resolved with out having to send someone out to the house.
good,Took inbound sales calls for one hour per day which was very easy and rewarding: the people calling were interested in the product. Remainder of day was cold calling which was very difficult.
good,"The hardest part of the job is dish is constantly changing and there is no job security. Very performance driven, they keep increasing your goals till it's hard to make them"
good,"Decent place to work, easy going attendance system. Bad communication between management and agents. Newer agents need better training. Inexperience shouldn't be promoted"
good,The company has some potential. We will see what comes of it. You will meet some people you like and hear some stories about people who did very well for themselves here.
good,Customer service is always fun for me because I love helping people. The department that I worked in was fun and easy to work in and my co-workers were awesome.
good,"Working for DISH was a great position for me, I loved the chance for advancement and the additional commission employees were eligible for"
good,"Fast paced, change was always around the corner.  New products, expanding inventory...."
good,Great place to with excellent starting pay. Discount on services once probation period is over. If your looking for advancement this would be a great place to start.
good,"I learned a lot working for this company, it is a fast paced job with call after call and you never really have time available between calls."
good,"management is awesome, friendly work environment, very flexible, awesome work schedule. not too busy, favorite part is casual Friday's.We were able to wear jeans on Friday's"
good,"El trabajo fue bueno, pero como no se cuenta con prestaciones de ley ya que estaba contratado por una empresa externa no tenia prestaciones de ley y el sueldo no era competitivo."
good,"Good benefits besides no sick days, you get points for just about anything. If you do not keep the pace they want or better you will be fired without notice or regard to your health issues. Not a job recommended if you have health problems that can slow you down sometimes such as getting sick or asthma, children or plan on having a life outside of work. You would be at work more than home, you will be home just for rest and to get up and ready for work. Always mandatory overtime just about everyday which is great, but you can only option out by getting a point. Top performers are chosen every other day to be able to leave at their 8 hours but its always the same 4 people so don't count on that. If you do not make friends with leads, supervisors, and human resources your stay wont be long in the company. Also they do not work with school schedules what so ever. If you have an emergency, there is no excuse you will get points or be on the verge of termination, they will say they will work some type of terms with you but eventually just terminate you without notice. Have a job to fall back on. It pays well as long as you overwork yourself to complete exhaustion everyday."
good,"fix problems with testing equipment, improve testing process the learn about signals and several testing platforms also mpulse ticket system good co-workers most enjoyable is the people"
good,Dish es una empresa buena y estable sólo le falta seguimiento a sus solicitudes a sus clientes para que pueda yo hacer una empresa muy importante aquí en México
good,"DISH is a good place to get started and there is always opportunity to move up. With that being said there's a reason that there is always room to move up. "
good,Bien dentro de lo que cabe buena empresa te da todas las prestaciones
good,It was a Dish TV authorized retailer. Not a bad experience but they are very hard on disclosures. The people were wonderful.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Working at Dish IT department in a call center was rewarding.  Support of agents, applications and hardware what is expected.  The hardest part of the job was getting communication of the application issues being seen because agents metrics are affected are affected if they spend time reporting issues.  The feeling of accomplishment in providing superior support is what makes the job rewarding."
good,Work long hours and meet various different people from different paces. Working in all types of weather conditions. not a lot of room for growth through out the company
good,I learned a lot working here. I never thought I could learn what I did. However it can become a stressful job but you make a difference in the world just by working here.
good,I am being required to write a 20 word minimiun review so this job is Good. once again its good..didn't reach the minimum yet so just in case you didn't see it the first time this is a good job
good,"Field Service Technician installing satellite and internet systems, running cable including wall fishing, wall mounting tvs along with installing surround sound systems and trouble shooting & servicing customer problems. Training technicians"
good,"Customer service and sales asoc."
good,The company is very flexible schedule wise. You can pretty much make you schedule whatever you need it to be.  If you are looking for a place to make money then this is the place.
good,Install satelllite cable on houses and businesses.  Worked long hours and driving.  Must have knowledge of home entertainment systems and basic wiring.
good,"Una empresa en crecimiento con personal muy competitivo, una empresa que tiene muy buen ambiente laboral."
good,"Es una magnifica empresa, solo que las comisiones ya no son muy atractivas y pues en cobranza lo jugoso son las comisiones."
good,The pay can be rewarding at dish. Job stability is based on performance in sale. good place to work.English reps are paid better than bi lingual reps.
good,alot of bias between managers and certain employees. not a fair place to work at. if managers behaved how theyare suppsoed to it would be a better place to work.
good,"I start my day off logging into computer for the work area I will be at, I am responsible for following all safety guide lines and SOE procedures. I worked with a energized attitude and through out my day I worked with a team to ensure that my product got to a customer. I was responsible for quality and quantity of product to reach my daily numbers. I often receive bonus for no defected merchandise."
good,"Aprendi a trabajar en equipo, aplicando respeto,"
good,The typical day consisted of reporting to the main office where the meetings were held and all the important information (weather/traffic) was given out to the workers.
good,"It was an overall good job, and they had amazing benifits. I didn't mind the job itself. Everyone was extremely nice. The typical day was talking on the phone all day and helping with accounts. The hardest part of the job was probably not having the ability to help the customer and get yelled at and insulted daily. People will say whatever they can if it is not in person, and after a while it gets hard to want to do that and hear that everyday. The most enjoyable part of this job was the co-workers, they were amazing and they truly cared and understood and tried to help with everything. Not everyone was the same there and there was the ""cliques"" but when you got to know someone there it was a good experience. Overall the job was easy and everyone was welcoming."
good,I really enjoyed working here. The group I worked with during the time I was there was always happy and they made everyday fun. The only thing I disliked about the job was that there was never a full time position opened.
good,Working for Dish Network was hard because you never saw the rewards of your work. You were not sure of your sales numbers and never knew what the success or opportunities were.
good,"Good company, employees are great and great team players."
good,"Dish is a great company and provides excellent pay and benefits, but you never know what days you'll be working or how many hours you're going to get in a week. Winters are extremely slow and summers are extremely busy. Not the best place to work if you like a routine and stability."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Answering incoming calls, and questions of customers. Over all the job was easy, and enjoyable. However, the new quality assurance measures where to strict causing them to lose a lot of good help."

good,"Working out in the elements is tough,if it was snowing or 100 degrees out, there was still a demand to fill for the customers. You would usually work alone, but there would be times where someone would come help you if you get stuck on a project."

good,It is what you make it and it has many benefits like the fact that it is only Monday-Thursdays. It is fast paced so the day goes by so fast. Dish is a place that treat their employees like family.
good,"this was a fun place to work I enjoyed the perks such as free or discounted satellite, ice cream on some days and free lunches at times"
good,"New employees are disposable to this company, so they don't treat you as apart of a team until you have been there for a year+. But if you are willing to wait that long the pay is great especially if you can't hit all of your metrics."

good,"Great product to work on and I enjoyed the team I worked with. However, after being a lead for 4 years, I was never promoted to a higher title and didn't feel that my work was valued. "
good,"Dish Network was an overall good place to work.  I worked at the corporate facility in Englewood, CO for the IT Project Management office.  There was definitely room for improvement with regard to the applications, systems and processes, but it was what you would expect from any major enterprise IT department.  They are keeping the lights on, while maintaining a consistent upgrade schedule to keep up with other competitors in the industry."
good,"Overall dish wasn't a bad company to work for but the expectations dish has for its installation techs are a bit unrealistic. The pay was low for the amount of work you are expected to do at Such a high quality. "

good,"The job isn't hard, very easy at that, they give a script to go off of and everything. I would say the group managers are very sensitive."
good,"It was not a great job fit for me personally "
good,A typical day at work would be getting your printed jobs and loading your van with all the equipment that you would for that day and start calling your customers to let them know that you will be installing there services that day. On this job we would have our managers to call us from time to time to check on us and make sure that we had everything we needed to  preform for that days task. One of the hardest things for me about this job was working on hot roofsfor  long period of times of the day.   What I enjoyed must about this job was being able to go on out of town trips with the company and see different states and city.
good,Enjoyed working with co-workers. Good supervisor that showed good leadership.
good,"I enjoyed the job. Very organized. High stress job. Calls back to back. Troubleshooting incorrect inputs of television, failed equipment, billing questions."

good,management will do what they can to help with the job and furthering your education.  the people at dish are great.
good,Its wasn't too bad. Didn't want to deal with it though. Customers can be mean or nice.
good,"I loved the people because they were fun and experienced. But often that experience made them closed minded to new ideas. Your pay raises are based on performance but your promotions are based on office politics. Everyone accepted the fact that you basically wait your turn to be promoted. So many people there had been there 5, 10, 15 years."
good,"job was very active and busy, long hours, management did little for employees. under paid."
good,I was seeking better employment opportunities. This was a good summer job.

good,answering calls and help customers with billing and technical issues..
good,"i love to work, whether its physical work or just sit behind a desk. i'm never late and i always take my job serious."
good,"At Dish your mainly working with customers regaurding their billing questions, technical problems and also making changes onto their accounts such as program changes or even an exchange on equipment. We were in the middle of changing managers and one thing I did dislike was the attendance policy. If you were late even by seconds you would get counted off as if your were absent half the day and mangers will not remove the 1/2 of point you would receive. The job alone wasn't hard at all. You just had to pay attention to the training and it was pretty easy. What I liked the most about the job is you had to get their services in your home to learn about the equipment and it was free."
good,this job was a fast past job and I like that beacause I like to keep myself busy with work .
good,"Adjusted and modified equipment to enhance equipment performance or to respond to customer requests. Demonstrated equipment to customers and explained how it is to be used, and responded to any inquiries or complaints. Installed and replaced faulty equipment such as satellite receivers and wires. Trained and developed programs to ensure that our field services employees received the training and support they needed to deliver quality work and outstanding customer service"
good,Its a great place to work with when the place is set up with great people. Management lacked a little when it came to helping their employees but other then that it was a good workplace.
good,"I would wake up in the morning and check my phone for jobs issued to me from the ETA Direct link. Then make proper time management decisions to adjust my day before I clocked in (which is through my phone also) go to the storage unit and pick up proper equipment for the day and extra just in case a product or piece of the whole system did'nt have a malfunction...there would always be a repalacement part  Call customer and let them know of my ETA, get there and start procedure of the job from my phone.  then proceeded to talk to customer of what have been the the issue, whether it be a trouble call or a new connect. Affirmed my conclusions and/or dianalysis with customer, and then go on with the proper procedure.  Execute the job to my fullest ability. Gave customer education.to understand how the Dish system works."
good,I didn't like being on the phones. To me i felt like i couldnt make a sell over the phone.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"A typical day at Dish Network entailed calling leads, creating leads from everyday conversations about movies and other subjects pertaining to entertainment. Sales were expected weekly and in store on the spot. I worked with a very talented group of multi taskers who engaged the customers in a different sense. They were tasked with selling blockbuster promotions unlike me. The most difficult aspect of my job was realizing my company had a higher credit approval rating than others, making it more difficult to close. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking about my job...entertainment."
good,"Great company to work with, but really low commission!"
good,DISH is pretty fast paced and I am learning lots of new things. I have a group of great co-workers and our coach is very helpful whenever we need assistance.
good,"During my time with Dish network (Echo star) I was given an opportunity to work in a outdoor environment in a set territory in Miami. They provided me with a company laptop and cell phone, "
good,You would come in start the day with a meeting before heading out to customers homes. Schedule would constantly change through out the day. Hardest part of the job is making sure you run all lines up to code and replace anything that isn't.
good,"comming in and beginning the job on collecting and sales"
good,Good place to work for students who want to enter the job market at a lower paying rate while learning quickly in a a hectic fast-paced environment.
good,"A typical day at work includes; meeting with customers, being social while working to understand their needs and/or concerns."
good,"Sometimes worked 12-14 hours a day, but knew when starting job that some days would be like that"
good,Dish is a great company to work for but management is poorly done. On a typical day of work my route changes about 4 times a day. working for dish i have learned how to talk to different types people. All of my co-workers are great guys and are very helpful. The hardest part of the job is explaining to customers why they cant get service. The best part about the job is work on my own with no one over my shoulder.
good,hice muchos amigos mi jefe muy amable mi jefa de recursos humanos  les agradeco lo que aprendi
good,Dish has been a challenging and exciting place to work. I joined Dish as a Sr Developer and quickly grew into Dev Lead and now Dev Manager.
good,good benefits
good,"The pay is slightly lower than other call centers. However, after being rated as the worst employer in the US, they have stepped up their game."
good,"The technical aspects are enjoyable, but the struggle to make a decent wage far outweighs the fun parts."
good,Very unorganized. Ask three people the same question and you will get three different answers.
good,"The position of Customer Service Representative at Dish is one that requires multitasking. Utilizing the company intranet, my purpose was to resolve customer issues quickly and accurately. I was well trained on satellite systems, signals and equipment to address technical issues. I also was responsible for answering general and billing questions. We are on teams that are enjoyably competitive and the management is extremely supportive. The hardest part of this job is being treated badly by the consumer. Often I have to turn their attitude around both for the benefit of the company and myself."
good,"calls back to back. helping customers with billing issues, upgrading programming, troubleshooting by phone, scheduleing techs, and problem solving if the customer is unhappy. they put you on a team with at least 15 people and a ""coach"" is in charge. The hardest part of the job is passing all their metrics. they listen to most of your calls, the customer has to give you a score from 1 (being the worst) - 5 (the best) after that a quality assurance person comes to your pod and gives you feedback grading you agiain points deducted if you missed something. you have to sell 10 % of premium channels PER DAY. your calls CANNOT be more than 11 min long. They have really strict metrics making it very hard to get bonuses. Literally! best part, is LUNCH. They have all these cool restaurants come and sell their food in our break room! awesome"
good,i like the people that i worked with but the down side to it is that not very good benefits. and very little overtime or room for growth.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,typicaly eavery day is peasfull.
good,"Although management is very friendly and understanding i have three different mangers whom all want it done their way. Work Hours are long typically 12 hrs, which wouldnt be a big deal if i didnt live so far. I was sent to New Jersey for a two week training and when i was trained out in the field all the ew jersey training was null and void. Dont get to talk to co-workers much but all seem unhappy"
good,"A typical day at work would be reconciling paperwork, receiving and shipping inventory to techs and warehouse, processing returns, inventory counts and audits, stocking and cleaning the warehouse."
good,Supervise dispatchers in a call center enviroment that would route an dispatch technicians on a daily basis. Enjoyed working with the people there. Constant time constraints on all tasks.
good,Advancement opportunities do exist but are few and far between.
good,• Conducted individual coaching sessions with listed direct reports
good,"I liked workinking for Dish Network the environment was plaisant ,we used to have BBQ with all the technicians"
good,Good working environment. Good learning experience. Never a dull moment. Challenging tasks.
good,"Drive 40 min to office, listen to supervisors talk about nothing, get truck and equipment, go do installs, come back to office, restock truck and park , clock out go home."
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and working for this company. I really wish that they didn't close the office that I worked at.
good,"The typical work day........ To clock in , sit down and start calling and confirming appointments for that specific day. Once all done, I proceed to gather time cards and start figuring payroll doing with many other duties my position required. For the most part, it was a fun job, alot of joking and cutting up but when deadlines were due,I knew when it was time to work. I didn't really know much about the position and what exactly a payroll/warehouse inventory clerk did, and that was the hardest part about the job to me was having to train and teach myself how and what exactly the position required. After awhile and alot of learning it was a piece of cake, and I was able to have fun at my job as well as work and meet deadlines on time..."
good,Good Job.
good,Inbound call center setting up new customers with television service.
good,While i worked at DISH I have to say it was best in the beginning and went down hill from there. Once the benefits dropped I had to leave. The other causing factor was the growing amount of mandatory work per job and no additional time. I loved the job but hated the company.
good,Take your money and keep your eye on new opportunities. You can be fired for doing anything including exactly what your superior instructed you to do.
good,Was just not what i wanted. I hated working on the tech side but liked the customer service side. Did like the employees was like a family.  All of the surveys were great.
good,Decent job decent pay. Team environment good management. Company vehicle and company fuel card provided. Met lots of interesting individuals while on installs.
good,It was a good job for a person who is looking to work part-time and go to school. Really helpful in that space. Not a lot of opportunities to move up to management unless you wait your time.
good,Not intended for a career. But good first job. Dish supplied all tools and inventory needed to do your job. Internet was much more interesting than the cable part of the job
good,"This job is a great environment but the customers are really rude and they do not care about the person on the phone. Other than that it is and amazing place,"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Dish thrives in its culture, its community, its cooperation, its ethics. They strived to bring out the spirit in each of its employees threatened with a crisis of working for a corporation. The way they designed their ethical portfolio was authentic, fresh, and swallowable. You feel close, important, and involved. Dish is certainly the better of the many major companies to work for. It was a great experience, all things considered."
good,"It isn't career worthy unless you're in school for business management, and willing to relocate out of state. Aux is promised for more development and it doesn't happen. Pay is good for a call center though."
good,Ideal if you have no family or are keen to work very long summer hours (sometimes over 14 per day) and very short hours in the winter (6 or less per day) no stability in pay makes it harder to budget.
good,no toman en cuenta tus iniciativas ni tampoco las nuevas propuestas.
good,"Excelentes prestaciones, lamentable manejo del gerente del área, en lugar de apoyar a desempeñar tus funciones te pone trabas y al final no cumpliste con las expectativas"
good,Co workers are great and the training is long to make sure you know what to do but management dont care about anything going on with you and they only care if you're in a seat taking calls
good,Benefits has a highend deductible. If you have any medical issues do not recommend!! Get plenty of overtime!! Pay isnt to bad for the area!! Management was great .
good,"liked the job at first, training is very very thorough. some days would fly by and when it gets sow be prepared to be bored and don't fall asleep cause you'll get fired"
good,"The technical side of the job isn't bad, other than obvious, daily discomforts (i.e. hot attics, cold winter days, rain, etc.), and direct management are for the most part great with little interaction with upper management, but don't take this job unless you are ready to sell, sell, sell.  If your sales metrics are anything other than stellar, you have to make not one, but two one-on-one phone calls with management during each work order, not to mention a meeting at the end of your day to sum up how and why you did or didn't sell during the day...I understand the company needs to make money, but requiring technicians to carry a huge, forty pound duffel bag of products into every single customer's home, regardless of the nature of work being done might not be the best way to do it...if selling is something you enjoy and are comfortable with on top of completing the demands of the technical side of the work, this company has a lot of potential for incentive."
good,"Fun environment, Great co workers. Competitive incentives. Some calls were rougher than others, but that's the nature of the business. Pay based on what rep selling"
good,"The job is Metric based. I have to issue with metrics being used to gauge performance if they are metrics the tech can control. Enjoyed the day to day change of job types. Had an issue with techs being moved into a sales role, there was a $ per work order goal set and you were expected to meet it. Those that could not perform in other areas as long as they could sell are regarded as great techs. The Office Manager is Harrisburg truly cares about techs, but some of the Field service managers cared more about their metrics then looking at the big picture. Micro management seems to be the newest trend in the company to force people to hit sales goals. Hanging over someone and baby sitting their every move to make sure they are selling items is a waste of time and effort. The company calls it funding the future by you selling the Smart Home services but over look the poor routing or technicians that do not do quality work and cause repeat truck rolls that cost the company money. Saving money is also a way to put money in the bank, I guess a tech driving 160 one way to a single job is not near the waste of money that someone selling a 30 dollar surge protector brings in."
good,"Dish is a great company to work for. Awesome pay, awesome benefits, awesome managers, PTO, etc. I love working independently as a technician. The only complaint I have is working 5 days/week 12-15 hours/day and having to work holidays. Very difficult to spend time with family working that schedule"
good,"It's a sinking ship.  It would be foolhardy to board.  The job isn't even focused on installing things anymore, it's focused on sales.  Even if you suck as a technician, they'll keep you if you're a good salesman, which is ridiculous to me."
good,Working for dish was a pretty good gig. 4 on and 3 off. I got to work from my house with my equipment in my garage. The only downside is the high pressure to make sales and hdmi cables and sound bars. They seem to care more about sales quotas then actual installation.
good,If you started working as Customer service you will have to resign and apply for a different department to have a better chance to be qualified for that department.
good,Excelentes oportunidades de crecimiento profesional y profesional apegado al crecimiento de la empresa
good,strict Q/A guidelines but generous benefits. No cold calling. All incoming calls. Four ten hour work weeks with one hour lunch. Daily incentives and perks
good,"This job has every second of your day mapped and tracked. You get calls back to back with little to no time in between to document that call and to breathe. The customers were the worst part. They are rude, mean, and just all around miserable to deal with. The lack of time to recoil from being cursed at to the next person is what made the job unbearable. I got lots of nice gifts and chances to move up within the company but that did not compensate for the mental torture the calls put you though. They also changed the ""teams"" you worked with so you could no longer build a good relationship with you supervisor and coworkers because they would switch every 2-4 weeks, along with your schedule."
good,"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Dish Network works very well on the supervisor and mid-upper management relations, as a worker your entitled to good benefits with multiple companies. Full paid training, holiday and overtime pay, and solid hours. This come with the expectation to play exclusively by their rules with little leeway on the corporate level."
good,You have to talk fast & be perfect. Training was nice & thorough. You can move up. Nice discount on TV service for employees. Wish I could say the same for the pay.
good,Very hard to keep customers not to leave don't have enough promotional offers for the customers and that new orders count against you when they are not supposed to
good,"I do love working at dish, but I do not like selling products in a customers home.  Along with the sales, I was told in interview that the manager had only seen someone make under 40 hours per week once or twice, and it wasn't by very much, however I am currently on week number 4 of getting sent home 1 day short of my 4 day work schedule."
good,"Very fun job to have, employee environment is very friendly. The work can be stressful as the company goals tend to always go up. Would recommend for someone looking for a job that pays well, paid time off and available time off available. Otherwise the stress is not worth the pay."
good,"As a installer for Dish Network, I arrived at a warehouse to obtain my work order for the day. After loading the necessary equipment for installation in the company van depart to my customer appointments. The main thing I learned was to make a positive impression with the customer, who would be your boss on site. The management pushed to get completed installs. The work place culture was job and customer desire before all else. Find home in rural areas was hardest part about the job, while bring quality TV programming viewing at affordable prices was the most enjoyable."
good,Did not manage employees well. Training was long yet fell short of the priority needs of agents. Company failed to utilize established feedback process to improve agent training. Random mass firings of capable supervisors destroyed any sense of long-term job security. Those who hustled and actively pursued advancement often fell victim to being promoted above their capabilities. Successful high-level executives seemed to move quickly to other companies once they'd made their mark. Feedback from employees got severely dampened or edited.
good,"You are required to sell Smart Home Products like sounders, tv mounts, screen cleaners, headphones etc in order to keep your job. This company only cares about one thing $$$. I have seen people let go for not making to required sales of 25$ at each job. If your looking for a sales job you better think twice. Id suggest car selling or retail work on Black Friday year round. Advancing within the company is tough I was a level 2 when I left and it took forever to obtain. The metrics are just unfair to work with. For example, If a customer cancels the service they want when you arrive and start the job it goes against you. 1 cancellation job takes 32 more non cancel jobs to make up for it. How dumb. If you don't sell the required 25$ per work order you are in the hole. If you think your just gonna install cable here you are sadly mistaken. Also this company ask you to take on more certifications but no additional pay for you. They give you the "" it makes you more valuable "" speech..... Jump into a bed of fire ants covered in syrup before you think of taking this so called job placement."
good,Must be able to think on your feet and come up with solution of problems. Career advancement is very hard and in order to move up the position must be open but the positions are numbered
good,"The Job was high paced and you were constantly on the move. Mangers were normally pretty good but were very driven on Policy.Seeing new customers every day was the best part of the job, never a stale or stagnant experience"
good,"Fun job most of the time, but no free time, which is fine if you dont have friends or family... the overtime pay kinda makes up for it and as long as youre doing your job well its easy to get pay raises."
good,"Don't like the QA process, great job overall and its pretty fair but I wouldn't work in a call center ever again thats just my opinion it's a very cut-throat environment at DISH"
good,"On-boarding as a manager does not cover half of the duties that are required and they change frequently. The Company has restructured 3 times in my tenure and mandatory overtime is a constant for the techs and field managers. Tech and management positions are not filled quickly when vacant, leaving those that are left to fill the void and do the same amount of work as with a full staff. Some offices have to share an operations manager with another office."
good,I only worked for Dish for about 8 months. It was tough and working through the winter having to install on roofs with 40 foot ladders is not something that I would recommend for many people at all. The best part about working there was that we only had to each work about 4 days per week leaving us with 3 day weekends.
good,Wonderful to work for when we first started. Opened its call center. Things changed toward the end. Learned more working there than any other job I had will always be grateful for the opportunity.
good,"Positives: I enjoyed working with/for my manager.  I worked with cooperative and professional teams. Very intelligent staff; some of the smartest people I've ever worked with.  "
good,"Stayed focused on quality while trying to achieve daily and weekly demands.  Supervised, trained, and coached associates on all guidelines and procedures."
good,"Dish was a good place to work. They did have recreational things to do while on break or at lunch.  Good benefits.  Didn't like the weekly 1 on 1's with your coach as the coach always tells you what you did wrong and did not give much praise at all.  Who wants to made to feel like you do a horrible job every week.   Also, having to go by numbers on all calls is hard because you can't control the calls that come in.  Management is pretty good.  Lots of nice people work at dish."
good,"Overall not a horrible place to work when I started. However, now,  I find myself looking for other jobs all the time. They force you into transitions with no warning and care little for your input on them."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"This was the first ""adult"" job that I had. It was a good place to get your feet wet but I wouldn't recommend making Dish a long term career. The team structure fluctuated and changed constantly. Lots of internal competitions, competing for top in sales that sort of thing."
good,"Dish is an ever changing, fast paced place to work. Training is lacking for positions other than technicians so you have to be a quick learner and dedicated to succeed."
good,I think it's a good job to start off in.It can be very stressful to maintain your stats that is a big deal working there. You are required to upsell which I wasn't very happy about.
good,"Not a bad place to work overall, just a bit aggressive in policies and management is almost aimed against you there. Very generous with compensation, but the competitive atmosphere leads to a very stressful low security workplace."
good,Dish takes care of its employees with catered lunches and tons of prize giveaways. The actual job isn't fun and you are micromanaged like crazy. Also hard to go to school and work here as overtime is most of the time required.
good,"this job started out great but in time you begin to see that the little things. like no room for advancement."
good,"I would say starting out i had high hopes for this company they seemed to care about the employee a lot. There was alot of advancement opportunity, as time went out that seemed to change as a lot for agent were being let go even ones that were shocking to be let go. Dish no longer has the employees well being in mind unfortunately"
good,"It has come a long way to improve the job enviroment, is a fast paced enviroment, if motivated can get good bonuses and sales."
good,Your typical day at work as a supervisor will involve listening to calls and driving teams real time. You will also develop agents to hit certain goals when it comes to metrics. I learned how to connect with individuals I supervise and how to build a successful team. I learned different management styles that I employ every day.
good,I enjoyed most of my time at Dish but the work/ life balance is not in sync. You are required to work odd hours that may not be in line with your personal needs.
good,I had worked myself into a good position but was let go for a DUI. I would have stayed if I could have. I still work part time on a contract basis but I need full time employment.
good,"Dish requires there employees meet certain stats to move up to higher tech level .I found that every person has there strong points .let it be strong customer service ..time management skills, quality control....or  sales skills ....these vary from person to person. There is no recognition if one exells in one of these categories....to move up you must meet requirements for all...and the bar is set unrealistically high ...."
good,"The job, pay and benefits are great. The only problem i had with the job is selling their product because i am not a sales man. I took this job because i wanted to get away from selling products."
good,you get hired they send you to a class you spend a month learning then they send you on your own sink or swim. the pay isnt bad and its kind of nice driving around your own van
good,"I enjoy a family style workplace, but I do understand its a business as well. Arriving at 7am on my scheduled workday was excepted as it should be. view your work orders and complete you work orders. I learned to find ,carry, and designate signal to home and/or businesses. Management was as if most places, good managers and managers that needed a little work. Dish has a family vibe when numbers are made for the time being. The hardest part of the job was to sell smarthome products to a customer . Its extremely difficult to sell to someone having problems with their satellite signal. I enjoyed the unlimited overtime offered. just couldn't advance due to the constant rise in dollar per workorder metric, which lead to other metrics falling that also couldn't be controlled (internet connectivity). I wish dish the best"
good,"Lots of call volume (plenty of leads!!!) Everyone has the same opportunity - my advice is take as many calls as possible, but some people say thats bad advice..."
good,"day would start with a morning meeting and then getting on the phones for customer support, technical support, keeping existing customers and obtaining new ones."
good,"Mi labor era buscar personas que quieran poner su propio negocio vendiendo Dish , el problema son lo jefes de esa área ya que precionaban mucho a los distribuidores , no tenían libertad al fin de cuentas era como si trabajaran para Dish . , si no vendian los amenazaban con cerrarle su negocio . lo único que les importaba a la empresa era las ventas "
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,This is a fast pace ever changing environment that thrives on customer service and never satisfied with the end result. Always looking to improve the process and the product..
good,"This is a high risk job. If you do not like heights, or ladders period, do not apply. They don't really care as much about safety as they say. You can be in the snow and end up on someones roof to install a dish."
good,"A work day at dish was steady in the morning, loaded up van and checked route for jobs and locations, every job was times heavily and was a bit stressful being under that kind of pressure, equipment failed about 25 percent of the time, long hours, fast paced and customer service was top priority. Learned a lot about the equipment and tools and especially about sales. The management was ok overall. The hardest part of the job was figuring out how to run the cable in the customers home and guaranteeing passing line of sight for signal. The most enjoyable part was working outside and independently without any supervision."
good,"It was fun working at dish. There was always something that was going on to keep us preoccupied."
good,"Dish was a fun place to work but the culture of the company and culture of the Spartanburg site seem to get lost on management level.  They did tons of family oriented projects but it seems most of it was just a sham to make it look good when in reality people were just unhappy most times to be there.  compensation was not good although it was getting better before i left.  Dish came off to me not genuine in its attempt to make people feel like it was family or maybe the message got lost by a few members of management however it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Also another bad thing about dish that everyone was gossiping about the next person which constantly caused feuds between co workers vs co workers, co workers vs management, and management vs management."
good,If you are single and willing to work long hours then this is a good job for you.  Management at the local level can be a bit over bearing and tends to question every move.
good,"High turnover due to stress and treatment of employees.  Many angry calls because the receivers and dvrs sold were junk. When first line call agents couldn't resolve technical difficulties, tech support frequently refused to receive the transferred calls and do their job.  Supervisors and trainers frequently had potlucks and other events for their teams, but that did little to alleviate the stress of an average work day."
good,"Really fun place to work. Great benefits, sometimes have to work a lot of overtime. I wish there were more pay increases than there were. Harder than usual to love up."
good,"Not a terrible company from what I've experienced...Decent pay, lot's of perks to working with Dish... Just need to be willing to work in a fast paced call center environment with high expectations."
good,Great place to get experience and learn.  Culture is not for everyone and could feel confined if you are from a more flexible environment.  The people that work there are good people.
good,Dish network warehouse was just a job for me. It wasn't in my field or anything it was just something to ensure I had income coming in at the time. I would recommend this job for someone who has retired and just looking to stay busy. It isn't face paced or anything work at your own speed as most times you'll be alone.
good,A good opportunity with many benefits. Good work schedule. With the opportunity to gain valuable experience. You are usually working by yourself throughout the day. You get your own route. You must be a willing listener and be willing to go the extra mile for your customers. It goes a long way because you get performance incentives.
good,A typical day in the sales department is taking incoming calls of people wanting to know or buy television programming. I learned sales skills and tactics.  The management team is very driven and competitive.  The workplace culture is competitive. The hardest part of the job is making your sales goal.
good,The environment is a very friendly while being very cold for me. There are a few opportunities at DISH. My manager was great I can't say anything but good things about him.  I had the same manager for the length of time 11 months in a few days that I was employed at DISH. They believe in rewarding the employees for good work. It's just that it is changed from real customer service to retention  is selling the value of DISH harder faster to hold on to the customer. You have to talk fast think fast in order to keep your metrics at the level they prescribed. It's all about the numbers nothing else really matters but if you keep the numbers hi you are  rewarded handsomely.   If you're not a person with the sales person's mentality you won't last long there. Because if your metrics are consistently know they will let you go.
good,"Dish is probably one the easiest companies I worked for job. The company is what you make it though, ig work hard you get more training. With more training, comes more pay"
good,Had to be ready for nonstop calls.  Center was opened 24 hours with plenty of overtime so was able to make my own pay check.  I had to travel great distance from home
good,DISH provides amazing opportunity to learn and develop new skill sets. Great place to start your career and build your resume. Fast paced environment.
good,Great benefits. Can be a tough environment when it comes to selling items from a Technician point of view. Making sales is extremely important. Other positions are valued but not as much as Technicians.
good,"Not easy to cope up with the work culture at this organization."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,deal with customers & time management is the hardest some times. co-workers are easy to get along with. being a success is the most enjoyable part of the job. i have learned how to organize better to improve a work routine. a typical day for me is dealing with customers and installing their cable tv.
good,"You're not a technician you are a salesman that just happens to install and repair dishes."
good,"team supporting is main part of work without it never a person achieve the goals, every upcountry visit  teach me different idea of work, when i decided i meet those person who not ready to work organisation , after my visit retailer freelancer are ready to work with organisation,,my Boss always lesion me work under time management ,"
good,A very down to earth place to work for. There was constant change to the rules and guidelines but overall a great place to work. Safe and controlled work environment with friendly and welcoming atmosphere.
good,"While working for Dish Network, you get to have their television services at a highly discounted rate, you get minimum required benefits for full time employees, constantly pushed to become better and to become faster. The programs are easy to learn and the offers given to customers are constantly changing. They do a lot of on the job training to prepare their workers and the management try really hard to help their workers succeed. Their attendance policy is strict, but necessary. "
good,"I worked as a educational trainer, all the staff and management were from different countries. So each day I would teach protocol and QC then learn new about cultures."
good,"I am a contractor and I am not on Dish's payroll."
good,customers feedback is good about company service and management . customers fully satisfied with the company schemes and company demo orientation.
good,Not the worst job or the best. Be careful when trying to move up in this company. Supervisors and Managers like to retaliate against you for trying to move up in the company.
good,"No dan las mismas oportunidades a todos los trabajadores, es una empresa en la cual si no eres amigo de los jefes, no puedes obtener un crecimiento dentro del área de ATN y si buscar cambiarte de área no lo permiten."
good,I enjoyed it for the first couple months. The money is great especially if you're good at your job and don't mind putting in hours. The downside is an overwhelming amount of hours you have to spend sitting in one spot talking on the phone. I liked the people and environment just needs to be more of a sales environment instead of a call center.
good,"A typical day started out with a short meeting followed by taking phone calls all day. "
good,I learned how to multi task from this company. I did technical support to our customers and I also provide customer service to them. I also did up selling of our new products to our existing customers.
good,Fast paced environment with opportunity to grow. Great people to work with and learn with. Very hard on you if you don't have a degree. Dish allows you to have freedom to be creative within your work environment. The best thing about working for Dish was working with the management team and understanding the different personalities and differences each person brought.
good,"Dish Network was an okay place to work for.  There is room for advancement, as long as you are willing to learn the required procedures to advance."
good,"I functioned independently of the main office. I had to weekly order the materials and product I needed for my job and store inventory at my home as well as the company van. My day consisted of obtaining my daily route in the morning, stocking the van with all possible needed equipment, driving to job sites and performing satilite tv and Internet systems as well as repairing existing ones."
good,"Training was fast-paced.  Not much training on the computer programs, mostly how to treat the customers.  Due to this, many trainees quit before the six week training was completed.  We were not completely prepared to start working in the center with a six minute call time limit.  The employee turnover was high. The most difficult part of the job was locating a supervisor when needed.  Communication between management and new procedures or new prices on programming was sporadic at best.  Overall, I advanced to Tier 5, had been selected to receive in depth training and became a ""Dr. Dish"" representative.  This was rewarding because I was allowed to work without as much supervision.  It was a fun place to work as my coworkers were wonderful and when on lunch or break we exchanged ideas to make our call times faster.  My immediate team lead was wonderful and took the time to help us all."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,I am handling STB testing and new product development. Everyday new challenge to face and learn. management is good here.
good,"As an On the Job Trainer, we worked as a team. Our goal was to make sure our new hire felt comfortable while learning the everyday needs of becoming a customer service rep. I enjoyed meeting new people and working with  existing employees to move up in the company."
good,I enjoyed my tenure at dish network. My co-workers were very fun to work with. I did not like the fact that my position was eliminated due to company restructure.
good,"DISH was great at first, Free sat service great work hours, and a flexible attendance policy. Unfortunate they fired me for being late to my 5am shift in the negitive 12 degree weather and frozen roads."
good,"Approach new or existing customers with company promotions and deals, make sure all customer equipment was functional and up to date, process customer information, speak with corporate individuals"
good,Its a good place to gain some experience.  It allows you the ability to refine and improve your communication skills by meeting and working with new people on a daily basis. It allows you to build the confidence you need to assert yourself as the professional in your field and obtain the trust of others.
good,"Overall I enjoy the job itself however dish is a company that doesn't believe in compensating the inventory team for the contributions that they put forward. Such as I technically managed my warehouse and inventory procedures, while making less than a starting technician that didn't even know how to put together a dish."
good,"I enjoyed my time while working for Dish Network.  My typical day concluded of several customer service calls while assisting them with billing, technical support, and several day by day questions. "
good,The job is very is to work for when there aren't take downs but the lack of help and assents that you need to complete a job there is very slim team lead and coach's are never around for assistants and is very is to get fired there but if you can get passed that and learn the job and not need help the job is well worth it to and extent
good,"Dish has received a lot of bad publicity for being a horrible work place.  I worked their for 11 years and enjoyed almost all of it.  They certainly have their own culture and if your not a ""roll up your sleeves and go to work"" type person than it is not for you.  I loved it!"
good,"Worked with dish for 12 years, overall had a positive experience until moved into Commercial department where management started to move out older employees."
good,Installed satellite tv on homes and ran cable. drove a panel van around.
good,"A typical day as a installer for Dish is extremely busy. The day begins with a morning meeting where management will go over the goals that were either met or not met the for the previous day. From this point the technicians will log onto their personal company provided tablet. Here the tech will review the jobs that they are scheduled to complete that day. On average a technician will have 4 to 5 installs depending on the skill level of the technician. Once the technician has completed the provided jobs; the tech will go back to the shop where he/she will clean the van and restock the inventory of the van. Co-workers are mostly fun and friendly to be around.... depending on how their day has been. The hardest part of this job is also the most enjoyable part in my opinion and that is the actual install itself. It is up to the individual tech to figure out where the dish will be placed, and how the cable will be routed. At this point there is a mental as well as a physical challenge that will arise. Overall, the job is a good place to start if you are looking to get into the satellite industry."
good,Great place to acquire good team work skills. Hardest part of the job are the early hours and balancing that with home.
good,era buenos dias aunque tenia un supervisor muy sangron aprendi que no siempre te llevaras bien con la gente que trabajas los gerentes eran buenoos cumplian muy bien con su trabajo mis amigo o companeros con todos me llebaba muy bien la parte mas dificil era soportar lo reganos  y lo que mas me gusto fue el ambiente de trabajo super tranquilo
good,"We had to use break times to use the restrooms. I learned how to troubleshoot the receivers and other equipment when there were problems."
good,"The job was fast paced and easy to advance in. In a year I went from a trainee to a Team Lead/Advance Tech Rep. However, if you have children don't plan on seeing them until your vacation days kick in. The job has to come first or you'll end up quitting or getting fired."
good,"A can-be-fun environment, marred by overly aggressive and sometimes unrealistic expectations. However, they are in a renaissance and are aggressively trying to address the issues within the organization. There are many rewards to such a challenging environment and most are to the benefit of those who are unique enough to endure it."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Now i working DishTv india company as a Data Processing officer using MS Excel and MS Word .I learned MS SQL database and some software application.
good,"Wake up at 7am and clock in at 715. Load your van, review your work schedule and drive to customers house. Istall new dish customers. Add satellite, cables, switches. Or trouble shoot existing customer. Always find ways to connect Dish system to internet. Climb ladders, roofs, go under crawl spaces. Drive home, clean work van. One day a week drive to office to stock up on supplies and have company meeting."
good,Good place to work... Lot of learning in operations. Management is very cooperative and supported very well.
good,"Tienen buenas prestaciones como uniformes, vehiculo utilitario, calzado, salario mediocre y para terminar no te pagan la comision por la cual tu te esforzastes, pesima empresa"
good,X-Plore Tech was an excellent place to work. Management was good and so were the co - workers. I learned so much during the time I spent with X-Plore tech.Being in a sale process I got the go get it attitude and I became result oriented.The only thing that made me leave the company was the immense pressure to get sale on a daily basis.
good,Pleasure working with all the other technicians. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and making sure all of the customers are happy. Management needs improvement and the overall company needs to have better opportunities for the employees.
good,Work life balance is good. Would prefer higher wages. Good benefits.
good,"Dish Network was a great environment to work in. The best part of Dish network is that they teach you the different aspects involved with technology, TVs and cable. It also teaches you how to maintain a calm nature while trying to problem solve customers needs. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful to new hire employees. They insist that employees are provided with free service. I loved working at Dish network, they provide different activities to be involved in, for up-training purposes or time between calls. The provided an internet cafe for employees to use for personal use while on personal time. Granted you do answer 95% angry phone calls, but understanding the customers frustration will always allow you to assist the customer best at Dish."
good,The people are great. The work is very difficult. I wish they had told me how hard the work is.
good,I learned a lot about sales inside and out in this position. Also excelled in phone etiquette. I basically learned how to sell ice to an Eskimo! lol I loved my co-workers. Was a very competitive workplace and if you didnt sell then you were cut!
good,"A typical day is on the road traveling visiting multiple accounts to conduct various training classes why keeping up with a multitude of emails and calls from both internal & external partners. The position requires constant learning of new products/services, new company directives, and improving your sales skills dealing with different levels of customers. Management is mostly hands off allowing you the freedom to direct your schedule and conduct your business as you see fit. Interaction with your co-workers is paramount as they help setup training classes with partners as well as provide feedback on the training that has been delivered. The hardest part of the job is the amount of travel both in state and out of state every week not lending to a proper work/life balance. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with your co-workers to educate/motivate partners to sell more and help improve your skills for the next position within the company."
good,"I felt like I was back in high school. My co-workers would throw balls, candy, really anything at each other and over cubicles. I felt I could not turn around without the whole building knowing in five seconds. It just was not an enjoyable environment to work in. The actual work was not as bad as I had imagined. The hardest part was trying to remember all the information I was required to give to the customer while they were cursing, their kids were screaming, or they were just simply trying to get off the phone. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to bond with my small training class and having a steady income."
good,"to many things to do a tipical day at work. I learned to be patient and was wonderful opportunity to accept the challenge to develop many skills in the same time and put in practice every day all time. I learned to work with diversity of characters and background. The hardest part of the job was fire personal but some times is necessary , the most enjoyable part of the job was when the technician reach the most high incentive (Platinum)"
good,"The day starts with a huddle, which the manager for that day will fill us in on our duties for that. After that we gather equipment or sometimes equipment is already loaded by other manangers. We then go the the vans look up the daily shedule of installs and repairs."
good,"Revision de Facturas,programacion de embarques por la mañana o al inicio del mes,"
good,Good company to work in a routine day work. Have learned DTH business in depth. Management is supportive and pro-active. Co-workers are friendly and helping hand. Hardest part is to understand STB trading. Insustry is good to work.
good,"Fast paced, great teaching and learning techniques."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Its your typical call center work, repetitive, dehumanizing, and soul crushing. Dish knows this and tries their best to make it bearable, but the nature of the work will leave you mentally and emotionally drained at the end of the day. The pay and benefits are decent for the work you'll be doing. The training does a decent job of preparing you for the work, but a human can only take so much mental abuse before burning out."
good,Es una buena empresa puntual y sería. Solo falta que el salario sea un poco más alto.
good,"They have let the greed of money get in the way, and are focused less on the customer and more on sales. On the other hand for the most part you are your on supervisor in the field. You will see your supervisor every once in a while in the field, more so at first and then less and less as time goes on."
good,"I really enjoyed working at dish in port st lucie because of how friendly my management and other employees were. Everyone was treated with respect from the regional mangers to the entry level newbies. If youre competitvie, good at sales and want to make decent money this is a good job. However, i am not a sales person, and the quotas to make seemed to just continue to increase which made the job very stressful for me,  while i was juggling extra responsibilities after a family tradgedy. Great team though."
good,Company is changing. Goals are changing. Job security isn't great if you are in support departments. Pay is average. Not much career advancement unless you are willing to relocate to Colorado.
good,You learn alot but they ask too much from you for the little pay given. They say customer satisfaction is priority but in reality sales is. Cool benefits cool people but management not too trustworthy really shady.
good,"You're hired and trained as a salesman. That's right, in-home upselling is required on all service calls. You are required to sell on a minimum PERCENTAGE OF jobs, and a minimum dollar AMOUNT PER job, and the quota increases each year. Regardless of performance as an installer you will be fired for lack of sales. Quotas doubled within two years."
good,Decent place to work a lot of on the job training but be prepared for long days and sales goals. Also if you can’t carry a 32 ft ladder solo and are afraid of heights this is not the job for you. They are always evolving and trying new things so their is a lot to learn.
good,The management act like they care but in the end you are just a number. I was with them for over 4 years and in the end was going through family issues and they offered nothing to help me which lead to me being let go.
good,Even for full time employees there are rough patches in the year with little work and you may be sent home due to not having any work to do. Lots of overtime available if you're willing to travel.
good,"It was a good environment to work in, the employees were very friendly and the management tried to make you feel comfortable as long as it fit the companies needs."
good,"Very traditional corporate environment, determined by the founding Chairman. Founding Chairman still influences the company on a day-to-day basis, which is unique for a company of the size. He is a visionary, but has some old-school rules. Very good place to get quality work experience without much work experience before. People either stay for 10+ years or only 2 years. Upper management directs all business decisions."
good,"In a typical day at DISH you speak with 40-50 customers and attempt to keep them from leaving to go to another company. Most of the customers are pleasant, but many are upset with something the company did and there is no solution to fix their issue. Pay is based on hourly ($14-$18) plus bonuses and no-cap commission."
good,Dish is a great company to work for. Hours are nice for work/life balance and the company culture is fun and laid back. My only con is there are certain stipulations that make the turn over rate very high and employee retention impossible. There are no sick days. Only PTO and each unpaid absence gets you an attendance point. 8 points is grounds for termination. That would be understandable but they assign a full attendance point for each late occurrence as well There are also tiers that employees receive when disclosures are read verbatim or if misinformation is given. Added to the attendance points it makes it very easy to terminate often.
good,"I enjoyed working at dish, but there was no growth for me at the time. Still, I had an awesome supervisor who honestly made it a good place for me to work until I had to advance in life and eventually found something else."
good,"Depending on the day, you are liable to get any number of different answers to a single question. No consistency, things always changing with no notice."
good,Working with Dish was okay. Except there was a change in the way management handled many things. Very focused on tech numbers rather than job quality.
good,"Working at DISH provided opportunities to expand my knowledge, skills, and abilities; it was a fun place to work and i enjoyed working with some of the best supervisors I've every had."
good,"I prefer the technician lifestyle, but having to take advantage of people to make high sales goals as an installation tech got too ridiculous. Long gone are the days of ""doing a good job and taking pride in your work."" These days its all about how much extra money you can wring from your customers in dish's all-out chug toward their 2020 5G release. Coworkers and direct management were fantastic, and the office attitude was great, and if you're the kind of person that can nerd out on overpriced, mid-grade TV peripherals and transfer that energy to your customers, you'll get along just fine, but I personally lost interest in constantly badgering people for things they didn't need, just to be badgered by management for not doing enough when I had nothing but good reviews from customers. Also be prepared for weird long videos of the higher-ups talking about how great they are and gesturing with closed fists like lunatics."
good,"It is one that challenges your desire for success and your work ethics and culture, it provides opportunities for you to meet others and grow your understand in the fields you end up in."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Always talking to customer. Showing care for their need.Always interact with customers and show them  new technology. I spent the majority of the time standing and talking  to people.
good,"Dish provided me with all the tools and equipment that I needed to do my job, and they gave me a very generous amount of time to adjust to the work. I would gladly work there again, and I would recommend the company to anyone."
good,"Tienen capacitación constante debido a los cambios que genera la empresa, pero es un lugar muy pesado para trabajar, por ejemplo solo se tienen 10 minutos en todo el turno para ir al baño, no sólo es atención a clientes, también debes saber algo de ventas ya que te exigen que vendas un promedio mensual, es un poco estresante el ambiente laboral."
good,"Exiting, fun, challenging sometimes"
good,aprendi aa gestionar alos clientes usar herramientas
good,Decent work environment. Not a lot of room for advancement. Pay was decent. Very fast paced environment. People were very good to work with. Could have had better supervisors.
good,"Working with this company made me grow and learned so much. Being able to work with different people and different cultures made me so open-minded. However, at times it is required for you to work much that you forget to balance between life and work. I love the people who I work with back when I was still working with the company."
good,Overall lack of management skills from Office Manager at the time of being hired on. At time of interview process was unaware of travel for training. Lack of leadership or motivation from office Manager at time of hire.
good,"Company needed to better understand their customers.  Do a better job of matching technicians to appropriate jobs.  Work to better serve employees in areas other than free cable.  Immediate supervisors and store manager were great, regional manager not so much.  They don't provide enough educational support to ensure employees are properly doing jobs.  Feedback is usually minimal to the employee, however the individual judging the prior jobs would give detailed information to management.  They also were pushing too hard to attempt to connect with other companies, this all while the cable/paid television market is dying.  They did provide excellent technology related to the job and genuinely seemed to care about technicians well being during harsh weather."
good,If they would've stayed open I would be still been working their. They had awesome culture and everyone knew everyone and we had social events all the time.
good,The company came in and shut down the site soon after I started to work. The site managers were great but the upper management did not care about the people producing the results they required.
good,"Many times I felt that the company pushed numbers/metrics over customer satisfaction and support.  Sometimes doing what's right for the customer would negatively impact your job performance, and that isn't right."
good,"DISH Network is an ever-changing company that gives excellent benefits and incentives for it's employees. It prides itself on growth and ""adventure"" within the company and allows for its employees a degree of independence while you are working. Overall a good company to work for. Stressful for those that have families and a lack of personal time outside work."
good,"It's a job, you get paid. Your experience with the company will be heavily dependent on the team you join so be sure to ask about the culture of the team."
good,dish  isnt a bad place to work if you can deal with constant changes with scheduling. Work/life balance is not very easy when your schedule is different from day to day and week to week
good,"dish network is a good job for the time being but not a good career. Teaches you a lot of technical skills when it comes to tv services, sales practices and customer services. Due to a unreasonable sales goal while also having unreasonable metrics to make at the same it is easy to be frowned upon through higher ups."
good,"My time at Dish was good in many ways and difficult in others. The job itself is very difficult, to be on the phones 24/7 and the treatment from customers is very damning. Dish did try to create opportunities for work life balance, however they have a very random way of shift scheduling and there is almost no way of getting out of shift that you get dealt, weather you have to pick up children, go to school, things of that nature, you really need to have availability, shifts also change every 3 months. In the way of support and benefits, benefits and pay are great, wonderful!.. However, support is difficult at times.. It's kind of like high school all over again. If you're in with the cool crowd and managers you'll have all the support you need, if you're new or you're not quite in, then you're not on your own, but you have to work 3 times harder to get help with problems or unique situations and when you do ask for help, it's clearly frowned upon."
good,Great work area and people to work for and with. Great opportunity in the work place if you are willing to work for it. Attendance is key as to any job.
good,It was a decent place to work they just don't pay enough for all the hours you work and the conditions u have to work in. I didn't enjoy crawling around under houses with snakes or going attics with spiders.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"No communication or proper forecast that creates an abundant"
good,It's a good job if you stick with it but it's very demanding on hours and has a high turn over rate. pays well but for the 1st 4-6months you'll have to cut throat sell and out do everyone to get the schedule you want. The customers are very rude and annoying
good,"very stressful position, constant incoming phone calls, customers mad because their service was interrupted because they had not paid their bills. Continuous beat down from customers."
good,Overall a good job to work with very good people. Management is in need of better training or new people in charge. Attendance policy is very strict and not very flixible. I would recommend dush as a place to work.
good,la empresa ya cerro actualmente se encuentran dirigidos a otro giro de comercio
good,Job was alright but got boring. Co workers were great but executives could not care less about you. pay was decent but not great. Opportunity for advancement but you would ALWAYS need to relocate
good,Es un buen. Empleo con buen ambiente te laboral pero muy desgastante mentalmente
good,"Dish offers many opportunities to advance, as long as you work hard and network as much as possible. You will want to get to know as many people as possible and build strong professional relationships with them, without networking and communication it can take years to move anywhere. The hardest part about working there is having a work life balance, mandatory overtime is common and managers will hold off on giving agents that information until 3 days before it's needed. It's best to keep up with current events in the media like channel takedowns, boxing events, competitive company issues so you can be prepared for what's coming. Often times you'll see what is coming before your leadership team decides to fill you in."
good,Typical day would be getting incoming calls from the customers wanting to order service. I would ask them about what shows or channels they look at the most and set them up with the best option for their price and channel preference. Would do a background check to see if they qualified not to pay up front . Liked when you have TV shows in common and how many channels were out there.
good,"Have to say that benefits are probably the best part of the job. Expectation are rarely consistent, changes constantly. It is often said at Dish the only thing that is constant at Dish is change. High level of turn over because this and stress level for higher level personnel can be pretty high but that is where people want to be for the better pay."
good,"Las prestaciones son buenas, las jornadas laborales son en ocaciones prolongadas, pagan viaticos, tienes la oportunidad de crecimiento con un año de antiguedad."
good,"different type of caller you will experience but still end of the call you have to solve the client concern and giving them a assurance,to work with them its a team, a team that you have a big role that any one of the member will not perform its like a boat that it will not run instead it will sink.hardest time sometimes if got a call which dead end no resolution i mean still you have to think how will this call will end up in nice and proper way. team building is one of the enjoyable part which no call just relax and chill with your team mate."
good,Nice place to work. Management was always helpful. People there were always nice. Job was easy to understand and complete and full time was good pay!!
good,Training was really fun and experience was great. Being able to come in and train for extra experience on off days was good to get practice on service loops and connections.
good,"As a leader in TV technology Dish was very fast paced and always looked to develop new technology and keep their employees informed and involved. To excel at Dish, it did require more than the standard 40 hour work week."
good,"A typical day of work starts and ends quickly. When you arrive in you have a quick huddle with your fellow technicians and manager to give you any new information about products or news within the company.  Then you take your van and any additional equipment you may need throughout the day and begin your route.  Due to the variances in job types, you never have a set time off work.  The company policy though, is to never start a job after 5pm, to ensure you don't stay out too late.  Once you are complete with your route you can go back to the warehouse and complete the day.  You only see your coworkers at those times, but we are always in contact through phone or email in case we have questions of comments to share with each other.  Management has been in flux for the past two years, managers and techs alike have been ""rotating"", which does bring down the morale slightly. Scheduling used to be easy 4 on, 3 off. But due to this new computer scheduler, everything is thrown off, no one knows a set schedule, and it upset a lot of techs who struggle to make your 40 hour workweek while others have overtime."
good,Little bit pressurized job culture. Incoming e-mail flow was high due to which in most of the cases some were just copy and pasted without proper solution. Management was good for which most of the team leaders were very cooperative.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,this job is very active and hands on .typical day includes working on the production line it is a face pace work environment. must be able to stand up for long periods of time.
good,It's very possible to make money in this job but it definitely is not for everyone. Your days will include knocking on doors all day trying to sell Dish Network to customers.
good,Management could be more involved with employees. There are constant schedule changes so be prepared to be very flexible. You have the ability to move up quickly depending on what you put in on a daily basis.
good,Dish overcompensates their benefits for their employees. Customers are rude and disrespectful.  long hours and not enough breaks. Constantly on phone calls back to back.
good,"This was my first job. i learned many things from this job like time management & discipline, good company and healthy environment for freshers to start their first job"
good,"Loved working with the customers. "
good,Good place to work but lacks leadership. It is a fast paced job and many different certifications to achieve. The more certifications the more opportunities to grow within the organization.
good,Dish Network's IT division is a great place to work.  You'll be expected to work hard yet if you apply yourself and seek opportunities you will advance and learn a considerable amount.
good,"DISH is an amazing company to work for! Well the call center is. A typical day is customer service calls with some down time in between. Of course some days are more trying than others but over all its an amazing work environment. Once you get through tech training it is such a breeze! They offer great sales incentives too! They literally give away beats headphones and Michael Kors bags and watches, and all you have to do is sell whatever the incentive is that month. The staff is friendly and for the most part supportive. The only thing I would really say is a con is the management isn't very upfront with you most of the time, and when a channel gets taken down or undergoes negotiations be prepared to be yelled at."
good,"If you're willing to not have a life the days you work, this is a great place to be. Most schedules have you work until 9-11pm. Must be okay with sitting down for long periods of time as when you're taking calls there isn't much to do for busy-bodies. The management is great, if you put in effort, they'll do all they can to help you succeed. Dish certainly appears to be the most customer-focused Pay-TV company in the market. Hardest part of the job is balancing your life with such long/late hours at the call center and having the patience with all of your customers day in and day out. Pay and benefits make it easy to stay."
good,The day begins with a team meeting followed by uploading of all systems. The day continues from there with us taking phone calls to provide our customers with whatever solutions we can apply to their current situation. That is a consistent theme throughout the course of the day with brief intermissions to see how everyone is progressing throughout the day. I may learn new techniques and listening skills to apply to situations as well as rebuttals. My goal is to earn 12 sales a day and i work with my manager to help me accomplish that. The hardest part of the job is not being able to control what types of calls you receive. The most enjoyable part is the camaraderie and relationship built within the team. We help each other overcome obstacles.
good,"This was a call center job.  As long as you can handle people yelling at you over the phone for things you have no control over, the pay and environment are not too bad."
good,Great place to work for as an entry level job and great opportunities for advancement. It was a good place to work for and management was very helpful.
good,"Friendly colleagues as long you are not sharing personal information of your life with them. Overall okay pay rate; customers can sometimes be trying, if you let it roll off your shoulder you should be fine."
good,"DISH Network call center included a variety of possible calls, each with their own unique challenges. While at DISH, I fielded calls for Billing, Retention, Technical, and General Customer Service. DISH would have contract disputes with various program providers from time to time and we would commonly field calls from very unsatisfied customers. Technical calls would involve trouble-shooting equipment and finding out why services were not operating as they should. Retention calls involved working with customers who want to disconnect their services and trying to keep them from leaving DISH."
good,"Good Job with excellent benefits, but I'm the kind of guy that needs to be moving around and not glued to a desk chair.  The hour lunch and break time is great as well."
good,It can be stressful with so many call and angry costumers and troubleshooting.Sometimes the costumers are not very helpful with the troubleshooting and it just makes it harder.
good,I really love this job they were great and we had a lot of fun speaking to our customers. I really learned great customer interaction and management was always great. There are many different languages at this workplace so understanding everybody was a bit difficult.
good,"Es un trabajo muy sano y sin preciones me divierto mucho cada dia  y me agrada trabajar para esta empresa  "
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"reviewed installation specification, building permits, manufacturers instructions to determine installation site. replace and repair defective parts.installation for residential and commercial accounts throughout Houston"
good,"call center is constantly hiring, but yet just reduced hours of operation. does not put you at ease while you work. has not kept a site director, even, for the last two years."
good,"Great way to build up to a career, you can advance quickly and earn a hefty paycheck based on overtime. I would recommend working here."
good,"fun environment, yet very hectic when it came down to communication and all the stress. Not a lot of people came to that mall. There was a lot of customer issues with previous employees and I had to fix it. work everyday with no hourly pay just commission."
good,"My Last company was Icici Bank ltd .i was working there under I-Process servicess india P Ltd as CPA Manager .My work experience was good now i want to join any finacial company like NBFS and Bank .I am not interested to join any of BPO jobs "
good,"I came to Dish, lured like a moth to a flame by their base salary, full time hours, and benefits."
good,I learned that you can be the driver of your own development. This was a place that it wasn't who you knew but what you knew. However hardest part of job was being over worked in a leadership position.
good,"aprendi a capturar mas rapido datos, tomar llamadas y resolver dudas de los clientes, la parte dificil mucha presion de clientes y soportar malas palabras de los clientes sin poder colgar la llamada lo bueno amistades muy buenas y perdurables"
good,Typically a good place to work. Need some improvement on some of their process and management can improve on there people skills
good,A typical day is taking sales calls and answering any questions or concerns a customer has about internet service for a variety of broadband suppliers. I learned to hone my sales skills in a non traditional sales environment. The hardest part about the job was not being able to help customers in person. The most enjoyable part was providing outstanding customer service as wells as high sales volume.
good,"I loved working for Dish Network. I had a set schedule with great hours and I knew what to expect every day at work. The overall atmosphere of the call center was fun and upbeat. The general manager went above and beyond for all the employees by having areas in the center where you were able to play video games, enjoy snacks, and just hang out on your breaks and lunches."
good,Aqui en el trabajo el respetar a los compañeros y su espacio de trabajo hizo que hubiera un excelente ambiente de trabajo asi como un trabajo en equipo el apoyo a los compañeros asi como a uno mismo logro un gran resultado
good,Some positions have flexible schedules. Great co-workers. Some people in management are difficult to work with/for.
good,Very fast paced  and a lot of customer interaction.  You had to wear a lot of different hats for long periods of time.
good,getting tecnichians out and about for installing.
good,"My experience with Dish Networks(Digital Reception Services) is both good and bad. I worked for Dish Networks as a Field Technician for only 6 months, but in that 6 months I was disappointed with many things on how the company ran. The work was never ending, worked from 7am to typically 7-8pm; sometimes even later to almost 11pm. The pay wasn't worth all the hard work you go through, $10hr with no raises unless you make almost perfect scores on their made up commission table for 3 months straight. Which only brings it up $1hr. Co-works are great and the Management was great as well. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting a company vehicle and being able to work alone out in the field."
good,A typical day at work can either be a hard day or a easy day depends on your custormers and jobs. I learned how to install satellite. Management is good. Co-workers are great. The hardest part is the jobs. The most enjoyable is being able to travel to different areas.
good,"In working for a communications company who provides TV I learned that everything is about money, the companies who fight to save you money, and those who are willing to lose a portion of its fan base to gain more money. The co-workers at Dish are some of the best people you can find, from former doctors and nurses to Ex-Mcdonalds employees, we all come together to help one another achieve success. The hardest part of the job is the ever changing environment on the phone calls to the actual environment around you. You have to be able to adapt to survive. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to take the most angry person you've spoke to all day and making them smile with the help you've just provided them. Certainly very rewarding."
good,A typical day at work was easy and interesting. I learned alot about satellite receivers. Management had poor communitication skills with direct employees. I enjoyed my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was job advancement was difficult and the lack of communication with management.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Good if you like being outside all day co-workers are help full and the management is ok
good,"Work is easy but difficult (labor wise). You have to deal with a 31ft ladder all by your self almost everyday. The starting pay isn’t worth the jobs we have to deal with everyday. Other companies are paying similar pay with much easier workload. There is a path for promotion and better pay, but it’s a steep path. Managers are amazing and they will do their very best to help reach that promotion, but like I said it’s a steep path."
good,"A typical day at DISH allows you to clock in up to 5 mins early, but not a second after the time you're scheduled. Overall, I learned quite a bit involving their equipment and different television setups.The on-site management and the environment at DISH is the best part of my time there, the hardest part being the overall influx of negativity and stress from the customers."
good,Not much to say really good place to start off in telecommunication for someone that is there first job. Good working place for everyone that is interesting
good,La empresa te exige mucho tiempo más de lo del contrato y aveces no lo vale por lo que pagan
good,"Worked there for little less than a year, training was great and management was great. But I was never home, just wasn't for me! Great place for others though I'd recommend."
good,Dish was a great place to work but was not expecting the layoff. it left me a little unprepared. The management and people i worked with were great and i will miss working here.
good,"Too much sales push on technicians that are trying to get installation and customer requirements completed.  Technicians ARE NOT SALESMEN.  Sorry, but If there was more Electrical opportunity, then I would stay."
good,"The job is fun? There’s free food. Very high stress. Depending on who your lead is, your metrics can break you. The attendance policy is strange, but they do let you borrow against pto which is different. Also, switching shifts within the entire enterprise, no matter where you are, is also cool. But it is a very very high stress job."
good,Dish TV a  good palce to work. I have learnt a lot in my association with Dish TV.  Stability and JOB security factors are there in this company. overall it's a good employer
good,"Overall, I had a great run with Dish. Most managers are willing to help you out if you ask them, and the other good techs are awesome and go above and beyond to help you. Around the time I started, in home sales started to become a big deal, which was not the case when I interviewed for the position. When I left, sales were overwhelming every other facet of the job. The minimum sales expectation nearly tripled for the techs with a lot of techs at my office resigning or getting fired over it. It no longer matters if you work fast with high overall quality if you cant sell on every single job. All my ratings other than sales were nearly perfect, but that wasn't enough to keep management from breathing down my neck. If you apply, be aware that you are now a salesman first and a tech second."
good,Good pay but very competitive work environment. You work 4 days a week but has mandatory overtime during busy parts of the year. You can work out of your house but have to go into office once a week.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo  y  me gusto el trabajo algo divertido
good,"Worked for this company for over two years and its extremely stressful. Your schedules are based off of your performance , they are constantly changing the system around , they have zero consideration for people with kids. Customers call in everyday yelling  , cussing , doing anything they please and you have to take it. If your okay with sitting in front of a computer for 8+ hours a day getting cussed out and yelled at then go for it."
good,"They try hard to make sure you like it at Dish. Unfortunately, you are working for a dying industry and for me personally, it was hard to convince people to keep their cable."
good,"Dish provides excellent training, benefits and opportunity for advancement, but you will work 12 to 14 hours per day and 5 days per week during busy season.  That sets new employees up for job burn out pretty quick in my opinion.  Estimated time to complete the job falls short of what it really takes to do the job right.  There is a very strong push to sell smart home services and products.   You are reminded each day to sell, sell, sell.  I'm just too honest, I'm not going to sell a 40.00 HDMI cable to a customer if they don't need it.  Or protection plan the covers more that necessary.  Many jobs were service calls and I found and corrected problems from the previous installer in many cases.   The result of being rushed and cutting corners due to time constraints.  I'm old school and work hard to do it right the first time even if it means taking a little extra time."
good,It was a great place to work with great one on one relationships with fellow employees....Everyone always got along and would help each other out.. overall i would say it is a good employer.
good,Worked there for a year and moved up to level 2 tech within a few months and was able to get a slight pay increase. The hours are a bit crazy and never very stable. My office worked on a A shift/ B shift schedule. Each shift was supposed to have at least one weekend day off but a lot of times this didn't happen because at the time I worked there they were short on techs which made for plenty of overtime. Also at this job you can finish work at 4 one day and at 10 PM the next day depending on what services they schedule you for.
good,Good place to learn about manufacturing . The engineering department was great to work with. They were all very helpful and knowledgeable. The company seemed to underpay engineers compared to national average though.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,they dont work with your schedule at all. the training is adequate and you learn alot in a little bit of time but it really takes 4 months to tell if you like it or not. the pay is not enough for the job you do and it takes way to much to get a promotion. the company policy on being late or calling out is way too much and will cause trouble they constantly rotate though technicians so dont expect to be there long.
good,its a great company to work for to learn about the industry. only draw back was they want you to be salesman in addition to be a tech. not comfortable being in someones home and forced to have to try and sell them additional products. i'm a tech not a sales rep
good,"Horarios de oficina flexibles y muy comodos, rotacion de turnos y capacitacion constante"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, respetuosos, hay valores, te enseñan bien y te brindan la confianza para desempeñar las funciones que te corresponden."
good,It was fun and competitve. Very friendly environment albeit a bit stressful. Learnt many new skills that could be applied to other jobs. They're able to work around your schedule.
good,"This job provides you all the benefits you can ask for and pays extremely well. However, you must be very flexible to work and meet customer demands.."
good,Typical  work day involves taking back to back calls every day 100-150 for the veterans. Learned excellent customer services skills as a result. Pay was horrendous but improved a bit later. Hardest part of the job i scheduling and the constant mandatory overtime.
good,Good part is learning about new technology and benefits the company provide.it could be dangerous at time climbing roof top in winter time.really friendly enviroment
good,"Best money you will make in the area without manual labor or dealing with sick people. Great people to work with but when they say the schedule is flexible, what they mean is you better have a flexible schedule because you better not miss and they do have mandatory overtime."
good,LOts of incentives to employess great place to work  associate discounts and great prices on movie packages flexible schedules fun place to work ok management
good,"First thing in the morning, I would log in the computer to see where I'm being routed. I plan my day according to the jobs I get. I may get a couple installs to do and a couple of repairs. At the end of the week, I restock all the inventory that I need in my van."
good,not only do u have to do your job but you also have to sell products and services to customers on every job and they ride you pretty hard about it sales seem to be all the company cares about
good,"Improved Technical Skills , as well as Soft skills."
good,It was a fun fast paced sales environment. Commission based job. Extremely high turn over rate for employees. Excellent training and very knowledgeable managers.
good,"I signed on with Dish to get away from retail sales at a home improvement store.  I was lured to the job with the description of being paid for good, consistent work.  After being there for two months, the focus took a dramatic turn.  After four months we barely talk about quality work or how much work we're doing.  It's all sales now and if you don't make consistent sales you won't get raises.  Overall the work isn't bad but you better like working outdoors and in people's weird and sometimes disgustingly dirty houses.  Management tries to look out for you but there's only so much they can do.  Again, if you don't like sales then don't work for DISH.  But if you're good with sales then DISH isn't too bad."
good,"each day is unique. you never know how or when your day will end. "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to help families across the country save money and to be properly compensated for your skills and efforts
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"My day starts at 6:00 AM. I route technicians and reject or accept jobs in TN region. Jobs must be routed by 7:00 AM. Have anywhere from 15-55 technicians that I oversee on a daily basis. This include troubleshooting with techs, reviewing job photo submissions, helping with installs, and managing technician scorecards based on performance. Co-workers are hard working, very driven individuals. I enjoy helping technicians, troubleshooting IT issues, dealing with customers, and the fact that every day has a different feel to it. Job presents many challenges, but working through those challenges are rewarding."
good,"A typical day at work is filled with answering customer calls.Attempting to resolve incoming call issues, explain and resolve billing inquires. Assist customers in technical issues that can be done by the customer in their home. Suggestive selling of upgrades and new equipment."
good,los dias eran normales mas experiencia  casi no se me complicaba nada tenia buena relacion con mis compañeros
good,"I loved working at Dish. Its hard taking phone calls 8 hours a day, but employees are well compensated. They make it fun and offer a lot of great incentives. However they do have mandatory ET, while its great getting time and a half its also inconvenient to be told you'll have to stay an hour later in the middle of your shift."
good,excelente centro de atención para salus mental y crecimiento personal de profesionistas involucrados en el área de  phsycología.
good,"As a Dr. Dish agent for Dish, I was helping customers by resolving their issues over the phone. Sometimes resolving their issues meant that I had to schedule a technician visit or to send a replacement receiver."
good,"This is okay if You like a constantly changing work environment, like the outdoors, and cold sales."
good,"Having a job in sales with Dish network can be great, or it can be rough. Its up to you."
good,"Assist customers with what ever they were in need of: billing, tech support, programming and general information"
good,"I would start off in a team meeting, from there I would take phone calls answering general inquiries, helping with billing questions, along with assisting customers with technical issues."
good,Installing and trouble shooting. Managment was good. Its a good place to learn about technical equipment.
good,Answering customers' questions regarding Dish Network service. Performing credit checks and offering the appropriate promotions.
good,"You have to be a special type of person to work here. It is a better job for a single person with no life, but it is a job none-the-less. The benefits are awesome and they will work with you but it is very stressful."
good,The promotion requirements depend mainly on customers you have no control and management will not help to fix any issues on most of the reviews customers give
good,great hours. good place to work. I worked in the warehouse and thus far has been my favorite job. Upper management needs some work. I really don't know what else to say
good,They micromanage everything you do and they expect you to way more than your job description requires and they expect you to also keep up with your normal duties
good,"Great money , great benefits. Stressful environment to be in . Walking on egg shells . Customers are ignorant and racist but that’s besides the point . Dish wants their employees to be robots ."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Resolved customer issues. Some where harder than other. But that was my job and I was going to the best at it. Some customers require more help. Some customers just want to pay their bill.
good,"I'm not into the whole you must sell and keep your numbers high to keep your job, you gotta work fast cause your timed if you take too long on a work order that's not good it will cont against you"
good,"Dish is one of the most stressful jobs you could have not because of the work or the culture, but because of the customers and rules. They are very specific about being late or being absent."
good,"I enjoyed work there. Unfortunately they had to let me go after a 1 years and 5 months. My hours where 4:00a.m to 2:30p.m in the afternoon and I had Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off with some mandatory overtime."
good,"very stressful days, LONG hrs, for the work we need to make more money per hr. we go to some nasty places. no life out side of work 7:10am to when ever your done with your route"
good,Its a great place to work when they don't lay off over 100 people. But other than that the managers and co-workers are amazing everyone is really nice and the pay is wonderful.
good,"Dish Is a hard core place to grow, however when the budget comes in and they have to cut they give those under a performance improvement plan unlimited time off and then they have no way of improving their stats so therefor it is grounds to let them go. Called ""essential time off"" they HAVE to take it."
good,Dish works hard to have a fun and supportive environment .you will work hard and be expected to hit certain numbers to keep your job.i wouldn't work there again but I made some really cool friends
good,Dish was a very good place to work if I could get back in I would. Loved this job. Their benefits we're also amazing. This job was a past job and kept you moving.
good,"Attending to daily routines and more"
good,"Fun job, must be good with hands and able to work at ridiculous breakneck pace, they focus on safety all the time, all vehicle expenses are taken care of by company (except in independent cases where damages are your fault) You restock your vehicle, clean your vehicle, work out of your van, install dishes and cables and cable boxes. Problem is, when jobs are weighted in points by how much work is expected to be at each job (which is impossible to know until you get there because you may have to rip out and redo a whole house for a job that's only rated for a half hour) or you may have to drive an hour each way and thus kills your productivity. As someone who follows quality standards to a t, it's simply impossible to achieve the standards they want, and that's not to mention the extra half hour at each job using cheap sales tactics to sell stuff to customers if they want a demo or not. At one point I was clocking 90 hours a week and yet I still got ""why is your productivity so low."" Just another example of corporate greed, but this is America."
good,Dish network is not a bad place to work if you do not mind being graded almost u fairly based on performance. The management team is very fair and understanding. They promote from within and if you work hard there is definitely opportunity for advancement.
good,"It’s what you make of it here at dish. I made met some wonderful  people here, my coach andtL was cool, if you do good you will be able to move up. For the amount of calls I do think they pay pretty low... Got a lot of food, bonuses, and different schedules to pick from. Able to watch tv while working on the phones .. wasn’t to bad of a job ....especially if ur team/building hitting the mark and doing good .."
good,They really really talk up how much you're going to make. You get taxed more because it is commission and it's not super super easy to get overtime like they claim.
good,It's an ok job. Expect too much. Very stressful. Preference scheduling after training so that's really inconvenient. I'm currently going back to school and the preference schedules do not work around my school schedule at all. I also live an hour away.
good,"muy buen ambiente de trabajo, y gran oportunidad de crecimiento."
good,"The benefits are great including free Dish, however they will work you to death and constantly change your work schedule and not notify you until the change is withing a week or two away. It makes it hard to plan anything outside of work or to find childcare."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is just how fast paced it is and how I have goals to meet, and the people that I work with are very helpful with each other or to new employees."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Un dia de trabajo normal presentarme en oficinas puntual antes de las 9 a.m, reporte de ventas, entrega de contratos, checar cuentas de clientes activas, por pronto pago, telemarkitin, bitacora de clientes diaria, prospectar, salir a zona de trabajo antes de las 10 30 am . Visitar colonias invitar a los prospectos a adquir los servicios, cerrar ventas. En general en eso consistia mi trabajo en mi ultima empresa. y en las anteriores generalmente era lo mismo, lo que varia en si es el producto que vendes y las zonas de trabajo."
good,"I loved the job that I done along with the awesome benefits of this job. However, management is AWFUL! Unfortunately when you went into work you didn't know whether you would get off at your scheduled time or you would be forced to stay way past your scheduled time or you would be fired."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of sitting down and taking 30-50 phone calls a day, as expected from from a call center job.  Most enjoyable part of the day was the whole day, socializing with everyone.  The employees are very down to earth, etc."
good,Cool place to make money... do not become complacent and make sure you're a self motivated individual.... be ready to work 50-60+ hours if your looking to make 60k+... YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO SALE.... ABC!!!!!
good,"Dish es una empresa fuerte en el mercado de las telecomunicaciones, su ambiente de trabajo es bueno, poca cercanía con los gerentes y directores, pero como empresa puedo decir que su producto es  bueno y que es una buena opcion para adquirir su producto, dia de trabajo es agradable, atendiendo a las personas que se acercan a preguntar o expresar una queja y como empleado es ayudar a resolver dicha inconformidad"
good,venta de televisión de paga ofreciendo a si un servicio de calidad a todos sus suscriptores a si mismo siendo una empresa comprometida con sigo misma
good,I spent the day troubleshooting and installing dish network systems and selling products to the customers during onsite visits. Worked out of a centralized warehouse and reported to two field service specialists who supervised our productivity.
good,"customers are rude, but every now and then you can win a tv, video gaming equipment, cameras, kindles  etc."
good,"Nice team "
good,Long Hours on the phone in a 10 Hour work shift. I learned dealing with angry customers in a reasonable fashion. Management is tolerable. Co workers are always insightful. Hardest part of job was accommodation life outside of work.
good,Ability to retain customers with save offers. Good interaction with co-workers.  Friendly environment. Team meeting on product knowledge and offers.
good,"Dish is a routine work, you take calls all day talking to customers about the same questions or problems with their television service. My co-workers and supervisor is what helped my day either go back quicker or made it seem much longer. I learned that when in a postive environment my days seemed less stressful and shorter. The hardest part of the job is consistantly providing high quality customer service, when you get off of a bad call with a high escalated customer its hard not to carry that over to the next customer. You basically have to reset yourself after every call and get ready for whatever the next customer is going to throw at you. The most enjoyable part of the job is training or one on one time with your supervisor because its time off the phone. The managers try to bring up the moral of the call center by offering sell incentives, but being a Advance Tech Support representative you don't get as much of a chance to sell since customers just want their problem fixed and to get off the phone as quickly as possible."
good,"job is simple, while i was on the floor for the first couple of week the supervisor advised me not to inform the member of the info on there account due to escalation reason, i advised them they end up calling back later even more mad due to the of info given. i dont like how they advised me to take care of them member. i quite due to the care of the members with dish."
good,I love the experience I gained just over being stuck on the phones all day want to interact and move around
good,"desde que entrabas a la empresa te daban capacitaciones de la como tratar al cliente como hacer que le interese lo que le ofreces. los colegas muy competitivos.. eso es emocionante, todos a un solo objetivo una meta, como todo ay personas inconformes después de un tiempo, pero si ay algo que aprendí es el cliente siempre tiene la razon"
good,"I loved interacting with lots of people there every day. "
good,get up and be at first job site by 8am .hardest thing is i think is trying to  work with upset custmers . when you get to job sometimes they take their anger out on you.i think they think since you work for them they can take everything out on you.when sometimes the only problem is that alot of techs are not fully trained on trouble shooting.
good,Dish is pretty ok well atleast the place I worked at anyway. The job itself is not hard at all. If you like helping people then you might found a home. Other workers will give you the chance to help. Great work environment and the other employees are fun as well. 
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,They had a good management team and i enjoyed cross training.
good,"They walk you through the call center and brag about how they are the best in the industry. No matter your prier experience, you have to start out as a customer service rep then work your way up. They do offer good benefits and a lot of incentives."
good,"I loved the people, you could be yourself and have fun. Definitely no schedule flexibility or WFH. Executive leadership was a little too involved in lower level management duties (tracking who arrived late or left early)."
good,Great atmosphere. Offers many benefits and discounts. Management is always on hand to provide you with feedback. offer Monday thru Thursday or weekend shifts.
good,"The hours you worked on a typical day are 10+, bi-weekly pay. Managers were nice and respectful they knew their job and know how to manage. Most managers started as a technician."
good,"Buen empleo, prestaciones superiores a las de la ley, falta igualdad entre áreas."
good,I truly enjoyed working for dish but it is ever hard 2 get an interview & hired Once you have a job with dish under no circumstances lose the job because you will never get the chance to go back to work
good,"The company offers a great opportunity for advancement, great compensation package, give you the chance of working beyond your normal hours, at least 10 hours of overtime per week."
good,A very good place to be employed if you are okay with repetitive work. Customers can be hard to handle sometimes and 11 hour shifts are difficult.
good,"A typical day consists of answering incoming calls and helping customers resolve billing and/or technical issues with their satellite tv service, and helping them troubleshoot their technical issues or setting up a technician appointment if necessary, notating the customer's account. Management was pretty solid. Coworkers were alright. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers."
good,"the typical day consisted of going in at 5 a.m. and working 12 hours shift-third shift.I learned to do my job in a very professional way; as far as management is concerned, there is always a need for improvement in the way they approach the team as a whole and not too much as individuals.got along very well with co-workers; the hardest part was trying to make it at the end with a 12hr. shift. i enjoyed working and that makes it most rewarding."
good,"Typical day at Dish was helping customers with billing concerns, technical support, as in their TV is not getting an input signal and so on,"
good,el ambiente de trabajo es excelente ya que en el grupo todos nos llevamos muy bien y cualqier duda los compañeros
good,Typical day was going to about 3 or 4 customers homes and installing or troubleshooting their service. I learned how to build a satellite and be able to do an installation from scratch. Hardest part of the job was the outside elements and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,i would get right under 200 calls a day really fun with other co workers always having pot lucks but hard to explain to customers that have realy low or no experience with a tv remote control
good,"GREAT Oppertunity.Kept track of technicians hours, mileage, time they stared and"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Great place to work, comfortable work pace. You are your own manager the majority of the time. However you are required to sell customers products that are not required at an excessively high price. this determines your chances for raises and can be grounds for termination if not at corporate set levels."
good,me divertí Buenos compañeros de trabajo . atender al cliente con amabilidad  Buenas comida
good,"Provided good customer service through one-call resolution. Consistently delighted the customer through communication, caring, competence, commitment and creativity. Handled escalated calls from unhappy customers determining when further escalation was needed."
good,Very supportive an understanding definitely loved the fact that they manage our work and home life as well. Very understanding under any circumstances over all really great place to work at
good,Every Company has its ups and downs like any other company overall I'm happy with the experience working at dish. Since working with Dish I have learned additional skills that I do not have prior to working there.
good,"This company has the employees do a lot to make the customer happy, and does nothing to build up the employees. I left the organization to further my education and to find a better solution for myself in the work force, the company offered my nothing and out of frustration I looked into a job I didn't want to peruse something that I needed."
good,Se maneja por ciclos de cartera y se le maneja diferentes tipos de corte y al msmo tiempo diferentes tipos de descuentos
good,"the company I contracted under was the worst I ever worked for, this being said I have nothing against Dish or Direct TV. I was used for my mini van to transport everyone back and forth to Seattle multiple weekends in a row with little to no fuel compensation. Which means I paid for everyone to go up along with my food, shelter, and anything else. bye the time we got back I was the only one broke. I spent more time driving them around than aprctually getting sales."
good,Hours are long and the pay isn't all that great.. Host lots of events that you can win cool new items. Offers you free basic cable while you are employed with them.
good,"Good people, just not best company. Not willing to work out better fitting schedule. Seems to pick favorites at times. The pay is good, but be ready for changes without letting you know."
good,You take a lot of calls and you have to close sales if you not a good saller you will get fired
good,"Incentives at Dish Network are great. As long as you work hard, you will receive incentives. The moral of the company is very low due to management reminding employees that they are ""replaceable in a heartbeat"""
good,"Started at this company with an positive attitude and then management started making changes that benefit them not the employees that take phones calls. Dish as a company can be good and bad it depends on what you want out of the company, but always keep your eyes opened never know when you will stabbed in the back."
good,While working there as a field service manager  I noticed several things that needed to be changed in order to make it a better place to work and balance home life. This was at least for the Field Service Managers. There were two per shift and initially we worked side by side from 5am to 11 to 12pm per night. I found this to be unrealistic as getting home at midnight or later and having to be back in at 5am was absurd. I spoke with the operations manager and suggested we split up and overlap the shifts. This way one FSM could come in at 5am and get things going and the other FSM would come in at noon. The FSM that came in early would leave at 5pm that week and the other would stay until the last tech returned. This was rotated on a weekly basis. My idea was taken up the chain and approved. I cant see how uper management didn't already see this and have it in place before I started there.
good,I learned how to work with excel and how to do inventory with excel. the hardest part of the job was the driving around so much. The best part of the job was how fast the days seemed to pass.
good,"If you like being yelled at by customers who cant pay their bill, please apply. At first I thought the job would become manageable, it doesnt help with the supervisor wont step in and take customer requested supervisor calls. Good luck"
good,Typical Day: A noisy sales floor with very high expectations.
good,Employed at Dish at a time when the management was fairly new. Management wasn’t organized and in over their heads. I believe if the management has gotten better then it should be no problem there.
good,"Dish would prefer robots to take customers calls. Very strict processes in every position."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Not worth it to work with Dish unless youre an installer, or upper management. They are now getting rid of the 3rd shift, so many people are being laid off."
good,"a normal day called for a schedule to go and install cable for our customers with new or existing services , from new installs to troubleshooting , there would be times when a house would take longer than the time window and the pressure would be on you ."
good,"Great opportunities for advancement"
good,"Not a steady or reliable work place, the co workers were not very friendly, I learned about the products that dish network has to offer and was satisfied with that, but the work place wasn't comfortable because of the managers that ran the location."
good,"Sitting at a desk for 8-10 hours, breaks every 2-3 hours, depending on your shift a 30min-1 hr lunch. Training is 4 weeks, with new training as needed. Management tries to make selves known but not always so helpful. Overtime available often as well as incentives for sales and overtime. Paid time off accrued per pay period. Attendance is strict and on a point system."
good,"Due to having to work at home, I was made to work a split shift...I started @10am, worked 5 hours with a 3 hour break and then finished the last five, this is not what I signed up for.  They knew when they hired me, they were going to transition from call center to work-at-home."
good,Excelente empresa. Beuna ubicacion. Buenas prestaciones y bono de compras. Excelentes herramentas.
good,"The company prides itself on career advancement and growth, but it truly depends on the department you are in and your direct leadership team. Working at DISH is a great opportunity to build your skill set and professionalism. Since this is such a competitive and fast-paced environment, you will do great in any other job you pursue thereafter. You are required to work over 40 hours a week or else it will affect your performance appraisals and ability to move forward in the company. Work/life balance is lacking. You'll be most successful here if you put in the hours, which more often than not benefits those who are single/don't have other priorities."
good,La empresa es muy buena la administración un poco lenta el compañerismo es muy ameno lastima de el interés de la empresa por sus empleado
good,"Dish is a really great company too work for the only issue I have is work/life balance, other than that it is truly a great place too work, you meet a lot of amazing people at Dish."
good,"You always had to be careful what you said.  you made one mistake and you could get fired without a chance to defend yourself.  That is the main reason I left, no job security.  As long as you do your job well though you have potential to make good money."
good,"-read study manuals"
good,"Excellent place to learn multiple skills. You instantly become a human Swiss army knife. The more you advance the more responsibilities you overtake in order to complete tasks. Corporate strives to always do better, but usually lacking due to unwillingness to compensate."
good,"career advancement opportunities within the company is a plus. multi-tasking is  a must, tech savvy and also willing to deal with escalated customers."
good,They never seemed to have a clear understanding of what helping the customer meant. Long hours and little pay out. Being told things are one way and then being Above goal and getting told things are not that way and getting pushed below goal.
good,"Tiene buen ambiente laboral, trabajo bajo precion , se hace responsable de herramienta, unidad, y equipos,"
good,this job is so stressful you need to maintain a percentage and don't mess up if you do you will get fired when working the manager will do nothing just look at the computer
good,There are always that few that ruin the industry for you.  Loved Dish.... my coach.... not so much.  Watch your back and wash your hands.  I ended up with a full 22 oz coffee poured in my purse ruining everything
good,"Daily inventory and stock van."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Responsibilities included running a floor team for technical center practices.  Other tasks performed include training new hires and the Receiver Audit Team for new team established on site, helping establish the F.A.C.T. program for better individual training for floor personnel to improve development, and collaborating with colleagues to improve the quality training materials.		"
good,"I have been very privileged to work with a very talented group of individuals, specifically in the Hilliard Call Center. Management cares about the individuals and ensures that development is being provided. I have learned a lot about management and corporate values while working here. I have developed a lot of ""out of the box"" thinking strategies to be able to perform at a high level in spite of the many restrictions that are set by corporate policies."
good,"Dish is a decent company to work for,but the wage they pay makes it imperative that I bonus on a regular basis and their lousy rules cost me 3K in bonuses in 4 months,so I left."
good,In the interview they were talking about a couple items that they can sale but it is not a requirement.  I am now at a point that I can be fired because I am focusing on the install and not saling a $500 surround sound system  to every poor person I visit. I want to leave there with everyone smiling and that is not the focus of the managers they want you to leave with the customer worrying about how he is going to pay his Bill's now that he has given away half of his income to a sound bar.
good,Very high pressure on employees to work. Team leaders are mis behaving with customer care executive and do not paid for over time in nights. There is no more values of employees.
good,"Dish is a great company but I wouldn’t recommend working for any of the contractors that they branch from. The pay,hours, and cost of tools and materials was just not worth the overall pay."
good,"Dish was a good place to work. However, there isn't much flexibility with scheduling and being corporate they don't work with you if you have to miss work for being sick to often. Also not to family friendly."
good,"I was a work at home specialist for technical support for approximately 2 years. I loved how I can work at home. However, they are constantly changing their systems and call flow But not the reason for leaving. Overall good company with decent pay for El Paso."
good,es un trabajo bien pagado pero no apoyan lo suficiente en las dudas o errores y te generan reportes por lo mismo
good,Helped to develop conflict resolution skills and provided an opportunity to be a strong team player. They strongly uphold promoting within. Was a great opportunity to develop organizational and administrative skills.
good,"Very stressful, little career advancement opportunities, under-pay. Little manager to employee engagement/concern except for your direct manager. Corporate and High managers are very distant."
good,At the local office level the people were great.  I enjoyed working with them everyday.  We all were in it together and would tackle anything in our path.
good,"Over the years I worked there I moved through the ranks from field tech to Operations Manager.  I felt like the environment was good at the local level and there was a lot of support.  As the direction and demands from the upper management increase at times the work life balance for the field would diminish.  You get out of the job what you put in, and I felt that our team worked great together."
good,"The compensation is excellent but there is absolutely no job security what so ever.  You have to be fluid to work for this company, major policies often change numerous times in a weeks time frame."
good,"I can handle northern kerala,specially calicut region,and in my under minimum 25 technician and 10 service centers,and I handle,stock managment,pay out managment,and customer services"
good,"Beginning day is meeting followed by job assignments, van loading, and get out there and start. customer contact and installs. new techs are given basic skills to complete job, but a lot to learn to be good at it. management works long hours and spends too much time on procedure and not enough on developing employees. hardest part is dealing with all the extra nonsense involving wasted paperwork that no .one reads. greatest part is when you teach a customer something that makes them happy."
good,"dish is an okay place to work with, my shop that i worked out of in south bend is alright, the techs there are nice and friendly. job itself is pretty easy if you like to work with your hands, you install satellite tv"
good,Installing systems at various homes made the job stressful. Lack of assistance made the job difficult to work efficiently.
good,"es una buena empresa, se conoce mucha gente y te da satisfacciones"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers and the job that I did.  I thought I would have a career here.  However,  the thorns started to show when I was in the hospital and my son got sick.  They do not care about you, it is still a negative to be absent no matter the reason even if it is a verifiable health issue.  This seriously hurts your ability to move forward.  Even when we moved I asked to be relocated to a closer place but due to the attendance points from being absent in the hospital I was told no.  It wasn't worth it for me to drive an hour and twenty minutes to stay with a company that treats you as a number."
good,"good and all the staffs are friendly."
good,Working for a sub-contractor can be teddies and challenging at times .
good,"I love working with computers so the job was easy. The majority of my workload was data entry and customer service. The hours were pretty long. We worked 12 hour shifts, 4 days on/3 days off and then 3 days on/ 4 days off. The downside to it was I would leave in the morning and my baby would be asleep and I would get home at night and she would be in the bed. The only time I would get to see her was on my days off. It was pretty hard since she was only 6 months old when I went to work with the company. The job wasn't really a problem. I liked the job. It was just hard to balance my work life with my home life. Then my mother got sick and had a major surgery and it did not go as planned and ended up in ICU in a coma. I had taken my week paid vacation. I called my supervisor to tell her  my mom had taken a turn for the worse, she told me I had to come back to work or I wouldn't have a job. I told her I wanted to stay until my mom was stable. Needless to say, that was not an option for the company. I chose to stay with my mom and I lost my job."
good,"Show up, inspect van, get assignments and equipment, go to customer's homes verify order, install and activate equipment, help any other techs in my area to wrap up installs, return to warehouse, return un-used equipment, clean van , then turn in paperwork and go home. Management was helpful. Co-workers were knowledgeable and helpful. The hardest part was climbing ladders with all the tools needed and the receiver dish. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and making sure customers were happy."
good,"Since I am still employed by Dish, it is difficult to give a full review. There are many things that have been improved upon during my tenure, and those things continue to get better."
good,"Overall, Dish is a decent company to work for... Decent pay and benefits. But the management in Alvin is horrible, yet again they only care about their dollar... Who cares that an employee that's been here just shy of three years caught pneumonia and was in the hospital for two weeks... you weren't here, so lets fire you illegally..."
good,"This job is ok overall. But all they care about is sale sale sale. Didnt matter how many installs you did a day, if you didnt sell anything, you got nagged about it at the end of the day. Management was not the best but it was alright. They always sent you somewhere out of your area. If you lived in denham you were going to bogue chitto ms and would have to be on your first job by 8 and wouldn't get home until 10 p.m that night."
good,"The hours were horrible, the stress un bearable. No emergency was acceptabke for late or unplanned absence. They do not want quality, they want quantity, how many calls, how short are tbe calls. They do not want someone to take their time and really listen.  It was all about numbers."
good,"I enjoyed shipping and receiving, nightly inventory, pulling orders.  I don't believe that I was recognized for the leadership ability that I demonstrated"
good,Mi trabajo me gustaba mucho porque tenia un ambiente ligero y muy productivo
good,"Your typical call center job, you're basically a voice for customers to yell at. Often times you will find yourself in a situation where can't win, and you will be berated by the customer, but it pays okay."
good,Didn’t have a chance to move up in the company. I was also pregnant and didn’t qualify for fmla so I had to resign my position. I would work here again if given the chance to work from home
good,Management is rather unorganized about training and traveling. One hand doesn't seem to talk to the other. Have been in Boston for seven weeks and my office is in North Haven
good,Working here was the easiest money you can make all you have to do i is follow the guide lines but it does get pretty repetitive so when they provide you with perks it’s best to take advantage
good,In a typical work day i would leave my house in a company van and gather jobs from the app in the phone and then travel to the houses of the customers and install a dish and run the tv boxes for the customers.
good,En general la empresa es muy buena pero la gente que la maneja hace que sea complicado el trabajo poniendo candados y barreras para poder trabajar
good,"El clima laboral es muy bueno, todos saben trabajar en equipo y muy profesionales."
good,...I don't really have much to say about the company.. things started off completely different and went south kind of quickly but overall it was a decent job to have
good,"I enjoyed working for Dish.  The pay was pretty good, the atmosphere was great and the job itself was pretty simple once you're able to cram the millions of pounds of information into your brain and finally understand and get the hang of it.  Other than my commute being about an hour one way, Dish's attendence policy wasnt created with a working parent in mind.  No matter why you were late or had to take a day off, they didn't care, if you exceeded the 5 points they give you (which is extremely easy to do!), you're done!  You could be on your death bed, but if you miss 5 days, they send you packing!  I understand that they're running a business and need their employees there, but I feel some of their policies are extremely unreasonable."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,we go into homes and fix or install tv. you may have to travel as much as 200 miles to a job and work 12 to 16 hours a day. this can weigh on a family but pay is good and work is not hard.
good,"Work life balance is somewhat poor. HR department is very oddly empowered,  almost like a corporate police department. That part was strange.  Overall good people that want their reports to be successful."
good,Ambiente de trabajo bajo presion y riesgos en campos
good,it's ok. I hate their attendance policy. makes it difficult to manage work life and personal life. overall it's okay place to work. management are very supportive.
good,It was a great place to work just the people act childish and act like 4th graders.Management needs to be retrained.They have their picks and show favoritism. They dont care about their employee
good,There are activities to do when you're not working. There is food on site and they bring in local vendors. They try to do activities for the customer service team but my team is not included.
good,fast and hard working environment. says that they promote within company but that isn't true in all cases. there is a lot of  unfair promotions and not right promotions.
good,"It's a stressful environment but they do try to help with morale. You have a coach who will help with development into your role, and other support staff to help you along the way as you move up."
good,At Dish you have long hours which is not that fun.  The relationships you build with your co workers are excellent.  The higher management is not willing to work with the lower management.  They never stick up for anyone who should still work there
good,"Most of the co-workers have there kliq in the company and will help only them "
good,"Salgo a buscar clientes para instalaciones, hago publicidad de la marca, aprendo un poco de electrónica. tengo muy buena relación con mis compañeros de trabajo. La parte más difícil del día es cuando no encontramos clientes para instalaciones. Lo que más me gusta del trabajo es que mucho o poco continúo aprendiendo y que gracias a la buena relación laboral que tengo con mis compañeros, disfruto más y me desempeño mejor."
good,"The leadership structure leaves much to be desired, hardly ever is a great job or stats praised but they are quick to write you up for any little thing, like being sick even if you bring a doctor's note. I was told by senior management at the El Paso site that being sick is not an excuse to miss work and that I should be there regardless of what the doctor says."
good,"Great company to work for but it is also a stressing job, Customer are the ones that make the job a stressing job. The surrounding on the company are of a great ambient."
good,"Dish Network was a unique job, i enjoyed it but the ability to move up in the company are so slim, that it quickly becomes a dead-end job."
good,"A typical work day is serving in-house customer and inventory."
good,"At the BJs store in Boynton Beach I was selling at, it was tough to sell because about 95% of the people lived in Home Owners Associations, and therefore could not put satellite in their homes.."
good,"Dish network strives to bring customer satisfaction at the expense of their employees, you have to meet these unreachable goals or you get written up for not doing so and the managers are always coming out to your job site and conducting site surveys on their employees. If you cannot connect the receivers to internet because the customer does not have internet then world war 3 is among you. Extremely long work days in the summer time, days can be from example: 6am-7-8pm everyday no problem and you have to do the jobs, no coming back the next day because its 10pm at night and the customer doesn't want you there"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Every time and every day in life we learn something from our working life . So if I face odd condition I think that I will get something from this odd condition
good,"en general la empresa es buena ,lamentablemente la rotacion gerencial constante cambia los contextos generales ya pre establecidos por antiguos jefes ,de lo cual la estabilidad cuestion horario y entradas economicas se sacrifican ."
good,Good job if you enjoy working on your own. Has the freedom of meeting new people and exploring new areas in your city. Good to stay on top of new technologies.
good,Company is evolving rapidly which is good considering there main stay business is shrinking. This also has created opportunities for  advancement for high performers.
good,I enjoyed working here I just needed a better schedule. work conditions were tough but nothing to extreme. I got lots of support from co workers and management.
good,"A nivel técnico y de vendedor la paga es poca, a nivel administrativo mejora; el detalle son las restructuraciones que hacen a nivel gerencia."
good,"It was a friendly laid back work environment everyone did there own job assignment for the day everyday and the work was smooth and easy, I also got 40 hours a week."
good,"* A typical day at Amigo Satellite (Dish Network) was taking call (most of them hispanic customers) taking information for new installations and offering different TV's packages. "
good,The job is okay if you don't mind all of upper-management only caring about sales that you do. You can be a great tech but if you don't sale the Polk Audion systems or the google Nest stuff than they really don't care and will probably fire you. It is sad that a once great company only cares about sales now. If your a great salesman have at it you'll get promotions and raises and all kinds of stuff but if you expect to advance through hard work this isn't the job for you.
good,"daily sales goals"
good,I was fun and I enjoyed the traveling. But I was not paid enough for what we we doing and our air fai we had to pay out of our own pocket. I would work for them again if I was paid more and worked only in Sacramento.
good,"buena empresa, aunque falta de organización cuando se trataba de implementar nuevas formas de trabajo"
good,"presentacion con el cliente atender la falla reportada o instalar un nuevo servicion."
good,". No job security in this field"
good,your job was always on the line even if you didn't do anything wrong on the call. even if the customer was wrong and the call center always recorded the calls and would write you up if they didn't think you did a good job
good,It’s a really fast paced environment. If you are not quick on your toes this is not the job for you. They would change procedures and scripts at the drop of a hat with no notice at all. Sometimes I felt as if I had no training or understanding of new policy.
good,It was honestly a fun and had alot of opportunity to move up in the company but changes were planned poorly and management at the time was of no help.
good,"Worked here for several years, the 4 on 3 off schedule is great to allow you time to get an education. Love my coworkers, they are supportive and a real team. If you are behind, others will come to help you out, even if it means them staying later in the day. This should not be taken lightly as that impacts their productivity and can have negative consequences."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"They have a great environment to work with a lot energy, and assistance from your superiors. The job can be frustrating becase reaching commission can be tough."
good,"Rather than going hour by hour through every day, focus on a few main tasks, and describe how you go through those tasks in a typical week. Be sure to focus on duties that are relevant to the position for which you are applying"
good,"Good for starting out your career. Very stressful and work life balance is talked about but rarely considered. "
good,"your being rushed on the phones, limited on how to help the customer, managements works with you on personal issues, nice fun work place, meeting quotas with limited time with customer, benefits of meeting quotas get to go home early with pay when approved."
good,"A typical day at work was an enjoyable day. Learning to be compatible with different personalities and cultures, having management that was supportive. The hardest and the most enjoyable part of the job was the training of different people with different personalities and learning habits.It was a challenge but a good challenge."
good,"a typical day at work started with some stretches and a unit meeting to see where the numbers where of production and to get employees situated. Managers were very helpful. Good hours, little pay and many benefits and discounts."
good,"Dish's business is currently slowing down and they are having to lay off a lot of employees. When I worked there is was very fast paced and a good environment. There were a few bad eggs, but they were managed out. Decent benefits and competitive pay."
good,Poor training and lack of communication had to work long hours and drive all over Mississippi due to employees quitting.I had to deal with rude customers all the time
good,"I enjoyed my time at DISH network, however the pace was a bit to fast for me and I began to get discouraged because I couldn't keep up. I would have liked to be able to remain."
good,Even with the restrictions on development the time at DISH Network development my Account Management skills. The management team in Denver is a little out of touch for the field teams.
good,I don't want to complete this section but I did not have an option to continue without doing so. So this is the verbiage I used to complete the minimum requirement to move forward.
good,A typical day at work was answering the phones and doing my best to solve the customers issue for a first call resolution. Management was okay there was good ones and there was also bad ones. Glad I am not there anymore.
good,"It's a good company if you have great leadership, if you aren't with great leadership your job will go to from good to bad quickly. They don't work will you on issues with family. And if you miss a day they take your pdo"
good,Great job if you're able to handle constantly changing schedules and possible mandatory overtime. Back to back phone calls all day all while being able to manage multiple programs on the computer. Good environment and fun people to work with. Escalated customers and poor leadership were the worst part about the job.
good,Teachers were patient and learning the programs weren't too difficult. If you aren't use to call centers the roleplaying might be hard but otherwise a good company to have been a part of.
good,Soy encargado de ver a un grupo de clientes que dejaron de  pagar el servicio por falta de trabajo etc. Con la finalidad de recolección y recuperar saldos
good,"10 hours a day 4 days a week"
good,"A company worth working for. Dish offers great benefits, good pay, and good advancement opportunity. Although has terrible management, a very stressful job, and ridiculous policies."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,A typical day at work is you receive your jobs. Then you load your van or truck with the gear that is need for those jobs and a few more extra jobs just in-case you have a job that can't be done or cancels on you before you get there. If that happens then your day is going to be a very interesting day to say the least. If your day is not changed then your day should be fine that is if someone else in your area dose't have a job drop and management thinks that its a good idea to start changing your day to help the struggling tech out. But any how if nothing go wrong in a day the jobs are easy. Most management can hold there own on the job and with customers. I thought the hardest part of the job was all the selling of hardware and  products. I feel that I was there to do a job not sell the customer solutions to their problems. The most enjoyable part of the job was how I was able talk to some of these customers and find out some of the most amazing stories of there life or a friends life.
good,"Door to Door sales had it's sets of challenges but overall when proper management was in place, everything worked well. The abilities to travel, help people and make great amounts of money was both fun and invigorating. Learned a large number of skills, tools and procedures that has been beneficial in many areas of personal and other work life."
good,"Certain departments within the company had issues with leadership which set up technicians to fail, My position was of a quality assurance specialist, which provided feed back in detail about the systems installed in customers homes. Leadership in my department was lacking due to lack of communication."
good,I loved my multiple years with Dish!  I recommend the company to anyone looking for a good customer service job for good pay/benefits.
good,"Se lleva un buen ambiente de trabajo con los compañeros, no se puede decir lo mismo de los jefes que no tienen modo para tratar a los empleados y se basan en amenazas y chantajes, presionando mucho y ofreciendo poco a pesar de cumplir con las actividades subordinadas."
good,"talk on the phone all day. Sometimes get extra training we received breaks, i learn how to fix a tv if its a black blue snown screen and also remote. i enjoyed the people i worked with"
good,"At Dish I worked Monday-Thursday 12 hrs Shifts. In Receiving Department Where I was required to unload trucks, use pallet jacks to move and prepare receivers to production. Also I Clarified Products into company system in order to be received. Clarifying was fast-paced, I scanned 73 units per hr ( the average rate was 62 units.) I enjoyed Dish Network because of the warehouse atmosphere. Working Hard, Constantly having task to complete was not only fun but rewarding. I did learn at Dish that I cannot get frustrated with the co-workers who don't want to work. I believe in going to work and doing my job. I understand now everyone does not have the same work ethic. The hardest part of my job was the first 2 weeks. getting used to no A.C. and strenuous work was hard . though at the end of the day the most enjoyable part of my job was walking to my car at the end of my shift, Soaked in sweat, uniform beyond dirty, and every muscle in my body soar. But from that I knew I gave 100%, worked as hard, and did my Job."
good,"Se trabaja practicamente en la calle , metodo de cambaceo."
good,The time spent at Dish Network was very useful in the fact that I learned more about sales. I learned strategies to sell a product where others may not have been able to sell. The compensation was random as a usual typical sales jobs. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving a massive discount from Dish Network. The hardest part of the Job was dealing with the unstable compensation.
good,"they make it nearly impossible to achieve any of the goals set for you, they educate you on all the fundamentals of satellite installation, then send you out to the field with unrealistic goals and watch you fail, the best part of the job is driving off the lot and escaping the fake people there to help you fail, the hardest part of the job is installing systems in cold and wet weather. the most enjoyable part of the job is the different customers you meet day in day out"
good,Working at Dish Network has been a learning experience. The technical part of troubleshooting has been the most challenging. If you don't appreciate constant feedback of the service you provide this wouldn't be the place to work for you.
good,im a technician that provide a service for the customer also climb ladder and crawl homes
good,"En este trabajo aprendí la responsabilidad y seriedad que se debe tener con el cliente, cumplir con lo que se establece. Así como también hacer la compra de insumos para producir el calzado."
good,"Dish is a great place to work if you like the technical aspect of things. The management team is easy to talk to, and the work environment is always upbeat and positive. The only downer to working in this type of environment it the varrying schedules and shifts available."
good,"Good Working Places, Good  Co Worker's ,Working  More Enjoyable to job periods"
good,"a typical day has a busy workload, new challenges, and successful accomplishments."
good,Dish needs to set clear expectations and make sure everyone reads the handbook before starting a position at Dish
good,"Similar to running a small business of your own, fast paced, customer service, technical work and warehousing. Enjoyed interaction with people, but driving time monotonous."
good,Management only cares about sales.  They want you to meet all of your metrics while being 'nice' but providing information and getting the upsell - Every single call they harp you to get these little old ladies to buy buy buy.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"I enjoyed what I did with Dish, I had a great Supervisor and nice co-workers, I enjoyed the flexibility of my job working with the other warehouse employees assisting them with product and information, my position allowed me to work in the office and warehouse.  Making sure all orders were shipped for the day and if not in our warehouse it was sent to an affiliate warehouse to ship. "
good,"Call come in about Billing, Tech issues, Account Information, Problems with company. Good customer service skills and empathy. The coaches help and management are stuck up."
good,"Hours not set.. Depending on jobs and efficiency, day could either be long or short. Pretty well hands on job. Drives a company vehicle, that also provides you with tools and uniforms"
good,"I liked working with different equipment, tools, and all the electrical components."
good,"Dish Network was an ok job, it pays well. But the overall expereinced working there is not that grand. Felt like being backstab everytime I tried to ask mangement for accurate information on particular calls that I have yet to be train on."
good,A typical day at work was routing and running reports as well as assisting customers. I learned how to professionally assist customers and several soft ware programs via the company. Management was consistent and my co workers were a pleasure to work with and train. There was never really a hard part of my job most said the ability to multitask but I found that to be one of the most enjoyable parts of it.
good,sales agent. we were paid per. sale. was able to make some good money because i was driven and good at my job.
good,Company needs to give employees more of a opportunity for advancement because it takes years to rise up to the next level because of the outstanding achievements you have to make to make it to the next level
good,una empresa solida con oportunidades de crecimiento laboral
good,"shift work"
good,Deben cambian alos supervisores para que pueda funcionar la empresa y no haya tanto rotacion de empleados.
good,"Although I did not have problems and was treated well when I was pregnant, others have been fired when faced with personal hardships.  The callers were tough but the staff was helpful and most people were helpful."
good,"Busy Schedule , to much unplanned activity because its operational company , you have to work others groups of company  of DishTv as well ."
good,"The training was extensive, and everyone on the team at the office worked to show how important each member was. Everyone was out to help each other when needed"
good,"Not many growth opportunities while I was there. Being a national top 3 sales associate,  actively mentoring others,  I was never considered to train or supervise,  lots of internal middle management politics involved."
good,"In Dish work culture was bit stressful due to workload present during my tenure as the company was undergoing the process of merger, but otherwise they provided me the opportunity to learn more about my profile and work and even how to groom myself in corporate environment."
good,Debe de haber gente competente en cargos más altos y el trato debe ser equitativo
good,"Awesome place to work"

good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Forward thinking management, branching out into different disciplines. breaking the mold.  Excellent benefits and bonus programs. great Work life balance."
good,"i was based in Manila, work is stressful though we are happy working with DISH, met lots of friends so i really didn't mind the stress because my co workers were all friendly, its just that the company was mismanaged  i guess and i can not understand it anymore. thats why i have to leave and find work abroad"
good,excelente ambiente de trabajo se consiguieron ls metas establecidas y se rebasaron las expectativas gracias a Dios
good,Excellent training... Great company as a whole to work for... Absolutely loved it. only downfall was hours had to work and lack of support manigmemt wise.  And as a remote tech next to impossible to keep ur expected jobs completed.
good,"Long hours, roughly 10 to 12 hours per day, usually 5 day per week. Good management in the San Jose office but the rest of the staff were a bit rough to get along with."
good,"Company is driving technicians in Sales. Sales is driving tech's production, and performance. Hired as a tech, not sales rep. Its killing the industry and loosing good people. Very High turnover rate"
good,Bueno es poco sueldo tiene sus ventajas y desventajas el tiempo que te sobre lo puedes emplear en otra actividad .
good,I worked for dish almost 3 years and I did enjoy it. My only issue with the company is with certain management which it was hard to work under. And it was hard to go to anyone about troubles in the workplace cause I wasn’t taken seriously. There are wonderful managers and team leads and then there are some not so great. The job is a tad stressful but it’s not too bad. The pay could definitely be better for the amount of stress resulting from calls and metrics you are expected to meet.
good,After 4 years and being a top Tech the was no place for advancement without a college degree. Only found out after applying for management job I would never go higher.
good,The pay was okay managment was kind in tech support and you had alot of freedom to work with your customers at least many years ago no idea what its like now.
good,"Excelente horario, empleo formal. Tolerancia a la frustración, saber negociar con los clientes."
good,"Typical day at work gather all equipment and load your things into your truck and go to homes to set up satellites, this may include climbing on customers roof and setting up the equipment."
good,"DISH is a great-paying job, but you will work hard for it. Expectations to perform in sales roles are high, but rewards are worth it. This job is not for everyone, and those who do excel may choose not to stay longer than a couple of years."
good,Well I can't complain to much it was a job that helped me get further in the technical world for sat. Comm. Thanks for the time with y'all company. maybe I'll have a chance to get back on sometime .
good,"The center (sales and retention section) I worked at was rediculous, very tight buddy system, if you aren't friends with the manager dont even waste hope or energy trying to get promoted. Even if you try to move up outside of your section that manager will make sure you don't because if they select you she will give them such negative feedback that they will retract their offer."
good,"It was fun working at Dish, if there was an opportunity to work from home i would jump on it right away. I liked the environment and the people i worked with."
good,Depending on the department this place is a great start. Making a great impression is important. Communicating to your manager that your goal is to ascend to the ranks is also important.
good,"Muy bueno, pero falta area de capacitacion a vendedores"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,I liked working here. There is a lot of opportunity for growth and advancement. This sales position gave me the opportunity to learn how to interact with a potential customer.
good,"Buena empresa con buenas prestaciónes, buen ambiente laboral"
good,Dish has a metric system that lets you know exactly how your doing and what you are being judged on.  Its nice. It makes it easier to get promoted....
good,"Buenas prestaciones, puntuales en sus pagos, te dejan trabajar."
good,"bien, cuenta con servicios para el personal como transporte gratuito, servicio medico y buenas instalaciones"
good,"I dealt with receivers and i had to put them up in there right location when they came down my assembly line it was a fast paced job and kept you going sometimes i worked with  Accessories like they remotes, batteries, wires and WiFi boxes"
good,"dish is a great place to work you can move up the ladder in the company, and you can meet some cool personalities within the job sight. great place to make money."
good,Dish is the average fast past job. It has the same benefits as most companies in that area. It's business is customer based. And the job security is based off of customer demand.
good,job gave me freedom to complete jobs up to my own standards.  I got to plan and navigate multiple houses and businesses to ensure maximum effieciency.
good,"Super padre, un poco dificil, pues en el área que trabajé,. era obligatorio que los prospectos contaran con linea Telmex, a lo cual se me dificultaba un poco, puesto que solo trabajaba dentro de la tienda Telmex y eran bajos los prospectos"
good,"Good company to work for, I made a lot of money with dish until they changed their commission structure."
good,"Four ten hour plus day but you do get 3 days off every week. If you are good at your job you can climb the tech levels from 1 to 4, however the goals to increase can be difficult to achieve. Once you reach level 4 there is no where else to go from there, raises only come annual from there and are based strictly off of your metrics from the previous year, so it is possible to receive a minimal raise."
good,"The money their was good, it wasnt a hard job once you got used to the systems, Management was super stressful and was very hard on you making the work culture difficult"
good,"The drive from where I Iived to where I worked was an hour, but besides that it was a decent place to work with decent people to work with, with good Management. Having to Sell things while keeping on time is a tad difficult but they had to throw a curveball somewhere"
good,"My position within the company was a unique one so I had a very difference experience than most of the other employees. The culture across the company was inconsistent, although highly promoted. The average employee did not have a healthy work life balance as long hours were very common. It is true that the biggest benefit is opportunity - lots of room for advancement, moving between departments, etc.. Managers are not always great, very inconsistent across the company."
good,"There are always a lot of jobs to get done for the day, which makes it stressful. But, management is very helpful when you need time off, and if you have any issues."
good,"Only drawbacks to this company are: Work/life balance, sub-par health insurance benefits, and the increase focus on in-Home sales requirement for technicians."
good,Great company but really need to realize their people are key to their success. To fire great employees due to merely letting a customer know there's credits they could qualify for.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"The pay TV market is a tough one to be in right now and although we are making large gambles that may pay off, I need to see what is available elsewhere. I was able to work on some exciting projects but some people felt unhappy in their roles. I simply wish to excel faster than I am at this fortune 200 company."
good,Clasico dia de trabajo en un call center con buen compañerismo
good,"Buena empresa, sin embargo si considero necesario que se realicen evaluaciones periodicas a los mandos intermedios y superiores como sucede en otras empresas que rankean en great place to work"
good,es una empresa buena para trabajar un buen ambiente laboral
good,"This job definitely give a person the opportunity to make more money than the average 9-5; however, your pay is also dependent on your performance as well as how the call volume is going."
good,"Challenging and fun, pay is not bad at all. management could do better! If you can't handle high call volume and high stress, this ob might not be for you."
good,"Co workers and management were great, job was physically demanding but I enjoyed it. When I was there I remember there being a lot of hoops to jump through to get a raise, dont know if thats changed."
good,"aprendi a tener trato con la gente, tener mucha paciencia, alcanzar metas, tomar el control en las llamadas"
good,buen trabajo pero muy pesado y mal remunerado en comparacion con otros empleos similares
good,You meet new people everyday with DISH. Everyday is a different challenge. You have to learn how to do the job in a timely manage. This job is very physically demanding.
good,The work place is a stressful environment as an installer. The constant pressure to up sell dish merchandise made it a little more stressful then it needed to be.
good,Good Pay for a newbie it was my first real job and it was a good experience for me. Management could do a little better with supporting their techs and not just treating them as numbers for sales.
good,We used to have this bench press in the back and right before I would start restocking the warehouse I would do a couple of sets to boost up my energy
good,Average. Work life balance is not so good. management is really very poor. In staff coordination is very good and adjustable according to the requirement.
good,Stop forcing users to review every place of employment they've ever worked. This is absolutely frustrating that I can't even apply for a job on this site.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Dish is a nice place to work . You have to be self motivated and have a great personality.  Part of the job require that you work long hours and you will be on you feet and in the elements of the weather at times.There are time when we listen to the radio or watch tv while working.
good,Es una empresa con estabilidad laboral y no tanto económico
good,aprendi a tratar a la gente a dar servicio al cliente . me gustava por que te brindaban buenos beneficios
good,"Todo bien, el ambiente es muy divertido y tienen cafe gratis"
good,"The current focus of Dish is for it's technicians to sell accessories at all costs. There is no thanks given for quality work on the satellite TV/Internet aspect of the job anymore. The focus is sell, sell, sell extras."
good,"Friendly coworkers, laxed atmosphere as long as you do your work well. Fantastic place to work. The one downside and one major reason I left is the company is they started pushing sales entirely too much, our position of field service tech stayed in tacked and a whole other job was mounted on us while I was working there, and that was become a salesman. Quality suffers when you're worried about losing your job because you need to sell sell sell"
good,es una empresa muy responsable y es de un buen desempeño laboral todo de pende de las ganas que le pongas y tiene una estabilidad económica excelente
good,No review is provided at this time due to protecting one's self from self incrimination and a statement being used against said self for repricussions.
good,"Opportunity and growth"
good,I like it unlike other jobs they actually take the time to train every one and the right way. i like the pay. and you can get benefits almost right off the bat. during the holidays for they will feed us thanksgiving dinner. and they might feed us for being successful.
good,"Las labores a realizar son sencillas, pero se requiere de mucha responsabilidad y actitud para llevarlas acabo ya que se relaciona uno directamente con  los clientes y dentro de sus hogares."
good,Installed necessary Satellite/Internet hardware at Residential and Commercial locations. Traveled to different states to install Satellite/Internet. Fun guys to work with
good,"Worked there a long time ago so I'm not sure if things have changed. Good training, high school environment, long hallway where a lot of sales agents tried hitting on me, mandatory overtime"
good,"Very well paid specially with bonuses but schedules are rough. They do have tuition reimbursement that helps a lot. "
good,Esta bien el trabajo solo que no te suben mucho el sueldo
good,"Entertainment consultant responsible for maximizing inbound calls by demonstrating expert knowledge of Dish’s services and technology, evaluating consumer needs and recommending appropriate products and programming packages."
good,"first job in BPO, lot of things to learn, lots of work but salary is not sufficient for the type of work. career growth was okay its base on tenure ship and knowledge"
good,Lo que aprendí en esta empresa es saber trabajar en equipo y conocer la ciudad de Villahermosa aprender a trabajar bajo precion
good,"En un día típico en Dish, se establecen las zonas donde se va a trabajar, recibimos motivación y reafirmamos nuestras metas."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Close knit family co-workers. Opportunity for advancement. Energetic fun environment. Great bosses. Understanding of family life. Good hours and good pay
good,My coworkers were great.  I drove forklift all day and pulled orders.  I even got a raise.  I was always on time and prompt to work.  They had great benefits.
good,"They force you to work overtime, they only focus on everything you are doing wrong and nothing you are doing right. So if you enjoy getting pooped on for 12 hours a day, it's the job for you."
good,"Job is exactly what it sounds like.   You install satellite dishes.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Great training program.  Wished they offered more incentives"
good,Local staff at Nitro is a great bunch of guys.  I enjoyed working with them and they were all more than willing to assist in any way possible.
good,Productive and fun workplace with a ping pong table and basketball goal. Recommended for people who love to work overtime.
good,"Very kind to me plus they are easy to work with"
good,"Hard work but you can advance it you bust your tail.  Can be rewarding, fast paced environment.  Attendance is mandatory.  Senior operations manager is possibly the worst in history of the position.  But everyone else is pretty competent."
good,"The accounting department is good, but advancement possibilities are very limited. You need to ""know"" someone in order to move up. The benefits are pretty standard, except for health insurance. The worst health insurance I have ever had."
good,I've worked for dish for 9 years. They are a good company to work for. I have learned a lot working as a field service technician. Technicians work at least 40 hours a week.
good,Overall this company is much like many large corporations. I enjoying working with the people I had and learned a lot from co-oworkers and supervisors. I would say the biggest challenge I had was working with customers over the phone and trying to educate them about how their billing worked and the services they subscribed to. I always found it to be rewarding when I was able to help someone who felt like they were not being listened to and was able to help them to understand something that no one else had been able to explain.
good,This job is not for the weak hearted. You have to stay very calm in stressful situations. The management needs ALOT of work If you ever wanted to advance in this job you had to know someone in higher management.
good,A day at dish is normal for any high call volume call center work. 8 to 10 hours of billing and technical assistance while providing great customer service. I gained development skills and how to give productive feedback. Management interacted yet stayed out of sight. My co-workers were the best part of the job and hardest thing to leave while slow work days were the worst.
good,"Ok place to work, management can be unstable. Not enough compensation for work responsibilities. ..........................."
good,"I worked for a contracting company called Updish. The benefits were great and pay was good. However, most of the stress came from the company. How they run things and their organization (which is the worst I've ever seen in a business). Working long nights and six days a week take a toll on you. I was putting in 80 hrs/week or close to it every week. Yeah it a nice pay check but no freedom or relaxation. Not all is bad though. The job is simple and easy once you know what your are doing. Still, its unsafe and dangerous at times. I had wake up every morning at 5 to be at the warehouse by 6 in order to fill up my van. After 7:15 the warehouse stops handing out equipment. That give one an hour or so to fix a problem you may have with inventory, clean your van out, do a van inspection and get equipment that maybe the warehouse said you didn't need. Plus, other techs are there to fill up their vans as well. Too much. Just too much. I like the job and wouldn't mind continuing but with a company that know how to manage things better"
good,"DISH was a wonderful company to work for and I loved the call center environment. I enjoyed having this opportunity because it laid down the customer service representative foundation for me, and provided validation that this is the type of business I want to build a career in."
good,"Aprendí a ser empatíco con el cliente, y a resolver peticiones de manera eficaz y con una sola llamada."
good,"DISH is a great place to grow your career if you choose to do so. If you want to learn about accounting and be the next CFO, this is the company to join. Will it be easy...NO. But that's what is good about working here....you may start out as an Accounting Clerk and give 110% everyday and be promoted to Staff Accountant, then Manager, then.... you name it, the future is yours to make."

good,"Challenging, competitive sales environment.  Hard work and long hours are required to be successful.  Management was very supportive and gave the tools necessary to be the best.  The most difficult and rewarding part of the job was educating and influencing young salespeople in closing deals and optimizing the uncapped commission.  I look forward to utilizing the skills I have learned over the past four years in sales to positively effecting a top ranking ethical sales department."
good,Dish was a great company to work for. I enjoyed working there and getting the special services that I did not only with customers on the phone but also with the supervisors and employers as well.
good,"All the supervision its done in mexico city, you will only do as you are told, there is not  a big gab to be creative or bring new ideas to work. Its still lacks in infrastructure, and the sistems to operate the data base are extremely slow."
good,"Get place to work co workers are great and mangement is wonderful , fast paced work enviroment , hardest part is dealing with all the   drivers and getting them to the next job most enjoyable is knowing you full filled all work orders"

good,"enjoyed working with the customers and the sales aspect of the company, helped with sales, phone work... selling the appropriate packages to suit someones needs"
good,Es una empresa que tuvo un crecimiento explosivo pero que en estos momentos ya le cuesta mantenerse en equilibrio y en lo personal me gusto mucho que las personas con las que labore me dieron la oportunidad de mostrarme y crecer en ellas. Desafortunadamente hay muchas personas en las direcciones que lejos de ver un trabajo que respalde a la persona de repente se fijan nada mas en la persona y eso es lo mas dificil con lo cual trabajar ya que en un puesto de una instancia elevada en tratar de entender las ideas que los directivos quieren que ejecutes.
good,learned a lot from their and from the co-workers I was with. they show you how to work at every department and give you the certifications.

good,"well, working in marketing department teaches me a lots of thing such as, planning, scheduling, budget preparation, advt. plan, resources utilizations and many more.. but the thing is we were only two staff in marketing department so we need to give our 100% in order to get the result. so this was the most hardest  part of my job however, I have learned many things because of this.."

good,"Una empresa grande donde se puede crecer,con buenas prestaciones"
good,"It's basically the same as any other customer service job, answering telephones, and listening to the customer ramble on about their bill, or their service. I honestly didn't mind this job."
good,"Being in a acall center environment taught me to live one day at a time, giving your best shot in evey call you receive. Patience is tested in each and every call but it's all worth it hearing your customers say ""thank you"" for resolving their concerns. Not all calls are good and resolved but at the end of the day support system is very helpful to increase your knowledge to meet the demand of the work as opportunities await those who do what is expected and love what they are doing."
good,I taught myself how to run a warehouse with help with a few people from the corp office.

good,"A typical day at work starts with the morning meeting and checking your days route. You then grab your tool bag and keys and move on to the days jobs. After the work is done you come back, stock your van, you turn the keys back in, and then go home. I learned how to be very hands on and how to really work alone. Management is A++. They will work with you in your personal life and in your career. Co-workers are totally different. There are those who are amazing but majority are horrible people to be around. The hardest part of the job is you continue to do the same thing over and over. There is nothing new. The most enjoyable part of the job is the management. They are amazing. They taught me how to be a leader in a business environment."
good,"taking 80 call a day, i have deal with people from every different corners of the country.  Managements have easy jobs, their responsibility is watch after customer service agents. the hardest part of the job is satisfy every customers out there."

good,Customer service inbound call center for satellite TV service.
good,"This job was emotionally draining. Being so dedicated to customers made it difficult when I would hear so many complaints about the company and wasn't able to fix certain issues. I did everything I could to keep the customer happy. I was handling over 100 calls in a shift, and had to work close with my team if I hit a problem that I didn't know the answer to."
good,"Work days include sync meetings with content owners to begin the design process for training. Various review meets at different levels for content and message approval.

Then install dish, run lines, work on ladders, torubleshoot, ground, and make sure the customers is happy with the work i did. I like working by myself but also have help a phone call away.

good,"Travel,go new places and meet new people."
good,"First I started out in sales and then by choice and much convincing I asked to go into Customer Service. I was one of the top sales people but I needed a change. My day would start by asking my manager if there was any changes I needed to know about then I would log onto my computer.   This was a call center setting so on a slow day I would receive 50 calls on a busy day 80. I learned a lot about multi-tasking and wearing may hats because the calls would range from a payment, complaints, upgrading package, sales, scheduling an install etc. Management was ok you worked hard helped them out in a pinch they would help you, it was a team effort. Really enjoyed my co-workers. Hardest part was working with Corporate employees when I had to send them over. The atmosphere was fun any very busy at the same time. I learned a lot about satisfying the customer."
good,"Answering phones, helping customers with bills and tech support on the dish cable boxes.. Assisting technicians with new service set up.."
good,a typical day at work is at my desk taking in sales calls and set them up with dishnetwork tv services. Being apart of a sales team and working together.
good,A typical day at dish is taking calls and solving as many issues in a one call resolution process.  Working for Dish I learn to be focus and take notes when needed specially when I would get the difficult customer who don't like to repeat them self or like to confirm that I was lesson to their concern. With all that said I did enjoy the company of my co-workers at lunch you get to watch TV and relax in the break room and in ERT everyone saw each other as family since we all knew each other including management so lunch was always great.
good,Enjoyed the daily challenges and the people.  I enjoyed that I was able to help keep people organized.
good,"Heavy phone lines, costant moving at last minute notice.. Which i didnt mind at all. It was like a adventure."

good,"I have had a healthy mix of positive and negative experiences at Echostar (Dish Network). For the larger part of my career at Echostar, I would start the day preparing reports to be worked, and then of course actually working them. My actual reports only took about three to four hours, then although it was not in my job responsibilities, I would track down, research, and report customer and retailer fraud. Occasionally, I would be called to help other coworkers and departments with various tech issues."
good,A typical day at work includes a team meeting every other day at the start of the shift. The main thing I have learned when retaining customers is that not one customer is the same.  Customers have different needs and wants when it comes to the importance of there tv services. Management has been a great help with coaching up there employees. Co-workers have been great work with. Everyone brings there own perspective on work. The hardest part of the job is the mental aspect. Not letting the stress wear you down. The most enjoyable part is the of the job is the sincere thank you that a customer gives you when you assist them with there needs. Customer are grateful for the assistance you provide them.  That makes you feel like you are doing something important for customers.
good,it is a nice enviroment on most days we have to help new employees with the basic functions of the work place and how everything operates
good,"Management was the not the best. They would never follow through with work-related harassment. They would hardly helped their employee's out. For example, my apartment flooded and they put me on a written contract for calling in for 2 days."
good,Satellite TV platform known for being a low cost TV provider with excellent set-top-boxes.
good,"Log in to computer"
good,"I liked being on my own out installing for Dish but you only get 40 hours vacation and your 10 hour shifts takes that up fast.  You work at least 50 hours a week but you get 3 days off at least and all the overtime you wanted.  I like having all the responsibility fall on me and the quality of my work shows.  Co workers were fun and helpful, management was always there to help you out.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours."

good,"a typical day at work, came across really unprofessional colleagues."
good,"The typical work day consist of a 10-14hr work day. Since working at Dish, I have learned a great deal about the cable industry. As far as management, I feel it could be a lot better. Too many inconsisties but overall the management is ok. On the other hand, the co-workers are great. The co-workers are very knowledable about the job and are always will to lend a helping hand. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in the feild and the hands on approach to getting the job done."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,i really enjoyed working at dish. It was a very friendly environment to work in.
good,En dish se trata todo con transparencia en cuanto a lo ke se refiere entre empleados. Tiene muy buenos valores pero estabilidad laboral no ya ke hubo recorte de personal.
good,• Demonstrate a good understanding of Dish Networks services and technology to prospecting customers.
good,"Not the best pay, but a good first step. Management is lacking in certain areas. Great people for the most part, but relatively similar to a high school gossip environment."
good,"My typical day on the job: I open the office by 5.30 am every morning, get everything for technicians to come in. By 6.00 am the technicians are all in, then I will go over safety procedures and materials. I would share any new information passed down by corperate or any matters arising. I would conduct van inspection before technician leave for their jobs. After some paper work, I would hit their field for quality inspections, routine training and coaching, and addressing any customer service concerns. Later in the day I would go back to the shop and work the grid until all techs are back to the shop."
good,"Work, work, and more work. Every day is different."

good,Arriave at a customer home to install a service or correct a service issue with a customer install or equipment.
good,A typical work day would consist of arriving before 9 am and staying until 4 pm. Most of the day is spent sitting at your desk completing projects and every day assignments. There is an onsight cafeteria for breakfast and lunches.
good,"Great company, fun enviroment, difficult metrics, handled calls and helped people with billing and tech."
good,I think that Dish does great but does not allow people to move up in the company fast enough. I learned the job and did it better than alot of people in management but I never moved in the company and wish that I could cause I enjoyed the job.
good,Dish Network has great training. Their transition into assignments is very smooth and you never feel you are overwhelmed.
good,"Overall, Dish Network is a good company to work for. The work is very demanding, but has variety on what to expect day to day."
good,"production is pretty easy, allowed music while working. Management is constantly changing. I mainly didn't like the way I was treated by my manager but I have heard there at new better supervisors."
good,"not a bad job, learning how to hook up cable that was fun."
good,"Dish offered different challenges daily and is a very fast paced company.  They are quick to venture into new areas and succeed where others may not.  Overall, it was a fun time there!"
good,"I started here in 2009. This was my first call center job and I was able to obtain many skills. I liked that I was able to move up extremely fast. I went from working in the call center to moving up in corporate which was great. Unfortunately, they like to layoff people and higher people for less pay or make room for a managers favorites to form their power team so its a competitive struggle to stay within the company."
good,Learned a lot about sales and value. More of a people person and communication with people is a valuable skillset. Flexible hours and diverse sets of staff.
good,"buen ambiente , la relación con jefes buena y con los vendedores aprendí que hay muchas maneras o métodos para vender , estoy convencido que todos los días se aprende algo ."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Decent teamwork with high competitiveness yet the managerial staff could use some work in my opinion.  I loved working there and it was a really laid back job with nice benefits
good,I enjoyed working at dish. You have metrics that can get you a bonus or get you fired. You promote basically with luck as a technician. It got so slow that I couldn’t afford to work there due to lack of hours so I had to leave but I loved the job while it was busy.
good,"It's an okay place to work. Lots of politics and favoritism. Backstabbing, greed, and laziness. The veteran workers get paid and dont work, while the new employees are stuck doing all the work and not fairly paid. Also it's more like being a sales man than an installation tech."
good,"good environment"
good,"Good company to work for if you like long hours and can take the heat and cold. Keep in mind that if you ever run into issues, some of the management wont have your back."
good,"fun and exciting on what the next day may bring and learning new stuff everyday and helping a lot of customers "
good,I really like the people and co workers in a fun work place environment. Good pay great benifits. If i had not moved i would still be working there. Great job
good,"The job is great but there is no work/life balance. If you like working loads of overtime, this is the job for you! Bosses are cool, you manage yourself."
good,"I have mixed emotions about working for Dish. Their pay is really good especially if your good at what you do. I loved the pay days with the pay outs. Also it's really not hard work if your trained correctly and have great Coaches. I was employed for 1 year and 10 1/2 months there where two different times I ended up with one particular Coach that really knew nothing. Once when I came back from maternity leave which before I went on leave I had just finished tech training a week before, then once again when my metrics had dropped which I did ask for a different coach which was denied. I was set for failure with her! I mean really she had to ask other coaches 95% of the time for the answer and the other 5% she wasn't even around her cubicle to help her team. Right before Dish let me go and a lot of others, I had gotten a raise and was told how much better I had gotten in the last quarter. Which the timeframe I had did great in I had two amazing coaches that knew exactly how to do their job. Which I guess is the reason they still have their jobs at Dish and the other one doesn't. The benefits are really good as well! When I started at Dish I was pregnant so when I was allowed to start my benefits I added short term disability. Before I went on maternity leave I had a pretty good lot of PTO. Then when I came back after maternity leave remind you I used FMLA and my short term disability payments. All my PTO was gone and nobody could explain. I really didn't like that I feel that it was very unfair because Dish didn't pay me while I was on leave. I paid for the short term disability"
good,My time at Dish was an enjoyable one. I would NOT work as a phone associate but any other position there I would gladly take. The environment and the people made coming to work great.
good,I was able to learn how to sales in a call center.  The compensation plan for commission payout was great.  The company focused a lot on the employees.
good,It started as a job but slowly evolved into a career. Had the Oort unity for advancement on a local level within technician levels. As well as opportunity to relocate and move up the ladder. Dish prefers to promote from within rather than hire new employees for higher level jobs.
good,"If you are not motivated to sell then this isn't the job for you, they are very strict about not selling. The days can get a little long but help is there if you need it."
good,"Enjoyed working with my immediate supervisor and coworkers. Other than long hours I cannot really complain about my overall experience. Just as you find in any job, there are pros & cons."
good,Get on the phones and deal with people on the phone that want to cancel.Cant try and lower the bill too much because then the company will be mad at you.
good,"I honestly liked working at Dish. Its definitely a place where its what you make it. It can be stressful at times, but they also make it a fun place to work."
good,Una empresa muy buena para trabajar que motiva mucho a su personal el detalle fue el personal que llegó al área administrativa
good,"se realiza servicios en toda la zona centro de villahermosa tabasco y en las rancherias mas cercanas ya que se realizan instalaciones equipos no enciende sin señales cambio de cableado cambio de lugar de equipo cambio de lugar de antena instalaciones con costo y manejo de presion al 100 porciento interactuando con diferentes tipos de clientes , trabajo de papeleria y logistica regresando de labores de campo ."
good,It's far from the worst place to work in America. Don't believe the hype. It's a forward looking company that tries very hard to improve their culture and technology constantly.
good,Definitely opportunity to make excellent money. Really does focus on customers.  Great advancement opportunities. The disclosure and tier process is daunting
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Great attitudes by supervisors/ they push opportunity for advancement.  Achieved top 20 of new class of 45.  Approved for live telephone inbound customer service within 3 weeks.  "
good,"Excelente relación con los compañeros de trabajo, hice amistades. Aprendí a ser tolerante. Apoyo a otras actividades."
good,This job is very competitive and can be stressful. The job pays very well the pay helps you get through the days its very easy to make around 70k and I'm only 21. However the heath insurance is bad and even with the money being as good as it is i find mindself dreading going into work because it can be mentally exausting and very repetitive. The people are fantastic the leadership is great and do everything they can to help you out.  The biggest reason for wanting to change is have a better schedule then working till 11pm and to have more oppurtunity for moving up and lastly to get a jop that has a little more freedom and isnt the same thing everyday your in.
good,"Dish was a great place to work, the problem with the hours and forcing the shift changes with short notice for indefinite periods.  people asked for certain shifts and it was always the opposite of what you requested."
good,on my first year at dish the moral was high energy was great bur over the years employee perks stopped and scheduling was inconsistent on a constant basis towards the last 2 years
good,Always changing quality assurance never knew what to expect. Seemed that they always come up with some reason to rip you out of your bonus. It was always something.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, facilidad de trabajo y horario para estudiantes"
good,I would recommend Dish Network to anyone trying to find a telemarketing career there is the possibility for career advancement but you must be able to adjust to frequent change and your work schedule changes frequently as well so as long as you are able to adjust with all the changes you will be fine
good,Management could be a bit better I had wonderful coaches for over two years I was with my last coach for 2 weeks and she had me fired for petty stuff.
good,"Got to building and signed into the phones. Immediately started taking calls from external customer and resolving issues. Issues were billing, technical support and sales."
good,"It was pretty good, but management needed some organization. The employees are great and it was a lot of fun working there. The training was also really well done."
good,Great people to work with and a solid company. Offer great benefits as it is a huge company. Although have a very strict rule on coming in late in the morning. three strikes and your out. Seems a bit unnecessary.
good,"Overall a good job, but it is really the staff that makes it. The work itself is fine, but high intensity; the schedules are demanding. Lots of OT asked."
good,You have to meet quotas and there is no time for conversations.  You have to work at a fast pace and if you are a hard worker you get financially compensated.
good,"There is not a typical day at work for the engineering team, you are always looking for the next thing to innovate, or providing support to the production floor."
good,I generally never had any issues with this company. I was high praised by them and was given advancements and promotion. However they couldn't let my private life be separated from my work and they terminated me.
good,"over all ok company I learned many skills like how to save customers production is the same. no accountability for when associates make mistakes."
good,"Great company to work for if you like work and money. Have to beable to want to help others in this field, there is more money to be made if you lend a helping hand."
good,"Good culture ,fun work place fun staff , great materials to work with . Moved up fast in the company, they had a lot of changes but hung in there because sometimes changes are good."
good,"The condition of the building was ok, the insulation that was on the ceiling would fall and land in your drink and you would never know it, in general it was a great place to work"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Working for Dish is great starting out. The training is superb, preparing you for various in field situations. The ability to troubleshoot was major but was easy to do because of the level of training you receive. As a tech you do a lot of work but being compensated does not match. The metrics at the time I was there were capable of being reached in a perfect world hindering you from advancement l."
good,"Muy buen horario, me permitía estudiar y pagar los mismos, excelente trato y ambiente laboral"
good,"Técnico Instalador de Equipos y manejar por la Ciudad."
good,Its an good company to upgrade your skills and enhancement of careers. Company provide immense space to show your potentials which helps you and company in all means..
good,"Buen ambiente laboral con los compañeros y subordinados, no así con el coordinador o con el gerente que se la pasan peleando"
good,"es excelente "
good,"Una oportunidad de aprendizaje en un giro nuevo "
good,La empresa tiene muchas áreas de Oportunidad en el Área de Recursos Humanos.
good,The training was a bit short really wasn't prepaid to just jump on the phones. The advanced tech training was even shorter with a lot more to pick up. Not a good support team and hard to find a supervisor available when you need one.
good,"Dish is a great place to work, the pay is ok and the management is supportive.  The downside is you usually give up any free time to the job, since most places are understaffed which causes lots of overtime, or extra long days.  Its easy to be lured in by the 3 days, but you'll quickly find that most weeks you have so many overtime days that you will quickly go down to one day off.  If you're single, or love to work roughly 60-70 hours a week than this is the place for you."
good,A typical job pretty much layed back to where you don't have managers and supervisors breathing all down your neck. A job to get started on warehouse experience with reflexable work schedule.
good,"It is a good place to work, very helpful co- workers and managers.  Train you very well to do your job.  Answer customer telephone calls regarding existing accounts.  Make requested policy and account changes.  Respond to questions and concerns about service, and escalate calls appropriately.  Consult with customers to evaluate needs and determine best options.  Counsel customers on options for service and coverage.  Upgrade service and offer additional service packages or options.  Consistently improve customer satisfaction through expert resolution of conflicts, issues, and concerns."
good,The environment was very welcoming and productive.  Very sad to see it close so soon after starting there.  I feel I could have had great advancement opportunities.
good,Even at an entry level position you will receive meaningful projects and senior level management exposure. Will learn to move fast and adapt in a resulted oriented environment.
good,"Buena empresa para trabajar, muy noble, de buena estructura politica."
good,"help customers with any satellite issues, including outside equipment, inside equipment , set appointments for techs to go to customers home for repairs, sell programming and equipment"
good,This job is a great job to have and wish it was full time. Unfortunately it is not and i have to look else where because of that. The people i work with are great people and are fun to work with. I wish there was more communication in the company and more chances for advancement. The best part of the job is a chance to work outside and still be in the comfort of a warehouse.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Es una excelente empresa para trabajar, le importan mucho sus empleados"
good,The starting pay is great but it is not easy to advance in the company. They tend to hire college graduates to management positions instead of promoting experienced technicians from within.
good,started to not allow agents to express their individuality thus causing a decrease in morale. Will get angry with you for being 5 minutes over on break time even if you have to use the restroom. Plays favorites with the employees so some people get away with everything and others nothing.
good,"Me parecio una empresas excelente para trabajar, sin embargo como es a nivel nacional, en ocasiones se toman las decisiones sin saber exactamente la situación guiados por los lideres de la zona que en ocasiones solo ven por sus intereses y no por el bien de la empresa y sus empleados en común, teniendo estos mucha falta de criterio y consideración, asi como una forma de guiar solo a su conveniencia."
good,"I learned how to Empathize & understand customers point of view. Work under pressure to swiftly address & resolve customer concerns. Provide technical support assistance, as well as actively listen to customers descriptions of tech issues to effectively address and correct customer’s dilemma. Apply patience, care, and understanding when dealing with all customers."
good,"Every day starts from monitoring numerous systems and their associated infrastructure which revolves around various broadcast & IT equipments."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"I personally enjoy being employed by Dish, there are ups and downs but more benefits for sure."
good,Great place to work but management really doesnt care about the employee's and think they know everything.
good,"Current position is productivity base which is being moved off shore. Majority of time dealing with reconciliations of work orders from external providers and deciphering worked performed by technicians then comparing against business rules of allowed configurations.  "
good,co workers are nice but the managment needs improvements . you wont get far with this company only if you flirt with your managers and stuff . i quit because managers are flirting with employees
good,"dishtv, India’s pioneer and first direct to home entertainment service, is a division of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, the largest media and general television entertainment network with a wide range of business. "
good,"I would log into my computer and sign in. once i was signed in i would start answering incoming call with great costumer service. i would help the costumer out with any issues or questions they had. i would also add or remove programming the costumer wanted or no longer wanted."
good,"This JOb was great had great pay"
good,"The environment working at DISH is everything it states and then some. It has a culture of highly driven, highly motivated talent all tasked with a common goal of propelling the company forward. Exceptional talent is rewarded and opportunities for the right person are many."
good,All goods but management acts late to take productive decisions than competition updates
good,"DISH expects hard work and smart people - but that is made clear in the interview and on-boarding process, so no one should be surprised. Each day brings new surprises (or, ""fire drills"") and there are lots of opportunities to pull yourself out of your comfort level and learn new things. Senior-level management is smart, easy to talk to and are open to new ideas. The people at DISH are what makes it so great - (almost) every department, (almost) every person is likeable, hard working and makes the day full of laughter. People who work there want to make a difference. If you don't like constant motion and constant change, DISH is not for you. If you don't think that rules are created for a reason, DISH is not for you. If you like making great, lifelong friends and contacts, DISH is for you. If you like to work hard, think outside the box, speak your mind and break the mold, DISH is for you."
good,I typically interact with customers and internal employees on the phone. I learned that the customer service and customer satisfaction aren't always one in the same. Management at my location was generally willing to help out but at a corporate level is very disconnected from the business. The hardest part of the job is keeping a large customer base happy. The most enjoyable part is helping co-workers and customers.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"1. DL/DS/DCC/SF Creation."
good,"Es buena empresa ,todo va bien mientras esta vigente el contrato porque despues de que expira ya no responden ni el telefono."
good,"a typical day at work for me is answer calls, attempt to save cancelling customers and sell dish network packages. i learned to compromise with customers and letting them know we appreciated their service. my co-works and i got along well. the hardest part of the time is the call volume increasing and not having any wait time. the most enjoyable part of my job was knowing i satisfied the customer and was able to save them"
good,"Learned alot on this job. Learn how to be a better costumer servicemen, do quality work, work safely, and in a timely manner. The management team for the most part where very supportive and helped you when you needed it. My coworkers where all pretty much fun guys to work for."
good,I really like working for this company and the comission structure was great.
good,"nice place to work, somewhat dangerous, but good, some good perks. free cable, company vehicle, but there were lots of long long hours and very long days."
good,"Working for Dish was an adventure. All I can say is if you're a person who likes detail and human interaction, choose a different company. Dish is about the bottom line and employees beware. The management pushes for the dollar and not a care is wasted on the employee. But there are a few that are selfless in their caring for the grunts that make the company what it is."
good,"overall is a good company to work for. hours are long, but pay checks are long too. if you got a family, this isn't necessarily the best place to work, although the income may be good. however, for the average joe that is not tied up with too many external responsibilities, is an awesome opportunity."
good,"Ambiente bastante amigable, te permite salir a campo y asi sales de la monotomia administrativa. En oficina revisas material a entregar y resguardos, en caso de haber quejas de clientes, realizas visitas domiciliadas, o en su defecto se revisa el trabajo de los tecnicos, en caso de encontrar detalles se procede a la capacitación"
good,"They pay good salary and good insensitive for the top customer service and sales agent. The benefits like any other company, but the job is not secured, we all got laid off because of the out source locations. We were told that we need to work very hard to be able to keep our location opened, they mislead us and at the end we all laid off."
good,Installation of dish network equipment.
good,they are great in finding you temp assignments but sometimes need to micro-manage a bit more than they do.
good,was a fun job loved helping the customers and knowing that i did with acounts or tech problems
good,"elements are the biggest problem rain, snow, heat your going to work in it once you get over that its a good place to work benifets and good pay with raises in your first year"
good,Great place to work lot of prizes you get over time as much as needed they did lay me off those great environment to work in a lot of benefits they work with your schedule
good,"Obtuve crecimiento laboral y mucho aprendizaje, relaciones interpersonales, capacitación constante dentro de la empresa."
good,"A Typical working style and seniors is friendly."
good,"El edificio está equipado con muchas comodidades, sillas cómodas café gratis, el trabajo de agente telefónico es estresante pero hay que aprender a manejar la presión."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Uma empresa formada y de renombre excelente producto, lo malo el nuevo personal administrativo"
good,las áreas estaban divididas y no se organizaban de manera correcta
good,En micaso desde el inicio de mi contratación yo no tuve problema alguno para desempeñar lo que se me pedia
good,"The culture dish has is a great culture, what kind of set me back was the hours, i lost my social life with this job, and almost lost my marriage, that is the only reason i had to leave."
good,Very fast paced and always changing too knotty equipment lots of different jobs to do every day possibility of remote techs work hours very and could benefit with over time
good,I need something a bit more flexible with my hours and they are not willing to accomdate me. The hardest part of the job is agreeing with the customers. The customers are elderly and stuck in their ways which can make your job frustrating
good,They have great hours the process is as long as you need for training and management is very helpful and positive. If you focus and pay attention there is really nothing hard about the job.
good,"good place to acquire experience with tools and installations, "
good,"Friendly and clean environment to work in. Great managment from supervisors, great hours. Flexible hours. Good holiday pay. Very multi cultural environment."
good,"Buen ambiente laborar, oportunidades de crecimiento"
good,Si te gustan las ventas puede que te agrade. Los horarios como vendedor de módulo si son un poco pesados.
good,"Dying industry with a focus on outside sales to stay afloat. Though they tell you while interviewed sales would be a focus, it's too much, being more important than actually installing the dishes and cable almost as if salesman is your preferred title. Pay is decent however, and they are pretty tolerant to your metrics if you under perform as long as you stay away from the regional manager's radar."
good,Good job if you enjoy technical work and LOTS of travel. Sometimes 3hours between job sites. You have to like selling because you are pushed to sell. Hours become very inconsistent. One day 7am to 10pm next day 7am to 10am. Never knowing from day to day. Too many employees for the demand. Asked to go home before you get a job. Benefits are very expensive. Best benefit is free tv!
good,"El clima laboral es muy ameno, en cuanto a su medición de ""calidad"" son muy inquisitorios, pues por un pequeño fallo hace que el trabajo de meses se descarte sin oportunidad de redimirlo, lo que ocasiona un alta taza de deserción y frustración, recursos humanos deja mucho que desear, pues cuando internamente se licita una mejor vacante, esta se ocupa por personal que ya lleva años en la empresa y no siempre es la mas apta o capacitada para desempeñar las nuevas funciones, puesto que hay empleados que cubren con experiencia y conocimientos el perfil solicitado."
good,Really fun and competitive work environment really enjoyed working for dish poor management was reason for leaving great pay great people to work with managers were terrible
good,"I actually enjoyed my time at Dish.  I do feel upper management and HR care for their employees.  I feel the further down the chain the less that happens.  For the most part, you work a 4 day on 3 days off work schedule so the 4 days can be long and rough.  Do not make plans.  However, the 3 days tend to make up for it.  The work is always changeable and is random just like whatever direct boss is in charge.  I recommend this job for someone who loves a challenge and likes to work alone.  Also, someone trying to finish school or wants a decent paying job."
good,Daily duties include printing inventory reports and reconciling with warehouse and tech vans. Pull inventory for technicians for daily routes and installs. Make sure counts in warehouse and all vans is accurate. Research and adjust any discrepancies between on hand inventory and daily inventory reports. Data entry using ORACLE.
good,"Me parece buena empresa."
good,My time working at dish was pleasant. I liked my schedule and the team structure. I also liked the commission payout.  I would work for this company again.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Easy and quick advancement if you really want to move up in ranks. Training is always great and fun. Work life balance was getting better when I left.
good,"I felt proud to work at dish and their were numerous benefits to performing your best at the job. I worked hard and received 4 pay raises in about one year because of the leveling system they have. However if you are lazy and don't perform well, you will not get raises."
good,good company to work for - long days in my position you do have more freedom. very hectic sometimes. Once you get the hang of it your able to handle it. People are very willing to help you.
good,"Workplace culture is not good- Timings not flexible. All time monitoring of the employees by higher management, no work from home or remote options, rest all good, lot of scope to learn new things, gives lot of respect to the employees, lot of interaction with Developers and managers."
good,"I would take anywhere up to 60 calls a day. I would assist customers with technical and billing questions. The hardest part of any call center job is the customers, especially the upset customers."
good,"The day job is great. But it is all about sells. Great pay, great team work. Some boss make you feel like your fired daily and some are cool. But the job id 100% selling"
good,"mi experiencia fue muy buena , el ambiente es bueno , lo malo es el sueldo que es muy bajo,aun así las prestaciones son las de ley"
good,Dish was a great place to start working. You got paid training.  The perks are great. Bonus incentives.  But there is pressure to sell stuff.  It went from a focus on quality installation and customer service to a salesman job.  If you don't mind selling then its a great job.  You get compensated with points for each sale to use on a website to get stuff. Some of the options are great.
good,Dish is a very fast paced company that will provide you opportunities to grow both professionally and personally.  It is a challenging environment and is not always suited for everyone.  If you like a company  that moves very fast and provide opportunities to learn new skills then Dish may be a good fit for you.
good,"Dish is not a flashy company to work for.  The pay and benefits are pretty much in line with the majority of most other companies in the US."
good,Long hours with little incentive to do anything beyond the bare minimum. The job itself is relatively easy with plenty to keep you distracted throughout the day.
good,The Job was very nice when I started we worked three days on & four days off long days but we got the time off to rest & still have family time or etc. They changed after I was there about eight months to four days on & three days off that was still nice a four day work week is nice it allows you to refresh your self.
good,Your hours changes from month to month.  the hours goes by your numbers if you had a bad month you will get bad hours to work the next month.  hard to plan ahead.
good,Very strict about logging in and keeping customer info safe. The management tried to be as open and willing to work with you as they can. Normal day was taking customer service and technical service calls. Hardest part of the job were the calls being back to back with not a lot of down time.
good,"Some Managers were better than others in how they treated their team. It has been several years since I worked there, and I've heard there have been a lot of changes."
good,"Fast pace daily"
good,"Experience varies based on the location you work out of. Some managers can be very helpful, and some seemed to not care about the techs as much. The work is stable, but routing was not always balanced and days could be long. Every year metrics and promotions became harder to obtain."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Compensation should be much higher when compared to other tech support positions. Training hours have zero flexibility, but the staff is heavily involved in your development."
good,"Dish was a fun place to work.  "
good,Es una buena oportunidad si te encuentras estudiando ya que sus horarios son flexibles.
good,some days may be long but you are doing something different everyday. no 2 jobs are the same and no 2 customers are the same. Dish is the leader in technology.
good,"Permanent opportunity to improve technical skills, learn new technical environments, and automation tools."
good,"opportunity for job advancement was good! Management wasn't the best, however; that depended on the team you were on. There was different levels of departments. I was fortunate enough to be a great sales person which lead me to be on the ERT (Executive Resolutions Team) which was directly for corporate."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo. dificultad para subir de puesto
good,"The people are fine."
good,"constantly set standards higher and higher, it seems you can never meet the goals since they constantly change. did continued my job title after six years."
good,"En esta empresa me he desarrollado en lo laboral como en el ambito per sonal, debido a que he aprendido como manejar diferente tipo de personal; asi como colocar a cada subordinado enj los mejor res lugares para las aptitudes de cada uno de elllos. "
good,I would recommend working here to friends and family. Fun environment to be in. Politicking goes on the higher you get in the company. But at the beginning everyone is on an even playing field.
good,very fast paste the job deal with people on the phone all over the place and some of the people is not nice at all when you call them but you try to sell them dish  or witch them out of their cable company that they have now to be able to get the dish that we are trying ti give them
good,"Dish is a very good place to work, some of the managers and supervisor are very good people. the work is not difficult at all. The best part of working at Dish is the people."
good,Fast pace on a typical day you work between 8-12 hours a day almost always on your own. Hours are hectic but good benifits and have help from other techs.
good,"Dish is a good place to work.  We get basically free service. They offer Health,  dental,  vision, 401K, stock options,  fair amount of paid days off and Holidays.  The only negative for me is no sick days and very strict attendance policy. Attendance is on a points system, and it is very tight."
good,"Se aprende mucho sobre los estándares de calidad, el trato al cliente, el compañerismo..."
good,"Working at Dish Network was a fun experience for me."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"When I first moved to Texas, I looked for work in the town I lived in. Everyone I spoke with they recommended DISH as a place to work at. I applied and within 2 weeks I was in a new hire class. Training was very good and it allowed me to succeed at the job. I was able to advance very quickly and moved to different departments within the company. I was able to travel with the company and learn new aspects of my job and the television business as a whole. I was recognized many times for performance and was given the honor of meeting the CEO, CFO, as well as many other people in corporate management. The only issue with DISH was they decided not to renew their lease on the building they were using in my town. This meant that over 500 people were going to lose their jobs, including myself. I was asked to move to a different site but since I was married and my wife had her own career in the area, moving was not an option. Other people were not so lucky as me with an offer to move. I loved my job with DISH. I just wished they were able to stay in my town but that is the nature of business."
good,"While working for dish I learned how to work as part of team to reach the companies goals, as well as how to push myself as an individual to reach my own goals.  I also learned the importance of time management and setting my own goals to ensure my success.  The hardest part of the job was that at times it would get repetitive, and the workplace culture would turn negative if the sales numbers were below goal.  At these times I would have to push myself to have a positive attitude, and overall this has given me the ability to work under pressure and continue to perform at a high level.  There were many enjoyable parts of the job working for dish.  I enjoyed the camaraderie between my self and my teammates and the joy we felt when we reached our goals.  I also enjoyed the incentives that dish had in place which made me push myself even harder to hit my goals."
good,Work is exciting and fufiling with an opportunity to truly impact the direction of the company.  However benefits and direct compensation are well below the market for comparable positions.
good,Install Satallite Tv or Satallite Internet for customers. Had to arrive at office every morning and every evening to pickup and drop off van. And the van was restocked  every night by warehouse.
good,"tuve a mi hijo recién nacido y me lo podía llevar a la oficina sin ningún problema, el horario era muy flexible con mis actividades . Aprendí más sobre el trato con los clientes y sobre procedimientos de ventas- instalaciones de una empresa externa."
good,Good work place friendly people and good pay just not a lot of opportunities for job advancement and not a fan of sitting at a desk for 10 hours a day
good,"DTH set top box and EPRS sales and distribution, business around 1 cr, in Bilaspur and it's upcountry market...got once best area sales executive in entire zone..."
good,"Answer customer's calls regarding billing, changing programs, or technical errors. Make sure to be friendly and respective at all times and try to help customers in a reasonable time manner."
good,A typical day consisted of gathering work orders and making sure all equipment was provided to finish and complete work order for installation. I learned to work together with different installers and gain knowledge of technician and satellite customer service. The hardest part of the job was long days and nights. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting brand new customers and giving them wonderful customer service.
good,Good environment and productive team to work. The company keeps moving in the right direction. There are many changes that we need to adapt to keep the company alive and in a good shape.
good,"Daily work environment route for call center, new update and product change. a lot of self discover than direct information sharing. Coaching (immediate Supervisors can be either direct influence or distance distraction depends on which you are assigned to. Site Management is are seating in open area but give off isolation feeling when feel like approaching for question or clarification on site issues or company concern."
good,"They really know how to motivate their employees. The work hours were not that great for me because Im a mother. If I did not have a kid though, this is the place to expand professionally. Awesome work environment and care for their employees."
good,"Challenging job, always on the go, need to be proactive with no supervision at all times you manage your own time and your own decisions, and customer service oriented."
good,"A typical day at work starts with the planning for the day, the start is usually dynamic with lot of leadership and sales strategic capabilities  challenges. While being on spot for market and dealing with 500+ distributors poses an different challenge every day. Daily engagement with management and conference calls with zeal to achieve every day some day plays a vital role. "
good,"Located in a great location, and pay very well right out of school, but where you start is mostly where you will stay. Not a lot of room for growth. Definite great first job out of college."
good,Fast paced atmosphere.Opportunities for advancement High stress work environment but if you like customer service dealing with customer complaints you can make a carreer at Dish
good,Great work environment among peers and management. Positive attitude always maintained. Great support feedback on a regular basis. The most difficult part of the job was working in outdoor conditions for most of the day. Rain or extreme heat during the summer months. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people from all walks of life and the feeling of accomplishment when you had all systems up and running.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,This an American account its a  a little bit tedious because we handle customer billing programming and technical concern and then hardest part  I think is having a shift as early as 2 am
good,Buena empresa con buenas comisiones buen ambiente con los compañeros
good,"Show up, and start inspecting your van, then get your route and equipment for the day.  Arrive at your first customer by 0800, review their order, install equipment, then teach the customer how to work it.  They were big on safety, and teamwork.  If you finished all your assignments, and you were relatively close to another tech, you'd be sent to help them wrap up their assignment."
good,"Es buena empresa, se aprende mucho cada día, se tiene buena comunicación con los compañeros, da oportunidad de crecimiento"
good,"Highly technical in depth training to prepare you for the job,"
good,It was a great place to work at the beginning but once you advance the extended hours and stress begins to affect your overall job performance other than that a great place
good,Overall I had a good expierence working for Dish. There is a culture there that breeds a desire to improve and promote. If you show proficiency in your position you will be promoted.
good,"The Management was questionable, because of the rapid changes in supervisory personnel. Always had a different group leader/ supervisor every 2-3 weeks. Not really an advantage when you're expecting to be rated on daily performances. Fortunately, I was very receptive of the many changes."
good,"I was able to be tech 3 at my time with dish and field coach, where i trained to hires. but managment could improve and allow more work family balance to the career. But management wants you to think you have to bleed dish all the time. But family is more important in my books."
good,Day by day i am enhancing my self according to the broadcasting standard and learn about new projects taking parts in various activities.
good,"stock van for days installations,  Maintain  vans overall condition, Install satellites for TV reception educate , customer on installed equipment"
good,La empresa tiene buenas prestaciones y buen servicio aparte te dejan que tu crecimiento sea personal acomo vendas ganas
good,Typical day is 8 hour shift calls back to back and depending on your skill/department anything from tech issues to regular billing. Learned excellent customer service skills and inner workings of that affects a business.
good,"There were a lot of extra benefits to working for dish, including swag from companies, discounts on tv services and other items, and tuition reimbursement (for full time employees)."
good,"un día normal en dish la hora de entrada era a la 8 am y empezando a levantar 4 equipos que son (antena y el receptor satélital) y también haciendo cobros de personas atrasadas con el servicio."
good,"Typical Day: A lot of sales contest and cool things to win. Breaks in between calls. Unlimited bathroom breaks."
good,"Great place to work if you need a flexible schedule. I worked at Dish while attending college part - time and found it helpful that there were several opportunities to adjust my schedule. The job was a bit stressful at times but the managers were all very helpful and friendly and you truly feel like part of a team, Pay was fair and bonuses were easy to come by."
good,"Good place to work, management sometimes gets under your skin. Loved the ability to work at my own pace and learn something new and exciting. Loved working with my hands."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"I enjoyed my time there, was able to work my way up. But I hate that after also 9 years of service my location is being closed down to reduction to force in May..."
good,"contacting managers for approval, issue with company email a'lot, issues with inventory count sheet every week, other than email not easy to get a'hold of wearhouse"
good,Dish is a really good company the typical work day was ok. My work environment was relaxing. Management was ok wish I had a little more support from my coach. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customer that would try to go over you and yell at you! The most thing I love about was the environment.
good,"A typical day consisted of direct supervision of 18 agents directly assigned to me. During that day I was responsible for driving all metrics associated with their calls and for directly reporting those metrics to a coach or manager. I would take escalated consumer calls when a consumer directly asked for a manager. I would monitor customer satisfaction surveys and if negative, would grade the call and provide feedback as to how to improve the overall customer experience. During this time I would not only support my team, but other teams that needed assistance as well. At any given time I was directly supporting my 18 agents, and assisting 30+ other agents from surrounding teams."
good,"En resumen es un trabajo bueno, aunque no existe mucha superacion laboral."
good,must be able to multitask and be organized. Also you'll need to travel a lot every day and you'll most than likely work every single weekend.
good,Intellectually challenging on a daily basis.  The organization is a great place to hone one's analytical skills while developing one's technical and interpersonal abilities.  The most enjoyable portion of the work is that boredom is never an option.
good,A typical day at work consisted of me being on the phone with clients providing top customer service and also acquiring new business through frequent sales. The company does tend to micromanage a lot but the co-workers I had were great and very uplifting. The hardest part of the job had to have been worrying about corporate metrics and making sure they were hit each and every day. The most enjoyable part of it was being able to converse with the people around me and refresh your mentality to get back to work.
good,"Typical day at work includes logging into your computer and taking calls for the entire shift that have to do with customer billing questions and technical problems. I liked most of the people that I worked with (you can't like everyone). You have Coaches, and you have Managers. All of the Coaches that I worked under were great. Managers can be a little more demanding (but that's their job). Hardest part of the job is simply the monotony of it. The most enjoyable part is the good pay and that your day would go buy quickly if you are getting a lot of calls."
good,Good work environment with great people.  Company policies are a bit drastic but the work flow is pretty consistent.  You sit at your desk receive calls and help each customer individually make the right decision based on the television service they require.
good,The atmosphere of working here is really good.  I am looking to advance to something paying a little more money.  Lost of phone calls come in with people that don't understand their bill.  Makes you feel good to explain it to them and the get what you are saying
good,"The management decisions didn't always make a lot of sense, but overall I knew what was expected and it was pretty laid back most of the time."
good,"Contrary to popular belief, Dish can be a great place to work. I was respected and sheltered by my senior management. I was allowed to build a team and fix IT Operational support of enterprise applications. When my senior management changed to the contrary, the culture suffered and I pursued my career elsewhere."
good,Organisations' management is good but they are not providing good benefits. Quality auditors have work like data type entry nothing to analyse for all QAs'.
good,easy job with a lot of great people. i learned a lot about the insurance business. they teach you a lot of things about the business
good,"Dish Network is a good company to work for it is hard work but there is room for advancement and the people including mgmnt were great to work for. Its not what I wanted for a career it was a job to me. "
good,"Good job, great people, not easy with intermittent medical issues if you have not been employed for over a year. (do not qualify for fmla) There is ADA but only if the dr signs off on it."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Had to opportunity to set up repair services for dish receivers. Gained some experience with different systems.
good,fun job learned a lot about satellite systems and how they operate.  I got a lot of customer service experience
good,"Typical work day was physical, but stress free. Good teamwork and very enjoyable management team. Learned how to do job basics though a single co-worker did try to over complicate some aspects of the tasks. Management was very approachable and friendly, and listened to issues and tried to resolve any issue in a productive manner. Most co-workers were very delightful with one exception, but overlooked that due to the cohesiveness of the overall team. Pay was good for area, but insurance benefits were terrible. The job was not hard at all, but could be made difficult by one individual at times. Enjoyed my time here and would consider employment there in the future if benefits improved and compensation go better."
good,"I am currently working as Deputy General Manager at Dish TV India Ltd (part of ZEE-Essel Group of Companies, largest Media Conglomerate headquartered in India & the largest DTH player in terms of subscriber base in India & Asia)"
good,Good company to get your feet wet in the art of hustling or if you want to be a big fish in a small pond to enhance your resume. Managers were great for the most part. Unfortunately they are bound by the owners critical decision making. Big disconnect between ownership and the front line.
good,"I owe this company a lot for allowing me to be an employee for over 5 years.  I learned a lot.  The pay isn't great and the benefits, but it was a good work experience for me."
good,"in dishtv am learning many thing specially how handle team and sales increment..and am related for mar-com team so we know abt on shop / In shop reviews...and PR meet / Events too...."
good,"Very family like, they treat you with respect and most are very friendly. not a hassle to sell just be professional over the phone pretty strict with phone guidelines don't hang up on customers u have to wait until they hang up i've been on hold for hours before which will kill your average handle time."
good,Good career and great all around place to work.However poorly managed towards the end of my career due to changes in corporate management.
good,It was a great job to work for the and it was fun we play basketball during our lunch break which was pretty awesome.
good,"Management is great...training is good...a lot of changes on a weekly basis that require conatant training. Schedule flexibility is zero to none. Very understanding of ""life happens"" issues. Not enough pay, too much access to leaving early or not going to work. Definitely not a job for the undisciplined. Not enough advancement opportunity fast enough. Great bonus potential for just doing your job. Medical and dental insurance suck,  vision and 401k as well as profit sharing is good."
good,"the job was nice, the people you run into are not always. it is a decent job."
good,"* Installation Tech."
good,"As a Tech during my tenure, working was fun, no hesitation to get up early to be at work for 6am, especially when it was a 3 day work week and a 4 day work week, completing 80 hours in two weeks, with plenty room for OT. The most enjoyable part of the job was the comradery between management and techs."
good,"The Digitization period in India( September2013- December2013) was a real time to work hard day and night. Thousands of Dish connections were installed, activated and given service at daily basis.I being a Area Service Manager handled 7 service franchise at one time and Work Hard for my Company success."
good,"Es una empresa que de tener en los puestos de supervisor a personas capaces y con actitudes correctas tendria una funcionalidad muchas veces mejor, el pago de comisiones a ido mejorando pero sabemos que pueden ser mejores, para que de ese modo podamos estar a nivel de otras empresas del mismo ramo, es una trabajo muy bueno para quienes nos gusta viajar y estar en campo"
good,"Management was easy to work with. Great Schedule, Good Work Enviorment"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"que es una empresa en crecimiento, con oportunidades de crecimiento, pro con muy poca solvencia economica, aprendi trabajo en campo,conocer todos los municipios en un 75% de su totalidad."
good,"A typical day at dish was taking calls in support of customer needs, I learned quite a bit about the operating platforms that companies like this use to run the day to day operations of their products and services. As is with many call centers I am sure, the management has to be quite strict with attendance and this can be frustrating to the hard working, reliable employee who may sometimes need to get away from work for personal reasons such as children. I loved my co-workers at Dish, we were all in the same boat and together we found a way to make it through the more difficult days (like when major systems crashed or channels were taken down). The hardest part of the job were the most difficult phone calls. One call I will never forget was when a man called in to tell me his house had burned down and he had lost his wife and child in the fire. It was my job to tell him that he was going to have to pay for the lost equipment. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had the tools required to solve the callers issue, ranging from technical support or to billing concerns or requests for promotions. "
good,Pues la empresa me trato muy bien lo unico malo es que el cordiandor de ventas no saia nada del negocio
good,Enjoyed working for this company overall. Management did there best to assist with any problems you may be having.
good,"Busy and allows for a different experience everyday, giving you the ability to learn new things and apply creativity to your job experiece on a daily basis."
good,A typical day at work was awesome. I also answered alot of inbound phone calls and I love it.
good,Change is in the air at Dish. Good opportunity for all applicants.
good,"buena empres,buenas prestaciones."
good,Great place to work. Different city from day to day. Learned how to get the job done neglecting obsticles. Co-workers were team players. Hardest part of the job was coping with natures elements. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfied customers.
good,"Dish network was not a job for everyone due to the work being repetitive, but i loved the repetitive work myself along with the astmosphere and company team as a whole. A work day would consist of answering call from uproared customers to calm customers which of all i loved the most delling with with different personalities and being able to resolve theri daily problems with the products or services.Not only was the atmosphere great but the compensation and benefits were also very reasonable."
good,"Dish Network was an excellent company to work with. The company does have an 80% turn over rate, however, the successful employees are self motivated. The company does not provide personal support, however they excel at providing support that is required to perform your job successfully."
good,"A typical day a work was we get the there in the morning and get our orders for the day. Then we would leave and go do the jobs. I learned how to interact with customers and a lot about the installation of cable. Management was good they would always try and help you out. My fellow co-workers were great to, a lot of good guys. The hardest part about my job was going in the attic in the middle of summertime. The most enjoyable part of the job was i got to go out on my own and do the job my way."
good,Typical work day. Log in to computer. Setup phones with headset. Have a 10min team meeting with supervisor. The get on the phones and provide world class customer service.
good,"Easy work, good work environment, good hours, good pay, and room for advancement if you do your job."
good,"It is a fast paced environment, with a lot of dedicated, hard working individuals. I enjoy all the new challenges and ability to work on multiple projects to learn all aspects of the business."
good,"En sí el ambiente laboral es bueno, las prestaciones son suficientes y el transporte de personal ayuda bastante. Los compañeros te ayudan cuando es necesario"
good,It is a good place to work for someone who is a consistent traveler and who is not afraid of heights or working directly for customers. One also needs to be okay with being monitored closely while working and understand that their work may be inspected.
good,I didn't have the typing skills for this job. I lacked the computer skills to complete this job. To many computer work needed.great job. . To much to do to get a deal. Could not keep up
good,"Buen horario de trabajo te permite hacer otras cosas cuando no estás en un proyecto urgente ya que en este caso trabajas más horas de la jornada oficial, home office para gente de TI, salarios un poco bajos en comparación al resto del mercado laboral, prestaciones regulares pero superiores a las de ley"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"En el ámbito de comisión es buena, pero lo malo es depender de otros para ganar"
good,"Fantastic atmosphere, great people and facility. Compensates well for an entry level position, but does not promote frequently or give any sort of bonuses. High employee churn rate."
good,"it was a good job overall that had a lot of good workers, and the environment felt like one big team. the advancement is there and that was one of the best qualities about the job."
good,"Dish is a good company to work for, work peaks and dips everyone and then and you start hurting for work,  pay is good as long as you keep your numbers where they need to be"
good,"Es una empresa en la que se puede aprender mucho, con mucha estabilidad pero crecimiento lento dentro de la organización."
good,I had good hrs. Had a good co-worker help me out then I needed help my boss help me a lot out it feel like I was with my family. I was a slow learner so boss tech me why I can learn easily
good,"Good fast past environment. Have to be really self motivated. Great training. Really a great company to work for, will work alone in the field and you have to be ok with up selling."
good,I loved working with the Wireless guys over at dish my only complaint would be the pay was about 10k to 15k shy of industry standards for the role I was in. But I'm sure that will change as they grow into the 4th carrier. I wish then the best a bunch of awesome people to work with. With lots of potential growth.
good,"Los valores de la empresa correctos, generalmente hubo interes en el personal,"
good,"Fast environment, constant training, great support from management, Paid Time Off, good health insurance, 501K, In-home service techs require to wear uniforms, uniform allowance, all the tools you need to be successful at your job."
good,I enjoyed my job and position at dish it was fast paced Workin environment which I like time goes by fast since there's always something to do .. stressful at times but overall I enjoyed working there and the people I was working with.
good,"Everyday on arrival I would get my desk situated because we usually changed desk everyday, then quick 10min team meeting, prepared myself to go ""ready""."
good,Company invests a lot on training and it’s employees. The sales culture can use a little bit of laying back. The demands aren’t easy or fair for new hires. The expectations can be overwhelming at times. Aside from this great emphasis on customer service and doing right by customers.  Would recommend for family and friends.
good,I worked at dish over 2 years and I loved going to work every day. The management was great. They cared about their employees and would promote within.
good,"just like most job, it's very competitive and fast paced. The job gives you opportunity for growth IF you're willing to relocate out of state. However, even as agents, they mentor you well in achieving your next goal."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Productive and fast paced workplace. Cultural diversity is much appreciated. Hardest part is no option of work from home and flexibility of working hours. Efficient management and great place to work.
good,"Meet new and exciting people daily. Fast paced and work solo mostly. Offers plenty of hours l, sometimes too much. Advancement is solely based on performance but some aspects are out of your control making it very difficult to level up."
good,"Great for career advancement, and pay. Fantastic training available. Sets expectations for changes ahead. Needs improvement with work life balance. Schedules are not ideal."
good,"Work was great but they force to try to sell expensive items to every customer.  Without the sales part, the job was great and i got plenty of hour plus three days off per week."
good,My time at DISH was very enjoyable.  I would have gladly stayed with the company if the center I worked at had remained open or if I had had the ability to relocate at the time of closing.
good,"Loved the experience working with dish, loved driving company vehicle and meeting new techs and people. Only issue is they enforce sales. They are not just looking for tech but they are also looking for salesman. While i worked there i thought i was going to be more focused on installing and repairing issues but they want you to sell as much you can and i was let go for not being able to sell. Especially in the areas i was working in it was hit or miss some days. As much as i enjoyed working for dish i wish they would look more into how their techs are doing and not how their sales are doing and making sure that they keep customers rather then make a quick buck off customers and not have them come back due to poor service!"
good,"Loved the tech support job and prizes won for stats being met,......Couldnt have the phones out on floor but could read or write if available.....Job was good till they let a bunch of people go."
good,DISH was a challenging place to work but rewarding as the management team would always provide new opportunities as you mastered the old.  There was no timeline for promotions as they were awarded when you were ready.
good,Great company to work for if you like a lot of overtime. If you have no fear of heights and a good work ethic you can go far. If you like interacting with people and are good at sales this is the job for you.
good,"The work environment is fast paced and they are very strict about security issues to prevent any compromise of customer data. This comes off as a little hard on employees, for instance cell phones are strictly forbidden from being out on the sales floor and if your phone falls out of your pocket, you will automatically be fired. This seems really harsh, but really seeing how much they try to protect their customers, really made me respect this company. They do really seem to try to conduct their business with integrity. The hourly rate is minimum wage for sales associates, but you get commission on top of that and that can easily be several thousand dollars per month. I was making as much and sometimes more than my spouse who worked in IT in a nearby academic setting. I just felt like sales was not a great fit for me personally. I think someone whose a little more outgoing will really thrive here. It was great while I was there, but I felt so drained at the end of everyday that it was really taking a toll on me to the point that I dreaded going in. I'm introverted, so being that ""on"" all the time was very hard for me to maintain."
good,"Good pay, good team support, great incentives and benefits, discount on services, great place to work for customer service..."
good,I worked at DISH as a contract employee and it was a great time. The culture was employee friendly and my direct interactions with management were always pleasant.
good,The sales culture can be cut-throat but it sure does tech you a lot!  I really didnt see much of an opportunity to advance my career but they paid very well for a call center agent!
good,Una empresa para trabajar sin parar con muy buenas prestaciones
good,Dish was my first call center I was there 5 full years and I really enjoyed my time there. I worked in diffent departments but my favorite was ERT fraud prevention
good,The job was good for learning computers and customer service but the schedule was challenging. I was promoted and the schedule they wanted me to work was not going to work for me.
good,Es muy buen empleo tiene sus pro y sus contra y los compañeros son amables
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Good place to start a career, lot of training provided to all employees. Needs work on metrics and goals. Not always employee based. Needs better benefits for health insurance."
good,Le empresa da mucha importancia a realizar el trabajo de acuerdo a normas de calidad para ofrecer un producto que satisfaga las necesidades de los clientes
good,"Life at Dish was pretty straightforward.  You get in early, check your routes and make sure you had everything you need for the jobs. It was honestly a great company to work for if you are single or didn't care about paying major Bill's."
good,"Within the department that worked in, you get to know the retailers who would call in. The department overall was close and could be considered a family. There was a lot of flexibility and there was a place for advancement."
good,"Provides benefits, a cafeteria, unlimited overtime. They try to work with your schedule, but it's very difficult to advance. Sick leave isn't acquired until the second year."
good,As is in the sales performance driven environment. Dish you keeps motivated to stay positive.... Dish coaches provide support and guideness to meet quotas and other goals.
good,"Was a great place to work, even with the long hours."
good,"working for dish has many benefits. however if you are not well with micromanagement and do not perform to the companies constantly changing goals, it can get stressful. there are many opportunities to work overtime and win prizes. if you want to spend most of your life at work or thinking about work, then dish is the place for you."
good,"Fast paced work environment with new experiences daily. You meet new people every day and get to work in a variety of locations, each with unique challenges and opportunities for creative problem solving."
good,I learned a lot but there was no opportunity for advancement without a degree. The had average benefits and regular work hours. Enjoyed my coworkers and atmosphere.
good,"DISH was good to me, for the time that I was there.  There is room for advancement, even though I ran into a couple of occasions where I applied for a new position and was turned down."
good,Fast paced work environment
good,fast paced job. usually work 4 days a week.  highly driven environment  Great place to be able to work independently.  Hardest part is dealing with upset customers but it is also most satisfying part when you can make them happy
good,"I feel that contrary to popular belief, DISH Network is a decent place to work. The environment is collaborative. I did not see too much politics. People are fairly friendly and easy to work with. "
good,if a fast paced day is what you are ins the market for this is the job for you great paying unlimited overtime advancement opportunities a wonderful career choice
good,"Dish values curiosity, pride, adventure and winning."
good,"Great company management could use a little help but overall great company you can make great money if your willing to work."
good,As long as you are willing to show up for work and Do your job it's not a bad place to work. They almost always promote from within and as long as you have a great attitude and attendance then you will almost certainly have opportunity to advance.
good,"While the review is for dish I was a subcontractor for dish at Tricom networks. The company was great but there was a lot of push to sell sound systems, fancy remotes, remote colored covers (skins) etc. but overall it was a great place to work. Unfortunately for me and my co-workers they closed the warehouse close to our team and the next warehouse dispatch was over 1hr 30min away if I needed something for the day or more equipment."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,working at Dish Network was a very rewarding and eye opening experience that was able to culture me in the supervisory roll that set the ground for future management positions
good,"Fast paced, could be stressful at times.  Pleasant work environment overall, fair compensation. Excellent training for each position, help available when needed.  Access to supervisors and managers for help in resolving complex customer issues."
good,"Buen ambiente dentro de centro comercial, ya que los clientes llegan solos, solo es cerrar venta."
good,nice opportunity to work. fun loving & challenging work place to work. HR polices are better compare to my previous experience. Leran lots of new things.
good,They gave extesnsive training.  I only left because i reached highest level tech and the only next option was management.  Most other jobs are located in colorado
good,the job had its up and its downs. Some days you would be yelled at all day by customers and other days it would be smooth sailing. It is not a job for just anyone. It is mentally strenuous.
good,muy buen trabajo buenas comiciones buen ambiente laboral
good,"Good company to work, Good culture and people are helpful to each other, HR Policies are good. Management is very oriented towards goal, Advance to work"
good,My direct managers were really good it seemed like the upper management were disconnected for the working man they preach work life balance but i don't feel it was achieved and i felt taken advantage of by upper management.
good,"I loved working for Dish and everyone at the company, I was under contract and was tasked with a job that had no advancement in my IT skills. While the company was great i was just in a position that wasn't great for me."
good,This is a great company to work. they value employee service and commitment. They provide with all necessary tools to be proficient in working. The managers are sociable and there is room for growth.
good,After completeing PGDM in marketing I was started working in Corporate. Now after 5 Years of experience in Corporate world I would like to explore to teaching world.
good,The job itself takes a bit to get down but once you do its quite easy. Management is great and extremely helpful. Any question you have will be answered in an extremely timely fashion. Good place to make money. A bit stern with the driving records as they will be quick to flush you out with there yearly driving record check-up.
good,un buen ambiente buenos compañeros que te enseñaban mucho pero faltaba un poco mas de orden
good,This job I can truly say its not for everyone. It answering high volumes of phone calls and sometimes they are not so pleasant to answer and it can be hard to keep your cool under control. But overall you get to put yourself in the shoes of the other behind the phone which can help you see how it can be difficult at times to be the other person on the call.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Dish has a bad rap when it comes to its work environment, but I enjoyed working there. My team was great, management wasnt bad, and a 4 on 3 off schedule was nice. Would have like to have been able to earn more, and the bi weekly bonuses were made near imposible when I left. Other than that, I would go back given the opportunity."
good,"My experience of 3 years working with DISH tv as been very fruitful, personally for me i have been promoted and the monetary benefits have been good.. work culture could be better, As ad sales employees we are not the main part of the business. The Management is excellent"
good,"Started from ground level entry, easy to excel if apply yourself. Training is never ending, learn something new everyday."
good,"Pros-they have a pool table, ping pong table, video games, massage chairs, pacman machine, and restaurant all in the center. Visitors from stations such as HBO and CINEMAX would raffle off expensive gifts during the shift as selling incentives."
good,"Call center with a laid back atmosphere. Things change very quickly and you have to pick it up fast, but there is also a lot of support to do so. Also, they hire internally, so room for promotions."
good,bhuena empresa pero el sueldo bajo. para el trabajo foraneo que se hace
good,I enjoyed working there even though the callers were a little rude at times I still made sure to give them the best of my ability to help them and answer any questions they had
good,"Frustrating calls, day in and day out. Teaches you patients. Management is there to assist you along the way. Work place is like a high school environment (gossiping). Hardest part of the job was satisfying the customer wants and needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers."
good,"very good company. very friendly..cooperating...Helpful company... "
good,They did alot of training which is helpful for those just getting started in a call center. A bit too much micromanaging. Nice facility. Too much turn over. Needed better compensation and hours.
good,Have enjoyed working at dish. People are excellent and there is plenty of training for advancement. Working hours are long but with a four day work week it makes up for the hours.
good,"Opportunity to advance, good pay, and plenty of incentives for on the phone agents.Growth is very progressive for hard working individuals."
good,"The hardest thing about this job is also the most rewarding.  This place of employ is very taxing on the body.  It is physically and mentally Draining.  However, in that comes a sense of accomplishment that most cannot find unless you are helping someone else.  DISH is all about their customers."
good,"I'm worked only 3 months "
good,"I would go back to work their. The place was fun, the coaches were mostly really good, and advancement is diffidently doable. I enjoyed  working there, and miss it a great deal."
good,Aprendí el apoyo completo administrativo. Me gusta mucho el ambiente de trabajo y las prestaciones son muy buenas.
good,"Great benifits, good pay. Yes you have to deal with some mean people but thats part of every job. If you can handle sitting for long periods of time and talking to a variety of people this job might just be for you!"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Very fast pace. Always have to be on your feet and focused. It gets very very busy and you usually end up doing more than your job title such as bussing tables, getting drinks for people, rolling silverware in the back, and washing dishes."
good,dish has structure and allows chance for advancement based on skill not just tenure. remote tech have freedom of dispatching from home.
good,"Family oriented company great people to work with felt very at home when I was at work, they where always willing to hlep with questions that I had.   Our team worked great together it was once again working with family.  The hardest part of my job was tech questions, but all questions always got answerd.  The best part of my job was the customer service explaining billing and taking payments of the phone and answering any questions the customer had about their account."
good,Great place to work.  Brotherly type work atmosphere with coworkers you can rely on.  Great management from training to day to day operations.  All around great place to work.
good,"Competitive work environment with entrepreneurial bent. Job can be rewarding, but requires lots of time onsite. Pretty good training program and incentive/rewards system."
good,"Dish was a wonderful place to work. It was a fast paced and fun. I learned the metric system and what the goals where there. I was a top performer there i was in the top 20% of the company for sales "
good,"Training was fantastic and we had all the necessary tools to do our job in a timely manner. Metrics played a big part of advancement and bonus opportunity and if anyone struggled, they were offered extra training, coaching and to shadow a representative doing well in the field that they were struggling in.  I was lucky enough to advance quickly and was able to help others that needed the extra help. Great company to work for, just a shame that there was the reduction in workforce."
good,Take alot of calls about customers looking for other companies.its also your job to sell the customer and make them get dishnetwork
good,"Pride, Adventure, and Winning (PAW) is the company's motto; and as such, it was my motivation as a Dish employee for nine years.  Innovation and change was a norm, and the drive to be ""Best In Class"" at what we do.  You have to be ready to meet every challenge, but with every challenge came rewards and opportunities.  Great above market pay!  Super management team, helpful and cooperative office staff, and family atmosphere with co-workers. There is a 360 degree turn from what the LSC was at start.  A new culture of people and management style (PAW).  Dish thrives on numbers, you're always attaining.....  My greatest joy was the travel, meeting people, and providing good customer satisfaction.  Oh yeah, hitting the NUMBERS!!!"
good,"DISH is a company where you have to learn to make the most of opportunities.  There are plenty of opportunities.  You will grow and expand in ways you may not imagine.  The people who work there are strong, intelligent, and innovative.  Management is far-seeing and industry leaders.  You'll work a fair number of hours, but the rewards for hard workers are excellent."
good,"Es una gran empresa a nivel nacional e internacional, mi trabajo lo realizo con gusto, es pesado, claro pero tiene sus recompenzas como cualquier trabajo, el unico detalle es que no siempre hay equipos para instalar, se escasean a nivel nacional eso nos indican y hay que esperar dias para que lleguen y si no instalas no ganas osea no es seguro tu salario y eso me afecta economicamente."
good,"My time at Dish Installations was great, the only reason I left was because I relocated to another city.  My coworkers, supervisors were always willing to help me learn new products and was able to reach my goals on bonuses with up selling products and services.  Overall it was a fun and learning time for me as I had been working with Dish Network products for the past ten years prior to when I started."
good,"All we would do was make calls and recieve calls for setting up cable, Hardest part of the job was cold calling potential buyers to sell them our product. The most enjoyable part of the job was the staff and management."
good,"Dish is a good place to work "
good,"Great place to work for benefits, but as for time off it was rough. You usually work a 10 hour day but it turns into more like 12-14 hour days. You have to fix other incompetent employees mistakes."
good,I enjoy working at dish its a positive work enviornment and friendly coworkers. They kept you updated on company changes. I enjoyed being able to see who my bosses were and walking around interacting with everyone.
good,"Easy job with good pay, but everything you do is scrutinized. Supervisors are 50/50. Some are great! Some play favorites and don't mind making other hard workers look bad. But if you go for the weekend shift, your job isn't safe. They do it so often to get a tax break, then start laying people off bit by bit."
good,"It's a good job, but management needs some serious work. It's also a 9-5 type job so the freedom to go do things comes down to how many hours you have banked up, which is incredibly frustrating."
good,"Un día típico de trabajo llego a las 2:00 me conecto, saludo  a mis compañeros, a mis jefes empiezo a gestionar clientes. Un cliente me quiere pagar con tdc y/o tdd, realizo la operación. Mi jefe me pone en junta para darme nuevas indicaciones. Enseguida tengo un cliente molesto por que no tuvo señal el mes pasado y ademas el técnico no se presento el día que acordaron, trato de estabilizarlo ofrecerle una disculpa y darle una solución,  a las 6 tengo que salir a comer, de regreso realizo curso en linea de 2 horas, por ultimo salgo me despido de todos."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Your are surrounded by peers that understand the chaos of working in a call center. Everyone and anyone is willing to assist with any questions or concerns you may have. Management is understanding and willing to work with you should any issue arise. Hardest part of the job is taking calls back to back without any downtime or rest between calls. Most enjoyable part of the job is when you assist a customer to the best of your ability and they genuinely appreciate your assistance.
good,"Leading DTH organization in India, Dish TV India Ltd, Revenue US $ 310 million, part of Essel Group, Revenue US$ 4billion. The organisation gives an opportunity to learn and grow to all its employees across levels being dynamic in nature."
good,"Se entra a las 7 am y salgo a las  2 pm, se tiene media hora para almorzar y  10 minutos de descanso lo que me gusta es que queda la tarde libre para cualquier otra actividad."
good,"enjoyed installing new system to help people enjoy life nice place to work , need to be more mindful of the family. great time to start just need to know better time at getting off"
good,"Un día típico en Dish, comenzaba a las 8 am con la conexión para atender las llamadas de los clientes, que  en la mayoría de los casos eran clientes molestos por las muchas deficiencias en el servicio, aunque cuesta admitirlo el sistema tenia demasiadas deficiencias y en algunas ocasiones nos tomaban por sorpresa a las personas que atendíamos los reportes de los clientes porque incluso el área administrativa desconocía las fallas, tardábamos un poco en habituarnos a una situación cuando surgía una problemática nueva, supongo que esto sucede cuando se busca constantemente la mejora en el servicio, en todos aspectos y en todas las áreas, para que se cumpla con las expectativas de los clientes. Aprendí bastante y desarrolle muchas habilidades en este trabajo, conocí muchas personas ejemplares, supervisores dispuestos a ayudar en cualquier duda, la parte mas difícil como lo describí antes fue manejar situaciones desconocidas ante clientes exigentes e intolerantes, hubo también clientes muy pacientes y amables, lo que mas me gusto fue el horario, el ambiente de trabajo, la relación con compañeros, los logros que alcance en mi vida personal gracias a la empresa Dish"
good,"es un trabajo agradable, con buen ambiente en q aprendes a tratar adecuadamente al cliente para convencer q contrate el servicio ofresido, lo malo es q no tienes una hora de salida determinada y como todo es basa de metas establecidas debes cumplirlas dia a dia y esto acarrea u na gran presion sobre los trabajadores."
good,"I've worked in many customer service jobs and this has by far been the most depressing. Even just the drive to work is stressful because all you can think about is all the angry customers you're about to talk to for 8 hours. Your lunch is only 30 minutes and there isn't any place dedicated for the relaxation of employees. There is no pay high enough for a job that makes me feel so low, 8 out of 10 of the employees I met smoked."
good,I would conduct team meeting (kudos or identify areas of improvement based on the stats the day before).  I learned the importance of time management.  My coworkers were AWESOME to work with.  The hardest part of the job is when you see someone not applying their best effort or not displaying full potential.  I very much enjoyed going into work.
good,Log in and start taking calls. Assist customers with a variety of issues. I have learned a lot about the dish technology that is offered in television services. The hardest part about the job is having to deal with highly escalated customers over the phone. The most enjoyable part about the job is being able to assist cutomers with their problems
good,"business has been a little slow due to the summer, sales have been down for a month. I have bettered my customer service skills within the sales field. the hardest part of the job is the time in between sales since work has been so slow. the most enjoyable part of the job is connecting people with affordable and enjoyable cable to watch."

good,"Es muy buen equipo con el que trabaje, llegaban para que les hiciera revision de recibos de cobro, checaba las unidades me proporcionaban tickets de gasolina para realizar reportes de consumo, hacia un corte al medio dia de como ibamos con pagos, resolvia dudas de clientes, realizaba cobranza telefonica, restablecia señal del servicio, asistia al supervisor con reportes u organizacion del equipo."
good,"Great employees get around $1000 in commission based on their stats, employees who can't meet the numbers get demoted."
good,Dish tv India Ltd. one of the growing company at dth sectore. They provide a quality of product to customer and also employee.
good,Great pay and benefits good job culture. I am comfortable with the fact that the attendance is as strict as it is. If my son who is disabled gets sick too much i will lose my job.
good,"Good place to work if you can get under the right supervisor. average 70 calls a day "
good,great memories with dish net work great co-workers upper management seemed fair great pay and work week 4-10's and good benefits i Have a great time working there
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,It was a fun place to work. Consisted on receiving calls from prospective customers. The task at hand was to educate them about the product based on their needs and make suggestions and make the sale.
good,"Online reviews of the work experience at DISH are fairly negative.  While these reviews do have some truth to them, they do not apply to the Customer Retention department.  The culture within the department is very supportive and progressive.  Its refreshing to be able to work with a group of people that are able to quickly and agilely work together to solve real time problems. The work days aren't long, but they are definitely hard."
good,Its a good place to work with many benefits. Four day work week and one weekend day off. only bad thing is the long hour days
good,"The majority of co workers were friendly and willing to help others.  At least once a month, we'd have some kind of event that involved a free lunch or such."
good,"How to handle pressure ."
good,"Fantastic company to work for, I thoroughly enjoyed my training. They gave me all the tools and knowledge I need for personal and professional success. I have never worked for a company with such friendly and knowledgeable employees, and I believe those that complain about this company do not invest in their own success and therefore are not rewarded by the company. Put in the effort and the company will take care of you, and reward you for your work."
good,Management will fire you at the drop of a hat. You work in any kind of weather.
good,Working at DISH network was enjoyable. Helping costumers on the phone was interesting. Co-workers were very helpful and friendly. The managers were very responsible. I have only positive comments to say about DISH network!
good,This type of job has ups and downs. Working for yourself is wonderful but the fact that your income is directly dependent on the sales staff of the compnaies from which you draw you work from can be hard. If they are having a bad time frame with slow sales your income is negativly inpacted.
good,doing custom work like running cable and installing dishes on the customers roof.providing customer service.working with power and hand tools.
good,"the entire day taking calls, only breathing time is during break"
good,I enjoyed working for dish network. The number one skill I learned in depth was to communicate. Every different location I went to I needed to communicate with the customer to know what they wanted.
good,"The Savannah Depot of Dish network was a great place to work because of the people. I did work long hours, but the people keep me going. I worked here for nearly 3 years, and the money wasn't bad for the area"
good,Working with dish network need a lot of patience because you will be dealing with people with different characters and as far as working with our field service manager they are really supportive concerning our advancement and to be a more productive tech.
good,It was a great experience working in a call center and building my customer service skills.
good,The typical day at work was assisting customer with there dish program and billing. I learn how to trouble shoot the dish program . Management was a joy to work for and always made sure you had the tools and the knowledge you need to be successful at your job. My co-workers was always a joy to work for and always believe in a team work approach. The hardest part of this job was the every changing work schedule but it was still ok. The most enjoyable part was the benefits and the work environment.
good,"Working for Dish will teach you great customer service skills and critical thinking.  Great place to start for an entry level job, and many opportunities for advancement in different departments."
good,It was a very quick working environment you had a large volume of equipment to inspect and test but they still did not overly stress their workers.  The management and co-workers were very open and helpful and wanted you to succeed. The hardest part of the job was the shift that I worked which was from 4p.m. to sometimes 4 a.m.  the most enjoyable was being able to interact with fellow co-workers so that you felt you were truly a part of a team.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Empresa que brinda retos constantes y permite el desarrollo de sus colaboradores
good,"I worked in IT in Cheyenne, it was a good job, good co-workers and manager.  My manager changed a couple of times in three years, but that is to be expected in a large company."
good,managment normally works with u. days can be long at times however u get 3days off. i did enjoy freedom of working alone. overall a decent job. they pay for training even if u have no experience. i enjoyed the job altogether.
good,"Dish was my first real job out of high school. They provided a fun, fast paced environment. There was a lot of potential for growth in that company. Definitely a good first start if you are looking to expand your customer service and sales experience."
good,A lot of great people and a good environment to be around. its a good work to life ratio as well. i like all the benefits that come with the job and the people i work with.
good,fast paced job get so many points for your work day depending on how fast you finish it that produces your points per our overall internet connectivity failure causes reviews etc sales you do have to conduct sales question product customer service completed etc
good,"A typical workday at Dish, depending on the time of the year, is usually pretty fast paced. The management is usually supportive and there when you need them. The hardest part of the job is staying focused and being able to have the mental capacity to handle the customers call after call."
good,"Dish is flexible with hours. Overtime is available. Relaxed setting. Assist customers with their billing, programming needs and trouble shooting issues."
good,I wish I was still there I liked the work and the people there but I don’t think that’s a place to have a career over all it is a very nice place to work
good,The management I worked under at Dish were great and helpful. You work on your own and follow a generated constantly changing route to provide service to customers. Supervisors would come to your job and help you even when you were hours away from the office or send someone else more experienced to help you so that way you were never truly struggling alone. The work for the job is hard and crawling under crawlspaces and lifting and climbing ladders puts a strain on your body. The sales aspect of the job combined with the pain I was getting in my knees was the reason I ultimately left. They expect you to pitch your sales and demo your stuff at every job even when the customer explains they have no interest which sometimes can build tension in an already hard job. Setting up and learning how to do the work was well explained and training and travel was all covered which was also good.
good,One of the best jobs I've had really loved that job training was easy to understand and if you had any problems while in the field someone patiently talked you through or a more experienced tech came out to assist
good,"mi periodo durante la empresa fue grato aunque con un pago algo bajo debido a que me encontraba estudiando, por lo general los supervisores son amables aunque parte del ese personal puede llegar a tratarte de la patada, sin embargo la empresa da oportunidad de crecimiento si lo sabes aprovechar."
good,was a great job but every pay raise meant less hours . they had unrealistic sell goals . if could not hit 35 a work order you would be written up. and was made to drive 300 miles one way for a job driving your points per hour down.
good,"Overall good company to work for, great training, and proper management selection. Human resources is undertaning of all personal situations and competitive pay rates"
good,Debes de organizarte con tus tiempo y tus actividades para terminar a buena hora.
good,it was a fun and exciting place to work. Job advancement and great benefits. I loved the hours and days. 4/10 hour days and every weekend off. Opportunity to work overtime if needed. Just a great place to work/
good,"The money was great in the loyalty dept, the management sucked however. Also, trying to get vacation was pretty difficult. If you are able to get vacation, your ranking for the team is completely wiped. One thing I really enjoyed was how the CEO wanted to make sure we had a comfortable workspace. It was fun, music energy, excitement and acknowledgement when goals were met. I would honestly work there again."
good,Ok company but with set schedule hard for family life when stuff comes up. Uses you vacation time when u call in but still count as a absence. Make good money there especially if you are good at selling.
good,The growth with in the company was amazing. There was always lots of openings for moving up the ladder. Plenty of training available to assist you in prepping for new positions.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,At dish you feel like you are with your family. There is always all the support that you need for your success. Also the company organizes a lot events for employees to break out the routine.
good,Day to day work is usually the same. You know what to expect and what is expected of you. Not a stressful or difficult job. equal parts down time and busy times.
good,"La empresa esta muy bien posicionada, tiene muchos clientes; el servicio no es del todo perfecto pero se brinda calidad. Hubo mucho enriquecimiento profesional;, ya que, no trabajaba con personas con la misma experiencia ni en la misma área de trabajo."
good,"Dish gives you a number of opportunities that give you stretch goals and new responsibilities every year. They ask a-lot from their employees but in return most folks are more well rounded because of it. The culture is very straight forward and direct, so when I say Dish is not for everyone it is not a bad thing. They look for people with grit and for people who can work with little to no direction at times. The result is folks have satisfaction and pride in their work. There may be days where there are long hours but people are proud of what they have accomplished."
good,"se aprende a tolerar a la gente, pues no puedes ponerte al tu por tu con la persona en la linea"
good,"Working for Dish wasn't as bad of a time as I make it out to be. If you don't have too many obligations at home, you're willing to work lots of overtime, and you enjoy a fast paced selling motivated environment, Dish is a great opportunity to make some good money. The team I worked with was great and very helpful. Management was always there whenever I needed them. My issue was that I was responsible for watching my kids in the evenings and I never knew when I was getting off work due to schedule demands."
good,"The goal as an Operations manager was to accomplish the tasks you set for the day such as managing interruptions, development and training of managers, reports and stats, budgeting and daily operations of running your facility."
good,"A diario se atendían y resolvían dudas de clientes. "
good,I had to work long hours at the beginning and sell customer products I was uncomfortable doing. You get scheduled a certain amount of jobs to do that you MUST complete then you can go home. You get paid commission on sold products plus points per job you work. The hardest thing when you go out on your own is learning a routine. Once you learn a routine the job gets easier.
good,"Oportunidad de crecimiento en la empresa. Buen ambiente laboral, requieres bastante disponibilidad de tiempo y para viajar."
good,"Dish is a good company to work for. Just a little difficult to career advancement."
good,"It has its good days and its bad days. Its good days are occasionally great and its bad days are occasionally terrible, but overall a decent place to work with awesome coworkers at times. The supervisors are pretty willing to get their hands dirty and roll out to a site if needed, and they are all about teaching you how to do your job proficiently and efficiently. There are worse places to work, and not many better places to find employment."
good,It was a great experience working there. Constant on the job training. Never felt monotony or that the work was dull. Great advancement opportunities.
good,"Good experience and good, structured process workflows and manufacturing methodologies.  Recruit for high talent and experience and general intelligence."
good,You stay busy on a daily basis. You work hard but there are a lot of chance to get bonuses if you do. It is a great place for  someone who is willing to put in the effort and time.
good,"Great job.pay is good and the benefits were great. Very long work weeks, and they ask to much from a beginning tech. Overall the job would be good for someone who is young and doesn't have a family and doesn't card to work long hard hours. The sales side if the job will make you feel like you are behind everyone else."
good,it was a great job for people who doesn't have a family but if you do then the hours are very difficult. also the independence of working there was nice as well
good,Good place to work but not enough job security. It is a call center atmosphere and you can be subject to corporates whims. Good benefits and you are noticed for doing good.
good,"A typical day at work was answering the phone and chats to take care of customer's needs."
good,"Dish has a good work culture, but the working shifts are kind of hard and you have to from time to time which sucks. You never know what shifts you""re getting"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"everything was great until Dish tried pushing Union workers out using illegal tactics like reducing wages"
good,It was an okay place to work for I enjoyed to co worker it was stress ful at times but overall it was not a bad place to work for they had lots of incenticves and game
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, trabajo bajo presión, con beneficios o prestaciones superiores a la ley."
good,Working at dish you have to come in every morning at 7 get your get your bag set up your van for the day clock in and your phone see your route for today and head out to your first job
good,Es un trabajo muy agradable en el que puedes desempeñar muchas actividades en las cuales deja experiencia laboral.
good,"Buena empresa, está bien la capacitación que dan, y muy entretenido el trabajo"
good,"El ambiente laboral es bueno, sin embargo hay que estar mucho tiempo laborando y recibiendo un salario no tan remunerable."
good,"I enjoyed working at this company. They provided great training for the first month and a half before I was on my own. A typical day at work was to look at my assigned jobs that i drove to and met with the customer. These jobs consisted of a full install, technical support, relocation of a dish or adding new products the customer had paid for. I had some family issues and unfortunately could not work with Dish any longer due to the situation I had to prioritize."
good,"DISH is an innovation company, one that is NOT afraid of change!  One of the best parts is in a year, you may be doing something completely different than what you were doing today.  The work/life balance is rough.  DISH does what they can, however, it's the nature of the industry."
good,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Dish. Managers were great to work for. It was difficult to deal with angry customers, but those calls were not very often and usually deescalated quickly."
good,"awesome experience and i appreciate all the training that was endured."
good,"typical day involved being ready to answer the phones, taking the customers call, inputing their security information and finding out what issue you could help them with, the most stressful part was not being able to fully resolve their issue or waiting on another department to resolve for them."
good,"At the beginning DISH was an awesome place to work at. Constantly providing prizes for simply doing your job. They were very transparent on how to succeed. Towards the end, the morale started to die as management was in transition and job security came in to question."
good,"Four day work weeks were wonderful, if not long. The pay was good, but opportunities to advance we minimal. As a technician, you could progress only to a point, unless you wanted to pursue management, but management positions were salaried and techs made a great deal more through overtime. Immeidiate supervisors were understanding of the positions challenges, as they mostly used to be techs, but beyond the Installation Manager position techs were considered replaceable."
good,"It was a fun, fast-paced place to work, the building was nice and clean, two large break rooms and a gym, and a person tends to get their own desk space.  The management was 50/50, depends on the person. The worst part of the job was the fact that answering calls all day without breaks could be stressful, especially depending on the customer."
good,While at Dish the environment was fast paced and full of changes. You need to adapt quickly and stay positive with change. You get great training opportunities that prepares you for becoming a great leader.
good,Back to back incoming calls.  Must be up to date with products and tech support as well as scheduling tech calls. Must be good at de-escalation of angry callers
good,While stressful and highly competitive at times I enjoyed the benefits and team spirit the company has. Dish has a great company culture and great core values.
good,Very knowledgeable and friendly people to work with. Fast paced. Commission earnings. Great management. Very understanding. Enjoyed my tome with these guys
good,I was on the phones 90 percent of the day.  Alot of competitive people.    My last department I worked I assisted retailers enter contracts in the system.  I got scored on quickness and accuracy.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar, buen ambiente y además es de las pocas empresas que manejan home office"
good,"There was never a dull day in the life of a technician and I had the joy of being a part of it. Being the Admin for multiple sites gave me non stop adventures. The hardest part was payroll for all three sites, but lunch time and getting to go in the field to process claims was the most enjoyable part."
good,"I liked working where I was at. I just got bored with the position i was in and all the up selling. The training is great and the people are awesome, however trying to get a day off is a hassle."
good,"Working in the Dish call center gives you many chances to advance. Your day consists of taking calls, and dealing with customers. You can deal with sensitive payment information. "
good,"I have had pretty good opportunities to assume additional responsibility and for career advancement, but it's necessary to look elsewhere to cash in on the experience."
good,"Company pushes sales too much.  Technician training was good.  Pay bonuses are graded on a metric scale, in which sales were part of.  I was not a salesman."
good,"Answer phones, take orders for DISH installs, log work orders, file finished work orders, do call backs to make sure customer is satisfied with work. My manager was very busy all the time, he gave me free reign to take care of the office and perform my duties. Hardest part of job was being the only one in the office, not having anyone to talk to or eat with. Most enjoyable part of my job was talking with the customers and my customer service skills"
good,"Take inbound calls daily, take payments, explain billing, help with technical issues. Good benefits and descent pay, preference scheduling is iffy. Not bad over all"
good,"Like any job in customer service, it is difficult to be in a call center environment working 10 hours shifts. The good: career advancement, fun work culture, plenty of overtime availability. The bad: high attrition rate, exhausting calls that make it easy to not want to go to work in the morning. In this case, as long as you are focused enough, you can get off of the phones quickly and move into a coaching or training role as long as you are able to perform as an agent on the floor. Everyone starts taking calls which makes for a healthy dynamic between management and the floor agents because the used to take the same calls."
good,it truly was a great place to work but heed my warning they take their policies very serious. they provide alot of very good benefits and they are great company when it comes to taking care of their employees
good,"Not a bad place to work in. The On The Job Trainers, Trainers and all are very nice. When I was working, it was in the middle of switching protocol. It felt very conflicted thus I'm not sure how to review this place."
good,Aprendí a trabajar bajo presión y a dar resultados favorables; también aprendí a manejar las herramientas de office así como el trabajo en equipo con enfoque a resultados.
good,Working in Dish Network warehouse is exciting and fun. Big discount on home TV service. The managers treat employees with respect. I love the hours; 10 hours per day/ 4 days a week and 3 days off.
good,"I would dispatch calls for DISH network installations, changes, and problems with service. I would also answer calls from the public requesting service. I also had to keep reports to track the amount of time it took the technicians to arrive, how long it took them to do the job and others reports. The manager was very kind, very encouraging and always gave words of praise. The workplace was calm. The hardest part of my job was telling the technicians where to go because a lot of them would get upset and didn't want to go to a job because of the distance. The most enjoyable part of my job were the people."
good,fast pace work enviornment good salary good training co workers look out for one another. great stock options and descent matching with 401k lots of overtime can make descent money
good,Been with dish for 3.5 years. If it wasn't for losing my baby sitter I wouldn't leave. But  I need 3rd shift so I have to quit. Would recommend for anyone who knows tech support.
good,Was a great job to have staff and leadership were friendly and promotions were typically readily available.  pay was competitive and I'm sure it's increased since I left.  would have stayed but took an opportunity with a friend starting his own business.
good,"professional place to work but sometimes racist issues arrouse, i love the dispacthing multi tasks. good life, i love my schedule and i l love my co workers"
good,"If you enjoy working with your hands and working outside, this is a great job.  You have very little supervision in the field, but there are surprise site visits by management."
good,not a lot of balance and they will make a lot of changes without telling you before hand. they will tell you over time is not required but then they will give you over time
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,They do take the time to train you good. I my case was especial cause i was in charge of all commercial work including airports. but the manager dint know how to manage or to talk to their employees
good,"Working at dish is a great job, good pay decent benefits, and good hours, all in all a good job unless you have a family the inability to have weekends off coupled with the super long hours the work life balance is horrible"
good,"I was worked there over 1 year on third party role"
good,Great work environment and also room for advancement.  I never had any negative experiences here and is a great place to work if you embrace a fast changing environment.
good,The company provides a friendly work environment with a professional and courteous work ethic. Provides the abilty at advancement within the company provides every individual with the ability to excel in the company
good,"Working at a call center is never an experience worth looking forward to, however Dish overcomes this by offering great benefits to even there low and mid level employees. The atmosphere is great and management for the most part cares about the people who work under them."
good,Running line from dish to house  installing satellite  installing receivers dropping lines from attic to 4 or 5 rooms gets hot up in the attics can be a hectic and time consuming.
good,"Dish is not for everyone. Some people will excel, and others will struggle. You have to be very motivated to get ahead, but if you are, opportunities will arise. Don't come here just looking for a paycheck or good vacation. Long hours are common with a desire to get the work done."
good,"I remember the days when I started working with BPO and later understood the paid people gone through when they attend customer over phone call."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, salario en la media, falta de promoción. Se hacen sugerencias, y no se toman muy en cuenta."
good,A good place to work just a little stressful at times people are easy to get along with alot of incentive programs training regularly. Support readily available
good,"Assited customers and helped fix majority issues while preventing similiar future occurrences. Provide excellent customer service. Also, was a mentor for other agents that needed help."
good,Good job but the didn't care about the safety of the technician. Was nice to meet customers everyday and had some good coworkers. Had two managers. One was good the other not good to work for. Only reason I left the job was that I was moving out of state.
good,Lover working for dish network very competitive and also the atmosphere was like family.everyday was like being stress free we worked as a unit.would work for dish again.
good,"My Experience as an former employee was great. It was a very up beat environment, with great team work. When I first started the Training was great, afterwards the On the Job Training was amazing. When I Started with an actual Team was the best. The supervisors were great, friendly and very understanding. You always had the help when ever needed. Great Bonuses and Prizes. Fun activities, and a Great Work environment. One thing I disliked was how Some Managers we're all about Favoritism, and special treatment. Treat everyone as Equals.  If that can be fixed, the Job would be flawless."
good,"A fun and interesting place to work for. DISH invests heavily in their employees and offers plenty of benefits/compensation for your work. "
good,"Good benefits and a great work schedule. Advancement in the company is not controlled by your performance due to how your metrics are set up. If a customer is not home, it counts against you. If you don't have a line of sight, it counts against you.  If the customer does not have Internet, it counts against you."
good,"Very intense volume of calls and customer related concern that would   keep the crew very busy. I had the opportunity to work with more than 40 different languages in my department, and I was able to acquire a great understanding of cross culture sales, and a sense of urgency. Managers were very busy, but always trying to provide the best support they could. Due to so many different countries and personal habits combined it was a challenge to be able to put everybody in the same track during trainings, and make them to understand the importance of follow certain steps. Interact with the customer and solve their issues it was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"This was my first job & i learned many things from this job like time management, discipline & responsibility. The working environment was quite good."
good,"Great experience. Similar to the movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". You can make what you put in. They are always giving out incentives. Great staff. I will miss food days."
good,"I was happy with working with this company for almost 3 years, they have some bad management but who doesn't. All they ask from you was to work hard, show up on time and be willing to learn new things."
good,"Una empresa comprometida con las mejoras continuas con referente al personal para que se tenga un buen funcionamiento al momento de atender la solicitud del cliente."
good,"Overall Southern Star was a great company, I was hired very quickly and in training within days. Completed 2 week training period then released to do my own jobs. They supplied a take home van, gas card and very easy to communicate with."
good,Great company but hard to enjoy family with the long hours and split shifts.other than that great job for a single person
good,"So I have worked in a few call centers in the area, and on a scale of 1 to 10 this one is a 9 or 10.  That being said it is still a call center AND its sales…   It’s inbound ONLY and the customers know what they are calling for (PLUS and PLUS).   Try working an outbound center, you may make more, but how many times do you want to cussed out in a day?!?!  Your selling TV service, how hard is that?  Here are your stations here is your price, Done!  It’s pretty laid back as call centers go.  They try and help you as much as possible.  Management could be better, and it is cliquey.  They need more men in management!  Owners seem nice but you never see em.  They have a full time cleaning crew, so it’s clean.  Its well-lit and comfortable, although they keep the AC at 65 so bring a sweater.  The hours are not that bad.  Yes, if you’re new you get a rough schedule but if you sell allot they will bend over backwards to give you what you want.  That seems to be the only key with they place 1. Sell well 2. Be liked by management.  The commissions are pretty good, could be better, but I was a selling in the upper half and making 18 to 20 an hour.  So that’s about it.  Like I said, its call center life, but you could do a whole lot worse."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company but it was vary inconsistent what policy changes . Great opportunities for advancement , great incentives and awesome training"
good,The job culture is great. The only problem i faced was the long dostamce travelling. Overall good growth opportunities for new starters. Yes the long hours may get u tired but ultimately ia good money for bread and butter
good,"It was a fun and friendly environment to work with and with many incentives! The lunch room was large with a number of couches, tv's, and games to play. Prizes are given away frequently and it was super  easy to win cool prizes."
good,"Es una empresa agradable, se aprende mucho de el ambiente laboral y trabajo en equipo, buen compañerismo"
good,"Very Good Company to work with having best in class Management."
good,this is a good company to work for. there us alot of room for advancement. the only down side is that some of the management isnt that willing to help.
good,"Everyone always had a great attitude, I learned how to speak to customers in difficult situations. I also learned how deescalate a situation they were having if possible. Management did a great job and the coworkers I had worked as a team. I don't want to say there was really a hard part it was pretty common sense, and it was an enjoyable job."
good,La interacción con el personal y clientes de esa empresa fue buena
good,"Working at dish at its benefits, the working environment was a pleasant one, everyone is always happy and cheerful, my only complaint would be the work loud that an agent would get after working with so many customers"
good,A typical day consists of phone calls concerning billing or technical support. In addition to your typical work there is also ample training and time to for development. What I have learned is to seek out my own personal development and growth. Dish has one of the best work cultures I have every experienced.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Working at DISH has definitely been a positive experience.  I have been working here for over a year now, and I would highly recommend a career with DISH for anyone interested in working in a collaborative and innovative professional environment.  Management is always there to support and educate coworkers and help to perform and improve daily processes."
good,I clock in I begin setting my computer up before I meet with my coach to go over the agenda after that we go ready calls come in and we handle each one with a great tone and promote dish. The hardest part of working here is the constant change in everything my friends I met ere will always be a text away and the incentives were always great.
good,"aprendes constantemente nuevos sistemas de trabajo"
good,"No supervisors looking over your shoulder"
good,"Una muy buena empresa, con un excelente ambiente laboral, la administración no es muy buena, pero considero es por el poco tiempo que tiene."

Management was always there to assist its employees and there was always good inspiration to keep the good work and improve it.The most enjoyable part of the work was the people i met trough my days working for Dish.
good,"I have worked in several industries all of which had difficult people to work with.  Whether it was a customer, co-worker or management personnel.  Since joining Dish I have seen a complete change.  Everyone is nice, has time to talk to you.  I've never felt rushed, unappreciated or unwanted since I began working for Dish."
good,Its a great place to work and  to make alot of money and great people you work with and great teachers that will push you to do better
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Dish gives a technician the opportunity to provide the customer with anything they need.  It gives me great satisfaction to leave a customers home knowing I have provided everything in my power to meet their needs and expectations. This is an awesome company with its eyes focused on the future.
good,"Overall great place to work for. 30% discount for associates. Although management wasn't the best, the company itself is fun to work for. Daily tasks consisted of helping customers find what they wanted, handling cash transactions, making sure the store was clean, and sales quotes were met. Overall great atmosphere and would work for them again."
good,pues me la pasaba de forma agradable lo unico que no me gustaba en que cierta forma tenia que dar explicaciones de lo que hacia y en ese aspecto no me gustaba por que yo trabajaba para beneficiarme a mi y alguien mas pero es mas para mi beneficiencia y por ese motivo me retire de ahi.
good,Long hours but overall a very rewarding job and great experience.  Most applications are internal so there is a huge learning curve but everyone is patient and helpful.
good,i enjoyed the enviorment and that i was reconized within the first year to move into the training department.
good,"Learn to work in a team, Rules and Regulations to follow.Loving place to work."
good,"A typical day at work will be checking my emails, grab reports and set up my grid for my technicians. Call my technicians to see f they are in route or made it to their job site and keep that up until my shift is over. I also answer calls, and answer any question  customer or sub-contractor may have. I learned a great deal at Dish Network. Their was training everyday and I became very good at Word Excel while working at Dish Network. My co workers were more so independent workers but when it was something one of us need they will extend their hand to help out. The hardest part of the job was getting laid off. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new projects every week,"
good,"It was fun to work here, fair compensation, great management overall a great company to work for."
good,Currently working with the Cyquator Media Services (Dish TV inbound calling process) As an Inbound Customer Care Representative.

good,"I received in bound calls regarding customer accounts.I was an advanced TSR III agent."
good,"llegar entregar deposito bancario, ver nuevas rutas de cambaceo, aprendí que hasta no ser humilde, pero si centrado en las metas fue cuando empece a crecer.  Hay ciertas personas que realmente se merecen el puesto en el que están, y quienes deberás valoran al Capital Humano que tienen en la empresa. Hasta que Falleció... en el mismo velorio gente postulandose para el puesto."
good,A typical day at work Consisted of being at work by 7:00 am. And completing a cable route. I've learned how to work on Satellite Dishes .Management was great And help out a lot. My co workers all kept to themselves. The hardest part of my day was selling products for high prices that the customer could get for cheaper somewhere else. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,Everyday starts with a new challenge and new targets to achieve that very day wish keeps you on the challenging mode. Very motivating seniors.!
good,"Great company to work for however as a technician you constantly have a target on your back, there is about 8 different categories you have to maintain high numbers in or you start to lose your bonus or constant harassment from upper management. With that being said the pay is decent to start out and the benefits are great. But without having any college education good luck moving up in the company, hard work will go unnoticed"
good,I enjoyed working with Dish Network and gained a lot of experience on the corporate install area.  I accepted another offer of employment to advance my professional career.
good,"Center Partners was a large corporation that housed several contracts with different companies, I worked for a few while I was with them."
good,Dish is a good company to work for. You get paid for training and its easy to advance in the company to whatever position you would desire. Pay is good and there are bonus pays to get as well.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,company is very good .we have lots of international buyers.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is helping employees move forward in their careers.
good,"A typical day in the call center would consist of handling and solving customer complaints. Resolving technical issues and billing questions. I had learned how to be more professional and empathetic towards customers, as this was my first customer service position. Management was helpful and very goal driven. The co-workers were helpful and team oriented. The hardest part of the job was handling high escalation calls, though it gave the opportunity to make things right with the customer and resolve their issues. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I helped numerous people throughout the day."
good,Sitting down and providing excellent customer service skills via phone.
good,a typical day is pretty busy. I have learned a lot more about the installation process. Management is good they do what it takes to help your get the job done. Co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is just not knowing what you may be up against each day and the most enjoyable part is to be out in the community meeting new faces and people each day.
good,"Shifting Work Schedules"
good,Would have liked to had more promotion job access. I liked the technical aspect of the job as I  became an installer from working there and really liked that job!
good,"•	STB testing :- My premiere task is QA/QC of DVB-S AND S2  STBs of C  based Middleware, which includes sanity , regression, integration, system testing etc."
good,I gained customer service experience that I can utilize to better shape my performance in a call center environment.
good,"I would be up and at work by 530 every morning, i would have to clock in and grab my tools and get started. Managment was okay but not great. They often lied to us about what all we had to do that day, and they did not have the best of attitudes most the time. The hardest part of this job would have to be working 12 hrs monday through friday. The best thing about this job was the money. I made 10.75 and hr."
good,A normal day at work includes coming in early gather tools and supplies. then getting out to the field as soon as possible. You work by your self all day. I have learned excellent communication skills dealing with customers on my own. I have also learned how to rely on my self. I can function great as a member of a team but can also be just as productive alone. Co-workers are great if you ever get stuck all you have to do is call them and they can give you advice. The hardest part of the job i would say is every job you go to is different. There is never one cut and clear way to do things its all about trial and error and what experience you take from it. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new things everyday and meeting all kinds of people.
good,"Es una excelente empresa, un valor importante es que da la oportunidad a chavos de comenzar con su primer empleo, es muy importante por que va formando a la nueva platilla laboral dando experiencia y en un ambiente tranquilo."
good,"-A typical day at work involves a great deal of socialization. You are encouraged to make your callers feel more comfortable with the questions and concerns they had, and more at ease with their responsibilities with the company."
good,Nice company. Fair about everything. Just didn't feel safe on ladders
good,"Experienced in a Call Center analyzing customer billing issues, Verified quote system data with customer orders to ensure accurate processing, Resolving satellite TV issues."
good,"If you are looking for a company that is rooted in telecommunications, and is not only a leader in this field they are also a student of their own craft."
good,"There are always some kind of contest or event going on. Unfortunantely I was able to realize that call centers are not the type of work that I would like to do. I was very good at my job, I just didnt enjoy it as much as others. My floor supervisor was awesome, and If you like call center work, I would encourage you to apply."
good,"The typical day usually has a couple of customer installations and service repair orders. I learned about time management and being productive, and most important handling customers and doing things in a safe manner. Co-workers for the most part were great I've learned alot from each of them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with each site because nothing was ever the same for each customer. Going home knowing I truly helped someone and being respected for it was my most enjoyable part of my job."
good,This was a fun job to work. Learning how to install satellite systems is challenging but worth the hard work to see a satisfied customer.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Dish is a great place. The only thing is if you get stuck at a house then your 10 hour day can become much longer. The people are good, the management is good, but when I was there with a young family it was hard"
good,"A decent place to work at, high lay off rate every year, discounted TV service"
good,"a typical day I will diagnose, repair, and or install about four to six customers satellite television system. educating them on the system and giving them the best viewing experience."
good,"Answer phone calls, take on sales orders from sales reps and input them in system to generate order for new customer."
good,"The job was ok. Never a dull moment. Had alot of administrative help. The customers were definitely a challenge, but i was able to assist and resolve alot of customers issues."
good,"A typical day can be easy or hard. You don't get off work for bad weather and you can work 60+ hours in a 4-day work week, but they pay overtime and also allow you to earn bonuses on every check. The managers really care about you as an employee and will help you grow as a technician. Everyone is hard working and takes pride in their jobs. The hardest part of the job is doing installations in cold/rainy weather or in large houses without cabling. The most enjoyable part is how quick the day goes by. You're always busy so the day breezes by."
good,"Dish is a great place to get your start. The company cares about it's customers and makes stride to make the experience for employees meaningful as well. The training is thorough and sets you up for success, and the daily support ensures that you are able to meet and exceed your job expectations. There is a mapped out career path and opportunities to grow into leadership. From the time you start you have an opportunity to really help people. "
good,In the call center to start you don't make very much but very quickly raises can be obtained. Very family-friendly company there's lots PTO time available.
good,On the job training is available to anyone without experience. Opportunity to advance in the company with others working as a team. Great management and leadership.
good,"Don’t like how I was set with a non coach, I was set with a level three tech, but it is what it is. Overall everyone is nice and friendly great people to work with wouldn’t want to work with anyone else. Great company!"
good,es buena empresa pero la gente que se encuentra alla desde hace años impide que tengas crecimiento laboral
good,"Good workplace, pay could be better. I learned new technologies. Management doesn't seem to care much about job advancements and personal growth. Overall a good place to start."
good,Building rapport with customers making sure they are always extremely satisfied with the service/sale working outdoors and in the customers home installing and siting in the dish was my favorite part.
good,"Physical labor, long days, good management, after 4pm is the hardest paert of the day, i enjoyed the bonusesw we got when we did a good job, i learned a lot about technology and customer service"
good,Good company. They take care of the employees. There are four manager at location I'm at and they care about the employee success in company. Work four days and off for three days.
good,I feel that DISH NETWORK was a very good place to work for and would recommend anyone that enjoys resolving issues foand with a customer over the phone.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Great place to work, people are super friendly!  You can make lots of money, you just have to ask the right questions, take advice on how to grow! Great job for many people!"
good,I liked working for them there are good place to work for picking good people and you got to meet all new kinds of new people and you got to go all different places which was cool
good,"I enjoyed working at Dish. I had to leave to find something closer to my house. I was also concerned with the future of Dish, but my understanding is they are doing fine, and would love to work their now, if it was closer."
good,"Nice place to work. I enjoy my time there, as the conversations with clients can be quite fulfilling. I also like my lead/boss and other managers that work at DISH !"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, sueldo promedio, prestaciones superiores a las de ley, actividades sencillas."
good,the people at dish are amazing we all help each other the best we can and you never feel like you are left out. its a fast paced competitive job and there are a lot of incentives for your hard work.
good,"Buenas comisiones"
good,"you basically show up to answer calls for 8-10 hours and leave, a work lifestyle is encouraged but limited to a select few due to company needs, limited floor support but always demanding progress and setting new standards"
good,"Company as a whole provides freedom to individual in terms of enhance knowledge & handle projects independently. Such freedom, certainly builds sense of leadership, increase accountability & make workplace feel like home.  However hardest part always remains bringing all different departments under one umbrella."
good,"the training and supervisors were great.  Scheduling was great. you had your choice of shifts.  A typical day at work could sometimes be stressful, depending on the call, but managers and asst. managers were always there to help.  I liked that we were all on a level playing field on the floor from training. it was a very technical/billing/etc. job but management was patient and helpful."
good,out in the field doing your job doing work that would be proud of until management took away the incentives that drove the techs to compete against one another which was good for moral. then that was taken away and replaced with everything depending on sales not technical work. So if you didn't meet quotas you would be written up.
good,"If you find the right department you will love the people there. The demands and requests can be a bit overkill. The promotion process is lacking, a small amount of people obtain promotions. It is also difficult to move to other departments for a bigger or better position, unless you know the hiring manager."
good,Can be fun depending on supervisor and team morale. A lot of calls incoming so be prepared for a constant call flow. Very little down time and usually plenty of overtime.
good,"Fast paste environment, good trainers and supervisors. Good prizes for doing your job correctly. So many changes can happen in a week like updates to the company procedures."
good,"They advertise the job on Indeed and ZipRecruiter as a technician position just installing and troubleshooting their services however what they do not tell you is that a majority of your position is really upselling the customers to buy things to “enhance their growing experience” such as TV mounts and soundbars. If you’re not into selling things, this is not the job for you."
good,"While Dish does get a bad name, I worked with some great people that I respect. It is a company that is working to the future and it will be interesting to see what is next."
good,It was a great job to work for. It taught me more skills and how to handle calls efficiently and effectively. I'd still be working there if not for medical issues.
good,I would start the day by reading my pending work for the next few minutes followed with a brief synopsis of the day from management. Throughout the day it would be recieving calls from customers that had already gone through the normal process but were still not satisfied. Usually very escaleated by that point.
good,It's a very good place to work. Management was excellent. Work was enjoyable and i liked being able to meet different people. I just don't like the sales aspect. If you dont meet a certain sales quota you'll be terminated even if you're the best tech in office.
good,I was happy to work for a company that gave me the opportunity to learn a new skill and earn enough money for my family. The job did have some long hours and I sometime worked in harsh weather but that was only for a limited time. I recommend working for this company.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,My experience at dish was good due to being newly retired from the military I had to reign in order to make scheduled doctors appointments. The company gave me a number of skills in which I still use today.
good,"excelente ambiente laboral, las personas son amables."
good,"El horario es muy bueno, la relacion entre empleados es muy buena"
good,"It was a good company to work for. Lot's of people & a bit noisy, I mean it is a call center. It's a very fast paced work environment. You must be able to conversate with customers through your entire shift. The hardest part of the job is meeting the incentives of upselling certain movie packages."
good,Great place to work. Bosses and team leaders are all very polite. Show up on time or you will get in trouble. Attendance is huge with them. must be at work to make money.
good,If you love interacting with various people from all walks of life then this is for you. My only negative was that it became a sales position and not based of merit and solid work. If you weren't able to sale you were faced with a writeup etc.
good,Great place to work. I wish it was still in the area. The people were fun and the environment was great to work in. We share work ethic and great memories.
good,Very busy place. Lots of calls. Learn how to satisfy customer that are very mad. Fun people to work with always made my day goes fast. Learn how to coach.
good,"If someone will ask me how can I describe my experience working with Dish? All I can say is AWESOME! "
good,"Great place to work , salary and commissions were awesome. I recommend whoever want to apply to give it a shot , you wont regret it."
good,"The company, culture and perks were really good but the scheduling practices are absolutely terrible especially if you have children. The work with third party recruiters who tell you something totally different then what the schedule actually is when employed"
good,"Area de operaciones ningun dia era igual"
good,Dish is trying to be everything to everyone and sell more than just cable service. As a dish installer i was also required to maintain a 28.00 dollar per woodworker sales quota. They call it smart home services. I was let go after 2 years because i was unable to keep that requirement.
good,This is my first career out of undergrad. It's a good place to start out. I love the culture in the marketing department but feel as though the salary compensation leaves some to be desired
good,I had a wonderful experience working at Dish Network. I’m grateful to have such an opportunity at a very young age. The staff was wonderful. We were always givin opportunity to advance as well as get coaching that encouraged us to keep doing our best.
good,"this company has a great and fun work environment, most of the team leaders are Pro-Agent which is very unusual in the BPO industry but you will definitely enjoy all things you do there."
good,"Dis Network is a treat place to start your career. During my 10 year tenure, I held various positions that allowed be growth and knowledge to transition to my next career phase."
good,"I am a remote tech, so I do not have a commute for work. Great culture and teamwork mentality. When first starting as a tech, the hardest part is making sure that you get the installs done right. But as you get that down, the most stressful part is the sales that the company pushes you to make. The expectations keep getting bigger and bigger. I didn't struggle with the sales, I am actually the top sales tech in my office. But I recently talked to a Directv tech, and they make more money, are guaranteed 40 hours, and do not have the expectations of selling at every stop."
good,"Ambiente laborar agradable, asesoramiento y aprendizaje constante."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Despite of the little time wich I worked there, it’s a friendly place to work! The company provides all tools and infrastructure to make your job very well"
good,"Worked in receiving department,  fast paced with no time to relax until break or lunch. Really enjoyed this work enviorment. Our supervisor would give us our quota every hour"
good,"always on the go, very fast passed environment. Dish network focuses a lot on there selling aspect of the job so no matter how good you are at installing and how fast you can get them done if you do not meet a certain quote of sales you get terminated after a period of time of not meeting the quote."
good,"Good training, good performance bonus. As a installer, work 4 days per week. Job can be risky at times. Pay is good and bonus standar is very possible to reach."
good,"While the health benifits and the compensation aren't the greatest in the industry, Dish takes pride in promoting from within and rewarding hard working employees."
good,"It was a great place to work, they were always trying too make sure that u had a fun environment to work inn lots of training and development,management was great"
good,Worked for DISH 7 ears and saw advancement. The company left town after building lease was up. Offered to move agents they deemed qualified by the company.
good,"Un buen lugar para trabajar, muchas actividades entre compañeros"
good,"A great challenge to take care of 2 company's customer service i.e., Dishtv & Videocon D2h. Entire day carries out with phone calls/Mails & stock requirement/reconciliation. Management supports a lot to us if there is any urgency in Service delivery. The hardest part as well as enjoyable part of the job is Corporate Sector. In corporate sector, the customers uses 200+ connections & we have to provide them service 24x7 i.e., even at night 1 or 2 also we attend their phone calls to resolve the issues over phone. If the problem resolves, its a great enjoyment/relief for us."
good,"A typical day at dish is waking up around hour or so before your shift and look at the logs, never a promised  a home time. I learned more about the RG lines and different kinds. Mangers was good but did not want to do much. The work place settings was cold in the winter and hot in the summer. The hardest part of the job is working long hours and going into nasty homes. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and seeing your co workers"
good,"it has a state of the art facility to work, good schedules available for those whom may be attending school. relaxed and some supervisors are really good."
good,"Over all a good place to work . Lost to do in a fast environment , lost of calls . No support if needed and no got with management .  Free services are the best"
good,".Assist in tech support calls, and sell the value of PPVs and Dish packages"
good,"The people I worked with locally were fantastic. However, over half the customers were not usually happy to see me and I often found myself bearing the brunt of their frustration towards the company at large."
good,"They constantly have opportunities for advancement and the ability to get overtime. If you need money and are good at talking to people and multitasking it can become an easy job for you. It can be stressful working long hours and having to sit for so long but again, if you need a temporary or long-term job that pays well then I would recommend it. Staff is very nice and willing to assist."
good,"Arrive at work at 6:45A.M double check my van is sufficiently stocked with materials and heading out by 7:15 A.M. typically my mornings were the tougher jobs of my day for example i would have new customers/ installs , or migrations which were existing customers that had moved. 30 min lunch . second half of my day was usually troubleshooting or upgrades finishing typically 4-5 jobs daily returning tonthe shop around 6 or 7 to restock my van . clock out and head home."
good,The weekly pay is a big plus when it comes to sub contractor as a job. With dish your allowed to sale certain merchandise which they provide for you to offer as a sell item. You are compensated for every sale. Healthy atmosphere to work in.
good,very easy company to work for people are friendly. they offer very nice benefits package. The training was made to easy to follow. instructors were able to answer all the questions.
good,i love taking calls everyday knowing i was helping someone around the world. If i ever got stuck on a call my team or manager will assure i will get all the helped needed.
good,Good job overall. I left due to low salary and forced sales...no other complaints. I was not happy when they tried to force in-home sales on techs. I was hired to install tv not sell.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Dish was a very good place to work and I would still be there if my health had not of forced me to quit. It can be stressful at times but most of the time the customers are very nice and just want help with an issue that they are having but if you help them in a timely matter it is very rewarding. I would recommend people to work for dish network. Their perks are not bad either.
good,It was decent for a call center. They worked with me and helped me grow. It was a great opportunity to learn and grow.................................
good,"Working with dishtv has many shades. Most of the shades are bright and few are grey. I am given the freedom to do the innovation within the brand guid lines and manage a big sales force and their demand. Office politics are part of life these days and it exist everywhere, so it does not make any impact on my performance. I am enjoying working here with 3 Awards, recognition from HR, 2 promotions in last 7 years. I have been handling two circles and more than 30+ sales force , 85 distributors , communication to 18000 recharge outlets all across."
good,Productive workplace. Helping customers with account issues. Management was awesome. Hardest part of job would have been time limit for calls. Most enjoyable part of job would be speaking to different people all over.
good,"Muy buen trabajo, un muy buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,"Think of it like a sports team. When you take the job, you know what's expected of you. Professionalism, speed, quality, sales, resect, and integrity. Now obviously some of these contradict one another. But like any athlete you have your traits, your strengths and you weaknesses that will show themselves as you progress. Key word ""progress"". Don't get lazy! For me, I was better at customer service. I was decent with sales. But not very fast. 2nd string if you will. Well rounded. But it was because I listened to those who came before me. I learned. Management does a great job helping you improve, especially at this office. But you have to have an open mind. Don't let emotion inhibit your potential. The formula works. I promise. I'm a better man because of these guys. If i didn't have to move id still be there. Get out of your comfort zone. Push yourself. Travel. Travel. Oh and did I say travel?"
good,I don’t have much to say every experience is different  when they work there some people may say that they loved it some people will tell you that they hate it. All I can say is that it is what you make of it
good,"Learning the skills necessary to complete the job was easy. Work is steady, they understand if you're late. There are policies in place for everything, that makes it easy to follow the rules, do your job, and get paid."
good,"Working at DISH was a wonderful learning experience, can truthfully say I have learned so much from working there. Just wish it was managed better, had different HR advisors and Managers."
good,Se conoce muchas partes del estado y se viaja con los compañeros a todas las regiones que requieran el servicio
good,"Technology changed frequently enough that we had to be able to adapt to new things almost daily. Though this was a little difficult, it's something you get used to."
good,"Most of the people at the company are great, and joined the company because they want to work for a place that makes a difference. The benefits are okay, and the company supports the idea of work-life balance"
good,"Only complaint is I wish they had better health insurance options. Other than that, the leadership is generally open to change and the company invests heavily in the future of digital media."
good,I was able to grow with this organization and had the pleasure of serving multiple roles for the organization. There were many talented and inspiring individuals that I was able to work with and learn from.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.

good,This job can be stressful sometimes but the pay was okay. Customers are very irate. The experience of dealing with different people everyday taught me how to handle many situation.
good,"Fun working in an outside environment. The training could have gone better, my lead was very impatient and judgmental. Even though i have extensive background in the industry. I ended up leaving because of transportation issues."
good,Dish is an awesome place to work for.  The environment is so outgoing and dish appreciates employees by having events.  The pay was good as well and OT was there to choose.
good,"-Assist customers of Dish Networks satellite video services."
good,"Full benefits, Vacation time and sick days.  It is a good career. Also dangerous.  climbing a ladder 40ft is sometime required.  Physically demanding."
good,At any given time I was tracking anywhere from ten to thirty technicians. Sometimes it was hard to keep up with who was where and who needed to have jobs reshceduled.
good,Que sean un poco más flexibles con las conexiones.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people."
good,The company is closing business in the TV satellite services. The Spartanburg facility is closing gradually and that is the reason I do not recommend anyone to work there.
good,"this was a great company , they gave away free gifts all the time. It was a very relaxed atmosphere and the management was very great and understanding."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo muy bueno, compañeros muy colaboradores, jefes muy condescendientes, buen trato, con mucha paciencia, aprendí el trabajo de una warehouse. a manejar forklift, jack manuales y  eléctricos, a conocer los productos que despachamos, a trabajar ordenadamente y con eficiencia, lo más difícil posiblemente aprender dónde estaba cada producto. me encantó el ambiente de trabajo, excelente"
good,You can develop important projects because in this Company are a lot of opportunities to apply all the manufacturing tools and obtain work experience to reach the personal and company goals.

The management team do try to make sure that all employees feel valued by hosting various events throughout the year and allowing for casual dress (as long as it is within company guidelines) on certain days.

Then we would have our team meeting where the supervisor would motivate and uplift our spirits so that any bad call would just roll of our shoulders. In between calls the supervisor would hold different contest which were super fun. The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of the shift because I enjoyed working there so much.
good,really liked it here but i it did not pay much and after a while it gets boring on the phone all day

good,It was always a busy day at work providing customers with excellent service.
good,Busy work week regardless the day of the week. I learned about Technical Support in a different level. Management was great and understanding. The co-workers were friendly. The job was difficult because we had to troubleshoot over the phone with guideline provided. The fun part was that you work your mind to try to resolve situations.

(Team lead(s) are usually the most knowledgeable member(s) of the team and normally is someone looking to move up in the company)."
good,"I worked for the Blockbuster division of Dish, Inc. They worked well around my school schedule and management was extremely friendly and helpful. Paid a bit over minimum wage, and hours were hard to come by when we didn't hit budget."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Loved fixing satilites. Management was good. co worker great. hardest part was telling customers that their dish wasnt working due to bad weather.
good,concertar citas instalar sistemas realizar servicios tratar con gente vender el sistema trabajar con libertad y cumplir con las citas realizadas
good,"DISH is an ambitious company due to the owner's drive to grow, expand and adapt. This proved for a work environment centered around making things work. If you are a creative and driven person, it is easy to shine in this environment, as well as to move up the employment ladder."
good,"Normal day would consist of getting my team ready for our New Hire class if we had one scheduled, meeting with trainers and our training manager to go over next weeks schedule for up training."
good,i loved my work schedule. i had graet co workers no drama issues. the most enjoyable part of the day was LEPC!!!
good,Installed and serviced satellite television for families and companies.
good,"Go in at 5:30 or 6 am, Auditing anything from remotes to L.M.B.F's (satellite part) to cables,phone cords,and switches. Than coming in once a month to do End Of The Month Inventory through out the warehouse on receivers. Management is very nice and eager to show you a lot, which is great, love learning new things. Co-workers are very nice we make a good team, help each other out with different areas we work in. we take turns running different areas. Cant think of anything hard about the job, but the most enjoyable part is learning some thing new, moving to different areas every so often so it doesn't get boring."

good,Its a good job if you dont have a family or a family that understand the hours. It has alot to offer and can make alot of money if your willing to work alot.
good,Es un buen lugar para trabajar y las prestaciones que dan son excelentes
good,"Some days can very rough, and other days can seem like they go by very quickly. The workplace always depends on the Weather. But I can say even though it may not be a job for everyone but those who are up for the challenge will be compensated for a job well done."
good,"Great place to work, with focus on advancement if you want.  Schedules can be an issue as they are built around business needs.  Training is great and plenty of support to get started."
good,I enjoyed my time with Dish!! I learned a lot from the company leaders & Would recommend anyone who could get a chance with the company to take it. It is a fun work environment.
good,I was really pleased with my experience at dish. I think it is a good company pay could be better but they other benefits are awesome!  The culture and environment  rocked
good,"They are planning something big and exciting that will change the industry. They need manpower and smart, patient people. Work is great and you get commission on top of your hourly pay."
good,"Great training that gives you more skills as you move on with your career. Plenty of room for career advancement. During off seasons, if the  call que is low they will let teams leave early. During high call volume seasons there is mandatory overtime. (4 hours minimum when I worked there but there is potential for unlimited overtime as well). Workplace culture was friendly and I never had any problems with any of the management or other co-workers. The hardest part of the job for me was that some customers could be hard to deal with, but once you get over being new and get used to the system it becomes much easier."
good,"You have the ability to pick your schedule however it is based on your performance (like at any other job), if you are meeting your goals you are more than likely to get what you asked for. The pay in my opinion was perfect for the amount of work I was doing."
good,Dish network is an excellent company to work for. They treat their employees well and if you take care of them and do what they ask for they will take care of you in return. Exciting work to do and such great guys to work for.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"I liked working there talking to people, planning the structure of my plans to complete the job. The only thing I didn't like was LADDERS. Otherwise it's a heck of a good company with benefits!"
good,Great place to work! I loved the advancement opportunities as well as the laid back work atmosphere. if it wasn't for moving I would probably still be working there.
good,"I really hate that I had to leave the way I did. Was forced into a position that was not what I applied for and therefore had to leave, otherwise I would have failed."
good,"came in as a fresh gradate with very little tech skills. Dish provided me with the training to use most tools and install smart home items. Being a technician for dish is dope, you work independently, sell some stuff, meet new customer, and control how you work. However sometimes it may be overwhelming with everything you may be tasked to do because you will be doing more than just installing dishes."
good,"I have worked at Dish for over a year. The new comp plan is something that was needed. Turn over was high, but that has reduced. I take anywhere from 10-25 calls in a 10 hour work day. I am set to pace over $80,000 this year and only work 4 days a week and the best are set to hit 6 figures. Dish offers a lot of perks, like stock options, about 15 days PTO through the year, a amazing overtime payment plan($21-$50/hr) based on commission, a great company match for your 401k, free food throughout the month, a entertainment area with pool table and ping pong, and discounts on services. The downside of Dish depends who your team lead is, not all are treated by their management fairly. This causes more stress on the calls from your lead  on top of the stress that’s all ready there. If you join Dish, ask about your lead first, this will help you in your future there and you can change before training is over. With benifits, the health insurance is horrible, the vision is decent, and dental is good. Overall Dish is a great company, stay away from negativity and stick to the process and you will be successful."
good,"It was a nice and laid back work environment, room for advancement within your own personal life, but as far as advancing within the business was not possible short-term. Overall, I would still recommend it for people that want to just relax, but still be motivated enough to do your job  and give 110%.  It’s your paycheck and your opportunity! Question is, are you motivated enough?!"
good,It was a great place to work had a very positive environment  And the hire from within. Maybe opportunities were available for people that want to advance.
good,en este empleo aprendí a valorar el trabajo de las personas bajo mi cargo ya que se laboraba bajo clima muy caluroso.
good,"A good place to work because of the people and the organization of the company. The management is changing, so the future of Dish is not clear. There are few opportunities to grow, but it is possible."
good,"Overall not bad, but it is a very stressful job to say the least. If you are ok with being at a desk for the entire day and taking back to back calls, it may be for you."
good,I worked here for too short a time. I enjoyed being able to travel all over for work. I advanced quickly in the company due to my skills and drive. I would work for this company again.
good,"Tiene horarios de tiempo completo y de medio tiempo, es bueno el suelto que ofrecen de acuerdo a las horas que se laboren transporte gratuito y capacitación constante."
good,Good place to work would have never left if it wasnt for me missing so many days.The management was awesome and the coaching staff was really helpful as well.
good,If you plan on staying as a install technician you will see raises and you can live a comfortable life. There was a strong focus on sales and if you are running in a low income area it can be hard to compete.
good,"Everyone believes in what we are doing, and proud to stand behind such a successful product  and interesting project. There are a lot of beautiful girls in the office. You really feel excited to get out of bed every morning and come to work!"
good,"Overall I loved working for Dish. I would work there again and I would definitely recommend my friends and family as well. Great benefits and a great atmosphere. They have a relaxation room , employee lobby with a pool table , air hockey , ps4 , and Xbox one. They also have a break room with arcade style games. The pay is good, and the room for opportunity is amazing. But they do have shift bids."
good,"This is the place to go make money. "
good,"Co-workers were great, very supportive work place to expand on current role to endless possibilities. Great work life balance, never took work home with me."
good,Very competitive and constant schedule changes make it difficult for your personal life. Goals are constantly changing. You have to be able to adapt to change quickly.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"If you can’t handle confrontation with people its not the job for you. You have to understand people and be able to communicate with people. The advantages for working for Dish are great. Great benefits and also rewards for making sales. If you put in good work, you are most definitely rewarded. The only negative thing I have to say is they are definitely not flexible with schedules, and promise they are after you’re there for a certain period of time. Also anything there can also change at any moment as far as procedures and goals go."
good,"Not a bad job if you are in decent shape, problem solver, and can handle working in heat and cold. Typically work 4 10-12hr days with 3 days off.  Be ready to sell, sell, sell...."
good,Don’t let it overwhelm you so many people walk in with no experience in call center jobs. Just know they will train you and help you for a few weeks by the time that’s all done you will be set.
good,"Es una empresa con muchos retos al pertenecer al giro de la tecnología, se encuentra en constante cambio y eso representa para los empleados mejorar dia a dia."
good,Great place to work. My first job doing sales in a Call center environment. The work culture is great as your work independently however each rep is assigned to a team and your productivity affects the team overall. The most enjoyable part of the job was when contest were being held for sales competition. The prizes were amazing.
good,"If you are not self motivated individual this isn't the job for you. You out in the field by yourself and tackling day to day problems on how to I stall cable, dealing with customers traffic etc. Once you get the hang of everything its pretty much smooth sailing from there. Only a lazy individual will find it hard to work here. Just pay attention and do you best everything else will fall into place"
good,"Working with Dish Network was very Good for me"
good,"Work day was great people there some were good to work with, i have learn to multitask and work in a fast environment. Management was great always willing to help when having a question. Hardest part of the job is keeping clam and knowing how to DE-escalate the call, find a solution for the customer. Enjoyed that there where always ways to win prizes."
good,"In dishtv , There is work Life balance and each individual alligned to there roles and respnsibilities."
good,El área de ventas de publicidad tiene la ventaja que esta en constante capacitación para desarrollo de la gente.
good,"Gives complete freedom to employees to achieve their goals."
good,"The management made it a lot better. They took our feelings into consideration and had the right type of leadership, for me at least. Great place to start a career."
good,DISH was actually a great job to have if you love doing physical activity. I was able to have 3 days off and 4 days on. The technicians I worked with were a great group of people as well as management.
good,"DISH is an awesome company with good benefits, free tv service and pays really well for what your job consists of. There is opportunity for advancement however it's really hard to move up in my experience even with having great stats. Most managers there were friendly and genuinely care about your progress. Annual performance appraisals and raises."
good,"Dish Network is an amazing company to work for. The benefits are incredible, the management and support staff is wonderful and supportive, but the only aspect of the job I personally don't enjoy is the call center aspect of the job. As a front line agent, you're expected to sit, on average, for about two hours at a time, taking back-to-back calls about billing related inquiries, and technical support. Doesn't seem like that bad of a position, but those are two-hour chunks of sitting and listening to unreasonable, screaming customers demanding you make changes to their account that you're not given the ability to do, requiring you to transfer to loyalty or a supervisor, ultimately affecting your overall metrics. Great job, would recommend to anyone, but I personally don't enjoy the aspect of taking back-to-back calls from unreasonable customers for hours on end."
good,En la empresa se recibe el apoyo del supervisor para resolver algunos conflictos con los clientes haci como también otorga la promoción para crecer laboral mente también otorgan prestaciones como caja y fondo de ahorro y préstamos personales de la misma caja de ahorro
good,"Overall, I like working here, but they do not work with you if you have family commitments.  The pay is competitive, benefits is good but deductible isn't competitive, extremely high."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo,capacitación constante."
good,good job to have. they take excellent care of their employees during training and pay very well with good benefits. nice being able to have your own work vehicle at your house
good,Dish is a great place if you work in the right department and team. The finance team has great leadership and makes it a point to advance their members. I had managers who were invested in my advancement and interests within the company.
good,es una empresa con un muy buen ambiente de trabajo lo cual ayuda a controlar la presión laboral.
good,Very fast paced and major attention to detail. I was in charge of 3RD SHIFT as Quality assurance inspector. My job was to insure that production did not damage any components and all product was 100% acceptable to ship.
good,good paying job with good benefits but very slow process of moving up withing the company and low starting pay wage. good atmosphere to work in.
good,"building customer relations and installations"
good,los compañeros que me tocaron y los jefes fueron muy buenas personas es por eso que me vuelvo a postular me agrado el ambiente

good,It was always great going into work. It was a very upbeat environment and my co workers were amazing people. There was definitely room to grow in the company. Everyone there was willing to help you learn and progress in your career with the company.
good,"Esta empresa me dio la oportunidad de el primer empleo, mi estancia fue placentera, los supervisores normalmente eran muy amables y si podían te resolvían dudas."
good,sometimes it can be hard to get on a personal level with employees in such a big company but I truly appreciate the effort and constant change for the betterment as an employee.
good,"Dish was a fun environment to work with easy career advancements."
good,Nice environment to be in with good structure. i worked a 5 day work week with great co-workers. Leaned how to be a leader of young men and also coach train and develop out talent.
good,Good place to work if you are self motivated and like going to different locations and meeting new people every day. Job is demanding because of the long hours and you have to work in severe weather conditions.
good,"high call volume, excellent training, team atmosphere. success comes from adaptability and knowledge of products and the ability to communicate."
good,"Loved this job alot. Get to meet new people everyday. Tools, van, phone are all provided to get the job done. Learned a great deal about installing satellite and how it works. hardest part of the job was long hours and time away from family. Most enjoyable part was seeing different people everyday and knowing that you made their day better"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,llegar ala oficina recibir cartera recibir indicaciones aprender mas sobre como llevar una buena cobranza de los cursos que impartieron muy accesibles la direccion y gerencia compañerismo muy poco difícil encontrar las direcciones de los domicilios lo mas agradable los cursos impartidos
good,first company to enter DTH industry in India. An absolutely new concept in entertainment and so was the learning. training regularly and then to the customer explaining the difference & advantages of DTH to a pure cable TV was fascinating. Despite being a large organization the employees were well knit with everyone understanding their role and this made working fun in the organization.
good,"La parte que mas me gusto fue que conocí a mucha gente excepcional, de la cual aprendí tantas cosas y dejaron huella en mi, sin ellos no hubiera llegado a ser ni la mida de bueno que soy. y mis amistades como en el trabajo las conservo hasta el final."
good,"This job is unlike your typical call center atmosphere. Your day consists of managing your incoming calls the way that works best for you. You can answer a large quantity of calls to achieve more sales, or perform with higher quality per call, answering less, but being compensated for a higher closing rate. Every sales factor or skill for that matter is assessed, and you are rewarded for your extra effort."
good,Worked at dish for almost four years. I did everything from  Q/A to just being one of the front line agents. good pay for awhile untill they cut out the gold silver and Plat ranks. Plat got you and extra 800.00 a month witch was really nice!
good,"I enjoyed working as a satellite installer, the hours I worked in only four days a week, I could manage to attend college full time, for the days I worked, I had to be up by 7AM at the latest to be at my first assigned job around 8. One of the most amazing things about being a tech, is getting to know people from all over the world and from all standards of life, I worked in Bel Air and Beverly Hills, and I worked in Compton and Perris. Throughout my 6 years experience and with a minimum of 4 jobs a day, I can say that I've seen it all. My work schedule was changing every quarter to fit my school schedule, I'm still friends with my bosses and my coworkers, some who trained me and others whom I trained. I was popular tech because I got along with everyone, also the fact that I spoke 3 languages made it even easier to approach newbies. The job gave me great social experience ,however, it was one of the most dangerous jobs you'll ever see. I had to get the satellite installation done no matter what the weather was, from a wet slippery roof on a rainy day, to a strong ladder moving wind, to a steaming 120F attics in Palm Springs summer, but all i can say about that is ""it only makes you stronger."""
good,"llegar un buenos dias para todos, hecharno animos, juntarnos estudiar alugun terreno para vender salir en equipo y limpiar la zona, ver quien vendio y apoyar al que ande bajo."

good,la atencion al cliente andar de un domicilio a otro tratar con las personas
good,"me gustaba levantarme y saber que con mi trabajo podía hacer felices a algunas familias aunque fuese por un momento. un día normal me gustaba llegar siempre primero al trabajo relajear un poco con mis compañeros de almacén mientras me entregaban mi material revisar el trabajo que tenia asignado y esperar a mi jefe para poder salir a campo a realizar lo que mas me gusta el trato con el cliente y satisfacer totalmente con la calidad de mi servicio que ofrecía, me gustaban las instalaciones difíciles que casi nadie quería hacer  porque eso me hacia sentir mejor, aveces lo que no me gustaba es cuando no había lugar muy adecuado para colocar mi escalera de 7.3 mts. aveces sentía mi edito pero era parte de mi trabajo y lo hacia y lo que si me mataba de sentimiento porque cuando llegabas a un domicilio humilde y veían el carro de dish los niños se ponían felices y brincaban de alegría que les iba a poner sus caricaturas. esas sonrisas pagaban todo el esfuerzo,el cansancio, el asolearse y la sed. es maravilloso mi mejor experiencia en la vida, de mi parte operativa y administrativa siempre medecian cuando llegamos ya no estas y cuando llegas ya casi obscurece y casi  nos vamos nosotros y comentaban que no tienes familia y les conteste si mi familia es dish. y mis hijos me esperan."
good,A typical day is all about customer service and managing a grid for productivity.  I have learned a great deal about budget and customer service since being employed with Dish.  I have always placed my employees first and treat them as my customer just as I did during my military life.  Happy employees will produce motivation and productivity for you.
good,"es buena empresa hay respeto entre los empleados, trabajar en grupo"
good,Definitely a solid job. Always room to advance your position as well as great incentives
good,The job pays well. Pays to train you. They take pride in the product
good,"un dia típico es revisar el vehiculo antes de salir a campo y platicar un poco de las estrategias del dia para cobrar y aprender a entrar a todas la colonias de Morelia gracias a especificaciones mapas y menciones de los compañeros de trabajo también a usar una maquina con la que se le hacen los cobros al clinte se selecciona y sele da recibo asi mismo como regresar su señal de cable y en la parte de dirección poes tener platicas construtivas con el supervisor i platicas de superación personal con los compañeros tratar de ver las estrategias de cada quien para asi trabajar un poco mejor en base a esos tips lo mas difícil es lograr que el cliente acceda a realizar el pago poes muchas veces eran agresivos y teníamos que saber manejar la situación lo que mas me gusto el ambiente laboral horarios de trabajo sueldo, prestaciones, y los cursos impartidos semanalmente"
good,"I work hard & am a dependable person, work well with others & a team player. I enjoy being able to help people out where ever it may lye. Enjoy being around people."

good,"bueno, dentro de lo que cabe, en cuanto a salarios y comodidades."
good,"job included handling customer complaints and providing customer care. team oriented job working closely with management. constant opportunity for overtime , great incentives based on performance."
good,"When first working for dish advancement is adored, however the unnecessary test could cause some frustration. Changes are always normal in any type of call center environment. I would say the changes occur ever 6 months to a year there would be a change of some type. Some managers are down to earth and are willing to help, but some are sort of clueless of policies."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Volume sales performed and cold sales requires. Weekly meeting with sales staff, identify potential customers and new potential markets."
good,every part of the day was good. Really had no problem with the company just had a new career
good,I have been working with DISH Network for a while now. From day one it has been a learning experience and the team I work with has been helpful and has made me feel very welcome. Everyday there seems to be something new and I can't wait to see what happens next.
good,"The place is a good place to work if you don't mind talking on the phone to people. It can be quite stressful if you don't know how to handle people, however. The first 6 weeks were really difficult with a learning curve, but after 6 months, it's not a hard job to keep up with. You have plenty of opportunities to move up, if you make yourself available, and the feedback on improving yourself as a rep is always available."
good,Dish was my first job coming out of highschool. Dish was a good job for me because they worked around my school schedule.  They also trained me well for the position i was working which made me very reliable to them.
good,With dish I learned a new set of skills and a all time high of professionalism being that I went into people’s homes to do work dish was a good place to work but it was consistent enough for me
good,Awesome job I had. Great people's. Awesome eviroment. Learn fast and great pay rates starting. Work your own schedule. Was always flexible with my schedule.help the community.
good,Dish was a great place to work. The pay was even better. With uncapped commissions the sky is the limit. Plus unlimited overtime. The staff are great. Everyone wants you to succeed. Your success is their success. I would recommend the job highly. Just learn the product and the competition and you'll do well.
good,I started as a tier 1 customer support agent but I was able to progress quickly into more advanced positions. If you work hard you can find yourself with a great job working for Dish Corporate.
good,"Fun place to work, great work culture, and there are plenty of benefits provider by the employer (Satellite TV, ping pong tables, Break room TVs with with satellite channels, etc.)"
good,"La empresa dish ha sido muy importante en mi crecimiento laboral tiene un clima laboral muy agradable, aparte que otorga grandes beneficios a través de su caja de ahorro,  prestaciones de ley y otros beneficios que satisfacen mis necesidades ."
good,I loved my management staff. The culture was upbeat and everyone helping each other. They offer a ton of incentives and the pay is very competitive. They train for advancement and career pathing.
good,"Dish is not a bad place to work at, the only downfall is the lower pay. I understand that their market share may not be as big as the other guys but, employees can’t be held liable, maybe come up with some ideas to increase pay and that will keep more employees around. Other than that great company, great moral and leaders."
good,"Although it was my first 'cable' installer job, it was a good learning experience.  I enjoyed building connections with the clients and providing a service to them."
good,It was good company ro work for. Plenty of incentives and options to compete to win great prizes. Flexible schedule options to accomindate employee needs.
good,Basic inventory work. Forklift driving. It was a small space so end of day counts were easy. Coworkers made this place a blast to work at. Compensation seemed fair considering the relatively easy work-life. I would recommend it.
good,"Good work environment, excellent training, daily team meetings about updates and success. Descent pay, schedules are fixed but there are shift bids about 2x/year. Management expects a lot of you but most are wanting you to succeed."
good,Stressful but company does a great job with keeping the environment fun and worth it. Lots of room for advancement plus great incentives and benefits.
good,7 años laboré en la empresa que me permitió alcanzar mis objetivos y desarrollarme profesionalmente siempre en un ambiente integro.

good,"During my time at Dish Network I learned a great deal about technology and what it had to offer, along with teamwork and just a really good universal environment to thrive in. Every day is a different task and new adventure."
good,"Dish Network was a great company to work for, ignoring the obvious downsides of working Over the Phone Customer Service. They provided a fun, laid back environment with a strong support structure to ensure that their employees are happy."
good,"It was an overall good experience, their training classes are hands on and fun! the work enviornment is laid back and they have a pool table in the break room."
good,"Dish provides a great opportunity for advancement. Everyone in management started at the bottom. Team environment especially in the sales and retention departments, which focuses on competitive drive."
good,"You were required to sell products to customers. If you didn't sell the products, you would be at risk of losing your job. Dealing with customers is not that bad, but you do have to get into tight attics and in summer time it gets really hot inside the attics. The management is good though, they were pretty helpful and understanding. Training is really great, they fly you to the nearest training facility and they feed you 3 times a day for an entire week. They pay you hourly while training as well."
good,i loved working here and was promoted however the job was in Alvin tx which was quite a ways from Houston I got a closer position to my home was the only reason i left
good,Sin agregados. Consideró que la empresa en el area9 que me desempeñe cumple.
good,Ability to work alone and finish jobs at your own pace. You will only have about 4 jobs a day on average. Dish provide you with all your equipment and safety equipment and tools to keep you as comfortable as possible during the extreme heat.
good,"Great place to work! very nice management. Unfortunately, they closed our site down and I was laid off. All of the people that worked with there were pretty friendly"
good,"The managers have been nothing short of fantastic. Training could be longer and more in depth but otherwise amply provides the recruit with the basics necessary for the job. The only complaint would be base salary; however, DISH does provide quick steps up the ladder and uncapped annual performance raises, as well as a commission-style per-check bonus."
good,"Dish is a special place. During my time there I learned more about  customer service than any job I have ever had. Dish is a team environment and strides to ensure the growth of their employees. I have never felt more appreciated. Should you get this job opportunity don't squander it, this was my favorite job."
good,"This was a career I would've stayed with till retirement, fast paced environment, hard work and a great amount of self motivation, the company went under and unfortunately had to move on."
good,The work was fast paced and ever changing. The job had potential to be stressful and there is a big sales requirement. There is a lot of overtime but in my office we only worked 4 days a week so the work life balance was good.
good,"Dish set out out to be a great company to work for and worked hard to take care of their people. It is a challenging environment, but with focus and drive you can easily be successful."
good,fast paced and stressful but there is always support and on some days there are fun activities. Long hours but you get three days off per week instead of two.
good,"Great place to work, check it out. "

good,"A typical day working for Dish Network would involve lots of driving, lifting, and interacting with customers. What I've learned working for this company would be you could never know everything about working a job, every day I would learn something new even at the end of my employment working there. Management was really great, my GM believed that a good company would not be fully functional if its all about business so he gets to know every single one of the employees personally and if there ever was a problem he was very understanding in my making allowing the employee not to even consider leaving. the hardest part of the job would be the hot days and not knowing when your going to get off and relax. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the four day work weeks and after finishing a days work, the sense of accomplishment knowing you can do this kind of work."
good,very challenging my advice to anyone is come in and be honest with yourself dont look for anything but an honest day work keep a good attitude. if you are experienced keep it to yourself co-workers are very cool meet all the matrix as best as you can

good,"A typical day would consist of a team meeting, then getting on the phones for a set period of time taking customer service calls. Then there would be multiple breaks throughout the day with a lunch of a period of time related to your shift length. I learned the ins and out of the Dish products and services to better convey this to the customers calling into the call center. The management was very hands on yet very allowing of independent work for the employees to flourish. They also provided many chances for furthering of the education for the employees so that advancement was a definite possibility. The hardest part of the job was when there was a problem, that we as a first line customer service representative, were unable to fix so we had to transfer the call to another department. The most enjoyable part of this job was the entertainment facilities at the location with tv's, pool tables, internet cafe, hot food preparations for meals, etc.; also the incentive programs which if made allowed the employees to take part in item giveaways, trips, paid time off, etc."
good,it's was fun knocking doors and talking to and meet new people and learning things about your costomers....

good,"It is a fun place to work, the people there are very nice and friendly. Most customers are very happy with their service, You do get some calls that you want to just walk out the door, However, you must take those calls as just one call. They do force you to sale, sometimes it is unconformable, but its fun to upsell to some customers and it just takes the right pitch to get them."

good,buena opcion para laboral en el area administrativa
good,The schedule was a bit much (10 hour days of back to back calls) they could have given you a 30 second breather between calls but it was always back to back and became too much mental stress when you’re there for 11 hour days. The benefits and pay were decent tho and management was relaxed.

good,"DISH is a great place to work. Management tries to make going to work fun and the Sponsors would come by almost biweekly to give out prizes while pushing you to make upsells. The team enviroment is what I liked the most, if you get a great team, it can feel like a family."
good,"Working for Dish Network is a great experience overall. Even if you have previously worked in the customer service field, business processes are changing constantly to the point where there is always something new to learn. Initial training is very in depth and the training staff make sure that you are comfortable as you transition between skills. The customer base is very demanding and will keep you on your toes while taking calls that range from simple billing issues, tech support, and retention accounts."
good,Employees are wonderful. Environment has a friendly and welcoming feeling. Learned numerous skills of customer service/tech.
good,Good place to grow professionally and get experience. Leadership staff cares about their employees and attempt to allow a work life balance. Call center environment.

I learned the difference between satellite television, and cable television service. My co-workers all had interesting personalities with competitive spirits. The hardest part of the job was hearing so many rejections, while still maintaining a positive attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new techniques on how to sell a service."

I learned a lot and excelled at my position.  I learned dealing with angry customers in a reasonable fashion."
good,"Best Co-workers -Smart - all rounded"
good,"The usual restocking day requires technicians to drive company vehicles to our local Dish Warehouse and to meet our mangers and techs for weekly announcements, rewards. New equipment and new electronics and cables etc., are then distributed to technicians for selling to our future customers. The management is well ran by our FSM's (Field specialist Manager) that keep their technicians up to date with jobs, safety and new things being offered to us as techs. The co-workers are great to work with making the environment and experience working with them better. We work by ourselves at local homes in our work area but also communicate with each other using company phones, and ipads so everyone knows if someone or something is needed at a customers home. The hardest part of the job are probably the bigger installs. They take a bit of more time for technicians to finish on. My most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet new people and see the smiles on their face when your job is finished in a timely manner while having great customer service and communicative skills."

The workplace culture is very laid back and casual. The hardest part of the job was to guide customers that weren't as technically savvy resolve their issues over the telephone. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work culture as well as when adding a new feature or product to a clients account due to the commission structure."

good,"Answer a heavy call volume on a daily basis. I gain a lot of experience in which I didn't have prior to working there also I had a very well put together team of managers who were always very helpful.

good,"This job was absolutely amazing! Wonderful place to work! Awesome benefits, and compensation!"
good,"(muy bajo salario base lo malo es que todas las prestaciones las calcula la empresa con este pero las deducciones con todo y las comiciones),  lo bueno en el tiempo aquel que yo labore en tal empresa muy buenas comiciones con tales me reponia., lo malo te hacian madrugar a veces a horas disparatadas o tras nochar a horas disparatadas en las que los clientes te atendian muy pero muy molestos, mi jefe no sabia nada no tenia experiancia laboral con manejo de personal y simpre se le fueron las cuatro con un servidor por su falta de experiencia y talento nato como jefe. nunca necesite de su cocheo, siempre mi tendencia es fue y sera a la exelencia siempre sobresaliente a rank 1 plus."
good,Work 4 days a week and 3 days off you really can't ask for a better shift than that in the cable industry.
good," If I needed a day off it would have to be approved by the managers bosses. that wasn't the problem really it was mostly that they had the idea that if one person failed to obey then everyone had to pay for it. so with that managers had about 20 persons to take care and they knew their workers yet their bosses did not know the other co-workers, yet they decided for managers."
good,"Te dejan salir más tarde del horario contratado, cuando no le caes bien a los coordinadores te dejan solo en lugares peligroso"
good,it was ok in the first  but company started demanding to much not pertaining to subcontractors  and taking money . I liked interacting with customers.  installs were pretty easy usually  Trouble calls could be troublesome sometimes  going to the warehouse for equipment could be a bit troublesome because didn't know whether you would get enough equipment or not
good,This a fast paced work all day long.  I learned a lot about managing and the importance of positive interaction between managers and field techs working together towards the goals of the company.  My coo workers where very nice and from different places of the world. The hardest part of the job was to work long hours away from the family and the must enjoyable part of the job was lunch time!
good,There are major pros and cons. Deeply discounted cable is a pro plus their points for free stuff is a huge one. I really enjoyed working here. Management isn't bad but wasn't great. Their health vision and dental suck.
good,"Personally I loved working for DISH, taking calls were pleasant for me most times, my issue would be with some of the inner workings of the particular call center I was working at."

good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.

good,I really enjoyed the Work at home option. This is really the only reason I left my prior job as child care is costly and this allowed me to be at home when my kids needed me to be. However the split shifts and changing schedules made it hard for me to leave my home.
good,"Es una empresa dedicada a servir a diferentes clientes,"
good,terrible if you have a family. hours vary way too much and are based on your  metrics so if you take pto(PAID TIME OFF) it makes you have bad metrics. the pay is great cannot complain

good,"Enjoyed the ability to use technical skills i.e. problem solving, math background and learning about new products."
good,Dish Network pays better than most companies in this area if you are willing to put up with your schedule changing a couple of times a year. Sometimes you get stuck whith supervisors who don't care so you are pretty much left to your own resources but every now and then you get someone who is there to help you become a better agent. Dish employs many people so you get to meet people from everywhere but sometimes you do feel like sheep being herded through the fences. If you can handle that believe me you will have a great career this company is here to stay and will only get bigger. Great perk is you get free programing on some of their packages. Yeah this company has amazing technology and programing after resigning I still stayed on as a customer and don't plan on that changing any time soon.
good,"Don't believe the new stories that appear rom time to time placing DISH as one of the worst companies in the country to work for. It actually is a good place to work. "
good,A good work environment. Required sales. Monthly stat goals and minimum requirements. A lot of overtime and plenty of opportunity to promote. Good job if you can keep your stats up.
good,"Dish can definitely be a fun place to work, the hours are no good unless you are a super high performer in your calls. Even if you do good on your calls it isn't certain that you will get a good schedule. "
good,Trabajo del 200% .Bueno. Pero inestable.sin seguro

good,great place to work. very busy environment and requires a lot of initiative and entrepreneurial spirit.
good,Dish is a good temporary company to work for. They do not guarentee job security or advancement. It would be a perfect 2nd job or one for a college or high school student
good,Friendly management and technicians to work with. The overall work environment was remote. Working from home with some leisure time made for an easy day that didn't feel too long.
good,"Upbeat environment, great technology, great people. Sales department allows flexibility of schedule and accomodates changes where necessary. Sales targets are a challenge to achieve."

I enjoyed interacting with new people on a day to day basis and setting them up with Quality TV for a reasonable price."
good,"All that is required is daily attendance, log in, take calls, log out at the end of the day. Hardest part would be stressful customers, enjoyable would be incentives pay outs."
good,"It was an ok place to work with ok benefits but the GM was a bit of a knob, thats why Im not there today. Too many late nights."
good,"Good Company! Excelent management and enviroment! The hardest part of the job? Nothing because every day we need learn something, the most enjoyable part of the job was help every customer!"

good,"I loved working at Dish. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. They let us work on our own, but we were closely monitored to ensure that we were doing our job correctly."
good,The job was fullfilling just looking to advance in other areas. It is a challenging environment that i appreaciate to the upmost.
good,"•	Maintained accurate inventory and equipment for installations, service calls, or trouble tickets"
good,"Working for Dish wasn't too bad. The pay was pretty decent for a full time job. However, management wasn't always on top of things."
good,An all around great environment to work and grow and a person both mentally and socially.  Management and other aspects of being employed at Dish are at a bar set real high.  Would recommend Dish to anyone looking for a meaningful employment.
good,"I love to work and be around others, I'm also adaptable to almost all situations. If former co-worker and managers had to describe I believe it be as follows; dependable, hard-working, personable, and patient."

good,"Los dias de trabajo comensaban a las 9:00 de la mañana, hasta 7 u 8 de la noche, aprendi a ser tolerante, mis colegas siempre mostraron ayuda con todos los del grupo, la parte mas dificil del trabajo era encontrar a las personas en sus domicilios y enfrentarnos a personas que en ocasiones tenian caracter dificil, lo que mas me gusto del trabajo la convivencia"
good,Great job just hours kept changing learned more about cable and prices and packages
good,a typical day at dish was always enjoyable. I learned how to improve my salemanship skills. i always felt that the managment team was interested in my well being as well as helping me reach my professional goals.; the hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere of the workplace.
good,Well organized warehouse work made easy. I learned everything there is to know about warehouse work. Everyone made sure I got a hang of things quickly.

good,I loved this job. I learned so much that i can use in everyday life
good,I only had to be at the office one day a week I had a team of salesman we would travel around Texas. I learned people skills what to say what not to say. The most enjoyable part about this job was the traveling.
good,i loved working for this company. I was in the customer service department. I took incoming calling from customer with an account or customer that were looking to set up an account. There were days when I receivedsome pretty diffcult customer calls but the feeling you get from being able to turn those unhappy customer into happy custmers was awesome. My co-workers were great and very friendly.
good,Meet many diffrerent people. Great place to work. Enjoyed going to work everyday.
good,loved this job i was a subcontractor the only reason i stopped is because they started paying less for work done and giving you more to do
good,El horario q se maneja es muy accesible d 7am-2pm pero en ese lapso de tiempo no se cuenta mas que con 10 mins de tiempo personal en caso de tener necesidad de estar en el w.C. O realizar alguna otra actividad personal
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Es dinamico trabajar en esta empresa, ya que el compañerismo es muy bueno."
good,"• Strong working experience in building the components using Core Java Servlets, JSP, Spring, Struts and its similar framework like PS Framework, EJB 2.0, EJB 3.0, Web Services (JAX-WS), JDBC ORM models like Hibernate"
good,"Great learning exp...Hardest part of the job is keeping up with conflicting demands of superiors. Moral is tested on a constant basis with ""pep-talks."
good,"Management and work atmosphere was amazing. I dealt with customer service on a daily basis. I also handled extreme heat and weather conditions, heights, and wild animals. Was a fantastic learning experience."
good,"Dish was ok, very competitive sales position but you can make a lot of money in commission.  You are literally on the phone for 10 hours a day.  I loved the training class and the people I worked with"
good,Es una empresa agradable para trabajar con muchas facilidades para poder realizar tu trabajo
good,"Enjoyed working here but due to the swing shifts I feel it works best for younger people.  They offered a work out facility onsite, cafeteria area, games to play on breaks and tv to watch during breaks."
good,"Competitive hourly and overtime pay plus paid training, vans, tools and uniforms"
good,"Ver tu ruta de trabajo planeada ya planeada  a principio"
good,"Se tiene un buen compañerismo como ambiente labora, continua capacitación y desarrollo de habilidades para el trabajo"
good,"•	Customer service"
good,Great company for a new job or entry level. Was able to maintain the level of growth I needed to be in business management and were very big on my future and what my goals where in the professional field.
good,"I liked the pay until the pay structure was changed, it was a stressful place to work but you had to make sure you did not let it get to you. The management was great and so are the co workers."
good,The Job isn't that hard to do and it was very easy to learn but management experienced to much change too quickly and feels out of place.
good,"Fun place to work but the pay is low and the location is far from Houston. It's in Alvin, TX. But Dish made it fun to work there."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"This is a great job and I love the people and the work, but being a remote technician in an area like mine makes it hard for advancement opportunities."
good,The diversity is great with all walks of life employed.  Dish really stresses working all the calls you recieve and exploring all options to sign customers up.  All customers must credit qualify or they will have to buy the equipment or a have a bigger deposit to acquire service. If they don't have a credit card or debit card they want you to ask them if the have any other friends or family that would be a joint account holder so that they can get service.  The only thing I didn't like is that you would have to work 50 plus hours per week to reach the highest percentage of payout on your commission.  The best part of the job was talking to people all over the US your calls could range from 8 minutes and up depending on length of discussion.  I would go back if you didn't have to work 50 plus hours to make the highest commission.  If they changed in to 40 I feel their turn over ratio would be less.
good,Good place to work but high turn over rate. not much advancement.
good,"Providing excellent customer service, and making sure you give out clear information. there really was nothing hard about his job, my co-workers we all got along enjoyed everyone company, I was always ready to come in and do my job. the most enjoyable part of my job were my friends and managers, everyone enjoyed their job."
good,"The best part of my day was knowing that i was able to put a smile on the customers face. I enjoyed being the one to adjust any problems that may have been having with their accounts, being able to set up new accounts for customers so that they could also enjoy the services that Dish Network offered."
good,Supervisors were always around when needing assistance. There were always incentives for simply doing your job and plenty more incentives for going above and beyond. Great atmosphere. 
good,I would refer my friends to this company. The owners help train employees on there jobs and promote the employees pay in respect to cost of living. They do require that the employee provides there own tools and a means of transportation.
good,"Work life balance could be a bit on the edge as it is  a 24/7 * 365 running round the clock operation.salary is handsomely paid to deserving candidates.overall,a good company to work"
good,"It was a new and innovative company to work for coming from a sales back ground. It was commission based, so there was no cap limit or floor for your performance, purely satisfaction l based."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo,  me permitió seguir con mis estudios."
good,"The pay was great, coworkers were nice, managers were on top it! I appreciated the team meetings as well. But I hated only standing in one position for 8-9 hours, unable to move around."
good,"Great place to work, warm friendly people, a bit stressful but everybody works together to get things done. Some of the management can be pressured to make some tough decisions for the sake of the company but over all a great working experience"
good,"a typical day at work was morning huddle to discuss better ways to improve your day to day duties and talk about the new smart home products available. learned how to interact and take care of the needs of dish customers, how to take your time and be safe on the job. hardest part of the job for me was sales. I'm not a very good salesman but do my best, and took pride in my work. best part was meeting new and different people, being my own boss to a certain extent.  the pay was nice also."
good,"great money, awful managment, great benefitts, been working here since april and ever since then its been hard because they forced me to go to a department i didnt want to be in"
good,Arrive at work pick up equipment for jobs you are to respond to that day. I learned to work with tv/cable troubleshooting and to  interact with customers to help them understand the new equipment.
good,"Buena empresa, otorga prestaciones de Ley y superiores, beneficios a sus colaboradores en diferentes lugares como descuentos, lo malo es que a los trabajadores no nos hacen ningún descuento en el servicio de Dish."
good,Nice environment to be part of. Employees worked well with one another. The management and team leads should take leadership classes in order to guide team members to be and get better rather than tear apart.
good,Working for Dish Network is great! There are many opportunities for advancement as long as the employee demonstrates a willingness to learn. The pay is good and getting time off to mange your work life balance is easy!
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Aprendí a laborar en campo me gusto mucho el trato directo con los clientes los horarios eran flexibles y sobre todo un excelente ambiente de trabajo se puede ganar muy bien
good,"Fue muy interesante laborar en dish aprendí muchas cosas, las personas son buenos colegas, la parte mas difícil de mi trabajo fue que hubo cosas que no se cumplían por parte de la empresa o de mi jefe directo. me gusto la forma de trabajar solo que el pago era muy poco y las actividades realizadas era bastantes."
good,Es bueno el ambiente y el trabajo te desempeñas en tus metas el trabajo constaba de llamar al clinte para recordarle su pago para que no se cobraran recargos. Tambien se le daba solucion a fallas tecnicas se asesoraba en su servicio. Se ofrecian paquetes a bajos costos promosiones y ventas de canales nuevos e interesantes.
good,this was a good place to work they are very good with their employees and they do treat you far. be careful and not to over load yourself
good,"I enjoyed the work that I did as well the people that I was surrounded by, all though the work to life balance it not what I liked or expect from a company I work with."
good,"Nice feeling in this job. sales can earn more than more income."
good,Really fun place to work really enjoy who I work with and management does strive to make the job fun with prizes and competitions.
good,"I gain a lot of experience with them. I work on a call center and I know now how to manage better with the customer. Management was pretty good, treat the employes really fair. The hardest part of the job was every time a mad customer call, most enjoyable part of the job every time you give good customer service and at the end the customer thanks you for it."
good,"I was nervous about what working at DISH would be like due to the negative reviews.  However, I can honestly say it has been a great job.  Though working in a call center can be stressful, I always enjoy the people I work with and the atmosphere.  I have learned many skills that will benefit me in the future.  As with any job there are some negatives, but your career at DISH is what you make of it.  I am grateful for my job here.  If you want to move into other positions, my advice is to make sure you show up on time and don't call in sick.  They base any advancement on attendance first when being considered for a position."
good,"Dish Network is an awesome place to work.  The only thing was the manager had no idea of the company itself, he was appointed manager just because he had managerial background skills."
good,"Great staff"
good,Ask not what your company can do for you but what you can do for your company.
good,I am very happy to work in this company.
good,"Great company. Great benefits and pay. Flexible hours and OT welcome. However, team leads are of little help. They are not paid fairly so they give up easily. Their pay is based on their team's success. So if your team lead feels that you are holding them back they will alienate you in an effort to get you to switch teams."
good,Management seems to strive to get you a better work/life balance when they can. Very busy at times and can end up working long shifts.  Sales are a big part of employment now.
good,"Buena empresa al principio"
good,"Is a job the required lot of pacience with customers, you will work under all weather conditions, your typical work day starts at 7am but you don't know when you are going to finish"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,I have nothing negative to say about working at Dish.  The main reason I left was because the pay was not comparable to other large companies.  Manger as very nice and accommodating and I hope he has since been promoted.
good,"Great place to work, very positive upbeat, only drawback was mandatory sales for smart home services. Over all loved the job, the culture and people.  YOU MUST BE CUSTOMER SERVICE ORIENTED . I would work there again!"
good,"If you’re okay with constantly having to up-sell customers over the phone and always being monitored/criticized, then it’s really not too bad of a place to work for. Your hours are good, pay is acceptable, management is good, and you have a pretty decent work-life balance. There’s definitely a lot of work place drama though and there’s a lot of stress that comes from this fast paced job."
good,Working at Dish was a great experience overall.  I had the opportunity to work with a lot of amazing people who were dedicated to achieving goals and providing a great experience to customers. I also worked under great leadership who pushed me to sharpen some of my skills and continue to grow.
good,es un trabajo sencillo con buenas ganancias y comisiones
good,productive fun and adventurous clean environment stable work. 3days off from work was great plus options to work on your days off. Options to get bonuses by upscaling your customers to add more features for their dish TV.
good,"Me gusto mucho trabajar  el ambiente es divertido relajado mucha gente muy valiosa labora ahí, solo que las mujeres en ventas no tienen muchas posibilidades de ascender"
good,"This job is also keep many more challenge and give also much rudely behaviour parsons ."
good,They believe in there workers. If you follow rules dish will make sure your in a stable work environment . They are very on top of call outs and attendance.
good,"Great place to work, easy to learn the system, work at home availability, regular coaching, positive environment, rewarded for sales, training on new equipment often."
good,Dish is a great company to work for. they offer many benefits & have a area your able to relax in on breaks. there is also a cafeteria so during bad weather you don't have to leave the site if you choose not to.
good,"Buena empresa, con buenas prestaciones,pero muy lento el crecimiento laboral, ya que en mi caso me toco trabajar con un gerente, que carecía de lo que es ser un buen lider."
good,"You get put on a regular shift, but work days may vary. Frequent opportunities for over-time and advancement. Great benefits and reward."
good,"Builds customer service skills always helping customers with technical concerns and general account information and issues. Great people to work with, some great management as well always wanting the best for you and helping with your career path."
good,"Working for DISH was a great position for me, I loved the chance for advancement and the additional commission employees were eligible for."
good,"people were positive great benefit,enjoy working they helping customer with their eta and dish network question .Great office clean office and i learn a lot from my supervisor and co worker."
good,"dominio, manejo y control de datos en excel de los servicio e instalaciones a través de cuadrillas, interpretación de estadísticas, big data"
good,Very fun work environment! Learned everything I needed to know about satellite television. Everyone is friendly. Took calls all day assisting customers with television problems or billing issues.
good,Burlington was a great place to work we had fun daily. The only downside was the pay got along with management well and they listen.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"you learn alot"
good,"answering inbound calls , and answer customer questions about billing , and tech support."
good,"The company is great, it’s the system they used to rate their techs that’s the problem. They use the same standards for techs in the city as the ones out in the rural areas. It’s a lot easy for a person to get jobs done faster and more of them in the city than someone driving threw mountain areas.  Example I had two jobs both were worth 22 points each but I had to turn them into 50 points total. To do this I had to end my 10hr day at 8 hrs. But my entire route time came out to be six hours which left me with two hrs. to do the job. Unfortunately these jobs were rated at being two and half hour jobs. Doing the math it was a losing battle. Eventually I and many other rating were low for too long so we were let go. And still to this day there are always openings at the nitro office because of the system."
good,"Great place to work, just needed to pay more and have better insurance"
good,Loved working for Dish. I wish I didn't relocate otherwise I would have stayed with them.
good,"I would love to work with this team, but the senior management is hesitant to changes."
good,They are very strict and micromanage you all the time. But at the same time is a great job just the usual call center environment nothing out of the ordinary
good,"I advanced fairly quickly but they don’t pay what employees are worth.  I felt like I was underpaid for the work that was required of me.  I still was paid okay, but not what I should have been making."
good,"I first started with dish about 6 years ago, and I didn't mind the job, management was nice, co workers were nice, but as a technician I had very little time with my family, I would barely see them"
good,Its a good place to work but it will put a beating on your body and mind. You can work at your own pace only if you like to stay out late. You can also be a remote tech if you live a certain miles away from the office.
good,Typical job for me starts at bout 7 in the morning and get off between 5 and 8. Sometimes I work later and sometimes get off sooner. I typically average about 60 hours week. I work Tuesday-Saturday so I get 2 days off a week. Job is very fun and I enjoy what I do. The customer experience is my favorite part. I’m a hands on kind of person and there’s always plenty to do.
good,"They held different activities for employees to help them boost moral. The security that we had onsite were there every second, and the entire site felt very safe. They are very weighted on production."
good,Had a blast. Worked with Amazing people  . Positive environment and room to advances .  Always trying to find a better way to doing things for customers and employees alike . Highly recommend
good,"Buen horario, aprendí muchas cosas tanto profesionales como de tecnología. una gran experiencia"
good,"Great place to work! From ownership down everyone is a true pro and great people! "
good,un dia tipico en el trabajo seria un viernes cuando sales una hora mas temprano y tienes el fin de semana libre.
good,Lots of room to advance at dish. I was there a little over 3 years. In that time I went from a level 1 tech to a level 4 tech in about 15 months but a had already 12 years experience as a satellite installer. I was asked to take a promotion to a field service manager but the pay was to low and the hours were  insane. I made a lot more as a tech and at the time raising a family management was not an option for me
good,"I have enjoyed working at Dish Network however, due to a lack of advancement opportunities in the field of study that I was able to complete, I am sorry to say that I need to look for better opportunities."
good,"Great work, great experience, great training, different jobs day in and day out. new customers to change up a work day, a lot of available  training, awesome job"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"En buena empresa en general, uniformes,calzado, equipo y sistema. Solo falta un poco de mejor trato."
good,"Expect to work long hours and holidays. Benefits are fantastic, paid training, and paid time off. Management and overall atmosphere are great. Compensation for the long hours is extensive. However, if you are not a salesman at heart, this might not be the job for you."
good,"They give you time off the phone when you need it so not to burn you out."
good,Dish tech is dish network I never worked at a dish tech however dish was great enjoyed my time there had no issue with management. I just wanted to sell rather than install.
good,"I personally enjoyed it because it was like i was my own boss.I got to follow up on sales myself, close deals, and interact with people that built my ability to communicate effectively."
good,"very good environment to learn new systems and technical skills. management and workers are very friendly, only con is they want install technicians to become salesperson."
good,"The management is very helpful & invested in your success w/ the , so long as you are equally dedicated to it. Training is very thorough & will make sure you are comfortable w/ not only the products but as well as the computer systems used."
good,"Answered customer/client requests and inquiries concerning services, products, billing, equipment, claims, and reports problem areas. Often difficult situations and repetitive calls, but management always willing to assist. Working there was like working for a family and always cheering you on. Worst part of the job was schedules. These were probably the worst balance for those with children and those physically attending college. Advancement within call center was minimal."
good,Fue una experiencia muy bonita haber trabajado en Dish porque aprendí demasiadas cosas y aspectos técnicos/ingenieriles para poder captar y bajar la señal satelital. El ambiente de trabajo era formidable puesto que existía mucha comunicación y apoyo entre los colegas.
good,es un buen lugar para trabajar si te gusta la atención al cliente y la resolución de inconvenientes de un usuario del servicio.
good,En general es una buena empresa que ayuda a los jóvenes a emprender su vida laboral
good,In 1st one and two months there is no pressure in the job but after 2month thee target is more and thr management is very irritating
good,Great company to work for.. if you know what your doing.... I really enjoyed them for 11 yrs ... it was apart of my life...  Gave me pure satisfaction  knowing i was resolving any issues our customer's  were having . ...
good,"La verdad el trabajo es bueno y hay buen ambiente, los jefes son muy buenos y hay mucha comunicación todos son muy agradables y amables"
good,Enjoyable if you are outgoing and enjoy talking people into stuff and talking to strangers about cable easy job makes abou 1-2k per week if your strong at it.
good,"muy buen ambiente de trabajo, buenas prestaciones, es complicado aguantar el clima se siente bien caliente,"
good,"Dish was good to work for until the last few years. They began eliminating Admin, jobs throughout the company. Many of these employees worked at Dish for 10 plus years. Manager I worked for was great, and my coworkers were the best! Typical day included running reports, answering emails, and calls. Booking travel for the RD and occasionally the RM's and OM's..  Most enjoyable part of the job were the people!!!"
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,Dish is a good job.  You have an opportunity to move up and do more as long as you apply yourself.  The people are great and the management if fair.  The only reason why I may have to leave Dish is because of the call center where I live is closing.  They gave me and all my other co-workers the option of relocating.  If nothing pans out I may relocate.
good,The management was great and I had alot of company paid training for the position.  The management was there for when ever you need help with a job or situation.
good,"Un día típico era llegar y abrir la oficina, atender a los clientes desde ventas hasta resolución de conflictos y quejas, trabajar en conjunto con los técnicos y el personal de ventas."
good,"I loved my job with dish.  It is fast paced and exciting.  They really care about making things better and more efficient.  The pay is good, but the benefits were not that great."
good,Por lo mismo que andaba solo  no tenia  ningun tipo de problea con nadie
good,"Dish was one of my very favorite jobs. I learned more about myself than at any other job. I had the opportunity to grow my skills which also included training others in the OJT department. I am so glad to have been a part of a growing company. It was the hardest job I ever had because of the changes that occured daily. I enjoyed the people I worked with. However, my favorite part of the job was walking the floor and knowing who I trained was still there."

good,Fast growing company with lots of jobs available. Fun work environment.
good,Great place to work. Plenty of opportunity for advancement.
good,"I started at DISH as a sales assistant, and through two promotions am now an ITV Client Services Manager. DISH is known for having a rigid culture, and that's true. However, this isn't a fault. For satellite TV, and ITV itself, there are a million moving pieces to account for. Putting together a robust interactive advertising platform is no small job. I'm exceptionally proud to be a part of DISH Media Sales, and to have been in on the ITV business from the ground floor."
good,"Very fun place to work at, but one of the busiest restaurants in Anchorage so being prepared is a one of most common tasks at the Dish as a sushi chef. There are many things to learn such as learning about new customers in many different fields, making new friends, working as a team during the stressful rush hours, and most importantly preparation."

I also assisted customers with technical support issues or sending a technician out to the customer's home if I could not resolve the issue. Dishnetwork has a very warm and cozy feeling. There was always something going on in the work place to keep the fun going.
good,muy buen ambiente laboral y con oportunidad de crecimiento
good,"Dish does provide a lot of great benefits to those who are committed and attend every minute with full effort. The compensation is nice, but the environment is worth the amount of stress."
good,It’s a great place to work and the money is amazing. There is plenty of room for growth in the company and pay increases are available. The environment is great and full of energy. I’d recommend this place to the world.
good,company working culture is good. salary and other payment timing also very good. overall its a good company to work. i suggest if any one wants to work he can without any doubt.
good,"no tuve ningún problema fuera de lo laboral con mis ex compañeros, muy buena empresa"
good,"Las comisiones no son muy altas, pero si están fáciles de alcanzar"
good,Dish tv company is not given any appraisal  last 5 year.. It's a not a onroll job..Dish tv service is worst service in india.. I am suffering too many face problem in market due to service. There is no extra facility to work for senior employer.
good,Very speedy interview process. I was asked about my work experience and it was explained to me that my lack of factory experience would not interfere with the hiring process because as long as I was willing to learn j would always have a place to work.
good,"Always had installations."
good,"I had a lot of fun working for dish, it was interesting and challenging in a way that made you improve daily. I would work for them again if I found another place structured like the Topeka office."
good,"Es un excelente lugar para trabajar, se tiene plan de vida y carrera, se transformó en OCTOPUS ahora se instala dish, telmex y venta de productos Steren."
good,"If there was a Dish call center near where I live now, I would go back in a heartbeat! They really take care of everyone that works there. And the atmosphere is great!"
good,"es una empresa donde el ambiente es agradable, ademas de que encuentras compañerismo y los coordinadores de ventas no hacen distinción en cuanto a los empleados de venta se refieren"
good,"Organisation is growing with the increase in customer demand for more and more TV entertainment ."
good,"Sería el echo de no tener un sueldo fijo , mucho menos prestaciones , siempre estar al tanto de tu harramienta y verificar que la instalación este correctamente echa"
good,"Good job for someone with customer service skills and technical experience. Supervisors are supportive, but for remote not frequent with feedback. Training is top notch"
good,This is a great company to work for. The only thing I hated was the way we was laid off. They choose to not renew the lease on the building and due to that we was either transferred out to a location several miles (200+) away or was laid off.
good,My manager is the best and is always thinking of others when it comes to making our jobs easier and less stressful. There is opportunities for growth but you have to be good at what you do
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Dish is a great place to work because it was my very first time doing this kind of work and doing it from home.  The training went fast but was thorough enough for me to understand and be able to assist customers. We were frequently encouraged to ask questions in training, during one-on-one coaching sessions and during team meetings.  Feedback from coaches is great and call are regulary monitored-this is great for Dish, you and the customer."
good,Very pleasant to work for and great opportunities. Fun work place that is very goal driven. The mor ehard Work you put in the better the rewards are given.
good,"Es una buena empresa que el tiempo que estube ahi me trataron muy bien, no puedo decir muchas cosas, solo estuve dos años en los que estuve muy agusto, solo faltaba oportunidad de crecimiento para mi area"
good,"Although I no longer work at Dish Network Call Center, it was an amazing job. MAnagers/Supervisors were right there if help was needed. They gave constructive criticisms so that each person can grow based on their weaknesses."
good,"install or troubleshoot satellite systems. driving long routes, sales, interactive with customers, and prompt service with great results. Adhere to a schedule that changes hourly sometimes. management was great as they helped when needed. hardest part of the job was the long hours, and no personal time due to mandatory overtime"
good,Easy sales goals to achieve. Great commission and great bonuses/prizes. I would go back if I could but due to my own medical reason I am unable. Management sometimes could be a little more interactive in a positive way
good,"empresa con un agradable ambiente de trabajo, y personal capacitado."
good,"great job, benefits are okay, free dish services, free food, great work environment, uncapped commission, prizes and gifts are given out, managers are okay"
good,good company not bad at all loved being in a team driven environment managers have no problem working with you on closing deals and building new ways to help you succeed in closing sales
good,its a good place to work but has poor managenment.  which means the coaches dont ork with you. they end up firing for something  they never coached you  on.
good,"During my short time there the hours were long but it was a team environment. You have to work hard and be efficient due to often working alone, but management was in constant communication and would make sure that you have all the resources you need to succeed. Fellow employees were supportive and would often go out of their way to help each other. Management had no tolerance for slackers or poor quality because it brings everyone else down, therefore would keep everyone strait. Pay could have been better though."
good,Cool people good pay when I did work here they they had really good bonuses good variety of shifts I would recommend someone to work here would cater food
good,I enjoyed working at Dish Network. Busy phones makes time go by fast. I enjoyed assisting customers resolving their satellite/tv issues. Best of all the people are great to work with.
good,"Tester 1 : refurbish satellite  equipment : test satellite dish receivers  from customer homes, for dames , identify the problems,  if need soldering or minor  correction or replace the damaged parts with new part maybe done at sight. Test again for clarity. Send the products to the customer as perfect condition "
good,I would say dish is a great place to work and very competitive place to work and compete in sales with other techs. The hours can be long but worth the pay lots of travel from time to time.
good,"Speaking to customers via telephone for inquiries relating to cable, internet and telephone equipment questions and also promoting the sales of packages that best meets the needs of the costumers and then ensuring that the correct demographic information was accurate in order to place order for the field technicians to visit clients and then install services purchased."
good,"The company has many incentives to make you want to advance and do your best at work. They have about 3 breaks and during your break you can play video games or play pool, watch tv in the lounge."

good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.

good,"todos los dias se aprende algo nuevo, constantemente esta innovando, esta llena de retos y eso me encanta."
good,"Excellent benefits, can be difficult work at times and sales is pushed very thoroughly. Management team is supportive but tough. Can be very difficult when the weather is not ideal"
good,Dish network in my opinion is a good place to work. Good management and a great support staff. I was an in house tech with them for 3 1/2 years. Trained a lot of techs and lenses support to all when I could. Many of the guys I worked with back then are still around. Very secure company.
good,I'm fixing to retire. Im looking for a part time job. I would like to try something different other than working in quality. I would like maybe 30 hours per week.
good,Dish was an interesting job with a new issue to tackle everyday. there was never a dull moment and every day was new and exciting. i enjoyed my time there but ultimately i had to move on and pursue a career with better chances for improvement and pay.
good,"Dish is a good environment. It does have its benefits. but you have to make sure that everything is in order at home. Scheduling is not perfect, but there working on that. But, other then schedule it great."
good,"dish network is a great company, but only if you're the customer, technicians are pushed to sale products, requiring so much sales per customer and is evaluated on those sales alone."
good,"overall i liked my team leads and mamgers and over goals, were all acheivable.  it is good place to work and rewarding for perfermance. "
good,I enjoyed working for the company very much. I also enjoyed meeting customers and working for my team and office and field managers. They great to work with. I also enjoyed the benefits received through Dish as well as the benefits

good,"Good place to work, fast paced environment. Good compensation and benefits. Can become monotonous doing the same thing over and over again."
good,"se realizaba la captura de datos de los contratos de equipos de dish, atención al cliente para resolver dudas y problemas con la instalación o los equipos"
good,I loved the people I worked with. some days were just stressful but I had great support with my team. There were a few things I wish would change but still a fun job
good,always I like to do my work.At here I have been learning a new step of DTH sector.Management always good.My co worker always help me to do my duty.Customer management is the hardest part for me but know it has been easy for me.My boss always help me on every time.
good,Buena empresa para trabajar .  Se aprende mucho y se tiene mucho contacto con clientes y compañeros
good,muy bien facilidad para el apoyo pero en ocaciones no se atiende al cliente por parte de la empresa
good,"It has been a great experience for me, DISH is a household name and they invest in their employees. It's also one of the companies which promotes diversity, which in returns increases the productivity at work."
good,"I only left because I found another sales job making more money. This job is just entry-level but its easy to make good money from the commissions. Work hard, do your job and you won't have any issues. I have never received disciplinary action or been treated unfairly by management, they only discipline you if you deserve it so I don't understand some of these reviews."
good,"I only left the company because I found another sales job making more money. This is just entry-level so the base pay is kinda low, but if you work hard and just try your best its really not that hard to make more money from commissions."
good,Dish Network is a great company to work for.  It is very adventurous and offer a lot of excitement to it's employees in regards to meeting and interacting with all of the customers.
good,I would go out with my appointments for the day to do our troubleshoot the installs. I learned to communicate with customers very will. Management was very co-opertive trough out the day. I had no problems with co-workers we all would help each other through out the day. The hardest part of my job was having to try to sell product to customer. The most enjoyable part of my job was customer interaction.
good,I really enjoy working with people and meeting new people.  I like my co workers and the sales incentives. I enjoy receiving dish points and being recognized for my hard work.
good,"I was with Dish for 9 1/2 years, most of them were good. I enjoyed working with a lot of the other employees. For the most they did try to take care of their employees. however there was some who were treated better then others"
good,exelente empresa solo que les falta cumplir con lo que prometen en cuestioin de material y comiciones
good,La unidad de transporte se nos descompuso en un ejido y tardo la ayuda en  llegar asta donde estábamos hubo mucha calor ese día aprendimos hacer pacientes y soportar elclima
good,Working at Blockbuster as an associate and the Dish Representative was not stressful even though there was a quota to meet. Co-workers were more like family.
good,10 or more hours a day fiscal and demanding work large amounts of  paperwork and training
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Short term contract, however the team I worked with was very professional and we had a great time coming up with marketing plans."
good,the job is great and what not but being in customers houses seems to give you that nervous feeling when you get a damage claim fro something you didn't do. i for one have got 3 so far and two have been thrown under the bus lets say and one i actually did.. but remember the customer is always right. also we could receive more compensation for what we have to do to get the job done.
good,Finding resolution to complicated issues with the equipment over the phone is difficult. We had the ability to communicate with our peers to assist one another on resolving complicated problems.
good,"Management is very good at this place, they put in real time and effort into you and make you the time of person you are destined to be. They will get you where you want to go. The hardest part of the job were customers who would call in upset about what a previous agent told them, it's like playing the telephone game in grade school."
good,You work ALOT of hours but you do have to the chance to make an extremely large amount of money. On top of being able to make a lot of money there is also the chance to win many prizes and incentives that Dish offers.
good,"Trouble shooting with customers on their newly installed equipment. Some calls were having to walk a customer through when equipment failed to see if faulty equipment or inexperienced customer."
good,"Se trabajo muy bien en esta empresa, habia un ambiente laboral tranquilo, eso si mucho trabajo como deve de ser y el personal que estava a mi cargo nunca tuve problemas con ellos y ni ellos con migo."
good,It was a good learning opportunity with the organisation. hey give a very good on the job training where you learn from others as well from your mistakes.

good,"Great company with a great bunch of guys!! Dish will supply ALL of your tools, pay for your gas, (company truck) and pay you pretty good hourly."
good,Lots of benefits and incentives. Pay is really good. Most employees were pleasant to work with and their training is top notch! The facility I worked at was also excellent.
good,From the beginning to the end the job was excellent management treat you as family give you a sense of purpose every day is a new day and adventure with this jar never a doll moment training every day always something new to learn. Excellent pay just the hours you must be dedicated to to work.
good,I got nothing bad to say about Dish but they was down sizing and I didn't want to be one that didn't have a job. I went back to Carilion Clinic now I'm a site leader
good,"Es un trabajo que permite llevarse a cabo desde casa y eso contribuye al ahorro de tiempo por el traslado, estar laborando desde casa es una gran experiencia, como en toda empresa, hay un poco de presión pero nada que no se pueda lograr, gracias Dish"
good,Challenging. Always learning with opportunity for advancement. Must be a self starter and show initiative. Fast-paced work environment. Very young workforce.
good,"Great company to work for, Worked as a contractor but felt as an employee. The work done was a high level experience in R, DC, Integration of systems and Equipment Testing."
good,I will admit working for Dish Network is going to give you lots of headaches due to upset customers but there are lots of perks and benefits! The prizes can range anywhere from JBL Bluetooth speaker to a MacBook Pro. The environment is really fun and makes going to work really enjoyable! They do offer lots of overtime.
good,Long hours.  10 hours a day 4 dats a week. Great place to work at. Management is great. Feels like family owned company.  I would recommend it. Must  e bilingual
good,En mi área de embarques siempre se me proporcionó la oportunidad de aprender y desarrollar. Y estuve rodeado de buenos compañeros y de tener un buen jefe.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Enjoyed working here, pay was good if willing to work hard, Hate that I had to leave. The goals can be a little far fetched at times, and can be a little stressful dealing with irate customers. But overall great environment, company really cares about its employees."
good,Es divertido conocer lugares por medio del cambaceo y al mismo tiempo ofrecer un servicio que entretiene a la familia y te lleva el sistema de t.v de paga a un gran precio A CUALQUIER LUGAR DEL PAIS SIN RESTRICCIÓN. 👍
good,"(CSR) Tasks.. Ensures great customer service with fast and accurate processing of orders, and coordinating with other departments to resolve inquires."
good,"Pretty decent pay for what the job entails and there is shift differential if you end up on nights/weekends. Performance based scheduling so it doesn’t matter how long someone has been there. Schedules last approx 3 months which makes it easy to plan your home life. Cons to the scheduling is if you have a lower performance, you get what you get. So not the best place if you are in school or have another job. Also attendance is really strict. Other than that, they train you well and you’re always learning something new. You can easily promote up quickly if you work hard!"
good,Excelente empresa un buen ambiente de trabajo y buenos sueldos.
good,Could use better management. I was injured on the job and the managers acted like nothing happened when I requested information for workmans comp. They actually tried to get me to take FMLA instead. It is the reason I quit.
good,from the training center to everyday work is very different which is to be expected but there are so many things that go against you as a employee that they don't tell you about in training and the management is very understanding about personal issues and life issues by far the best management i've ever dealt with and the workplace culture is somewhat team like but also not team like at the same time typical day varies based on job count and experience and the most enjoyable part is the ability to travel and be independent but overall its a great company to work for i don't discourage anyone from working there it's just not for some people
good,I loved the job it was easy. I chose to work for 10’s since it took me over an hour to get to work. Wish I didn’t live so far because I would apply to go back.
good,"The environment as excellent, compensation was very good, rewards also and everyone got along perfectly, they have transportation for employees who had late work hours."
good,"I learn a lot from dish tech and customer wise great job. I had some good days some bad but it all work out.  Management could be more available with all department's and more open on the no excuse policy. Workplace very warming, the hardest part was to ignore the yells and upset customers when you trying to help them fix the problem. I enjoy fixing and hearing the upset customer back to being happy at the end of the call and making the promoting sales"
good,"Most of the work starts with our team day, that we have every day."
good,"A great place to work but even Dish knows that their days are limited due to changes in technology. Fast paced, high stress, high pressure work environment."
good,"Dish was a very good company to work for. Very good benefits, lots  of overtime if you want it as well. They also have a tuition reimbursement program as well."
good,great for anyone who likes hands on work. hardest part of this job was crawling under houses and on houses for installations. the best part would be the customers and learning the craft.
good,"Dish is an easy and fast paced company loved working there i was able to do the work at home program and was able to work efficiently and manage my time wisely, definitely the only thing that i did not enjoy was the fact that they move you up to different departments and sometimes when your doing so great at one place and move you up to different is when things could change for you for the better or worse, i feel like the company should let the agents choose what they wanna do, or if they get moved let them try it for 90 days and if stats start to affect their job than move them back to what they were comfortable with."
good,"es una empresa solida que ofrece una amplia oferta laboral, y gran experiencia dentro del cmapo d etrabajo con grandes posibilidades de crecimiento"
good,"A typical day work meet with min 15 dealers in day, culture and environment is good for employee ,learn a lot in this company ,they are giving increment and promotion on time,"
good,"Great working environment, just not the right time for me. The management is great, except there was one inappropriate slip up, that made me leave. Would recommend though!"
good,I learned how to overcome objections with listening.  Management was helpful and present. I enjoyed helping my customers. Did not favor new comp plan.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"They make customer service as fun as can be. Decent pay good benefits, gym in building, contests, prizes give aways. Fast career advancement. frequent breaks."
good,"Dish has a culture of hiring and holding on to people for a long time. You can grow and learn new skills and advance within the company. Typically Dish will favor people that have been with the company for longer, rather than pure skill set or education."
good,"They give you a 1 month course on how to be a technician.  Including practical on site experience.  Once you get the hang of everything it becomes a game to try to improve your times and get faster everyday. "
good,Excelente Empresa para trabajar con un ambiente optimo
good,"Enjoyed working at Dish.  Great environment, sometimes it can get tooblud and it makes it hard to focus. However there is a lot of positivity. Perks are great, you get free stuff often. Pay was decent for the role however I think there's too much expexted to be completed on one call."
good,"Overall I loved working for Dish. I would work there again and I would definitely recommend my friends and family as well. Great benefits and a great atmosphere. They have a relaxation room , employee lobby with a pool table , air hockey , ps4 , and Xbox one. They also have a break room with arcade style games. The pay is good, and the room for opportunity is amazing. But they do have shift bids."
good,"la  empresa es buena y se preocupa por el empleado, en  general  el ambiente  laboral es agradable y las capacitacion realizadas  son de un modo  practico muy agradable"
good,"El trabajo era muy bueno, a mi no Me cansaba nada."
good,Probably one of the best jobs I’ve had. The energy that employees have in that job is exiting and makes job way more enjoyable. The only thing that affects that employer is the favoritism of upper managment in El Paso tx sales department
good,Overall good work place . Driving force of ensuring team takes care of customers and provides the best experience possible. Seeing the success and advancement of others is always rewarding
good,"My time at Dish was fun and challenging. I enjoyed being voted as best technical in class, but also helping customers daily if they had any issues. Every now and then I would get calls about needing new service, but most calls were technical calls."
good,"Eres tu propio jefe, te pagan bien y puntual."
good,Loved working for Dish 12 years. It was hard for me to let it go but got a better opportunity to come nd live here in Odessa with my fiance. He's been here in Odessa for 5 years nd it was getting hard for us coming nd going every 3-6 months.
good,"most management was helpful, not all were professional"
good,"was a great job but when the center decided to close and the staff was all being fired for every little thing from late to you desk to causing not enough sales to be created for the center, Poor Job Performance they called it.  It became very quickly a dying enterprise and everyone had to go."
good,"Muy buen ambiente de trabajo, "
good,DISH was by far the best job i had ever worked when it came to pay hours and advancement. They tried to keep a laid back vide in the call center because tge work could be stressful. The only downside was sitting on the phone 11 hours a day.
good,Ran my company and loved it unfortunately the area that I was in was non profitable so I seeked employment with Fairpoint Communications which has proven to be the best decision as it has expanded my knowledge in Broadband Communications.
good,"So far working for Dish has been fun, friendly, and challenging. I've had to learn to balance school, family, and work in the weeks that I have been at this company, but it has been worth it."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,I used to work for dish and it was one of the best experiences I have ever had. The only reason i do not work for them anymore is our center was closed for business reasons.
good,Me gusta la interaccion con los niños haci como realizaractividades manuales
good,"every day is different, the common thing is that you will always find support from TLs Ges and coaches all the time. great PTO offers but pay is mediocre"
good,"Solo falta mejorar el sueldo, fuera de eso es una buena empresa para laborar."
good,I met a lot of new people management was very cooperative and I enjoyed coming to work because the people around me was very nice and great to be around the work wasn't to hard as well
good,loved this job only left because i got hurt and my numbers went down did not want to have my group of co workers suffer because i could not move fast. If i had the chance to work here again i would. the pay is good the benefits is good and this company really cares as long as you are doing your part. great place to work at hands down. Only thing i wish would change is there focus on the numbers but i understand why the numbers and percentages matter when your out on the field.
good,"Excelente trabajo de campo, trabajo en equipo, enseñan a los nuevos a concretar ventas."
good,"Dish Mexico fue parte de mi desarrollo profesional, una empresa que me otorgo la oportunidad de crecer como persona con un agradable ambiente de trabajo, fue complicado el cambio de su plataforma de cobranza operativa,el loro mas significativo fue el extender mi tramo de control que comenzó con 03 plazas a cargo y concluyendo como responsable de 05 plazas en mi tramo de control."
good,"i worked there for 9 years, was a great rep. for most of them.. received lots of money bonuses and prizes. left company to get a career that did not work out. I then tried to return and was declined employment due to a written warning i once received."
good,buena .me gust que dan apoyo de transporte de la empresa y el plan de tabajo acargo de un supervisor
good,"Challenging but enjoyable"
good,"Amazing work environment, plenty of interactive activities to balance the work load, quarterly fun activities to relieve stress and promote unity and enhance the company experience"
good,you work by yourself all day. meet new people and go new places you normally wouldn't. ability to control your own day if you can master time management
good,"Work with a group of individuals at your same level in ""pods"" that have one team supervisor and then one coach. Very friendly. Open communication between employees and management"
good,I really enjoyed my time working at Dish.  They had a great training program that prepared you for the work that you would be doing once you graduated to working regular work times.  Even after training you always had support staff near by to assist if you ever had a question.
good,"excelente desasrrollo, las capacitaciones el trabajo en equipo."
good,"Dish is a very fun place to work, incentives were great, benefits are also awesome. Management team is very effective and they make sure all changes are communicated very well throughout the floor"
good,The enjoyable part is meeting new and all kinds of people.  The hardest part is when you have to go up to an attack in this humid and florida heat.
good,"This place gives you tons of training and offers travel if you are a good enough tech. However, they don't really give you raises and will work you long hours. There are jobs in the cooperate part of the company but even at the manger level you make less than the techs just because the techs make so much overtime."
good,I have no complaints about this company. Every company have areas to improve in. Dish need to back their employee's more when it come to customer' s complaints.
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Nice place to work for "
good,The job is good and has a well lit atmosphere and working is very pleasant. what I learned was an improvement on my computer skill as well as learning to multi task in a fast paced environment. my co-workers where fun to be around. but by far the best part of the job was being there.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of, first clocking in and opening the warehouse doors. Then I would sign into Oracle Software in the computer and also pull up a software program called ETA.  I would set up all the transfer windows needed to transfer and issue merchandise out of the warehouse to the technicians vans. I would then process defective merchandise, mostly receivers that did not go into the staging process the night before, and place them on a defective pallet. I would then give the warehouse a walk through and make sure the merchandise/ bulk items are properly stocked. I make sure I fill out a forklift inspection sheet and drop any pallets needed to complete the day. Once this is done we are ready to pull in company vans to start restocking/ putting them back up to base stock. After restocking 15-20 Dish vans and properly issuing/ transferring merchandise, I print out the nightly count sheets. I would then count the quantities of all merchandise in the warehouse and check the counts to make sure we are one hundred percent at all times."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, café gratis, concursos, premios , incentivos, capacitaciones"
good,Very interesting hands on job. If you dont mind hard work and sweat you'll love it. Very good pay and benefits. Lots of training and company provided uniforms are cool.
good,"I love my days as a technician. Good Pay as well as overtime, different location, sites, as well as homes and people. I will say that it is demanding and they will expect a lot from you in such little time but they understand its a learning process and it takes time to catch on for some people but the way they handle it is more of constructional criticism and motivation which is what makes the job fun. It's really kinda hard to lose your job there unless your lazy and the ""I do enough just to get by"" type, so security is a plus. In all,  If you got imagination and willpower the creation of advancement will be so much easier. Yes the system and policy changes frequently, so what, so does life. Either you can adapt or not. The harder you strive the better the results. It's fun and rewarding and the customers will respect you as long as you keep them up to date with things and work with them in the time of confusion and stress, believe me sometimes it happens. Other than that your your own boss and everything is what you make of it."
good,"1. A short team meeting for daily update and review of any changes. start taking calls. Learned customer service, multitasking, operate different application to review customers account. Update knowledge of the product, pricing. Handle escalated situation and deescalate. making quick decision and provide consultancy about whole home service. Every calls are different so never get bored."
good,"Learned lot of new technologies like groovy, scala. Got acquainted with Agile work environment. Management is very supportive."
good,"I have really enjoyed working for DISH, great people and management team. very friendly environment and fast paste place and work. I have learned a lot over these years that I worked for them. The only negative side of the job is the location from my home. It is too far for me since I am trying to built my family."

If you thrive working in an environment where we have the ability to make decisions on the fly, think long term, and can take responsibility of mistakes made - this is absolutely the company for you.  The benefits are mostly financial based, which is also not for everyone.

good,"A typical day at Dish was to answer calls and help customers with whatever requests they had. I learned a lot of how the TV industry works, both good and bad. Management for the most part was very great as well as all of my co-workers.

good,There is always someone there to encourage you to do well. Help is at your fingertips. I have worked under 3 managers and each was very helpful. The typical call center culture involves being a doormat for customers and this is the only down side to customer service anywhere. Dish makes it worth while with incentives and a team that welcomes you and supports you.

good,depending on where you work in the company its awesome...other people have said its the worst place to work but actually its great...you don't walk around and see sad or angry faces.

good,empresa responsable con pagos al corriente y todas las prestaciones de ley
good,"I had an excellent Boss, I was a subcontractor so I did not receive any benefits but made great pay! Some long work days but home every night. Knowledge of sales would be helpful."
good,I advanced very quickly within Dish network but on the way up there were several obstacles. Managers seem to be insecure in their position and seem to strive to keep employees from moving up rather than helping them to do so.
good,I liked my job there but it was too far away in the end.  I had 2 children at home to take care of at home as a single dad.  I liked the manager because he was a single father as well and fully understood my situation.
good,Dish Network is a place where you can balance work and personal life. They are very dedicated in helping less experienced agents out. The amount of effort Dish puts into their employees is quite remarkable and I will definitely recommend it to other people.
good,calls are back to back but other then that the environment is good. other then that dish customer are quite hard to hadly at first but the more you stay then easier the calls get
good,I liked how they’re opened about ideas and how to improve the quality of service that the customers get. They provide the tools to help you perform...
good,I really enjoyed my time at Dish Network. I worked on the sales side of things in the customer retention department. The pay was based off of commission but if you worked hard and focused on hitting goals it was very rewarding. Environment was very fast paced but everyone in the company was focused on making sure that you were successful. Management was very helpful and cared about employees as people and did everything they could to help out every individual person.

good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,I enjoyed my employment at Dish Network.  The training that is provided is world class.  The amount of resources available to make smart technicians was outstanding. There was always some sort of event going on where overtime was available and on some occasions mandatory.  Time and stress management are key components for working there.  Work life balance was taken into consideration as well.
good,Great coworkers and always lots of motivation to push sales since always giving out lots of prizes everyone was always very friendly and willing to help
good,It was enjoyable to work there they gave there employees alot of perks and benefits.  Also they helped their employees with personal issues also.  I would have love to stayed there but they closed down that location.
good,"Dish Network is a challenge, and if your up for it, it will definitely pay off! With a great work environment and amazing employees/team members you'll never have a bad Monday. Yes, this job can be stressful but you'll have great tools advaible and even team leader to help you asap!"

DISH was not only focused on the right thing for their consumers, evident by JD Power rankings but internally focused on the right things for their employees.  Employees were held to high-standards and justly rewarded when their performance met and/or exceeded those standards.  DISH did not put stock in where someone went to school or who they knew, instead DISH promoted and grew leaders who got the job done the right way.  For a hard-worker who wants an opportunity to gain a lot of experience, DISH is a great place to work."
good,Excelente trabajo pero busco más suledo para poder vivir mejor con mi familia
good,I have worked for DISH almost 5 years and it is the best job I’ve had. They try to be for the employees as much as possible. Great leadership all around.

good,DISH is a good company to work for and very demanding but at the same token there is a certain Satisfaction that one gets after exceeding goals in a teamwork environment. Love this job and environment.
good,The employers for Dish Network wanted to make sure we had a good work atmosphere. They constantly had games and prizes you could win and some higher ups would run through the cubicles with a dinosaur costume on to keep the smiles on.
good,"Satisfying work, competitive and team based. would work 4 days and then off for 3. some days would be longer than wanted. The part of DISH I enjoyed the most about working there was meeting new people giving them a good installation."

good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,"Agents work with 2 screen monitors, speak to multiple customers a day and are expected to aid customers diligently and quickly. Dish is pretty open to new ideas, relaxed, and are big on promoting within. The management is the best, they are willing to help with anything you are struggling on and are always available. Hardest part of the job would probably be the hours that they have available and the days they want agents to work. Most enjoyable part would be the environment and work ethic of the company."
good,All places have their ups and downs but overall Dish is a good place and they work with you when needed. Everything is laid out and the schedule works well with life changes.
good,expect a lot of inbound customer service calls about billing and payment and also equipment. take about 60-80 calls day you will be given an proper training and resources
good,Was awesome until terminated for being nine minutes past the call in time. Clearly no respect for their workers. They should be allowed to determine within plant not an outside source.
good,Empresa que te permite ampliar conocimiento en el area.
good,"In this workplace there is a great place, they give your opportunities to move up and opportunities to win prizes while working, if you like a slower pace then this is the perfect job for you but I'm more of a fast pace person."

good,Dish is a great company to work for. Excellent benefits and awesome management makes it a great place to be employed. The hours can be a tad long but breaks are always given. The hardest part about my job was some of the customers were irate but a supervisor was always willing to help. The best part about my job was the atmosphere.
good,no longer exits in my aea call center got moved to india  feel bad for everyone that got layed off and now there looking for work
good,"We start out with a small 3 minute meeting of how we are doing production wise. For the rest of the day, we make sure we comply with hours per unit and quality for the refurbishing of the product. Make sure we keep the area well maintained and make sure we comply with regulations and procedures. I've learned that quality and quantity are diversely opposites. For producing quantity can affect quality but as producing much more quality can affect quantity. Management work with production in a very efficient way and try to make you understand the importance of doing a great job. Co-workers are respectful and one of the most hard working people I have ever met. Hardest part of the job is when the physical strain begins to hit you. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fun family friendly events the company sponsors for the employees."
good,"Siempre conté con un excelente ambiente de trabajo, aprendí que si realizas un buen   trabajo en equipo, siempre lograras obtener resultados favorables, el respeto  y la colaboración que siempre se me proporciono por parte de mis  jefes inmediatos,  me alentaban a  mejor cada día mi desempeño laboral, así como la disposición y el apoyo por parte de mis compañeros de trabajo, el tratar de mejorar  las metas que se me pedían fue difícil, pero jamas imposible de lograr, me encanto que la empresa valorara el  esfuerzo desempeñado dentro de la misma."
good,"Fast paced environment; excellent management staff."
good,"Prestaciones superiores a las de la ley, buen ambiente de trabajo, horario flexible, el salario compensa el trabajo realizado."
good,una empresa solidaria con muy buena administracion y con todo los materiales necesarios para la realizacion de nuestro trabajo
good,"Working for/with Dish network has by far been one of the best workforce experiences! Dish's management staff is top-notch, always looking to help agents with any issues! The only downside to the job, the occasional irate customer (as with any call center)."
good,Working for Dish was amazing and I wish that I could have stayed.  They are awesome people and actually care about their employees.  The team that I worked on was one of the closet group of people that I have gotten to know and support just all around.  Couldn't ask for a better management team and coworkers.
good,"I would say Dish Network was my favorite job of all. I love to be out on my own independently, helping others to smile and be relieved of any technical problems that they were having. I kept my van organized with the correct equipment needed for the tasks. A typical day would be about 5 or 6 jobs varying from Trouble calls, new installments, upgrades, to dish moves. My priority was quality and time limits. If I were in need of help, the Technicians had phone numbers to office and other technicians that were out on the field, and if available they would come lend a hand. Hardest part of the job would be going under trailers without light to run cable, but it was pretty easy and fun for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see how happy the customers were after fixing any problems and asking if there was anything else that needed done."
good,"I have worked at Dish for almost 3 years and the ability to move up is the first thing that stands out. They help you along the way and want everyone to better themselves. A day at work would have me processing Net Promoter Surveys and Quality Assurance surveys on the agents of the company. The management group is outstanding and your colleagues are all fun and easy to get along with. I've learned a great deal of skills from phone etiquette to Microsoft Office applications to becoming a better word processor. Hardest part is the fact that I work 8-4:30 on weekdays and running errands during the week takes planning, but otherwise the job itself is great. Most enjoyable thing about work is the people. No one makes you feel unwelcome and the sense of team is extremely strong."
good,"I am sorry to leave Dish Network, both the company and people have been a joy to be apart of. I regret having to leave for reasons outside of the company."
good,Excellent place to work.  Managers and co-workers are very friendly and fun to work with.  They work with anyone to accompany your schedule.
good,I took inbound calls to pay bills answer questions and to perform trouble shooting steps
good,"Dish Network is a great company to work for, very flexible with great pay."
good,I got to learn a lot about call centers. There was a lot of room for advancement and if you do your job you move up fast. Dish always has events and goodies for employees and the pay is great for El Paso. The phone calls are tough though
good,"Me gusto mucho porque represento un gran reto adaptarme a las exigencias tales como: trabajar bajo presion, facilidad de palabra y tranquilizarme en situaciones complicadas."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.
good,It's a paycheck but nothing more. Not alot of advancement room....
good,"Training isn't the best and the only thing harsh is when you start getting used to one thing like working with billing they move you right up to doing technical support then Telco partner and it doesn't make the change any easier. Your supervisor is super supportive and helps you out at any time. Only thing I didn't like were the schedules, after working there for a year they gave me a horrible schedule and it was rough, but other than that its great. Lots of vendors and even the showtime, hbo, cinemax, starz makers give away prizes a lot. The breakroom is a full floor and there is ping pong pool tables, the most coolest thing is there are complimentary phones."
good,"Para empezar abrir la oficina en cosautlan, para atencion a clientes a las 9.00 A.M.

good,Great job couldn't keep 40+ hours while i finished college. didn't enjoy working on christmas
good,"dentro  de la empresa el ambiente de trabajo entre los compañeros era muy bueno, cada quien con su equipo de computo para realizar sus actividades diarias como atencion al cliente, apoyo de soporte tecnico al cliente. Los coordinadores y supervisores siempre al peniente de los problemas que presentabamos como ejecutivos. Lo mas dificil era la tolerancia y presion antes clientes molestos a los cuales se les tenia que otorgar trato especial para su satisfaccion."
good,I loved working for this company. I unfortunately had to return to my home town due to a death in the family. Dish really cared about its employees on a personal level. They offered growth within the company within 6 months. Every one I worked with was friendly and super supportive. Management had an open door policy so no matter the issue they wanted you to bring it to them. The hardest part of the job was angry customer's. The best part of working there was the environment the company provided to help along the day by having contests or games.
good,I learn how to be responsible and customer service from Domino's. I also learn how a business is ran inside and out i started as a driver and move on the become a Assistant  manager.
good,"Very thorough training. Good breaks & lunch. Interactive environment with co-workers, Management & customers. Worked on incoming calls for customer service, billing & technical issues. Very positive atmosphere."
good,"Dish Network in Christiansburg VA was a great place to work. They care about their employees and provide many benefits that other companies would not. We had a very large exercise area in the building with several different types weight loss equipment. They provide snacks when we have big events coming up on TV. We have barbeques in the summer and dinners for the Holidays. It is a open door policy and if you have any problems at all there is always someone you can talk to. Lots of times there is extra time you can work if you desire to do so, which means a good pay check. If I had not moved away to another state I would have stayed at Dish til I retired."
good,"If you're looking for a place to expand your career life, or have a great work experience involving helping out customers with billing questions or technical issues, Dish Network offers situations and job responsibilities in that area."
good,"Aisin gave me the opportunity for advancement and provided the training i needed to excell in manufacturing industry. "
good,"A typical day starts out with any menu items which need to be prepped for either the lunch service or the dinner service.  Everything needed must be taken care of before the beginning of service.  Once all food items are prepped, we prepare the line for service by stacking plates along the line, heating the grills, etc and making sure that all serving implements are sanitized and ready to go. "
good,"Worked in call center and primarily dispatch office. Was promoted 3 times while there from dispatcher to lead dispatcher, router to build routes for services installers. Very fast paced environment. "
good,"El unico pero en esta empresa era el gerente de ventas, que obstaculizaba la labor de los supervisores, no sabia nada de ventas de cambaceo y nunca abandonaba la oficina para acompañarnos al campo y era muy negativo en sus comentarios"
good,"typical day sit at my cubical put my headset on and answer phone calls .  learned to be more patient , i now have strong listening skills and mutitask . hardest part of the job was satisfying customers in a sense to offer them the packages to their needs .most enjoyable was hearing thank you sooo much you helped  today "
good,"mi dia de trabajo se trata de ver minimo 20 clientes, estar buscandolos durante todo el dia para lograr que paguen el adeudo. aprendi que la perseverancia es un valor que siempre te va a ayudar a lograr las metas que tienes. mis compañeros la verdad personas muy agradables y siempre estan dispuestos a ayudarte en lo que necesites al igual que mi jefe inmediato, bueno tambien lo vi con los gerentes, la misma actitud. la parte mas dificil de mi trabajo es lograr encontrar a las personas ya que la gran mayoria trabaja durante el dia y las personas que se cambiaron de domicilio. lo que mas me gusto, es que cuando un cliente paga su cuenta y se le reactiva el servicio se siente una gran satisfaccion con uno mismo por lograr el objetivo"
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and resolving the problems of others. I learned new thing everyday whether they were about the dish software of the dish equipment. Management was ok. The hardest part of my job is being able to understand everything that is being directed towards you. What i enjoyed the most was the environment of dish.
good,"I started out as a CSR with Dish Network right out of high school. I quickly advanced to the Billing Team. After four years I was promoted into Payroll. I really enjoyed my position in Payroll. I had a lot of interaction with HR for new hires. The best part of the job was going to the Payroll department. I would have continued my career with Dish Network, but I found a new interest in Mortgage. After six years with Dish Network I left to become a Loan Officer."
good,"Hard to get used to but, once your past the introductory part of the job the rest is great. The advancement in the business is great you can either advance or keep your position easily by being a great employee."
good,The owners have the wonderful ability to encourage their associates to express themselves through education of products/services. They also encourage their associates to give input on menu ideas.

good,Every morning we would review what happened the day before and out goal. I learned how to sell a product. Managements was a little to laid back. The hardest part was not making the sale. The most enjoyable part was to see the result of my hard work.
good,everyday was a good day here no two days were the same i suggest working here..
good,I enjoyed working for dish very much just wish i had more training in certain areas to maintain beter metric scores. Also enjoyed incentives for employees.

good,"The work was definitely hard. Dont get it twisted you wont only be putting up dishes, they also expect you to sell things while out installing the dish service. The management was extremely helpful, always giving me tips and tricks to get better and faster."
good,A typical day at work consisted of calling customers prior to arrival time checking out the property and best location for satellite signal for their TV and installing all the necessary equipment needed to operate their system. I learned tons of things about wiring a home for coax and the different types of equipment and tools used to do my job properly. The management was awesome and very encouraging in the learning process. The hardest part about the job was the inconsistent times you get off of work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being on my own and learning about my job.
good,"Good job opportunities to make money, lots of food days, 401k match, insurance is not that good. Fun atmosphere, you write your own paycheck. Career paths"
good,"I felt blessed beyond all measure to work for dishnetwork, This is an awesome company to work for. My manager was awesome he challenged me yet encouraged me. He was always all about teaching me new things and broadening my horizons I felt secure and confident working for dishnetwork. Thank you dish for all you did for me and my children. God bless you!"
good,"The best part of working at DISH Network was the amount of training that was poured into making you successful as an agent. The amount of role-play, practice calls, and education in the classroom really helped to reinforce the skills and potential that one has locked inside themselves."
good,I am forever grateful i had the opportunity to grow at Dish and with them. They were my stepping stones to be a leader. No management/leadership elsewhere compares. It's a drag when no one else accepts 360 feedback. I'd go back if the opportunity presented itself.
good,"Very excited  to begin working for Dish Network, which did not change for the entirety of my employment with them, I loved the challenges presented and problem solving tactics  involved in properly penetrating a multi million dollar home, or even in an apartment where you bring families together through television it was all to satisfactory and greatly fulfilling."

good,"I had to leave because of personal family matters unfortunately, but dish network gave incentives like bonuses for upsells on programming packages.  Giving you ""Gold coins"" for 100% score on monitored phone calls, which you could turn into management for stock shares.  On downtime, and slow days waiting for the calls to come in, we could literally watch television on monitors above us in the call center.  We had paid training to become a CSR and also training in all departments, so they wanted you as a company to excel.  I really enjoyed working at dish it was fast paced, high energy, but fun and professional all in the same breath."

good,"I really enjoyed working here. I was surrounded by wonderful peers, the bosses were genuinely interested in helping us succeed.  There was a lot of ""fun"" involved to help us feel appreciated.  Sometimes there was optional unpaid time off, or overtime available, which made it nice to balance income vs time with family."
good,"I enjoyed working here, but I ended up needing a place where i could work with people face to face to provide even more customer service experiences. It can be difficult to create bridged connections with customers over the phone, without seeing a smiling face, and eye contact, for me anyway."
good,"Dish was by far the best job i ever had. I loved it with all my heart. If i did not have to move then i would still be working there. Great atmosphere, great co-workers, and great management. There were occasionally some bumps in the road but it was overall an amazing job."

I've learned the art of sales by using the training and resources provided to me offering SHS on every job and being very successful. This will be very useful in future jobs which will help me to advance in my career. Honestly I could write a book on all the things that I have learned working with dish. Management is fantastic they really show appreciation to all techs and work with them as needed to help better each tech according to their needs. The work place is excellent, such great people to work with and around. The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain your metrics according to dish standards, but definitely not an impossible task.

good,"I would go door to door and build report with new potential customers. after proving my company was the best option for their entertainment, I would install the desired equipment into their home or business. Door to door sales had eventually decreased because most of my sales then came from referrals. The customer would sign a 2 year contract with me, which meant I was responsible for keeping the customer satisfied by way of service and pricing. The good service I provided is what brought me the referrals. Now people are finding news devices in which the get their Television entertainment. By way of tablets, phones, computer...etc. so business has dramatically decreased. I now attend college for Business Management, this will help me find a joy with better security for the future"
